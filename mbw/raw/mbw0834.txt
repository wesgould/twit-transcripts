[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.000]   What we're looking forward to?
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.120]   And just exactly how expensive is tomorrow going to be.

[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.880]   tomorrow.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.840]   Somebody said brightly, why don't you do Mac Break Weekly
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.160]   on Wednesday?
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.720]   We could have, but there's a complicated thing going on,
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.160]   and it couldn't.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.160]   So that's OK.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.000]   That's OK.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.480]   Because this is our peerless prognostication panel today.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.680]   Jason Snell is here from sixcolors.com.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.960]   Hello, Jason.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.600]   77 degrees in the garage.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.600]   It's going to be in the mid '90s and Cooper Tino tomorrow.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.120]   Yikes.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.840]   What a hot event.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.080]   It'll be the hottest Apple event in, I don't know,
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.120]   probably in a year or two.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.600]   Yikes.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.560]   Andy Inaco, where it's cooler, but a little wet.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.920]   It's very, very damp here.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.840]   It's not the humidity.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.720]   It's the flooding out of the major artery leading in and out
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.040]   of all cities in New England.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.800]   But I would much rather be rained on than in 97 degree
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.520]   weather again.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.040]   I'm fine.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.920]   I'm not complaining.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.360]   Yeah, a little rain.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.440]   You know, that's not going to hurt.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.960]   Also, Mr. Alex Lindsey Beck from a very important something
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.840]   or other last week.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.320]   It's good to have you back, Alex.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.840]   Good to see you.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.320]   It was a little--
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.640]   It's good to see you too.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.200]   I can't say anything but it was a little bit real.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.600]   No, I know.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.480]   When the White House calls, you've got to show up.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.160]   I understand.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.960]   What's the White House?
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.760]   How was Philadelphia?
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.120]   No, it was--
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.560]   When there's a New Star Wars production,
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.960]   you've got to get a new stamp to it.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.880]   I can say-- I was directed to shoot from my house.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.360]   I was directly shooting LA from my house with someone
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.640]   that's pretty important in LA.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.920]   But the fact that I was giving them notes through Zoom--
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.480]   How fun.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.880]   --how I was watching.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.680]   How fun.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.880]   This is the crazy thing.
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.680]   But it's amazing.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.320]   And I think it's thanks to Office Air Zech Global
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.480]   that you can actually do that.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.440]   You could direct from your home.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.680]   Well, we had a bunch of office hours, folks,
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.840]   that were actually--
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.960]   there was an area left and a bunch of stuff being fed into Zoom.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.400]   And all the proposed stuff.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.520]   And then as soon as it was done,
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.360]   it was sent to the Philippines to another office hours
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.920]   person who did the audio sent to New York
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.920]   to a front office.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.760]   The person that did the color correction
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.040]   came back and was delivered.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.640]   You know, in one day--
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.040]   Oh my god.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.800]   --it's just-- it's like the Labor Day weekend.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.600]   The old telethon is the Love Network.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.280]   It's the Office Hours Love Network.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.240]   And you're going to call it that.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.560]   You'll have a walk along.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.920]   All right.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.360]   So that was the weather forecast.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.280]   Although today in Petaloma, it's going to be 109.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.240]   It was 110 yesterday.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.120]   We're 110 in Nevada.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.520]   It literally felt when I walked--
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.280]   I'd walk out onto the deck and it literally felt like I walked
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.120]   into an oven.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.400]   And my wife said, it feels like a sauna.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.720]   I'm like, well, the sauna actually doesn't get up this.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.440]   Another state of California won't let it get any hotter
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.200]   than 104.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.440]   So this is why--
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.080]   Apple has such a bunch of control freaks.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.520]   I've got them-- I wonder if they're scrambling saying,
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.360]   everybody's going to be hot and un-air conditioned
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.120]   and really, really grumpy as they get their first look
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.280]   at our new stuff.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.160]   Is that going to work out well for us
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.080]   or should we basically get some sort of an external chiller
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.160]   unit and going inside to Steve Jobs Theater?
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.200]   I did get a note from Apple PR today saying,
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.400]   the weather is forecast to be hot.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.240]   Please plan accordingly.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.840]   So when I show up in the tank top and shorts,
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.360]   I assume they're just going to welcome me as a liberator.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.600]   What would Steve Jobs do?
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.640]   So maybe now, if I look at the far out invite,
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.280]   those are ice crystals instead of stars, galaxies,
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.280]   or carbon dioxide bubbles.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.960]   Maybe they'll mist us all on the way in.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.080]   They'll just have misters.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.400]   What do they say the temperature is going to be 100?
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.960]   Tomorrow will be in the mid 90s.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.400]   Good night.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.200]   Oh, mid 90s is nothing.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.600]   Racing, quite a complete winter.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.560]   And according to the invite, you're going to be inside.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.520]   You're going to be in the Steve Jobs Theater.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.760]   I bet you not everybody.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.320]   I think so.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.040]   I think the whole gang is going to be in the USGT.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.120]   Now, whether we'll just be sitting there watching a live stream
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.920]   in person on a screen or whether there'll
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.440]   be some live component released to the scene.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.880]   Because whether they do it at WWDC, Tim came out maybe--
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.040]   Before the show.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.720]   Before the show.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.440]   Tim and Craig Federique came in.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.920]   Craig came out.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.000]   But that was not stream live.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.880]   That was just literally like a little--
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.600]   Yeah, I saw you.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.880]   Like a film festival or something
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.600]   where the director comes out before the movie.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.320]   And it's like, I hope you enjoy my movie.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.040]   And goodbye.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.640]   Goodbye.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.120]   Come again.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.080]   And then the big screen.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.640]   And you guys are all outside.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.560]   They go to dinner.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.520]   No, they don't.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.320]   They're sitting in the back of the theater listening for reactions,
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.440]   just like in the producers.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.440]   And then probably you'll have a demo room.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.880]   Yeah, the way that the SJT works,
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.840]   it's because it was built-- so this is the brilliant thing, right?
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.280]   Is they built it for Apple events.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.440]   It's specifically made this whole building for these events.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.920]   So there is this-- it's circular.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.320]   People have seen the probably-- it's circular.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.480]   There's a top level.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.400]   And then there's a staircase down to a lower level
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.640]   that's like a circular room that's very large.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.240]   And then from there, you descend.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.440]   You actually enter at the top of the theater
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.080]   and go down into the seats.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.760]   Now that center area there, there's a--
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.080]   I don't even know what to call it.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.680]   There's like a rotating partition that can come out.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.800]   And it completely blocks what's in that second level center area.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.920]   So all you can do is go down the stairs
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.640]   and all the way into the theater.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.000]   And then by the time you come out,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.160]   they rotated that center around and revealed the big demo area.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.080]   So it's built-- purpose built for this.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.080]   Exactly what they're going to do.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.160]   Seating capacity 2,000, right?
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.520]   Oh, I think it's like--
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.560]   I think it's like 1,000.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.120]   It's 1,000?
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.240]   Yeah, it's like, yeah, that sounds about right.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.240]   It's like a big movie theater.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.280]   Well, I'm sure I can just do this Seating Capacity
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.000]   Steve Jobs Theater and get the answer.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Sam Eclara County Fire.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.320]   Let's see what Siri says.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.800]   Yeah, 1,000.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.560]   So 1,000 people-- each seat is worth $14,000.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.520]   So just do the math.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.880]   That is going to be a very expensive theater to sit in.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:31.240]   1,000 people means probably one person per publication,
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.440]   I would guess, yeah?
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.080]   I don't know.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.800]   I think Tom's guide, I heard, is sending a couple of people.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.280]   OK.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.040]   So here's the thing.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.880]   I think that this is a different guest list.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.240]   Usually, iPhone events, especially,
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.840]   have a very international guest list.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.120]   And much broader, too, right?
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:45.640]   You want--
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.560]   And a much broader, right?
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.360]   Because there's so much--
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.560]   You want YouTube people in.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.320]   This is by far the most important Apple event of the year.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.800]   I know we all, in this community,
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.200]   are like, oh, it's another Apple event.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.680]   But on the outside and the outside world,
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.200]   the attention is most focused on the iPhone event.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.040]   And so the press list usually is fairly eclectic.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.040]   But I think this year, they've done a different list
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.200]   because of COVID, because this is their first event back
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.240]   in the Steve Jobs Theater.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.280]   I think they've kind of restrained their invitation list
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:14.760]   a little bit.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.840]   And we probably see a lot less, especially
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.320]   international travel, I will think.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.680]   And it'll be a smaller group.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.560]   I don't know how-- I mean, they'll probably
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.400]   try to fill the theater.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.200]   But I wouldn't put it past them to not even fill the theater
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.720]   and have it be even smaller than that.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.200]   Oh, interesting.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.280]   I think they wanted to keep this light.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.800]   Oh, well, we'll look with interest.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.880]   Often what they do if they don't invite 1,000 journalists,
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.880]   which they never do, is fill the rest with employees.
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:40.520]   Right.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.440]   And it depends on, again, how they feel about COVID.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.000]   They might decide that it's better for everybody
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.400]   if it's a little bit more sparsely attended,
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.320]   especially if it's only a playback.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.160]   And they don't have a crowd with applause
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.320]   piped in for the show.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.240]   If that's all-- that's why you do that
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.360]   is the showbiz part of it.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.280]   So if all we're doing is sitting there and watching a video
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.560]   so that we can go into the hands-on area,
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.480]   then it doesn't matter who's there,
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.160]   because it's not part of the show.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.240]   It's just like WWDC.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.280]   We weren't part of the show.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.120]   No accident that Apple insisted workers come back
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.840]   to work yesterday, which is Labor Day,
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.320]   so I doubt anybody came back to work.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.960]   But today, presumably, will be the first day--
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.760]   they said Tuesday, Thursday, and the third day
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.080]   to be named by your boss.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.720]   So that means the largest number of people will--
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.760]   I mean, everybody will be there today.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.760]   Tomorrow, I imagine a lot of people will still be there,
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.760]   because you know, you want to be there.
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.760]   Probably a lot of people there over the weekend.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.920]   And look at the theater.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.040]   The people you know, Alex, were there.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:38.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.400]   Do they rehearse like crazy over the weekend?
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.920]   Oh, but this isn't live.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.400]   But it's pretty-- yeah, we--
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.280]   Mark Gurman, I think, reported that they were already
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.520]   recording stuff like a month ago.
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.480]   Yeah, remember that.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.520]   So it's all done.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.800]   Are they editing like crazy?
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.880]   Are they editing at the last minute?
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.520]   Are they pulling?
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:59.680]   Are they yanking the special segment all about the VR glasses?
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.560]   Are they fine-tuning?
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.480]   What are they doing?
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.080]   There have definitely been some stories of things
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.920]   that just didn't make it--
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.640]   You even noticed a couple of events
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.320]   ago a jump cut that you were sure--
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.480]   There was something missing.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:12.960]   I've no idea what--
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.520]   The trade, something missing.
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.720]   Something like-- they had a whole bunch of transitions.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.520]   And then one of them just went one bit next to the next.
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.480]   And I was like, someone took something out there.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.880]   I'd say, so 164.
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.000]   You see that the president--
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.640]   it's the true film of the little events.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.120]   It's like a little glitch.
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:28.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.840]   But there have been stories about how things have come up.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.000]   Oftentimes things that end up making it into the keynote
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.040]   that came to the right to the last minute, where
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:36.920]   they were ready to do it.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.760]   And I know folks that have worked over a decade ago
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.880]   that have worked on keynotes where,
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.280]   all three days before the event, they
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.880]   were sitting in their own flames,
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.280]   putting stuff together at incredible rates
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.680]   to put final touches on these things.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.120]   But generally, 95% to 98% of it is pretty well figured out,
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.040]   especially this is the biggest event of the year.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.520]   This is the one that makes things for everybody.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.600]   No, it's so important.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.960]   So today, they're probably doing a full dress run
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.040]   through playing back the things, rotating the elevator,
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.760]   doing all the things that you got to do.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:11.240]   Right.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.240]   You're sure that all your work.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.360]   That's the team that's been working hard.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.040]   If we assume that--
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.040]   Demo team.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.360]   --it's either 99% or 100% prerecorded.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.960]   It's the on-site event.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.920]   So it's PR and the on-site event people.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.560]   And what they're doing is, yeah, it's the hands-on area.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.400]   And what do you say?
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.920]   And what's the pattern that you use?
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.560]   Because the people at the hands-on area, right?
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.960]   Every phone will have a minder.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.520]   Minder will know what to show and what to say,
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.640]   and a little cloth to wipe it down afterward,
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.000]   and all of those sort of things.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.480]   And they'll be doing all of that kind of event prep today.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.800]   Do they give you any COVID information?
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.760]   I think you have to test the day before, right?
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.840]   Yeah, I've got to test today.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.360]   Although they said, if you don't want to share with the testing
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.240]   clearinghouse that they've got, you can literally
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.040]   bring a picture of your negative test from my at-home test.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.960]   Which means you'll be in that long line.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.480]   You don't want that.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.280]   That's because I don't want to quite understand the whole test
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:02.560]   thing.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.560]   Like, they don't ask for a date to be on it or to anything else.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.640]   It just shows us a picture of it.
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.320]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.320]   There's got to be a date.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.400]   No, no, no, there's going to be a date.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.080]   And they're saying 24 hours ahead of time, right?
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.480]   A lot of people say that.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:17.200]   It is, to a certain extent, it is an honor system thing.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.920]   Because as with WWDC, because what you are doing--
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.120]   because they don't want to go through, like,
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.200]   in the early days of the pandemic, when you could fly to Hawaii,
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.320]   but you had to get the full-on test, right?
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.680]   They want the at-home test to be allowed.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.320]   And I'm sure they check the date stamp of the photo.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.480]   But if you literally had a photo of an old test or someone
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.040]   else you could have.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.880]   You can show them the plastic thing and say, here's my test.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.360]   Oh, you're right.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.760]   That is not my test.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.920]   I test myself to go into building a whole time.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.680]   I have a tour full of negative tests.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.160]   So you can't--
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.200]   Right, but every time I do it, I'm
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.360]   like, swabbing going, I can't believe I'm doing this again.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.160]   Because I've got like 20 of them on my phone.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.360]   I'm like, I can just show one.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.720]   I think the idea--
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.640]   I mean, it's an honor system thing.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.720]   I think the idea there also is they just want you--
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.960]   they figure most of the people are going to be doing it
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.720]   in good conscience.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.400]   And what they really, I think, are trying to do
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.320]   is get somebody who thinks they're fine, who's asymptomatic
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:15.640]   and tests positive to realize it before they set foot in.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.800]   Steve Johnson's theater.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.360]   Yeah, that's sensible.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.240]   I think that's probably what they're going for.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.880]   By the way, though, I will say, in what
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.280]   was a very big surprise to me, there's
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.120]   no masking required.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.880]   So unlike WWDC.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.120]   So if you come tomorrow--
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.120]   And they're indoors this time, unlike WWDC.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.360]   Yeah, no masking required.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.240]   I will be-- I'll bring mine.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.880]   But because I don't-- I'm not going
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.120]   to sit in a big movie theater full of people unmasked.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.360]   I'm just not going to go that far.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.520]   But I think that's an interesting choice they made,
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.720]   that they're having everybody test,
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.160]   but they're not having everybody mask.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.360]   I think they should have people who are masked on the left
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.880]   and people who are unmasked on the right, so we know.
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.400]   And an aisle between them.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.080]   Where's the AC pointed?
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.600]   Yeah, right.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.120]   I have to say, I find that super disappointing,
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.560]   because I mean, I had to write something about COVID
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.920]   just last week.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.000]   So I really had to update all my COVID knowledge.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.400]   And it's not getting that much better.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.120]   15,000 people die every week from COVID.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.000]   Yeah, I mean, the CDC numbers there,
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.960]   they were increasing over the summer.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.760]   They started to flatten over the past month or two,
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.680]   which is good.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.680]   But this is not over with.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.760]   And a company like Apple has the ability to,
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.240]   A, not only protect all the people in that theater,
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.960]   but also the sign that they're conveying by saying,
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.000]   here every time there's a shot of the crowd,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.040]   look, there's everybody wearing masks.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.200]   Yes, we asked everybody to wear a mask
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.800]   as they want to be inside this place.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.040]   And that has the effect of reminding people
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.600]   that this thing isn't over yet.
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.880]   So that's very disappointing as far as I'm concerned.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.560]   I think if you're going to do that,
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.880]   you really just need to hand out N95s,
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.080]   because the cloth ones are useless.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.720]   So they do. They do.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.080]   At WWC, they did that.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.640]   And it's the cool, it's like the Apple designed ones
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.200]   that they get to the ones on retail.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.160]   I would go practically just for that mask.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.360]   What do you care?
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.000]   What is the Apple mask?
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.720]   So I walked up to someone at the Apple store,
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.160]   and I was like, I got to ask you something.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.520]   And they looked at me like, what do you need to know?
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.760]   And I was like, which get the mask?
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.560]   I'm like, it's so well designed.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.560]   And they're like, oh, we made them.
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.560]   Just, yeah, I need to have the Apple mask.
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.560]   And the Apple designed masks there.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.120]   N95, and they are super stily,
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.600]   and they look super comfortable.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.760]   Are they comfortable?
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.960]   I haven't worn one yet.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.720]   I got one, but I brought my own with me.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.760]   So I've saved it.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.200]   I may wear it tomorrow.
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.040]   Who knows?
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.040]   So good. It looks so good.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.080]   Do they have the Apple logo on it?
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.120]   No, it was little.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.520]   It's like indented.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.480]   At least the one in the Apple store,
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.760]   it has like a little Apple thing on one of the corners,
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.560]   but otherwise it's just a Apple.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.080]   There's almost no, and it looks so nice.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.520]   And I was like, I want,
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.040]   for a while I was really on a streak
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.520]   of buying lots and lots of masks.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.520]   Is this the mask here?
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.400]   Is that the one?
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.400]   That's a hell for nice.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.240]   It's beautiful.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.040]   But it's really, really well done.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.680]   And we're all mask connoisseurs after two and a half years.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.520]   Exactly.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.160]   That's where we are.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.920]   It's like, it's the equivalent of being sponge worthy.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.000]   I have the KN95 for the,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.320]   I'm just going to the supermarket,
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.880]   but I have like the really nice 3M ones for,
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.480]   I'm gonna be spending like three or four hours on Amtrak,
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.640]   or I'm gonna be like at,
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.200]   inside a theater for three or four hours.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.360]   So yeah, it's a,
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.320]   but the masks are designed and developed
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.760]   by the engineering and industrial design teams at Apple.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.080]   The same folks that do the iPhone.
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.240]   Here's an unboxing video that somebody's put on YouTube.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.520]   Is this unbox therapy?
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.840]   Did he get the,
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.680]   I should have sold these.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.960]   11 million views.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.520]   People really care about the masks.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.160]   Oh wait a minute, this is a,
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.640]   is this a Marquez?
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.240]   This is an unboxing.
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.040]   Anyway, wow.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.080]   Wow, wow, wow.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.680]   That's pretty impressive.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:51.520]   Oh, here it is.
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:55.440]   Yeah, this is, I guess this is Marquez doing this.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.280]   So Mark Gurman shared photos.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.440]   Yeah, it was unbox therapy that had the video of
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.760]   unboxing the Apple mask.
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.880]   Man, that's, you know what?
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.520]   That's when you know you have reached next levels
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.360]   on the Anibot.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.640]   They should have made them available.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.640]   A lot of us would have bought them
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.480]   if they had sold them.
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.280]   Designed by Apple in California,
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.840]   it says, "assembled in China,
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:20.600]   "comes of the very special Apple-y pouch."
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.880]   You get a sticker with it?
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.960]   You get a sticker.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:23.800]   You get a sticker.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.640]   (laughs)
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.480]   But they look good.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.280]   They look very complete and thorough.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.040]   They look like they, yeah.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:29.960]   They probably didn't sell them
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.960]   because they're keeping them for themselves.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.880]   Sure. Every company,
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.040]   every company of this, of this scale,
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.360]   they have their own version of FEMA internally
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.280]   so that they wanna make sure that if there is a disaster
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.120]   like wildfires that they can take,
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.720]   they can take care of all their people.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.280]   They have, for all of their,
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.320]   they have organizations that know exactly
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.280]   like what the threat level is at every country.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.120]   Like they have,
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.640]   if the political situation in a certain country
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.440]   suddenly goes south, again,
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.040]   they have a built-in organization that says,
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.640]   "We have an extraction plan for everybody."
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.240]   We know exactly where everybody is in this country
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.800]   where things have suddenly gotten hostile.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.520]   We have an extraction plan for them if we need it.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.120]   And they're, these companies,
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.240]   it's one of the most interesting things
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.640]   that I've ever learned about huge companies.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.760]   They even run disaster drills where,
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.320]   I'm not joking, where they will have,
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.480]   they will have the team that works on this say,
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.720]   okay, they will open up the envelope and say,
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:27.080]   "Okay, there is a viral pandemic
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.520]   "that's killing 40% of the population in a certain country.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.240]   "Go, what do you do?"
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.440]   And they run through all of these scenarios
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.400]   and it's gamed out like,
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.560]   okay, oh, by the way,
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.480]   it turns out that all the airports have suddenly been closed
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.000]   because they've suddenly not allowing any flights in and out
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.160]   what we do now.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.080]   And that's the, and I'm not just tech companies,
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.240]   but any big international company has all the stuff.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.280]   So it's not surprising that Apple designed its own mass,
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.080]   has stockpiling its own stuff
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.200]   and is ready to take care of its people
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.880]   and not only take care of its people,
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.960]   but keep the company going no matter what happens.
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.200]   - Jason, if they offer you an Apple mask,
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.960]   do not open the box, bring it home.
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.800]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.640]   Well, I have two in the other room from WWDC.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.480]   - I think you should tell them.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.680]   - I need four for my friend.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.840]   'Cause then we can all come up and read and read and read.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.280]   - So if I bring one to where
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.800]   and they offer more, I'm gonna be like,
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:15.880]   well, yes, I do need one.
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.480]   - Thank you, I'll take the message.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.920]   - And we're at Scott Evest and--
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.520]   - Yeah, just come back, just walk out and come back and go,
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.040]   you know, I misplaced my mask.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.280]   Just do that a couple times that we all could end up with.
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.560]   Bring your shoplifting pants.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.000]   - Are we excited about tomorrow?
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.800]   - We're definitely excited about the masks.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.040]   - Apparently the masks are the story.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.960]   We're excited about iPhone, four of them,
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.000]   not a mini, sorry, Jason.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   - And iPhone 14, the iPhone 14 and 14,
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.600]   I'm guessing, Max. - Plus.
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.600]   - Oh, plus.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.280]   - German says it's plus.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.120]   - Yeah.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.760]   - iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 plus,
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.480]   and those will have the A15 chip in them.
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.200]   Last year's chip, is that right?
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.040]   - Yep.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.920]   - The iPhone, well, now what does German say?
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.080]   The pros will be pro, iPhone pro.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:05.920]   - Pro and pro Max.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.760]   - Pro and pro Max.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:07.600]   - Still same name.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.160]   - A 16 chip in it.
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.680]   The biggest story of the week,
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.960]   'cause there's nothing to say, is the pill.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.160]   (laughs)
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.160]   Right?
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.240]   There will be, I think known for some time
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.600]   that they would have a cut out.
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:26.280]   Actually, too, they'll have a,
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.200]   and German confirms this.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.080]   They'll have a, let me see if I can find a picture of this here.
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.000]   They'll have a,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.520]   why do they show the backside of it?
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.520]   I don't care.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.800]   They have a, a lozenge.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.880]   They'll have a lozenge,
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.760]   and they'll have a dot.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:45.600]   - Right.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.760]   - But everybody's confirmed now,
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.080]   and I think this is offensive to some,
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:53.280]   that the screen in between the lozenge and the dot
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.800]   will be darkened so it can perform like a little warning light
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.880]   when the camera or microphone are on.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.520]   Am I saying that correctly?
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:05.040]   So it will be a big, it'll look like a big lozenge,
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:05.880]   but it isn't.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:07.720]   (laughs)
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.520]   And then I also ask,
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.760]   what of this region above the lozenge in the dot?
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.600]   - Yeah.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.720]   - That seems wasted screen real estate.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.600]   The notifications will appear side by side
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.560]   with the lozenge in the dot.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.560]   - It'll be, you know, background color filler right,
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.880]   so it'll feel like it's of a hole,
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.760]   but you can't put the information up there.
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:27.600]   - Right, you can't.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.440]   - Yeah.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.280]   - But also if you're watching,
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.160]   if you're watching video,
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.160]   if there's a dark background,
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.080]   you might not notice that that hole is there,
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:36.280]   and so that might give you a virtualized idea
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.960]   that the screen is as big as it actually is.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.240]   - Okay, it seems to be a,
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.480]   I mean, look at these are big screens,
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.760]   they're 6.7 inch on the max and the plus,
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.200]   but still it seems like a waste.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.320]   Why is the lozenge better than the cutout?
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:54.200]   The notch.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.280]   - Who cares?
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.440]   - Okay, the edge.
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.760]   - I don't understand.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.520]   - I mean, they spend a lot of energy doing it.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.360]   I mean, they must have,
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.440]   - I think people have a spend a lot of energy
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.280]   talking about it,
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.120]   and I'm just like,
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.840]   - I just don't care.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.840]   - Yeah, I've long ago forgotten that I had a cutout.
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:08.680]   - Right, okay.
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.560]   - My argument would be mostly that it looks different,
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.120]   and Apple would tell you that because the background
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.520]   is gonna match the, you know,
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:17.960]   whatever the background of the screen is,
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.080]   it gives this impression of the size of the screen
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.600]   being edge to edge, even though there's this cutout part.
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.760]   And I think ultimately,
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.000]   I think it's about Apple's visual identity for the iPhone
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.880]   that remember it used to be rectangle and a little home button.
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.760]   And then it became rectangle with a notch out of it.
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.800]   And that, that, people mocked the notch,
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.240]   but Apple started to use like,
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.400]   what does a silhouette of an iPhone look like?
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.000]   And it looked like a screen with a notch out of it.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.440]   And so now it's going to be a screen
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:48.000]   with a little rectangular,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.880]   you know, with curved edges window in it.
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.800]   And that's gonna represent what the iPhone screen looks like
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.280]   for a year or two or three,
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.600]   until they go to the next one.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.000]   So I think it's,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.120]   you know, I think they feel like it's a design variation
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.200]   that lets people say, oh, this looks a little different.
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:07.120]   And also that, that, that kind of mental game of,
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.160]   it makes it feel like the screen is extending to the edge
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:13.000]   because you can see that little extra bit of information,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.720]   or a little bit of color there,
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.440]   even though it doesn't impart any information.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.600]   I do like the idea of the indicators hiding in the little cap,
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.240]   though, 'cause I always hated the indicators
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.200]   kind of floating in the corner
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.000]   to tell you that the camera's on or the microphone's on.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.560]   - Yeah, I agree with the idea that just having,
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.360]   just having even that sliver of screen
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.280]   that continues the background to the actual edge
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:36.440]   of the device itself is an important part of design language.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.600]   And I think that that's what the design team in Apple
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.880]   were really, were really hot for.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.200]   I think that I have to go back to,
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.720]   I fix a tear down to wonder, to figure out if,
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.000]   was there a technological reason
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   why they couldn't do any kind of an edge to edge?
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.560]   Were they hiding some sort of a driver chip
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.600]   or something at the edge of the panel
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.920]   at the very, very top there that made it easier
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:03.720]   or impossible for them to even have that sliver
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.600]   at the very, very top when they decided to do the brow
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.560]   at the top there?
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:11.080]   There's there times where I think that a lot of what Apple
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:14.000]   does, God bless 'em, is that they really do think that,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.400]   "Ah, this is, it's almost right, but it's not right."
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.800]   Design-wise, we would want to do this,
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.200]   but we can't do it this time,
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.040]   but we're gonna do it again next time.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.360]   And sometimes it leads to design wonkery,
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.080]   but sometimes it really is aesthetic,
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.280]   sometimes it really is, this is our goal
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.520]   is to make the entire thing as good
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.840]   as we can possibly make it,
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.960]   and sometimes putting an extra six pixels
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.200]   at the top of the display above the cutout
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.440]   is actually part of that mandate.
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:44.440]   By the way, Google's event is coming up October 6,
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.560]   the invites went out.
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.960]   (laughing)
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.280]   - Oh my God, I haven't helped.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.120]   - This is something somebody cares less about
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.280]   than the Lozage and Dot.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.120]   - Okay.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:56.200]   - Can I say that, why does an Apple do things like this?
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.880]   - It's October 6th, and that date kind of
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.680]   stuck out to me for some reason,
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.240]   and then I realized that, oh,
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.080]   that's day one of New York Comic Con
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.360]   that last like Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.040]   that I wasn't gonna go to
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:10.520]   because I didn't want to make a special trip out for it.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.480]   And so what does an Apple just find out,
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.240]   hey, Steely Dan is playing nearby that night.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.840]   You'll get more people flying out of the word.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.640]   If the Google event is in New York,
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.640]   is that where it is?
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.320]   It's actually in Brooklyn, it's like that it's at,
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.800]   they're doing the hands on,
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:28.480]   they found a place right near their new Brooklyn store,
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.120]   and they're doing the hands on event,
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.160]   right at their Brooklyn store.
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.160]   - So this is Steely Enaco, who is our overseas reporter,
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.760]   filling us in on what the other folk are doing.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.440]   - Technically, from the double agent,
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:45.000]   as the person, I'm very proud
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.960]   and sometimes bewildered by the fact that
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.320]   when I talk about Apple on a Google show,
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.160]   I'm just an Apple fanboy.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.800]   When I talk about Google on an Apple show,
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:53.800]   I'm the Google fanboy.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.480]   - Yeah, you can't.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.320]   - Brilliant.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.960]   - But yeah, but so this is gonna be
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.600]   their, what, only their third Google store.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.320]   So there's probably a lot of hype going on,
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.920]   so we wanna make sure that people know,
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.760]   we want to get a freebie with people
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:10.800]   who are press guests to see our new Brooklyn store as well.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.800]   - Yeah, but I have to say, I mostly--
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.600]   - 30-10 AM, we'll cover it live,
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.480]   that's 7 AM our time, so that means I won't be here,
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.080]   'cause I'll be fast asleep.
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.480]   (laughing)
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.400]   - I can also see the new Med Opera production
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.600]   of Medea that night with me.
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.200]   - Oh my God, Anand, I'm not gonna go.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.320]   - I've known Andy for 25 years,
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.840]   and he works up to this, right?
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.160]   He's like, "Oh, October 6."
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.400]   And he's like, "But wait a second,
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.440]   "I know how important October 6 is."
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.800]   It's because of Comic-Con, and I think,
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:41.200]   but Andy, it's also your pal Jason's birthday.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.000]   - Oh, you thought he was gonna say Happy Birthday.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:45.840]   - Happy Birthday.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:46.680]   - They're doing it for you.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.520]   - Now, Jason.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.160]   - Now you're not gonna be surprised
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.320]   when that fruit bouquet shows up at your door.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.840]   Well, happy birthday.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.040]   - Mr. Spoiler.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.720]   Google, give me some good for my birthday.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.080]   - We already know, 'cause Google has said what they're doing.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.680]   - I'll give you a watch that you probably won't ever
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.760]   want to touch.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:03.600]   - Heck, yay.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.320]   - I don't know, I think the pixel watch looks pretty.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.200]   The problem is the Apple ecosystem is so,
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.600]   is the draw is so strong.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.120]   It is hard to move over.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:19.280]   We did see a new rendering of the Apple Watch Pro Plus,
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.600]   Max Extreme.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.920]   - We did, with the mystery button.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.560]   Has anybody come up with a new name for that?
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.920]   - German thinks it's gonna be called Pro.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.160]   I still think that that's a possibility
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.000]   that it's just gonna be a third-size class,
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.320]   but German thinks that they're gonna limit it to titanium
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.960]   and they're gonna call it Pro, and it's gonna be this sort of like--
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.840]   - He thinks he doesn't know, he hasn't heard,
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.960]   he thinks it's like close to a thousand bucks, right?
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.120]   Based on its features.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.000]   - Which fits into like what the Garmin watches are
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.360]   that are those extreme sports watches.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.800]   It's a category that we always think of like a cheap sports watch
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.520]   that costs $200, but that sports watch
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.040]   category is there are a lot of $1,000 in up watches
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:55.880]   in that category.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.560]   It's actually not Apple entering
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.120]   and making an outrageous price.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.960]   I think from the perspective of Apple Watch,
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.720]   we'll look at it and be like $1,000 Apple Watch,
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.360]   that's outrageous, but $1,000 sports watches
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.760]   are a dime a dozen or $1,000 a dozen.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.680]   - And that's not that big of a watch.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.000]   Like I've had watches that are bigger.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.040]   Like it's not like when they say,
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.160]   "Oh, it's too big, no one's gonna buy it."
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.000]   I'm like,
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.440]   - But this is as German pointed out
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:19.360]   to compete with the Garmin and other high-end sport watches
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.880]   that are around $1,000.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.320]   - And Garmin is, according to German,
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.440]   I had, he's got that Bloomberg intelligence,
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.680]   which I really like.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.760]   The, what $500 in up smart watch category?
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.200]   Garmin, Garmin, you know.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.600]   - German's the leader, not Apple,
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.080]   it's German because the Garmin GPS watches
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.600]   are so popular, especially with backpackers
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:44.560]   and other kind of outdoors people who wanna have that data
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.840]   and that connectivity.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.360]   So Apple, this is a huge opportunity for Apple
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.240]   in an area that they're gonna be comfortable in
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.680]   'cause it's expensive products.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.720]   They like that, they like being there.
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.880]   - Right, I forget the big deal about the Apple Watchers
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.160]   that it was always designed,
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.520]   it was always founded as a style item
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.880]   where Apple is getting into fashion,
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.880]   Apple isn't getting into style.
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.200]   And just like Jason said,
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.320]   I mean, there are people who have Omega watches
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.120]   that are for scuba divers that are,
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.080]   need to time their air down to 200 meters.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.720]   And they're being worn by, you know,
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.960]   people like me because,
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.280]   oh wow, cool stuff, it really shows off
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.720]   like my fascination for this stuff.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.360]   And if there's one thing that's maybe,
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.320]   I won't call it a problem, but a factor,
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.440]   I think with the Apple Watchers,
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.240]   that they all look the same
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.760]   from unless you get really close to it.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.520]   The person who has like the three-year-old,
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.360]   $249 aluminum watch,
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.440]   and the person who spent $500 more
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.000]   for their brand new one this year
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.840]   that has the stainless steel case,
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.760]   it's still a pillow square on their wrist
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.720]   with a colorful band on it.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.360]   If they were to come up with another styling
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.440]   that is essentially the Omega Speedmaster version
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.960]   that has extra buttons on it,
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.440]   that has a different kind of profile,
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.520]   a different kind of shape,
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.280]   that's gonna drive a lot of people
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.880]   who are into watches to spend extra money
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.960]   to have this very special looking thing on their wrist
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.680]   that says, I didn't just get this for my bar mitzvah
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:07.800]   three years ago, this is so,
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.800]   I'm a person of elegance and taste
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.600]   who gets the $900 880 ATM version of it.
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.200]   Alex, you were gonna say something.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.840]   I am not an advisor for stocks,
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.880]   but if I own, I don't own stock,
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.040]   so I can say this, if I own german stock,
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.520]   a garment stock, not german stock.
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:25.520]   - Does german have a stock?
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.520]   - Because I would buy german.
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.520]   - I would buy german.
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.360]   - Yeah, I'd buy that stock.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.280]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.120]   But if I own german stock,
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.520]   I might take a break today.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.520]   Just cash in and see how tomorrow goes.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.520]   - The Apple stock is down a little bit right now,
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:39.600]   but that's usual,
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:43.960]   you, the old saying is you buy,
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.680]   buy on the rumors,
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.000]   use the news.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:48.840]   - Right.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:49.680]   - This is somehow,
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.520]   it's, you know,
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.360]   - It's upside down with Apple.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:52.520]   - Yeah, but the garment one, I probably,
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.480]   you know, if nothing happens,
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.640]   then nothing will happen to the stock
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.320]   and you'll just leave,
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.160]   you'll come back to it.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.480]   If something happens,
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:04.160]   I think there'll be six to 10% less tomorrow.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.000]   - Wow.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.280]   - Yeah, if it might be right, yeah.
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.680]   - If Apple releases something that's very focused
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.240]   on the sports market,
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.920]   regardless of whether it'll actually hurt garment or not,
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.560]   the folks that are buying stocks might go well,
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.360]   I need to move things out.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:21.160]   - Here's the render from 91 Mobles,
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.560]   which is a Indian gadget site
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.360]   of what somebody says claims,
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:31.340]   is the Apple Watch Pro credible?
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:35.080]   - Yeah, probably.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.280]   - Who knows about this point maybe?
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.120]   - We'll find out.
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.880]   Yeah, it might be at this point, yeah.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.720]   The notable difference, it still has rounded corners.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.400]   It looks a lot like a regular Apple Watch,
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:49.080]   doesn't except for what is that hump on the right there?
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:55.080]   Where normally you'd have a flat button and a knob,
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:00.080]   you now have a raised bump with a button in the bump.
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.520]   What's that all about?
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.440]   - I don't know.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.280]   - Don't know.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.120]   - Nobody knows.
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:04.960]   - Mystery.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.720]   - It is a mystery.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.880]   - Maybe it's just easier to access,
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.160]   easier to access button if you were wearing gloves
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.000]   or something like that,
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.480]   instead of having it flush with the side of the thing.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.800]   - We need Adam Anks done here,
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.880]   'cause we need somebody as an extreme runner.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:18.720]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.240]   - 'Cause I bet Adam wears a Garmin.
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.680]   I wonder what feature of the Garmin this is to compete with.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.280]   - I think it's for the Spiderwebs.
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.120]   (laughs)
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.440]   - What's the Spiderweb?
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:29.960]   - You know, pew pew pew, you know,
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.880]   you come out like this, like this.
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.200]   - I just have like a little like that.
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.280]   - Spiderweb's been pretty good for a while.
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:39.080]   - I was, so I was in driving through Yosemite yesterday,
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.240]   and you're going through these areas
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.320]   where there's no cell coverage,
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.880]   and there's just Labor Day weekend.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.840]   There's lots of people, and they're in campgrounds,
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.600]   and they're hiking out there.
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.800]   And I was thinking about how that is one of these markets
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.320]   for these kind of watches,
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.240]   and how Apple Watch, up to now,
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.840]   the whole idea of Apple Watch has been,
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.960]   well, let's get to a one day of battery life.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.760]   And you do your workouts,
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.160]   and then you get home and you plug in.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.960]   It's like, well, okay, that's not gonna work
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.480]   in so many of these scenarios.
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.200]   So the idea that this watch is bigger is interesting,
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.760]   but you put a bigger battery in it,
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.640]   and maybe, German still is hinting, not Garmon,
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.720]   again, Mark German, that they may do a mode
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.400]   that's basically like a battery saving mode.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.440]   So the idea that you could say,
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.000]   I'm going out into the wilderness,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.840]   and I need this Apple Watch to last for a week,
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:21.960]   or at last for five days,
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.440]   and still do some tracking and some other functionality,
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.760]   not just be kind of off with a screen
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:27.720]   that just shows the time.
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.520]   And like, that is totally an area where,
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.880]   it's obvious Apple should go there,
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.280]   especially if German is making so much money
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.560]   on their watches.
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.000]   So a story starts to form there,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.640]   but I think the interesting idea is that if they call it pro,
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.520]   I think they're gonna want it to be aspirational, right?
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:46.080]   It's not that you are in the backcountry hiking,
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.320]   it's that you could be.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.480]   And so by our watch-- - Right, yeah,
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.680]   aspirational, yeah, I'll buy it even though
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:53.560]   I will never go hiking in the backcountry.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:56.160]   I will buy it just 'cause it looks like I'm pretty tough,
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.880]   and rough, and rugged.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:01.600]   So you're saying short German long German,
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.160]   or is it short German long German?
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.120]   I can-- - Long German.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.680]   - Long on German, short.
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:07.760]   - Long on German.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:08.600]   (laughing)
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:09.760]   - Okay, show title.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.480]   That's why I repeat it.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.400]   - Thank you, Andy, for pointing that out.
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.120]   (laughing)
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.480]   But we have several show titles,
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.240]   and we're just beginning, let's take a little break,
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:23.440]   'cause I wanna stop people in their tracks,
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.680]   because I know you're gonna go,
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.240]   you're gonna buy the iPhone 14,
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:31.800]   and you're gonna go get that overpriced Apple case,
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:35.520]   when you could do so much better with Nomad.
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.520]   Our show today brought to you by Nomad.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:42.320]   I love Nomads, cases, I love Nomads, chargers.
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.960]   Before you buy the stock boring thing,
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.600]   take a look at what Nomads got.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.040]   Nomad was founded in the 2012 effect.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:53.560]   I think I bought into their first Kickstarter project.
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:56.760]   They wanted to build ultra rugged minimalist tools
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.480]   for the 21st century.
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:01.040]   Beautiful objects in their own right,
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:05.120]   not accessories, but beautiful objects in their own right,
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.160]   made from premium materials,
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.200]   like Horween Leather.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.080]   This is a beautiful Nomad rugged case
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.520]   that has, this is for my iPhone,
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:17.440]   that is beautiful, Horween Leather.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:19.440]   That's from the Horween Tannery in Chicago,
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:23.760]   100 year old Tannery, and Leather fanatics know,
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.760]   Horween is the best leather.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.840]   They make Apple watch straps.
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:33.000]   In fact, I'll get whatever the stock watch strap is,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.640]   but I will almost certainly get a Nomad steel band,
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.640]   or they also have very nice sport bands
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:42.320]   for my daily driver.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.760]   And the chargers are the best.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:49.760]   I'd have the charger that does the watch
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:53.440]   and the phone, see that one there right there?
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:56.040]   But Lisa stole it, it's on her bedside table,
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:00.320]   'cause it's so good, this is the basic base one,
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.080]   which is fantastic.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:05.120]   It's heavy, it's mag safe,
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.480]   and the other thing I wanna point out,
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.560]   and you can get these standalone,
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:12.600]   the Nomads, incredible cables.
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:16.080]   Nomad, these guys are obsessive with the details.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.360]   They were tired of dealing with flimsy charging cables,
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.680]   and you know, you've dealt with them
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.000]   the fall apart every few months,
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.440]   so they set out to engineer some of the most rugged cables
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:28.120]   around, reinforced with double braided Kevlar outer sheath
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.640]   and strong metal alloy connector housing.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.520]   Nomad cables have been engineered for extreme durability
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:35.080]   and heavy everyday use.
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:38.320]   There's the base one, Max, by the way, which Lisa has.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:42.440]   They also offer it, I believe, a special edition in gold.
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:46.320]   A climate certified, climate neutral certified brand,
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:49.840]   so you can feel good about buying it, wireless chargers.
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.000]   Take a look at their wallets and their passport holders
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.720]   also with horn-ween leather.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.320]   And those leather accessories smell great,
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.160]   and they develop this beautiful patina
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:01.400]   that makes it uniquely yours over time.
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.080]   Look at this Kevlar outer sheath.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:06.880]   I only, only get Nomad cables now, they're the best.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.760]   Nomad is, and always will be, a company
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:13.120]   that prioritizes design and quality over everything else.
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.200]   One of the most important aspects to Nomad,
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.200]   when designing new products,
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:19.640]   they use the highest quality, longest lasting materials
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.920]   available, you could tell.
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:24.040]   When you feel this base one, it's heavy.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.800]   This is gonna sit on your bedside table,
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.360]   and it's not going anywhere, it's solid.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:31.160]   It feels like, mmm, beautiful thing.
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.760]   All of their concepts are designed by Nomad
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.160]   from the ground up, they don't white label
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.000]   other people's products.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.320]   I think you're just gonna love it.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.800]   Go to nomadgoods.com/macbreak.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.520]   Right now, use a promo code Macbreak
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.000]   for 10% off your first purchase,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.720]   actually maybe wait till tomorrow.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.560]   I love these GAN adapters too, they offer really good.
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.000]   The 65 Watts back in stock.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.760]   Macbreak the offer code 10% off any Nomad accessory.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:00.840]   Nomadgoods.com/macbreak.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.080]   The promo code again is Macbreak,
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.080]   there's a limited time offer,
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.800]   but I'm thinking you can wait till tomorrow.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.160]   (laughing)
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.480]   I don't know how long it'll take them
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:11.480]   to get stuff specific to the new watch,
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.280]   if the new watch has new bands,
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:17.120]   or specific to the new iPhone.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.520]   But certainly keep an eye out.
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:24.520]   nomadgoods.com/macbreak.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:29.240]   We think you'll be able to order Friday, right?
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:34.240]   That's the odds online from the bookies in the UK.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:38.000]   Friday will be the ordering day, I'm joking,
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.240]   it's again, Mark Gurman.
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:44.040]   So you could get up early Friday, 5 a.m., 6 a.m.,
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.440]   what do they do right now?
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.880]   - Well, it's 5 a.m.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:47.720]   - It's 5 a.m.
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.520]   Then you have to, there's the banging in it, not working.
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:51.360]   (laughing)
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.520]   The site still doesn't work.
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:55.520]   So you gotta give yourself a solid 35 minute store.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:39:00.520]   - I always use the Apple store app,
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.200]   that seems to work a little better.
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.040]   - Oh really?
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.560]   - Is that a web page?
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.200]   - I use the web page.
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.840]   - Well, okay, let's be fair.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.760]   I have three systems with all three of them
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.200]   loading the web page.
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.040]   - Right, right.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:15.800]   - I pad loading the store, I have an iPhone loading the store
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.880]   and I just, you know, hit them again and again,
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:20.320]   which is one of the reasons they go down,
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.200]   because everybody's doing that, right?
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.200]   - Well, you know, it's funny, we talk about that
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.040]   when we talk about fixing problems
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.000]   when you're dealing with customers,
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.520]   'cause like I work on live events
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:30.280]   and one of the problems you have is like,
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.560]   keep on telling people with the interface,
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:34.640]   I'm like, it's not 10,000 people coming through,
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.200]   'cause they're like, oh, we'll just build an AWS thing
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.440]   and we'll just have people log in all at the same time.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.640]   You know, it's automated.
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:40.840]   And I'm like, that's not the problem.
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:43.040]   The problem is if the button doesn't work for like a second,
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:45.320]   people will just start hitting it 20 times,
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:46.160]   they're trying to get it to go.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.200]   And then, so that's a behavior
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.600]   that the computer doesn't think about.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.560]   It thinks I click on it and then I wait.
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:52.840]   It doesn't think, I click on it,
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.840]   it doesn't react in point two seconds.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:57.720]   And so now I will just tap on it and tell something happens.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:00.120]   And so, yeah, that's the problem with their website.
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:03.120]   But I, the problem that I've had
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:04.600]   is that the order won't complete.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.760]   So I get in, I order whatever I'm ordering
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.400]   at five o'clock in the morning.
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:12.800]   And then I, when I hit order, it just freezes
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.720]   and then it goes, no, we couldn't do that.
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:16.080]   Oh, I hate that.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:17.120]   I hate that.
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:17.960]   I wasted all that time.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:18.560]   I hate that.
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:22.080]   And also with the phone, you might load up Verizon T-Mobile's,
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:25.280]   you know, 18, whoever your carrier is.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.640]   And those are the ones that really do that to me the most,
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.520]   where they go, I don't even bother with them.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.720]   I just give up, I can't understand what the phone was.
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.640]   (laughs)
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.920]   Wait and go to the store?
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:35.800]   What about, how about that?
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.520]   Is that a reasonable option?
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.360]   You get it something.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:39.120]   That's actually November.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:41.040]   No, that is, that is the, so,
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:42.960]   you're right about the Apple App, Apple Store App.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.000]   At least historically, there was something about,
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.920]   like, the pathway it was using, the API it was hitting,
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:49.960]   it was not going through the same thing as the web store.
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:52.320]   And so that you could, it was more reliable
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.920]   because the web store was getting swamped,
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.200]   but there was a different path for the app.
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.680]   I don't know if that's still the case.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:59.240]   Apple seems to have done a better job
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.040]   of getting everything to sort of stabilize when you order
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:04.000]   than it was a few years ago.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.200]   But yeah, if you don't get your order in,
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:09.440]   I'm telling you, the pro tip, the secret tip,
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:14.040]   is they reserve stock at retail for launch day
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.640]   and in successive days.
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.640]   So if you go on the website at any point,
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:21.240]   it says it's gonna be three weeks before you get it.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.800]   And keeping in mind, you can cancel your order.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.240]   So you can make an order out three weeks and cancel it
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:26.920]   if you can't get it in the meantime,
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.760]   but go buy your local stores
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.080]   or see if you can make an in-store pickup order.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:37.000]   Like, there are pathways into the secret reserve stash
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.080]   because they don't want the Apple stores to be sold out.
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.000]   They want people to be able to go into Apple stores
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.800]   and say, hey, do you have the new iPhone
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:43.880]   and have them say yes.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.640]   And as a result, they will reserve stock
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:47.920]   and distribute it to stores.
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.080]   So retail store is a great fall.
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.800]   - Is it only the base model though?
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:51.960]   Is it work?
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.400]   - No, no, they will do different configurations.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:58.640]   It's usually sort of the most popular configurations.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.960]   You know, you may be, you don't get to custom configure it,
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.680]   but there are more than just the base models
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:05.360]   for sure at retail.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.240]   - I think my problem is that my version of the phone
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:09.360]   is always turn all the dials up to the top thing
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:10.440]   and then buy that phone.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.280]   - Yeah, you won't have that one.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.840]   - That's not gonna be there.
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:16.640]   But they will have the top of the bell curve, right?
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.720]   The most popular models will be there
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:21.840]   and they also know they will lean a little bit
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:24.280]   toward extra features because they'll know that it's like,
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.120]   well, I know you wanted this storage,
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:29.520]   but I have the next level up for $100 more
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:30.920]   and then you buy that one, right?
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:32.360]   So they'll lean in that direction.
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:36.080]   - Should I now look at my existing usage on my iPhone
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:38.400]   to determine how much storage I should have
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.320]   in the new iPhone?
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:41.920]   This is be a good time to look at that.
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:42.920]   Yes or no? - That's what I do.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.920]   - Yeah. - That's what I do is I look at,
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.480]   I actually went down a step the last time I bought my iPhone
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:52.480]   because I realized that I was nowhere near even down one step
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.640]   in terms of actual storage on the device.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:43:00.640]   - I have 129.7 gigabytes of 512 used.
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:04.760]   I wasted money on this phone
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.040]   and I've had this for two years.
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.480]   So maybe 256, that's another rumor
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.080]   is that they're gonna start at 256.
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:13.680]   So the base model may actually have enough storage for you.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.600]   That's the only choice, that and the color, right?
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:17.840]   You don't have a lot of other choices
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:19.800]   if you're gonna buy a, you know,
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:23.400]   you have the choice between iPhone, iPhone plus iPhone,
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:27.720]   Pro, iPhone, Pro Max, but in that given line,
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:29.520]   it's color and storage.
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:32.360]   Yes, yeah. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.720]   So you could, I mean, most people, I think 256 gigs
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:37.920]   is a good place for most people, yes.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:38.920]   - I agree. - If you're looking at,
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.200]   the mine has, mine's pretty low right now,
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.280]   but it also has to do with the fact that I put things on it
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.560]   and take them off because it's too big.
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.000]   You know, so if you're shooting ProRes with your camera,
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.360]   you-- - Well, that's, yeah.
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:49.840]   Really fast, you know, so--
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:52.160]   - So let me ask you this, Alex. - All the memory.
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:55.320]   - We were all excited a year ago about cinematic mode.
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.760]   Think it all, man, I'm gonna be shooting a lot of ProRes
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.920]   cinematic mode, did you?
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:02.120]   - I shot ProRes, absolutely not cinematic.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:06.040]   It still does things that I don't expect it to do,
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.040]   so I played with cinematic and I was like--
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.440]   - That's the rack focus thing that they had those great ads.
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.280]   - Yeah, it does rack focus.
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:13.120]   And what it does is it looks a little further out
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:15.560]   and it can kind of guess what is coming through
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:16.520]   and it can make the decisions.
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:18.200]   It just didn't make the decisions the way I would make--
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.600]   - Not for a pro.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:23.600]   - And so, I mean, but I, I mean, I use that camera so much.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.680]   I mean, I shoot so much footage and you know--
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.520]   - Video?
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:28.920]   - You shoot a lot of video?
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.840]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, a lot of video.
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:34.840]   And I, you know, it's just an, it's a pretty great,
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:36.120]   I mean, it's a pretty great camera.
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.320]   I mean, I'm kind of amazed, you know, at this point
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.720]   I just look at it, I look at the phone as a camera
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:42.600]   that can do phone calls sometimes.
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:43.440]   - Right.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:45.080]   - You know, like it's, and I think that I'll be really
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:46.320]   interested to see--
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.800]   - This will be even more so, right?
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:50.520]   - Low light, you know, the big things that make a difference
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:55.520]   for me at this point are low light and resolution.
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.280]   And so, and chip size, you know, they could make that bump
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:59.760]   on the back about as big as they wanted it.
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.800]   And I'd still probably just go, okay, that sounds good.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.160]   As long as I get better pictures.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:08.160]   - If they are gonna get the new super megapixel sensor,
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:12.360]   we don't know if they're gonna bend it down to 12 megapixels
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:14.320]   or keep it at what it was at 48.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.520]   But will photos be larger?
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:17.360]   Yes, right?
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:18.200]   Or no?
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.920]   - Maybe, maybe, I mean, it's hard to tell,
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:20.960]   and will they be better?
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.760]   I mean, the problem is is that if they don't,
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:25.000]   if you go to 48 megapixel from 12 megapixel
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   and you don't make a significant chip size change,
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.400]   the issue that you end up with is--
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.720]   - Quality is not improved.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:33.080]   - The sensor sites are just smaller.
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.600]   And it means that there's higher or ratta,
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.800]   which means now can they get over some of that
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.400]   with computational photography?
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:39.280]   - Maybe.
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:41.720]   - But you know, it's still, what I do find
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:43.520]   is that the real thing is the real thing at times.
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.800]   - The argument for bending though is strong, right?
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:50.320]   You shoot 48 pixels and then you bend it down to 12.
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.520]   - It's actually what they were trying to do
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:52.600]   with that deep fusion mode,
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:54.800]   where they were taking multiple exposures.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.480]   - For sweaters, sweater mode, yes.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:57.320]   - The sweater mode.
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:59.040]   And they were trying to compare all the pixels,
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:02.000]   well, imagine if you could take them all at once
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.520]   and then do the computation.
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:05.280]   - I bet that's what they're gonna do, right?
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.760]   - Yeah, and you'll end up with something
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.400]   that might be bigger file size-wise,
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:13.520]   but is more akin to a really good 12 megapixel image
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:16.360]   rather than a full on 48 megapixel image.
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:18.640]   - You think of it not as, they're cheating
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.600]   by taking four pixels and turning it to one.
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:24.080]   Think of it as each sensor pixel being four times bigger
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.320]   than it would normally be.
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.520]   So it's taking in more lives, taking in more data.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.680]   There's more stuff that they could accrue from that.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:31.680]   It's just a big, big deal all the way around.
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.280]   To say nothing of what you do with it,
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:35.680]   if you, we talked about this last week,
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.320]   that if Apple decides to do something clever,
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:40.680]   saying, well, what if we, when we're shooting
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.360]   just plain HD or even 4K video,
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.920]   but unbeknownst to the user,
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:47.640]   we're actually taking a chunk out of that sensor
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:50.040]   and removing it around to sort of make sure
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.200]   that a subject is centered,
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.160]   even when you're not keeping up with your little kid
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.720]   or in my case of squirrel,
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:57.920]   there's a lot of cool things that Apple or Google
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:00.320]   or anybody who is very, very computationally hip
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.160]   could do with that.
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:06.320]   - All right, so there is some, the good news,
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.400]   and I like it, and I hope they do this,
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.720]   is you will watch the presentation tomorrow,
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:14.040]   have three days to think about it before you order,
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.240]   and that's one of the questions you might be asking is,
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:17.840]   well, how big is the file size gonna be?
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:19.760]   Are they gonna be in probably,
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:22.720]   is it gonna be much larger than a pure 12 megapixel,
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:23.960]   probably slightly?
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.680]   How much bigger Alex would it be?
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:28.920]   - Not that much, I mean, it's just hard to tell.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:31.200]   I mean, I think that, again, it's already a big issue.
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.200]   - And they don't have to say, they're not gonna say,
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.160]   well, get ready because your stills are gonna be 12.8.
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:37.400]   - Maybe, but you have the storage there
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:40.400]   to put more there, so it'd be nice for them
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.360]   to go ahead and go to a higher resolution.
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.040]   Again, if they have the data to--
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.200]   - That's a choice.
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.760]   - But a lot of times, it's interesting people go,
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:48.720]   oh, it's 48 megapixel, something's really big,
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:51.000]   and they didn't make the chip any bigger
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.400]   to take into account, and you go,
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:55.480]   well, it's kinda there.
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:57.160]   - So one of the things I do--
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.320]   - Because grain is a real issue.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:47:59.560]   - Grain is more important.
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:00.840]   - Grain is more important, right?
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:02.080]   One of the things I do that might mean
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:06.000]   that 256 is right for me also is I do everything,
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.520]   by the way, I now use photos, I photos as my dam.
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:13.720]   So when I take a picture even with my Sony A7R4
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:18.040]   or with my Leica Q2, I upload it to iPhoto's or photos.
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:20.760]   I just, I call it iPhoto's so you know the one I'm talking about.
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:23.960]   I upload to iPhoto's and let them store the originals
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:27.560]   on iCloud, and then I do optimize,
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:31.080]   I do iCloud photo storage on the devices.
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.280]   So the devices aren't getting big,
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:36.880]   but I do have a very large library in the cloud.
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.400]   Is that, I know it maybe is more expensive,
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:41.880]   but I'm buying the Apple One subscription, so--
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:43.720]   - Yeah, you get two terabytes without the one.
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:44.760]   - I got lots of storage.
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:45.600]   - Yeah.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:47.120]   - That seems sensible.
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:47.960]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.720]   - And now that means I don't have to buy
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:52.320]   more than two V6 gigs, even if, now does video,
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:53.480]   it works with video too, right?
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:54.320]   - If you're gonna shoot.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:55.160]   - Yeah.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:56.000]   - If you're gonna shoot it, if you decide,
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:56.840]   oh, I'm gonna do a movie.
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:57.960]   - Well, if I'm gonna do a two hour movie,
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.320]   I need to make your phone.
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:02.240]   - Or even just, it doesn't take very long at 422HQ.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.760]   It doesn't take very long to fill that up.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:07.760]   So it's, so you're gonna get two terabytes on your phone.
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:09.440]   (laughing)
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:13.520]   - I always think, if you're close to 256,
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:16.880]   you might wanna consider 512 just because you never know.
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.200]   - Oh, it's horrible to run out.
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:19.040]   - That's a good situation.
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:22.240]   My daughter got, we got her one step too little
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:25.440]   and she has had to deal with deleting stuff
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:26.520]   for the last few years.
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:27.360]   - Yeah, that's not good.
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:28.200]   - And I feel bad about it now.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.800]   So like, what I always do is sort of like look,
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.240]   and if I'm anywhere near the line,
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:33.800]   I will get the next one up.
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.320]   But it does mean you get the 512 instead of the one terabyte
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:37.760]   and you save yourself some money.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:39.640]   - Well, I'm thinking 256 is gonna be enough
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:41.480]   'cause I'm only using 130.
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:45.480]   I have a hundred gigabytes of music on here.
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:47.440]   I have the max audible will allow on this,
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.640]   which is 20 gigabytes of books,
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.720]   11 gigabytes of photos.
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:52.560]   I mean, I have to--
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:53.520]   - If you're using cloud stuff,
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:54.520]   the need for all that--
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:55.640]   - That's how some storage goes away.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:58.360]   Unless you're, again, unless you're aspiring
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.640]   to back talk in the wilderness
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:02.720]   and you need to download some music to bring with you,
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:03.560]   otherwise you're--
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:05.680]   - Well, 100 gigabytes of music is a lot of music.
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:06.520]   I don't need to-- - It is.
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:07.840]   - I'm not gonna run out of music.
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:08.680]   - Huge.
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:09.520]   - Yeah.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:12.840]   Also, the times you are totally, totally in the weeds
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:15.600]   when you need another 30 gigabytes of storage
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:16.720]   but you don't have it.
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:19.520]   That's to me, the cheapest money I spend
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.160]   is upgrading to the most storage I can possibly get.
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.200]   - Okay, all right.
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.040]   - I mean, I was tempted,
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:27.680]   when I bought my Pixel 6 Pro last year,
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.720]   I was really tempted to go back to iPhone
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:33.000]   because I love iPhones too.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.920]   But one of the things that really made the decision for me
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:37.680]   was that for the same amount of money,
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:40.600]   I could get 512 gigs of storage instead of 256.
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:43.360]   And to me, personally, not for everybody.
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:45.600]   I thought that the two devices were close enough
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:47.040]   in what I would want to do with them
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.560]   that that was gonna be one of the deciding factors.
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:52.080]   I'd never regret having more storage on a phone.
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:54.880]   - You're trying to talk me out of it
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.160]   but this all goes back to my
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:59.160]   of going in and getting the base model.
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:03.280]   And if the base model's 256, I'm golden.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:06.320]   We are all Pro Max buyers though.
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:07.360]   We are not sitting here.
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:10.440]   Well, you want a mini, I know, Jason, you're a weirdo.
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:11.280]   - Oh, well.
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.280]   - You're gonna survive.
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:14.920]   - Not giving that you can't get a phone as small as your hands.
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.440]   You're gonna get a Pro Max probably, right?
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:20.280]   - Well, I mean, I'm not gonna buy in this cycle,
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:24.480]   but as a product, 'cause I just bought a 13 mini,
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:28.880]   but as a product reviewer, I will tell you the, that's code.
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:33.120]   As a product reviewer, I'm most interested in the new pro phone
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:35.320]   because I think that's where we're gonna get the new chip
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:37.240]   and that's where we're gonna get the new camera.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:40.280]   And I'm really interested in that.
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.720]   And yeah, coming from the mini,
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:43.720]   I don't even have like the Pro Motion display
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.040]   or anything like that on top of it.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:47.600]   So that's the one that I'm planning on spending
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:50.160]   the most time with of the four,
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.000]   because now one looks good.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.040]   - But when you're spending your money,
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:53.840]   you're gonna buy something a little less.
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:56.640]   And I think this is probably in a year.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:59.280]   And you know, I skipped last year, so I get to buy this.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:02.080]   But I think that, you know, real people don't buy every year
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:04.280]   unless they have, Apple still offers, in fact,
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:07.680]   there's a rumor they're considering this for all their hardware,
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.520]   a subscription plan that gives you a yearly replacement.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:12.600]   The rumor, which I kind of an interested in,
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:14.400]   is they might do it for Max as well.
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:18.760]   - Yeah, I think that if you have a family,
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:20.600]   then you have an excuse to buy one every year.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:21.960]   - Yeah, 'cause I have hand-me-downs.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:22.960]   - Yeah, there's like hand-me-downs.
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:26.040]   - Yeah, a big, you know, train.
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:26.960]   - Yeah.
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:31.960]   - So, Lisa, who has the 13, will get the 14.
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:33.760]   Her 13 will go to her son.
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:36.040]   Her son's 12 will go to her ex-husband.
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:39.320]   I don't know what her ex-husband does with his phones.
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.600]   Oh no, wait a minute, I think we get it back.
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:43.680]   And then we give it to some employee, some poor employee.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:46.480]   No, we sell it on the Swapper, Gazelle, or somewhere.
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:49.360]   Does Apple give the best trade-ins, by the way?
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:50.360]   Is it better to go?
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:53.400]   - No, no, no, they're trade-ins are terrible.
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:54.240]   - Terrible.
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:57.000]   - It's just like turning in your car at the dealer
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.320]   when you buy a new car.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:00.160]   It is there for expediency's sake,
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:02.000]   but it's never gonna be your best deal.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.120]   It's super easy.
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:04.280]   There's that for it.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:05.120]   I mean, you're a professor.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:06.440]   - Do you ever sell old gear?
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:08.880]   - Yeah, occasionally.
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:11.000]   And I mean, you either use one of the web services
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.960]   or you find somebody or you using--
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:15.120]   - Don't do eBay, right?
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:16.200]   You wouldn't do it yourself.
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:19.640]   - I think that there are iPhone buyers closer to home.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:23.200]   In my case, I'm mostly just handing them down.
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:26.320]   But I sold an iMac on Craigslist,
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:29.800]   where there's $100 bills being transacted at the Starbucks.
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:30.640]   - Wow, that's great.
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:31.480]   - I mean, it's not my favorite.
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:32.320]   - No.
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:34.160]   - Oh man, that was nice dress.
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:35.560]   - It's very scary, yeah.
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:36.800]   - But there are services out there
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:38.200]   that will give you a better deal than Apple.
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:41.160]   The thing is, it is awfully convenient for Apple
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:42.720]   to just say we will take your old thing,
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:45.120]   but you can always find a better deal than Apple.
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:49.280]   - Dwindel in our chair, I got $920 for my iPhone 12 Pro Max
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:51.720]   trading in for the iPhone 13 on launch day.
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:54.280]   That's a pretty good deal from Apple.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:56.120]   - It's fine, the Pro-1--
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:57.360]   - Sometimes launch day, I know Samsung's
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:59.440]   that way on launch day, Samsung,
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.200]   you could almost get a free flip phone
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:02.800]   if you did it on launch day,
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:06.040]   if you had the old flip phone, just like replace it.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:07.120]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:09.320]   - Just, but you have to be careful
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:12.520]   that they'll give you an estimate online
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:14.640]   and then you send it back and then they might say,
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:17.680]   oh well, we gave you an estimate of $450,
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:22.680]   but $50, I think we saw a scratch near the charging port
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:24.040]   and now you have to figure out,
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:26.480]   do I wanna do all the stuff again?
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:28.080]   - Bring it to the store, do it in person
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:30.160]   and you'll know if it's worth it, right?
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:35.160]   'Cause yeah, I dropped this, there's some rug burn,
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:39.520]   I'm gonna call it, that they might use that as an excuse
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:42.240]   not to give me the full price, so yeah.
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:45.280]   - I have a bunch of friends who are on the subscription plan
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:47.360]   though, the Apple product, the iPhone--
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.360]   - Yeah, is that a good idea?
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.480]   Maybe I should do that this year.
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.960]   - A lot of people, if you like getting a new phone
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:54.900]   every year, keep in mind you're renting the phone
[00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:57.440]   and so what you don't get is the ability to hand it down
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:59.560]   'cause you literally, after a year,
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:01.960]   you give them your phone back and they give you a new one
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:04.840]   and you never have that and then they put it in there
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:08.480]   a refurbished chain instead and it's a good deal for Apple too
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:11.880]   but seriously, if you get a new iPhone every year,
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:13.080]   you should look into that program
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:16.200]   because that program is actually a pretty decent deal.
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:20.080]   - They don't charge a VIG really, it's just, right?
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:21.440]   It's pretty close to what it would cost
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:23.400]   if you just amortized it over 12 months.
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:25.360]   - Yeah, I mean-- - The only negative is
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:28.160]   you better not mess up your phone
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:29.920]   'cause then you're in trouble, right?
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:32.400]   - Right, to a certain degree, yeah, if you smash,
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.920]   you smash it, you're gonna have to get that fixed
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:35.760]   or something like that but it's,
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.240]   and again, it's one of those things that like,
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:41.000]   if you put in more effort to sell that somewhere else
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.640]   and buy a new one, would you come out a few dollars
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:47.000]   to your head?
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.960]   Probably true, probably you would
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.920]   but it's way more convenient to just say,
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:53.760]   "Hey Apple, I know exactly how much I'm paying you
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:55.800]   "and I know what I get and in a year,
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:58.520]   "I know I get a new phone and I still know what I'm paying you."
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:00.760]   That's a pretty good peace of mind kind of deal.
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:02.600]   - Would you do that for a Mac?
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:06.440]   - You're a bad example 'cause you get loaners,
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:08.160]   you get review units, you're not buying.
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:10.320]   - But I also have to buy, I mean,
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:11.800]   back when I worked at Macworld, right,
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:14.680]   we had a pool, we would buy so many units to test
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:16.120]   and then we would roll those down to people.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.800]   So I'd always get like a good MacBook Air
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:21.880]   'cause we had to test that model as a self proprietor.
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:25.440]   I don't buy every model so it's a little bit,
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:28.200]   so I guess the answer would be, what's your buying cycle?
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.640]   And the problem with the Mac is the buying cycle
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:33.960]   is different and the upgrade cycle is different.
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:36.440]   So would I subscribe to always have the latest
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:38.480]   and greatest MacBook Air?
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:43.480]   I don't know, maybe, but those cycles aren't as clearly defined
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:45.600]   as something like an iPhone that comes every year.
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:48.720]   If I knew there was a new MacBook Air every two years
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:52.640]   and that I could pay Apple and know that in two years
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:54.960]   I'd just get the new one and keep paying,
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:59.240]   I would consider it but I wonder if our iPhone,
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:03.200]   if our Macs and iPads really work like that,
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:06.560]   the phone's a little more so but I'm not sure.
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:09.600]   You don't want a new Mac every year, really, mostly.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:13.120]   Right, even if it was two years I'm not sure I would want,
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:15.760]   every two years, I'm not sure that would be necessary.
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:18.240]   And you don't know if you really want that update cycle.
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:21.800]   It's like one year I buy a bunch of Macs I have recently
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:23.680]   but I don't know if I need them every year.
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:25.840]   Like I may go, well these will go for the next four or five years
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:28.480]   but I bought in the last year I probably bought,
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:31.280]   I don't know, six or seven but they're mostly Mac minis.
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:33.720]   That's what I buy.
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:36.400]   We won't see any Mac announcements tomorrow.
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:37.240]   No.
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:40.840]   All signs point to October for an iPad Mac event
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:42.440]   so keep it going.
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:44.040]   Magic 8s now.
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:45.720]   It's the Magic 8s now, wouldn't it be funny
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:48.120]   if they did it on October 6th the same day?
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:49.200]   Oh God no.
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:52.800]   They got all stand up and sing Happy Birthday
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:54.360]   if they have it on my birthday.
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:58.400]   They generally don't, they generally avoid conflicting
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:00.080]   with other tech companies events.
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:02.400]   I know that you're going to say that they generally
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.400]   avoid your birthday.
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:04.400]   Well Jason's birthday.
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:05.240]   Well they should.
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:07.440]   It's a holy day.
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:08.440]   Can we be busy?
[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:09.440]   Yeah exactly.
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:11.200]   Stay away, stay away from that.
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:13.760]   Maybe the 11th, try the 11th.
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:16.200]   You know that's a good day, 18th this night.
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:18.200]   Lots of good October Tuesday's out there.
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:21.040]   Yeah it's risky actually.
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:22.760]   Well it's a Thursday this year.
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:25.520]   So yeah my birthday's a Thursday but Apple
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:26.440]   does their events on Tuesday.
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:27.280]   Oh okay.
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.280]   Probably just check it.
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:29.280]   Right.
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.280]   Got your bullet there.
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:34.120]   So 4th, 11th, 18th to 25th, those are the days available.
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:36.400]   Do you want to be too close to Halloween?
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.400]   I'm going to guess like the 18th to give them time
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:39.440]   to breathe after this one.
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:40.440]   Yeah.
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:41.960]   Yeah that's a good one.
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:44.800]   You wonder if part of that is conditional on how well
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:46.840]   the next version of Mac OS is coming on?
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:49.240]   Because how long is it going to take them to wrap things up
[00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:51.000]   and do they think that they're going to need an extra week
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:51.840]   or two?
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:55.160]   I would be very surprised if they didn't hold it in October.
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:58.240]   But I wonder if they're letting that float for well
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:59.720]   as they figure out how long is it going to take
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:01.840]   to lock down the stuff that we have already,
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:05.200]   at this point we've committed as the final punch list
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:06.200]   for the release.
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:09.320]   I think that's a great question and I think it's possible.
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:12.200]   Although I suspect that what the gating factor is
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:16.560]   for these Mac events is hardware availability.
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:18.800]   Do they have enough of them in the pipeline
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:20.360]   that they can actually put them for sale
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:23.360]   and actually have units to deliver instead of it being
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:25.000]   instantly back ordered?
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.760]   The other trick and Andy knows this too is that
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:30.280]   they often will deem something as the Golden Master
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:33.160]   and they'll ship that as the official version.
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:35.280]   And by the time it reaches people,
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:37.480]   there's already a software update.
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:40.120]   And that allows them to kind of like moderate that a little bit
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:42.240]   where it ships with something that's probably buggy.
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:44.560]   But as long as it can run the software update,
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:46.080]   it'll be okay because then they,
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:48.200]   because they have to put it on the hard drives
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:50.600]   when they're manufacturing them.
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:53.120]   And then there's a week, several weeks span
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:55.960]   and then they reach customers on launch day
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:58.320]   and they can have that backfill software update in there too.
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:00.920]   But it is, I mean, if they're really uneasy about the state
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.200]   of the US and the state of the supply chain,
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.200]   it's very easy for them to just keep pushing
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:08.800]   their internal date later and later in the year.
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.040]   It's going to be an interesting launch too
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.040]   because there are still some parts,
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:15.680]   there's still some parts of the Mac line
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.960]   that they have not updated for Apple Silicon yet.
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.760]   And they have promised by that by the end of the year,
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.400]   they will have updated the entire line.
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:22.760]   I mean, they can get out of it
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.080]   and they can get out of it the other ways.
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:27.760]   But in addition to that, there are a lot of people,
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:29.560]   you know, like Alex, like myself,
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:32.760]   who if there's going to be an updated Mac mini,
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.680]   this is the one that we've been waiting for
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:38.240]   and are going to be really, really hot to be there.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.920]   Like for the very, very first second that the store is open
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:43.240]   to make sure we get exactly the configuration we want
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.560]   without having to wait three or four months.
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.160]   So I do think there's a lot of writing
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:47.960]   on the line of this Mac announcement.
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:51.200]   Like the Mac mini.
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.400]   Like the Mac mini.
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.240]   Like a Mac mini.
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.400]   Like a Mac mini.
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.720]   Like the Mac was good, but.
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:00.800]   Yeah, it's very important.
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:03.800]   I guess the real thing is that they can,
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:06.800]   the world doesn't change other than you're in patience
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.600]   if they do it a little later in October
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.320]   or a little earlier in October.
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.320]   And that like that determination,
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.760]   I feel like is going to come by,
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:17.240]   somebody has got a spreadsheet of exactly how many
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:20.880]   they can make and ship from the factories by a certain date
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.800]   and then they pick their date.
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:26.120]   But you know, who knows?
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:29.000]   I mean, right now, like is both the OS
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.360]   and the supply chain are up in the air?
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.160]   So it could really be anything.
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:35.640]   I think that the thing that's so exciting about the Mac mini
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:37.280]   and we'll be excited about the pro and the studio
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:41.760]   and everything else is that is that the power of it
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:45.920]   for the developers that are writing to the OS
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:48.360]   as prescribed by Apple,
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.360]   the performance coming out of the M1s
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.000]   just keeps getting better.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.800]   I mean, we're doing a bunch of tests internally
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.600]   and you just see these, you know,
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:58.000]   just tons of 1080p streams and 4K streams.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   Why is that?
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.360]   Why is it getting better?
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.680]   Well, because, so one of the things I was talking to,
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.120]   actually Andy Carlucci about this,
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:09.080]   he's an engineer and what's happening is,
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.280]   is that they're able to,
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:12.320]   the operating system is getting you out of the way.
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:14.080]   So if you don't do anything to the frame,
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.240]   if you say, I have something coming in
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.560]   and I want to send it out,
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.400]   the operating system will do all that work for you
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.400]   and it makes it super efficient.
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:21.240]   (laughs)
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:23.840]   And it's, and so you're able to,
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.640]   if you follow the rules that Apple's giving you,
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:29.440]   Apple is really building it to be super high performance
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:31.560]   and what really catches developers is they're trying
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:32.960]   to roll in their own version of something.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.400]   They're like, I want to make this cross-platform
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.280]   so I don't want the code to be any different.
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:39.960]   And the most astute developers right now
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.880]   are they're saying, hey, we've got cross-platform.
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:43.800]   We're going to write to the Windows metal
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.360]   the way that it should be written
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:49.720]   and we're going to write everything native to the Mac
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:52.320]   and the performance they're getting when they do that,
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:57.320]   when they go to a fully native solution is just outrageous.
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:00.120]   You know, and the kind of performance
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.560]   that we're seeing out of the mini in the studio
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:06.840]   when we're doing tests is, I mean, astounding.
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:08.840]   Like the density of data that's coming out of it,
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:10.560]   I can't believe that I can do that
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:13.120]   on a $600 computer or, you know, $700 computer.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:18.120]   So you don't feel any drive to go M2 particularly?
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.080]   Well, I just think the M2 will be even better.
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:21.840]   Oh, we can call this company, do more.
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:24.720]   Okay, you know, I mean, like, I can probably get
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:27.840]   into density numbers about what we're seeing next week,
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:29.400]   next Tuesday.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.080]   There's a big video show in Europe
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.040]   that's, we'll talk about density numbers,
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:37.400]   but the numbers are astounding.
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:41.440]   And even with an M1, with a $700 computer,
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.880]   it's pretty amazing.
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:45.360]   And the prospect floating out there
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:49.040]   for the last two years of the high end Mac Mini,
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:52.000]   which is still technically an Intel Mac Mini,
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   being an M2 pro instead of an M2 is really big, right?
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.720]   Because that unlocks a lot of power
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:03.280]   that that base model doesn't.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:07.240]   And that's why that Intel Mac Mini is still sitting there.
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:09.960]   Yeah, I mean, for the big thing at the studio
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:12.120]   is that I don't have the ultra,
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.640]   but the big thing is having those chips,
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:17.200]   the dedicated pro res trips, the dedicated H.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:17.800]   Right.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:18.800]   Chips.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:21.840]   That even the M2 base will have, yeah, yeah.
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:24.320]   Yeah, those dedicated processors
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:26.120]   just make such a massive difference
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:29.000]   in just taking a workload off of it
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.080]   and allowing to do some incredible work.
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:34.400]   I mean, it's, and I don't, right now,
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.280]   I think that from the tests that I've been doing
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:39.920]   with the M1, we can't even find a PC
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:43.360]   at the same price point that's going to go anywhere close to it.
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:47.080]   You know, like as far as just sheer AV performance, you know?
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.560]   And so when people say, well, we're writing for both the Mac
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.080]   and the PC for how long?
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:52.360]   Like, for how long?
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.280]   You know, like, because it's, because I don't understand,
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:56.720]   I don't think that, I mean, it's dedicated chipsets,
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.920]   dedicated hardware, dedicated, you know,
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:00.720]   to make a run through this.
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:03.760]   Don't they envision GPUs?
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:06.080]   Yeah, no, I'm saying you can definitely build a PC
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.440]   that's super high performance.
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.920]   It's just that it's like--
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:13.760]   They still should invest anything Apple's doing, right?
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:14.800]   Well, when the Pro comes out,
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:17.760]   I think it's going to be pretty complicated in that area.
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:19.240]   The problem is, is that what I'm saying is,
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:21.680]   is that for like a, you could build,
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:23.320]   you could do an awful lot of production work
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.720]   on a Mac mini right now,
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:26.200]   and you can definitely, I have a studio
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:27.520]   sitting right here in front of me,
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:30.000]   and it's all I need for what I'm doing.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.080]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:32.760]   And I do a lot.
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.520]   Is that because it's dedicated playback,
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:37.560]   the dedicated playback circuitry?
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:40.280]   Well, it's playback, it's processing.
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:43.000]   There's so much in the OS that's already built to do,
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.760]   you know, to do the audio for you.
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:45.760]   But it has--
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:50.760]   So it has specific silicon dedicated video, right?
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:52.440]   Is that the difference?
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:53.760]   Oh, it's part of it, yeah.
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:54.600]   Absolutely.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.840]   And the fact that the GPU and the CPU are working together,
[01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:59.920]   you know, they're not unified memory also.
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.520]   You have to figure out, yeah, and they're able to just scale up.
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:03.520]   And they all die.
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:05.680]   And it's really--
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.200]   you know, they've really pulled away.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:10.280]   And again, in some places, I think that there's definitely--
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:12.440]   I mean, there are things that I want to do,
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:14.160]   where we do really complicated things,
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:18.200]   where we've got, you know, four NVIDIA top of the end,
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.480]   like $5,000 card.
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:22.080]   We got four of those in one PC.
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.400]   I can't do that kind of work on the Mac yet.
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:27.640]   But, you know, it's pretty specialized in the image.
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:30.520]   You know, there's like 100 of those in the world.
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:33.320]   You know, like, you know, and so for what we do.
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.480]   And so the thing is that--
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:37.240]   and if I'm mining, you know, no one's
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:40.600]   found that the M1 is great for Bitcoin mining or Ethereum
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:41.840]   mining.
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:43.120]   But they just haven't--
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:47.080]   I think that they just haven't written to the chipset yet.
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:48.800]   OK, I don't know how we got talking about the Mac.
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:51.160]   Oh, I guess because we're just wondering.
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:52.360]   October.
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:53.360]   So--
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.960]   How much money do we still have to have left in October?
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:56.960]   Ah, that's it.
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:57.960]   Whatever we did.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:59.280]   It's a budget calculation, of course.
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:02.200]   That's the big problem is that when I look at the pro,
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.960]   I go, I just don't know if I can afford the pro.
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:06.360]   Like, that's my big problem is I don't like--
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.520]   I don't know if I'll be able to afford what I want to buy.
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:09.720]   I probably shouldn't do this.
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:11.640]   But how much do you think you're going to spend tomorrow?
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:13.960]   Or not tomorrow, Friday?
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:15.920]   I'm going to guess 2020--
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:16.440]   What?
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.960]   --I can think of what I said aside.
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.080]   I said, well, my last one costs $2,000.
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.680]   Like, this one's $2,000 phone, which
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:25.240]   is why it sits in a case with a screen protector on it.
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:27.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:30.200]   This is the most pricey object in your collection.
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:32.400]   My current car is not worth this much money.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:36.160]   So anyway, it's not that I spend a lot of money.
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.600]   It's that I have priorities.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.680]   My phone is a way higher priority than my car.
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:44.680]   So anyway, this one was $2,000.
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:47.760]   I've set aside, saved up.
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.800]   I've literally been saving for a while.
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.880]   There's $2,500 that's just sitting there going,
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:53.640]   I'm not going to think about it under that.
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:54.720]   That's for the phone.
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:56.960]   Are you going to get a watch too?
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:57.600]   I don't know.
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:58.400]   We'll see.
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.520]   If it has enough performance things,
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:04.040]   I've only updated a couple times on the watch.
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:05.800]   So if it has something that--
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:07.080]   I have to admit, the body temperature
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:09.320]   kind of interests me more from a--
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:11.320]   That's the one new feature that everybody's saying.
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:12.200]   I'm curious.
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.760]   I'm just curious what it would show.
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:16.800]   And I do find some of the data I get back from the phone,
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:18.200]   enjoyable.
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:22.520]   But it would have to be maybe the body temperature thing
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:23.920]   might be enough, but probably not.
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:24.960]   And we have a lot of things.
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.440]   How about new AirPods?
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:28.480]   Supposedly, there's some rumor.
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:31.360]   We know that-- or we think that Google is going to start
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:36.360]   updating its Bluetooth LE to use this new codec.
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:38.080]   And there's a rumor that Apple might do the same
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.480]   with new AirPods.
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:41.480]   I have to admit, I don't use my AirPods very much.
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:42.400]   I don't like AirPods.
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:43.560]   I'm excited.
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:44.080]   OK, there we go.
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.080]   I'm an AirPods Pro guy.
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:46.520]   He's an AirPods Pro guy.
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:47.320]   I'll jump in there.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:49.920]   I am very excited about a new set,
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:53.840]   especially if there's potentially higher quality, right?
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:57.400]   The idea that there's going to be the higher quality streaming.
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:58.800]   I'm a lot less concerned about that.
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.680]   But the idea of new wireless protocols
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:03.840]   that allow better battery life, that sign me up for that.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:06.280]   Like, if you can extend the battery life of these things
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:10.960]   with a less energy intensive protocol talking to the iPhone,
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.640]   then I'm all down for that.
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:17.400]   So there's a filing in the Bluetooth SIG products
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:21.080]   database that seems to indicate Apple will
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:24.120]   boot doing 5.2 support.
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:29.400]   Perhaps an AirPods Pro with LE audio support.
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:31.080]   That would be kind of interesting.
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:33.480]   There aren't a lot of headphones that will do that.
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:36.400]   The big thing for me is that they can just get it to the phone
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:40.560]   that I'm holding that I had it paired to.
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.520]   I would really like it to stay paired.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:43.520]   Like, that's the biggest problem.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:44.000]   I know.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.680]   Honestly, that's the biggest part.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:48.240]   Like, literally, I don't need them to make the audio better.
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:49.280]   Yeah, another two smart.
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:51.800]   I want them to stop pairing.
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:53.760]   Like, just I have a lot of Apple devices.
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:54.720]   I have multiple phones.
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:55.520]   I've got an iPad.
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:56.960]   I've got a bunch of computers.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.880]   And I used to be like, I would just pick it up
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:09:59.880]   and it would work.
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:02.160]   You know, and that was amazing.
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:05.600]   Because even now with Bluetooth, with other Bluetooth headsets,
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:06.600]   I have a lot of headsets.
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:07.760]   But with other Bluetooth headsets,
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:09.800]   it's always like, OK, how am I going to get this to talk
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:11.520]   to this and everything else?
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:14.920]   And I get super frustrated by the fact that that's
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.320]   what stopped me from, you know, it kind of like broke the magic
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:19.040]   for me was the pairing.
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:21.840]   It was that it was constantly not pairing.
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.800]   Like, I couldn't figure out how to get it to pair to the only thing
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:25.320]   around it.
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:26.480]   I'd be on the car.
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:27.680]   Suddenly, it's like not pairing.
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:29.120]   And it's not showing up as something.
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:29.760]   Then I reset it.
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.920]   And it says, there's headphones here, but they're not yours.
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:32.760]   I don't know what drives me.
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:33.680]   That's great.
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:37.720]   So that's the more than anything around audio quality.
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:42.640]   It's just, let me choose which one I-- let me build a hierarchy
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:44.560]   of what I wanted to pair to.
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:45.680]   And then have it go through that.
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:48.000]   And if I'm holding the one at the top of the hierarchy,
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.480]   ignore everything else and just talk to that one.
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.440]   Like, especially if I'm in a phone call, it'd be really nice
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:53.880]   if you didn't just go somewhere else.
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:55.360]   You know, that would be great.
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.880]   The idea that you could have Bluetooth headphones that are
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:59.760]   connected to multiple devices at once
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.400]   and then can arbitrate between them--
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:03.360]   Seems like a good idea at the time.
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:07.440]   Well, no, but this is the rumor is that one of the features
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:09.720]   of this new radio is going to be--
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:13.040]   and this new protocol is that the headphones can be connected
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.040]   to multiple devices.
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.360]   That would solve it.
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:17.920]   And then decide which one it wants to listen to
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:22.080]   or by activity on a device, it would play into that device.
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:24.400]   And if that's true, that will dramatically
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.840]   improve the life of anybody who uses AirPods.
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:29.480]   Because it kills me when--
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:31.840]   it doesn't-- I'm listing on my Apple watch
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.320]   and it wants to talk to my iPhone or I'm
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:35.600]   listing on my iPad and it wants to talk to my iPhone.
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.240]   So that one-- Mark Gurman mentioned in his newsletter
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:39.000]   as a possibility.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.840]   And it's like, now, that's the kind of feature
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:42.320]   where we look back in five years and say,
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:47.040]   I cannot believe we survived having to connect our headphones
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:49.040]   to one device at a time.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.680]   Is that part would be the new H chip?
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:54.520]   There is a rumor new generation H-- what is it?
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:57.560]   The H3 this time in the AirPods.
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:59.480]   Maybe that would be one of the features of it.
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:01.920]   This is the chip that Apple made because they thought Bluetooth
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:06.320]   sucked and they could do a better job.
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:06.840]   Beep.
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:07.960]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:09.360]   Yeah.
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.120]   I hope so.
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:11.600]   I don't know whether it's that or whether it's actually
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.880]   part of the new Bluetooth spec or not.
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:15.800]   But it would not surprise me if that was definitely
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:16.720]   a feature where Apple--
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:17.880]   I like that.
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:20.920]   Apple knows how bad that user interface is, right?
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:24.280]   Where is my device or your Mac says,
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:25.840]   I'd like to take over your AirPods now.
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.680]   And it's like, no, don't do it.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:28.560]   So they know it.
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.160]   But how do you implement that?
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:31.880]   And is there a way to do that in the standard
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:33.680]   that they're going to come up with?
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:35.520]   There's a new Bluetooth standard that'll let them do it.
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.360]   Or do they do their own little secret sauce
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:38.800]   where they're doing their other thing?
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.080]   But they've got to know that that's
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.400]   a huge pain point for those devices.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:45.240]   They absolutely need to fix that.
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:48.960]   If I had to choose between a defect that causes something
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:52.960]   to not work flat out or something to almost work,
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:55.360]   I will take it not working every single time.
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:13:00.280]   Nothing gets me into a state of anti-tech rage.
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:04.320]   When I find myself shouting at a Bluetooth thing, do nothing.
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:07.360]   All I'm asking you to do is don't make any choices.
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:12.240]   Just whatever I tell you to do, do that thing and don't change it.
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:15.400]   And that's, oh boy, that's what turns like a phone
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:20.080]   into a projectile and a hole in my wall really quickly.
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.360]   Will there be one more thing?
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:24.680]   I think they're done with one more thing.
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:26.200]   I don't think they do that anymore.
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:26.560]   OK.
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:29.960]   I think the one more thing would be if they add in the VR
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:32.160]   headset at some point and they have that as--
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:33.480]   Will they mention it?
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.160]   But I don't think it's going to happen anytime soon.
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:36.280]   I think the only time you--
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:39.200]   I think every year we know at WWDC, this is the year,
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:40.360]   is not the year.
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:45.160]   But I don't think that the time to show an AR headset
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:46.960]   is going to be at WWDC.
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:47.960]   Like it is.
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:49.840]   That's the place because you want to say, hey,
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:53.280]   and now we're releasing a developer version for $3,000
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:56.080]   or whatever and let everyone spend the summer playing with it.
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:56.840]   That's when we'll see--
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:59.600]   RealityOS and people can develop for it.
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:00.120]   Exactly.
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:03.480]   Because you want to give the developers to launch.
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:05.480]   You want to give the developers time.
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.240]   You want to make sure that you've got great products now.
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:09.680]   They probably give a lot of people some time.
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:12.040]   My counter to that would be the Apple Watch launch, right?
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:14.320]   Where they did that standalone and they gave--
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:16.120]   and because it was a brand new product, they said,
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.320]   in September isn't this great.
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.240]   See you in April when we launched this thing.
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:21.960]   And the developers had that amount of time.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:23.840]   And I think that's more likely.
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:25.680]   You look at German's reports.
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:28.280]   He feels very strongly and a bunch of other reports
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:31.000]   kind of say that it's probably an early next year thing.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.360]   But I think that's it, Alex, which
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:34.280]   is they'll announce it maybe early next year.
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:36.120]   But I don't think it's going to ship early next year.
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:38.200]   I think it's going to ship months later,
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:40.080]   where if there's not a developer conference,
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:42.200]   at least they're going to be months where developers are
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:44.360]   going to be able to look at RealityOS.
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:46.240]   And depending on how they build it,
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:49.800]   maybe even attach an existing commercial headset
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:53.520]   to a Mac to do some debugging and stuff.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:55.880]   But that seems like a more likely scenario to make.
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:56.920]   I think it's going to follow that.
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:01.520]   I think it's going to follow the same path as previous times
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:03.040]   where they've come out of the gate with a device
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.120]   and never made before.
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:05.240]   One of the things that affects it
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:08.960]   is that they have to do an FCC public filing at some point.
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:10.600]   And that's going to happen way before they're
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:13.440]   ready to start marketing it or start platforming it at all.
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:15.640]   So I think that we're going to see something similar to that.
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:18.640]   In January, there'll be an announcement in which they will
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.520]   show it off and that will be concurrent with when
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:21.960]   they do the FCC filing.
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:25.560]   And then that will also be when they start laying months'
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:26.840]   worth of groundwork on.
[01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:28.480]   Here is what to expect from this.
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:31.120]   Don't expect more from this or something else from this
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:33.440]   than what we're actually telling you to do.
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:34.480]   And that's also the time when they'll
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:36.240]   start seeding a couple of developers
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:40.600]   so that when they do launch a developer edition at WDC
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:43.320]   conceivably, they won't just simply say, well, here it is.
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:44.160]   Ain't it a beaut?
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:46.440]   And we've got straps in different colors.
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.920]   They'll be able to say, and we're very, very pleased
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:51.440]   with our friends at Blah, Blah, Blah, who
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.480]   have something to show us on what they can do with gaming
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:55.360]   or what they can do with architecture with it.
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:57.560]   And hopefully something better than what they did
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:59.880]   at the watch launch of, hey, look, I can actually
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:02.000]   open and close my garage for my watch.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.520]   And actually shouldn't see video from it.
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:06.320]   But actually show you here is why we needed to make this.
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:09.160]   Here is why we are emphatic and we know what we're doing.
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:11.120]   And this is something that is very, very
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:14.480]   Apple and important for us to make.
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:17.400]   Well, tomorrow's the day.
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:20.800]   Jason and Michael Sargent will be at the event tomorrow.
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:23.560]   I look forward to hearing reports from both of you.
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:26.960]   Chris will watch six colors.com for your file.
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:29.480]   Well, you're not going to live blog it.
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:30.360]   You're not going to live live live.
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.720]   I'll do some tweets so people can follow me and just know.
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:35.440]   And I'll do some commentary there while we go.
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:38.880]   And then after the event's over, shortly thereafter,
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:41.960]   I'm going to do a live stream of upgrade with Mike Hurley.
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:44.720]   We're all reporting from Cooper Tino.
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:46.200]   We'll do that live there.
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:49.040]   And then I'll be writing endlessly afterward
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.320]   for the rest of the year.
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:53.160]   Relay data frame for those reports.
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:56.000]   Can I remember very well the days when we would sit outside
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.520]   the event in one shows?
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:03.520]   Alex, what is office hours planning tomorrow?
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:05.000]   We're all getting together.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:10.040]   So we'll do what we basically do is in the morning,
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.200]   we'll talk about what we think is going to kind of like this show,
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.080]   except there'll be a whole bunch of us all talking about,
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:15.320]   like, what do we think is going to happen,
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:16.480]   and what we should be looking for.
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:20.440]   Now, we, for us, the event is because we do production.
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:22.800]   The event is about-- we'll spend as much time
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:25.040]   talking about how they're going to produce it.
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.920]   That would be fun, actually.
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:27.920]   I'd love to.
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:28.480]   It's way--
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.400]   Well, you tell us straight-- look at this here.
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:31.240]   Can you know what you're doing?
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:32.080]   Can I look at this?
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:32.600]   They're here.
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:33.960]   Oh, yeah, totally.
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:34.440]   So we--
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.680]   But I bet you Apple's 38 plus, right?
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:38.960]   I mean, they're going to be the best.
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:39.280]   Yeah.
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:41.160]   I mean, I feel like-- yeah, I think that--
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:45.040]   I do feel like peak keynote was last December.
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.800]   The last couple have gone--
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:49.160]   Was that the one where they went out in the--
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:50.160]   California?
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.160]   California.
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:53.200]   I really-- I thought that was going to be the new thing.
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:53.720]   And that--
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:54.240]   I did too.
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:55.080]   And they did too.
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:56.240]   And it feels like they're going backwards.
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:57.840]   It feels like they're going to get ready to go back
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:58.320]   to the stage.
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:17:59.280]   Was it too expensive to see--
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:01.720]   Do you think Luca Maestry said you can't do that anymore?
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:02.240]   No more.
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:04.160]   I don't think that-- especially for this,
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.560]   I don't think that money is really the issue.
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:08.920]   I think that the issue really is what--
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:09.720]   It detracts.
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:11.800]   Do they want to do it something on a stage?
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:13.880]   And getting people used to getting ready to do a stage?
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:14.920]   I think that--
[01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:17.400]   Oh, you think they want to go back to live?
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:21.560]   Well, I think that at this point, I have no idea.
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:23.080]   I'm not connected to that team now.
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:28.920]   But I think that there's probably at least intros.
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:30.840]   I think I don't know if they could ever go back to the live
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:33.520]   events that we saw in the past, because they're so slow.
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:35.000]   They're just so slow to watch.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:35.760]   And so painful.
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:37.640]   And they're so hard to do.
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:41.000]   I've worked on hundreds, maybe thousands of keynotes
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.560]   for different companies.
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:45.720]   And the amount of labor it goes into getting something right
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:49.720]   live, and then the amount of risk that you have to doing it
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:51.800]   is so high that I think everyone's kind of like,
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.560]   yeah, the videos are pretty nice.
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:57.080]   And so I think that being able to say, hey, we have this new
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:57.360]   thing.
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:59.040]   We're really excited for about a minute.
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.400]   Let's go to the video.
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:02.720]   And then you go to a video and everyone describes it,
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:05.360]   I think is a way better solution than--
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:08.840]   and to me, as a viewer, as a reviewer--
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:11.240]   I mean, and Jason can let us know, and Andy can let us know
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:13.000]   what this is like.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.680]   I want to touch the hardware.
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:17.440]   So I'm going to go there so that I can talk to people
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:19.200]   and look at the hardware and everything else.
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.040]   What they do on the stage is--
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:23.240]   when I used to do this, it kind of doesn't matter.
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:24.040]   It's an integral.
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.240]   Like, I don't care.
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:27.880]   Like, you know, and so the thing is they can do whatever
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:28.240]   they want.
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:30.520]   They could just play a video on the stage for an hour and a half
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:32.920]   and I'll watch it and I'll have some ideas of what that looks
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:35.440]   like, then I'm going to go out and work out--
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:37.600]   you know, actually touch the hardware and use it.
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:41.000]   It's a scant outline of the things you really want to know.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:41.520]   Yeah.
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:42.920]   And so questions you really want to ask,
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:45.200]   they're not going to say LC3 codec.
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:46.720]   Yeah, so I don't need them to--
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:48.440]   and the thing is, is that I think most of us
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:54.360]   know that a lot of times what's presented is not--
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:56.280]   sometimes it's not actually working code
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:59.040]   or it doesn't work that way for everybody.
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:00.440]   And so there's a whole lot--
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:03.560]   like for a long time, there was the cable that
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:05.320]   went into the phone so that you could see it,
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:07.040]   because there was no way to do that.
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:10.120]   It was like a thing that only worked on the stage.
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:12.720]   So those are all kinds of things that--
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:17.440]   so it's not-- the stage event is not really real anyway.
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:20.400]   And it was made popular because Steve was so good at it.
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:22.240]   So it became-- like Keynote's became a thing.
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:24.120]   There was a time when Keynote's weren't that big of a deal.
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.720]   You know, like Steve really made it--
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:26.720]   put the turn on the mat.
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:27.720]   --that put it on the mat.
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:28.360]   But no one's--
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:29.680]   And you don't have one at Apple.
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:30.520]   Yeah.
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:31.280]   No one's Steve.
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:32.280]   Like there's people that are close.
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:34.840]   I think Steve probably liked the High Wire Act,
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:38.560]   liked the idea that it could crash and fail.
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:41.880]   I think so, but also that was an era where we weren't streaming
[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:42.480]   it live.
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:45.400]   And so then the show really--
[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:47.160]   then it was more like a theater presentation.
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:49.240]   And we were the theater critics or whatever.
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:51.480]   They were literally doing it for us
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:54.520]   so that we could then go report and disseminate that out
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:55.360]   to everybody.
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:58.920]   And that changed a long time ago now, where everybody sees it.
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:01.680]   So making it an infomercial and realizing
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:04.200]   that 99.99%--
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:07.440]   lots of nines-- of the people who are paying attention
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:09.120]   to that thing are not in that audience.
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:11.800]   And that all we're really there for is the other thing,
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.720]   which is to see it ourselves.
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:15.480]   And keeping them separate, I think,
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:17.240]   is perfectly reasonable.
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:17.560]   Yeah.
[01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:18.560]   Why did they change that?
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:19.760]   Why did they start streaming it?
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:21.760]   Was that after Steve?
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:22.320]   No, no.
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:23.960]   Were they streaming some of Steve's too?
[01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:24.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:27.120]   I think because some people walked in with their laptops
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:28.000]   and started streaming.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.080]   I don't know who that was.
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:31.880]   I was a rebel without a car.
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:32.960]   That was--
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:34.120]   And the live blogs and all that.
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:37.720]   I mean, that became the issue where they didn't want to do it
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:38.080]   live.
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.760]   They wanted the reports afterward.
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:42.040]   The world insisted that it be live.
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:43.640]   And Apple said, well, if it's going to be live,
[01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:46.280]   it's going to be our version of reality, not yours.
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:46.720]   Right.
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:48.040]   And here we are.
[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:49.000]   I think-- yeah, because I think there
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.640]   was a concern for a long time that--
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:53.920]   I mean, a lot of companies were concerned with keynotes
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:56.800]   that if we stream it live, it means the press won't come.
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:57.960]   They won't cover it.
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:58.480]   They won't.
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:00.360]   Because the news is already out, right?
[01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:01.760]   So there's a lot of different companies that
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:02.320]   had this concern.
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.200]   Apple doesn't have Apple's problem.
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:05.280]   But they don't have it now.
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:08.280]   But there was a time when Apple wasn't as popular
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:11.640]   and not everyone was trying to pay attention to everything
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:12.800]   that they said.
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:14.120]   But yeah, we're past that now.
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:17.160]   And the thing is that I think that the real value, again,
[01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:21.160]   for reviewers is typically the time after the keynote.
[01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:21.680]   For sure.
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:23.080]   There's why they're there.
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:24.840]   It's why they came in.
[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:27.760]   And so whatever you do on there-- and I think that, again,
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:30.200]   as a viewer, I just want it to be a great show.
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:33.240]   I don't need it to go slow.
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:36.120]   I think-- there's a whole bunch of interstitials in there
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:38.800]   where they talk about, I don't know, finances and great things.
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:40.160]   Oh, yeah, I think there's about that.
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:40.840]   All kinds of other stuff.
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:42.040]   And that's just the time for us to take notes
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:43.040]   and talk about things that we're going to be doing.
[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:44.040]   Right, pause.
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:46.840]   I think you nailed it, Jason, when you said it's a difference
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:49.920]   between a theater performance and a movie.
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:52.320]   And there is something to be said for a theater performance,
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:55.320]   but it's a very small, special audience.
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:57.400]   And Apple's a much bigger company
[01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:00.000]   and has a much larger audience.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.560]   I think that's especially appropriate because I
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:06.240]   think that over the years, Apple has desired
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:09.720]   and achieved the goal of making this communication
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:11.640]   a lot more one way than it once was.
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:12.640]   Yep.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:15.040]   That it's not as though they would say--
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.520]   it's not as though at the old hands-on area, they would say,
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:20.800]   oh, by the way, here are some engineers who worked on XYZ.
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:22.640]   They will answer any question that you want.
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:24.240]   And if you ask them a question, they can't answer.
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:25.280]   They will get back to you.
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:26.520]   It's not that it was that intense,
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.360]   but you could find the people who could answer questions
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:29.720]   that are off-script.
[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:33.120]   Nowadays, I think the value of being there in person
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:35.400]   is a lot less at an Apple event than it used to be,
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:38.560]   because they really want that to be a one-way communication
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.240]   where we are telling you what we want to tell you.
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:41.160]   They set the agenda.
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:44.680]   We're telling you what we want you to tell other people.
[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:49.360]   And it really is on you to have those contacts of people
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:51.480]   who are probably not supposed to talk to you,
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:54.360]   but certainly will answer text message.
[01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:56.880]   Or excuse me, not text message, but they will talk to you
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:24:01.000]   via signal if you phrase it in the right way
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.960]   and you've been a good person in the past.
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:04.360]   And that's something that people absolutely
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:07.200]   need to be aware of as they're seeing the flood of videos that
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:09.600]   are going to be coming on in the week's path
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:11.920]   that come.
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:15.280]   The only thing they can't control is our reaction
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:17.040]   to the physical product.
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:20.200]   And I mean, they can control it by keeping it out of our hands,
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:23.480]   but that is not a place that they seem willing to go, right?
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:26.280]   Like, so in the end, tomorrow I will hold an iPhone in my hand
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:27.560]   and I will be able to talk about it.
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:29.760]   But you're right, the people are more on-script
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:30.600]   than they used to be.
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:34.680]   And let's leaving aside the fact that there was a time when
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:37.640]   some of these product launches, they took questions
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:39.320]   afterward from the audience.
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:42.280]   Like, Steve Jobs would answer questions about what he had just
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:43.040]   announced.
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:44.640]   And that's long gone, but you're right.
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:46.120]   They're more on-script, they're more disciplined.
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:48.320]   That means there's less for us to glean about it.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:51.520]   But in the end, at the very least,
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:55.200]   you get to look at the product with your own eyes instead
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:58.520]   of their photography and hold it in your own hands.
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:24:59.960]   And that has some value.
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:01.360]   But it is--
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:04.080]   You've got to fight against the narrative setting
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:06.000]   that Apple is going to do because that's their PR mark.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.080]   After Mark has Brownlee noted the fingerprints
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:11.840]   on the Midnight Blue M2 last time,
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:15.880]   I wonder if they're rethinking letting you hold it in their hand.
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:19.520]   I don't think so, but remember, everybody, every employee
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:23.200]   is equipped with at least one cloth and probably a little
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:25.120]   spritzer as well, a little spray bottle.
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.040]   It's for COVID.
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:27.040]   It's a COVID.
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:29.360]   And they were doing that before COVID.
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:33.000]   They don't want your monkey hands to mess up
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.960]   their beautiful gorilla glass if you get my hand.
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:37.000]   I think they really should have used COVID
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.280]   as an excuse not to touch the devices.
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:42.280]   They missed an opportunity there.
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:44.200]   Yeah, but they know the value of the hands-on, right?
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:44.720]   Like--
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:46.480]   Yeah, it's a tension between getting--
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:48.320]   You got to hold it in your hand, right?
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:49.160]   Yeah, right.
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:49.680]   You got to have to.
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:51.400]   Which tomorrow has to say, I'm standing next to you.
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:52.160]   Yeah, I'm holding it.
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:52.320]   Yeah.
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:54.680]   I've got my exclusive hands-on review.
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:55.680]   First hands-on review.
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:57.000]   It's pretty really hard work, right?
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.360]   Because the truth is, if the hands-on didn't have value,
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:01.680]   they wouldn't need to go back to an in-person event.
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:04.160]   Because we did that for two years with the pandemic,
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.720]   with Zoom, and they would brief you on Zoom.
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:08.560]   And then a FedEx box would show up at your door
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:11.240]   with a product in it, and then you would write your review.
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:12.720]   And that was fine.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:15.080]   But they obviously see value in the launch
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:17.880]   having hands-on experience with the people who work up.
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:18.440]   They want the buzz.
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:21.080]   The single-day buzz that happens on this one day,
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:25.080]   this annual event, the Apple holiday is tomorrow.
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:27.160]   Andy, you're going to join me tomorrow?
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:27.680]   Absolutely.
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:30.360]   10 AM Pacific, 1 PM Eastern times 17 on your UCC.
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:31.240]   Yeah, but the Krakenoon.
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:31.840]   That's how much I mean.
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:36.040]   The Krakenoon live.twit.tv.
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:38.120]   I will reassure you some people were concerned
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:40.600]   that my offhand comment that maybe Paul Thorett
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:44.680]   should also be here to give the anti-Apple point of view.
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:47.200]   He is declined.
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:49.240]   He does not want to be that guy.
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:50.360]   He'll tweet it.
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:53.120]   He just doesn't want to have a target on his back.
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:55.640]   So Andy, it's going to be up to you
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:58.480]   to give the contrary in point of view.
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:26:59.480]   Excellent.
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:01.960]   I'll switch from clear liquor to amber liquor,
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:04.120]   just to make sure that I'm on point.
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:06.880]   We do that because otherwise it's just a damn commercial.
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:08.120]   And you can watch the commercial.
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:09.640]   If all you want is the commercial,
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:10.560]   please be our guest.
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:14.120]   Watch the live Apple event, you know,
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:17.080]   and absorb it undiluted.
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:19.680]   However, if you'd like a little bit of ice
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:22.520]   along with your brown liquor and the anti-licker.
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:25.560]   And we fill it all with like, did you see that camera move?
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:26.560]   I know, I look like that.
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:29.840]   I think I'm like, am I going to have two monitors open for this?
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:30.440]   I really think--
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:31.320]   Yeah, it really looks like--
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:32.760]   Would it be inception if instead of watching
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:33.800]   the Apple stream we watched you--
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:36.120]   Oh, you guys don't do the Apple stream though.
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:37.240]   So we don't have the--
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:39.080]   We don't have the Apple stream with it.
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:41.600]   Because what we do is it's designed
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:45.400]   so that you can listen to it and not hear it back.
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:48.920]   So you could watch the full quality version at the same time
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:49.440]   that you're listening to.
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:50.400]   That's smart, Jen.
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:50.960]   It's a second.
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:52.320]   Someday we may have to do that.
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:55.920]   Apple does prevent us from doing it on YouTube.
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:59.200]   So if you're a live viewer and you watch on YouTube,
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:01.080]   you will be seeing a rerun at that time.
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:03.040]   Don't be flummoxed.
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:05.400]   Just attempt to find it elsewhere.
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:10.600]   And I think Pirate Bay will be the place to look.
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:11.520]   Pirate Bay Theatre.
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:12.440]   Pirate Bay Theatre.
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:16.720]   And we will have extensive commentary in a week
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:21.240]   when if you were going to receive a review unit
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:26.600]   and if that review unit would have an embargo on the editorial,
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:30.480]   when would that typically be in years past?
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:33.280]   Did I phrase that diplomatically enough?
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:36.320]   I think the Abargos tend to be Wednesday, Thursday
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:37.440]   of the following week.
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:40.760]   So we want to have your unembargos thoughts.
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:43.520]   I don't traditionally get the iPhone day in date.
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:45.880]   I tend to get at the day the embargo drops
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:47.600]   as part of the second wave.
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:50.000]   But if I did have one, I couldn't talk about it.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.960]   But I don't expect to get one.
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:54.440]   I don't expect that I'll have that.
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:56.840]   I'll be in the dark with-- I will have touched it.
[01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:59.880]   And I'll return back with all of my touch observations next week.
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:00.920]   Perfect.
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:05.360]   And I think I will endeavor to have one a week from Friday,
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:06.880]   which I think is when they'll be arriving.
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:08.160]   Andy, are you buying this year?
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:09.320]   Are you staying back?
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:10.080]   I'm not buying this year.
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:11.560]   Not buying this year.
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:14.440]   I will say that I might be buying an iPhone next year.
[01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:15.520]   That's depending on what's going on.
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:17.960]   Very exciting.
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:19.720]   We will watch with interest.
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:23.360]   Well, switching platform would be a big deal.
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:27.640]   The OTB bookies are preparing their odds.
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:28.920]   Yeah, it would be a big deal.
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:29.440]   It would be a big deal.
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:31.560]   I'll be tapping on the order button.
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:32.800]   Yeah, me too.
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:33.240]   Me too.
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:38.040]   I'll be up 5 AM on Friday and ordering for myself.
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:43.160]   For my wife, probably Micah.
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:44.680]   No, John, you don't get one.
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:48.240]   But you might get a hand me down.
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:50.080]   He's cheering.
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:53.000]   Speaking of John, you know we have the best staff in the world.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.760]   And you guys all deserve huge credit.
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:56.480]   John Ashley is running the board.
[01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:59.440]   John Sladina took a break from his concert tour.
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:03.000]   All this month, John will be going to live shows from--
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.640]   I'm freezing again, Roger Waters.
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:08.440]   Who did you see last?
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:09.520]   Was it Roger?
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:10.440]   I'm freeze.
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:12.320]   When's the first Roger concert?
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:12.800]   Saturday.
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:14.120]   Saturday, OK.
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:15.280]   And then we're all going.
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:18.240]   The staff's all going on the 23rd.
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:21.440]   How many Roger Waters concerts again are you going to see?
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:23.080]   Eight.
[01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:26.360]   He's a glutton for Floyd.
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:28.000]   But why did I say that?
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.880]   Oh, because we love our staff.
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:35.520]   And when it comes time, sadly, to say goodbye to someone,
[01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:41.880]   we've just recently lost Ashley in our Cottonaway Department.
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:44.520]   Where do we go to hire the replacement?
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:46.840]   Immediately, we go to Zip Recruiter.
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:49.160]   Mac, break weekly brought to you by today.
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:53.880]   Zip Recruiter, it is what we use to hire.
[01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:57.480]   Because Lisa and the managers of the departments that
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:59.280]   are doing the hiring are very, very busy.
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:02.760]   We are a small staff working very hard.
[01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:06.320]   And they don't have a lot of time to assess
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:10.120]   hundreds of applicants and go through a lot of resumes,
[01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:11.280]   answer a lot of phone calls.
[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:12.720]   That's why Zip Recruiter is great.
[01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:14.680]   Because you post on Zip Recruiter,
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:19.000]   reaches out to the largest possible number of people.
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.760]   They post it to a bunch of job sites.
[01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:24.400]   They think 100 plus job sites, social networks, and so forth.
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:28.000]   So you really are reaching out to everybody.
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.880]   But then it does something really remarkable.
[01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:32.200]   Really remarkable.
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:34.160]   It goes through its-- people go to Zip Recruiter
[01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:34.760]   to get a job.
[01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:36.480]   So they have hundreds of thousands.
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:39.160]   I think I'm more than a million current resumes.
[01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:42.400]   They use their technology to match the candidates
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:44.720]   in their database with your job.
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:48.280]   And then they say, hey, we've got 20 people here who
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:49.840]   might be a right for the job.
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:52.880]   So you review them and invite your top choices to apply.
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:54.240]   And that really works for us.
[01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:56.880]   Welcome, Viva, who replaced Ashley.
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:58.960]   We found her on Zip Recruiter.
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:00.400]   And it's worked wonderfully.
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:02.880]   Four out of five employers who post on Zip Recruiter
[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:05.560]   get a quality candidate within the first day.
[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:07.600]   Did John Ashley, did we use Zip Recruiter?
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:11.440]   Or did we get you-- I think we knew you from Pixelcore.
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:14.520]   But Benito came from Zip Recruiter, I believe.
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:16.720]   So it's really a great way to hire.
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:18.840]   We get the best possible candidates.
[01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:22.480]   Look, I know hiring is challenging.
[01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:23.520]   Couldn't be harder.
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:25.760]   Because those people are the most important part
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:27.760]   of your company, the people who make it happen.
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:30.000]   But there is one place where finding qualified candidates
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:30.480]   is easy.
[01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:31.800]   And that's Zip Recruiter.
[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:34.960]   Zip Recruiter.com/Macbreak.
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:37.400]   They're the number one rated hiring site based on G2
[01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:42.880]   satisfaction ratings as of January 1, 2022.
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:44.800]   Unless we know somebody ahead of time,
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:47.360]   like we did with you, John Ashley,
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:49.200]   or unless you moved next door to us,
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:53.000]   like you did John Slonina many years ago.
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.760]   John made sure we knew about him.
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:57.280]   But everybody else--
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:58.080]   It's Zip Recruiter.
[01:32:58.080 --> 01:32:59.320]   Try Zip Recruiter for free.
[01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:04.000]   ZipRecruiter.com/Macbreak.
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:08.560]   ZipRecruiter.com/MacB-R-E-A-K.
[01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:11.920]   Zip Recruiter, the smartest way to hire.
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:15.000]   And we could say that with absolute confidence,
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.400]   because that's exactly what we do.
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:17.480]   That's the only way we hire.
[01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:26.720]   There are other related stories to this event tomorrow.
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:28.280]   I think, though, we've pretty much
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:34.120]   covered everything that might be coming up.
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:34.760]   Yeah.
[01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:36.680]   Phone AirPods, watch.
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:37.680]   That's it.
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:41.280]   Maybe some new services, particularly new services,
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:42.480]   related to the watch for fitness.
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:43.400]   But everything we do.
[01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:45.880]   Fitness, right.
[01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:47.880]   Do you think they'll add to Fitness Plus,
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:50.600]   or they'll have something else?
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:52.360]   They always add a little to Fitness Plus.
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:55.360]   Now we've got Poca dancing.
[01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:56.320]   Go, right.
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:56.960]   Yeah.
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:57.840]   That kind of thing.
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:33:59.400]   And the new exercise is a new sport,
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:00.480]   so they can track with a watch.
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:01.320]   That's something that they'll--
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:03.000]   I track my dancing when I dance.
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.360]   Like when we go to Monley Crew tomorrow--
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:07.400]   I track my curling.
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:08.680]   Do you curl?
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:09.600]   Where do you find--
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:10.760]   Where do you curl?
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:12.640]   Bay Area Curling Club in Oakland, actually.
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:13.200]   Oh, nice.
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:13.680]   They have ice?
[01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:14.920]   People are in the Bay Area.
[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:16.240]   They got their own dedicated facility.
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:17.520]   It's the only one in Northern California.
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:18.800]   Come sign up for a learn to curl.
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:20.520]   If you're a sweeper, does the watch go,
[01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:22.200]   I think you're sweeping.
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:24.160]   Well, it's one curling workout, but the watch
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:26.240]   knows when you're sweeping because your blood--
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:29.920]   Or your heart rate shoots up because that is hard work
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:31.680]   to do the sweeping part.
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:32.440]   That is the hard work.
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:34.600]   That looks like that's exercise, boy.
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:35.240]   It's a lot of work.
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:38.720]   Not the thing where you kind of slowly take the stone
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:40.160]   and you go--
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:42.040]   Well, I mean, it's a 40 pound stone, Leo.
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:42.920]   It's heavy.
[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:43.440]   Oh, OK.
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:44.240]   It's real heavy.
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:46.000]   All right, I respect.
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.040]   I'm not going to--
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:47.720]   I'm not that the curling.
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:49.960]   Yeah, but the sweeping is the extra aerobic activity.
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:50.440]   But it's in there.
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:51.120]   There's a curling.
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:53.080]   There's a curling in Apple Watch, and I use it.
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:56.280]   And I close my rings on the days where I'm doing curling.
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:56.840]   Literally.
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:59.400]   We forget about Fitness Plus, but Fitness Plus
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:02.920]   is essentially an Apple Watch accessory, right?
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:03.400]   Right.
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:04.840]   So this would be the perfect time for them
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:05.880]   to talk about Fitness Plus.
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:07.920]   I love Fitness Plus because we have a home gym
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:10.400]   and I have a rowing machine, which is boring.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:11.880]   Usually I just watch Jeopardy.
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:14.240]   But with Fitness Plus, I can actually
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:17.040]   get a coach coaching me while I row, which makes a big difference
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:18.360]   in how hard I work.
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:19.080]   I must say.
[01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:22.280]   My emollate--
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:24.680]   The fitness videos doesn't really get my heart rate up that high.
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:25.080]   Yeah.
[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:26.360]   The fitness videos are just amazing.
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:26.800]   They're good.
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:27.960]   And the way they shoot them--
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:28.640]   Remember, I just eat them.
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:29.120]   It's great.
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:30.600]   Yeah, incredible.
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:31.400]   So good.
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:34.080]   Xcode cloud subscriptions now available for developers.
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:37.080]   They talked about this at WWDC, the idea
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:42.960]   that you can have full cloud-based builds,
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:46.440]   continuous integration, CI, and continuous delivery,
[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:49.320]   CD, CI/CD built into the Xcode app.
[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:50.600]   It's actually been around.
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:51.400]   You can use it.
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:53.280]   But now they have an official--
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:55.360]   it's been available since June, but they
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:56.640]   have an official plan now.
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:36:01.680]   25 compute hours free per month, then $15 a month,
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:04.200]   100 compute hours per month, 50--
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:07.120]   I imagine they're developers who--
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:10.400]   not my kind of developer who work in a home alone,
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:13.160]   but they're developers who would be very interested in this.
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:15.400]   Do a lot of Apple products use CI/CD?
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:19.080]   Or that seems like more of DevOps enterprise kind of thing.
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:21.040]   Yeah, but this is an interesting one
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:21.880]   we'll see the uptake.
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:23.480]   This has been a long time coming.
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:26.040]   This was a 2021 WWDC announcement.
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:26.640]   Oh, it was.
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:27.160]   Oh, wow.
[01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:31.680]   So it's been in beta for almost a year now, I think.
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:33.480]   And now they've gotten to this point.
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:35.840]   But I think they must feel that there's
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:37.880]   a particular niche for developers.
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:39.760]   And since to develop for Apple's platforms,
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:41.480]   you basically have to use their developer tools.
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:43.920]   I think they felt like they needed to provide this
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:47.640]   because they're the first party and only party
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:48.760]   for a lot of these tools.
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:50.440]   So if you want--
[01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:54.160]   this feels very much like some big development companies
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:55.800]   came to them and said, you have to offer this.
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:56.800]   We need this.
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:57.760]   Yeah.
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:36:58.160]   It does.
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:36:59.840]   It's for parity, absolutely.
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:02.760]   It's interesting because Microsoft, which, of course,
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:06.160]   is very much about developers, developers, developers,
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:08.280]   has been slowly moving to this.
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:10.480]   I think I'm not crazy about it, but it seems
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:14.600]   to be the way of the world developer as a service platform.
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:17.480]   They're selling services to developers, even VS code,
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:22.000]   which their free, ostensibly open source development IDE,
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.960]   is moving more towards the services platform,
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:26.480]   where you pay a monthly fee.
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:29.480]   And I think Microsoft's pushing very hard to make,
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:34.480]   at least enterprise-level, big, iron development,
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:36.800]   be a service that you pay monthly for.
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:41.880]   So it's not surprising that Apple is at least offering this.
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:44.720]   Do people like Thompson use stuff like this?
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:45.680]   Probably not.
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:49.000]   I mean, James Thompson's doing his own thing, right?
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:49.680]   He doesn't need to work.
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:53.760]   There's a lot of testing that needs to scale.
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:56.200]   There's a lot of testing that needs to scale.
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:58.520]   And so it helps to be able to throw it on a lot of things.
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:37:58.880]   Sure.
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:00.360]   And that's been a big problem.
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:01.960]   I mean, there's definitely some services out there,
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:03.760]   but it's been a big problem for Apple developers,
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:07.920]   because it's something you can spin up in AWS pretty quickly,
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:10.680]   with a PC instance, but not necessarily with a Mac instance.
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:12.080]   So I think it's--
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:15.360]   And you're stuck using Xcode to develop,
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:16.800]   although I guess you're not, because there are
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:20.000]   cross-platform tools, even from Microsoft.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000]   And there's Google.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.560]   But I think most people are going to use Xcode, right?
[01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:25.280]   Here's the problem is that, again, what
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:28.680]   I was talking about earlier, if you don't write
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:30.400]   to the--
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:33.480]   All the cross-platform stuff for Apple is a waste of time.
[01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:34.000]   Flutter.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.040]   I'm just going to say it like--
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:38.480]   You can do little electron apps that run horribly
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:41.680]   and take up a lot of memory and time and everything else.
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:43.360]   So you can write those little things for things
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:45.480]   like Discord or Slack or whatever,
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:47.200]   because they don't really have any--
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:48.600]   they don't need any performance.
[01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:51.480]   And I guess you don't notice that they're sucking up
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:54.160]   so much of your CPU.
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:57.880]   But if you're doing real applications that need to perform--
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:39:00.880]   so if you're really building audio and video apps
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:03.920]   or anything that really needs to use that processor,
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:07.000]   you're going to have to write-- you have to write to the Mac,
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.120]   like with the tools.
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:09.920]   And I think that's part of why they have to do this,
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:13.000]   is because none of this cross-platform stuff
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.280]   is going to work when you want to take
[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:16.560]   full advantage of the OS.
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:19.480]   And this is-- I mean, some of the advantages of this cloud
[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:21.200]   stuff here, it's in larger groups.
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:23.040]   You're going to be able to set different branches
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:26.120]   to have different build paths.
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:28.280]   You're going to be able to flow into test flight.
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:30.280]   So if you commit to certain branches,
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:33.400]   it will kick off a test flight for that version.
[01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:36.760]   They're really trying to integrate this at this level.
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:39.520]   But yes, I think it's going to be for--
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:41.920]   I don't know if it's even for huge work groups,
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:44.480]   like work groups, as opposed to indie developers who
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:45.320]   want to use this more.
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:47.360]   And the pricing is-- honestly, I mean,
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:50.040]   even for small developers, if they can get benefit out of it,
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:52.480]   the pricing starts pretty low, and then it scales.
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:58.800]   So it's kind of interesting, but we'll see--
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:00.560]   I mean, it hasn't taken the world by storm, right?
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:02.680]   Because they announced it in 2021,
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:05.040]   and it's still only now just kind of emerging from beta.
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:07.240]   So we'll see how it goes.
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:11.480]   Apple looks like they might be making cost to LFtheri U-hole.
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:13.160]   You may remember that name.
[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:16.840]   He's the developer who created, I think,
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:22.000]   a very popular Apple Watch keyboard called Flick Type.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:26.160]   Apple pulled it from the App Store,
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:28.200]   saying it offered a poor user experience,
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:32.520]   and then approved competing keyboard apps and others
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:37.840]   that used Flick Type in the App Store.
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:42.480]   This annoyed Costa, who then became the number one App Store
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:46.040]   complainant in a variety of areas,
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:49.080]   and finally sued them over App Store rejections, scams,
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:53.720]   and fraud, and apparently, according to TechCrunch,
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:56.840]   Apple-- because they saw some court filings--
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:00.280]   Apple has filed a request to dismiss the suit
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:07.080]   with the cooperation of LFtheri U. I don't know details
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:10.960]   about what the settlement might be,
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:12.680]   but I hope they have made him whole,
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:14.480]   and I hope Costa didn't settle.
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:16.480]   He's pretty prickly.
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:19.400]   So he's still criticizing on his Twitter feed,
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:21.280]   so whatever happened here, he was not--
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:22.600]   They didn't get him to shut up.
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:24.160]   They didn't get him to shut up, exactly right.
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:26.440]   But when TechCrunch asked him what the terms were,
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:28.120]   he said, unable to comment.
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:31.720]   That is, by the way, always the case when you settle a lawsuit.
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:35.200]   All you're allowed to say is, to the mutual satisfaction
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:42.640]   of both parties, so I'm hoping he got something that made him
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:43.560]   happy.
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:47.440]   He then, of course, he's been our source for a lot of App Store
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:50.520]   scams, and so I hope he--
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:52.200]   I guess he didn't shut him up in that regard,
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:53.320]   so I hope he keeps doing that.
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:54.240]   That's good.
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:55.440]   You can't, really, right?
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:58.400]   First Amendment, you can't say, oh, well,
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:00.720]   that's, I guess, Apple's not a government agency.
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:01.880]   But you--
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:03.320]   Unless you agree not to say anything.
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:04.240]   Right.
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:04.680]   You can--
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:08.120]   It's interesting that Apple didn't insist on that, so.
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:09.800]   Well, I mean, they wanted to settle, though, right?
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:11.680]   You've got to give to Captain.
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:14.840]   It may be that he said, this is where I draw the line, right?
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:16.560]   It's like a severance agreement or something like that,
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:19.560]   where they might have tried to do something non-disparagement.
[01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:21.520]   My guess is that it was limited to his case
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:23.320]   and not to the broader issues, which is probably
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:25.280]   what they agreed to.
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:27.320]   And as Tech Crunch points out, I mean,
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:29.000]   the Justice Department is rumored to be
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.280]   in the early stages of investigating or filing
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:33.160]   in any trust lawsuit.
[01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:35.680]   U has also been given them the stink eye,
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:40.200]   so maybe it's better for Apple just to get this off the table.
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:45.360]   A theory who could not yet say what, if anything, has changed.
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:47.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:49.880]   But he does say he's working on a project related
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:52.080]   to an iPhone keyboard.
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:53.880]   His amended complaint reference difficulties
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:55.400]   with building keyboard apps as Apple never
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:59.200]   made available at Developer API to request full access
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:01.360]   directly from the keyboard, which
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:04.360]   made it hard to do on the watch, of course.
[01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:07.000]   He also argued that Apple constrains third party keyboards
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.480]   and areas like available memory.
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:10.520]   The ability to gather data, to make better predictions,
[01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:11.960]   the ability to be used in password fields.
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:14.360]   I understand why Apple may be restricting that.
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:17.760]   We don't know if Apple gave on that.
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:20.720]   He did build a software tool to identify app store subscriptions,
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:22.120]   scams, and frauds.
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:24.160]   He says, it's still running.
[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:26.960]   Just the other day, I re-ran my scam finding tool,
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:30.440]   and was able to find several new scam apps within five minutes.
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:32.760]   If L if there you can find it within five minutes,
[01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:36.360]   you'd think Apple might-- why don't you give him that tool,
[01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:37.760]   Costa?
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:38.760]   So any--
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:39.840]   Yeah, this happened where there was
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:42.640]   an app called Aviary, which is a Twitter related app.
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:44.320]   Yeah, I use it.
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:46.160]   And they got rejected for an update
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:47.960]   because they mentioned Twitter.
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:51.720]   And that got a retweet from John Gruber, which, as Costa,
[01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:54.480]   will say, like, if you get a retweet from Gruber,
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:55.520]   they might solve your problem.
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:57.960]   But how many fail silently and are trapped?
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:43:59.000]   They have no way out.
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:04.520]   But Gruber's comment was, this is why Apple needs more Apple
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:08.280]   and app store infrastructure like an ombudsman or somebody
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:12.280]   who's like maybe straddles the line between inside and outside
[01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:15.560]   and can come to Apple and say, why is this happening?
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:16.560]   Something, right?
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:18.720]   Like, Apple could do more here is the bottom line, right?
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:19.720]   They could do more.
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:22.040]   It's amazing that this stuff still goes on,
[01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:26.040]   both the weird rejections and the acceptances of clear scam
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:26.760]   apps.
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:30.320]   And what I've always thought is the app store
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:32.480]   is so successful and makes so much money
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:34.920]   that anytime somebody says, we should change what we do
[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:37.680]   with the app store, somebody inside Apple says, why?
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:38.920]   We make lots of money.
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:40.040]   Let's just keep doing it.
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:42.560]   And what did John Madden say?
[01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:44.800]   Winning is a great deodorant.
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:46.360]   There's stuff that stinks at the app store,
[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:48.920]   but they make so much money that maybe they just don't care.
[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:52.080]   I use Shahab Maboub's Aviary.
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:53.560]   It's an excellent app for Twitter.
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:55.680]   Of course, it's a Twitter client.
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:58.920]   So in the title of the app, it mentions Twitter.
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:02.400]   Apple said, no, you can't have Twitter, a trademark term,
[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:05.040]   in the app subtitle.
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:06.760]   He says, that was unfair in its own right.
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:08.560]   As many apps do this, I removed it,
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:11.920]   but it's still getting rejected to which John Gruber tweets.
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:13.080]   And this was a couple of days ago.
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:15.440]   For the umpteenth time, I say, Apple
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:19.000]   needs an app store ombudsman, an advocate for developers
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.760]   like Shahab.
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:24.040]   They need to absolutely clean house on the app store.
[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:28.160]   How many years have we been talking about just
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:34.560]   and egregiously stupid choices, egregiously stupid bureaucracy?
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:38.080]   The developers who feel like they have to fight Apple
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:41.360]   to actually exist on their platform.
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:43.120]   How many years have we been doing that?
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:45.240]   And how many years are going to continue to do that
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:48.120]   before we acknowledge that this is--
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:49.080]   I agree with Jason.
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:51.480]   This is not a, oh gosh, our hands are tied.
[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:54.120]   Or, oh gosh, this is just so hard to do this at scale.
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:57.560]   It's, no, there is a certain minimum number of dams
[01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:00.360]   that Apple has to give before they fix this.
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:03.360]   Apple doesn't feel as though they have reached the minimum
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:05.720]   number of dams required to actually see this
[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:09.120]   as a real problem, which is not something that a policy
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:10.200]   is going to fix.
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:11.880]   Not even an ombudsman.
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:14.160]   It's going to be get someone from the outside who
[01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:17.400]   is not part of that culture who has the power to basically say,
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:21.920]   oh wow, are you people totally not doing this right?
[01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:25.680]   And now we're going to be having a year in which--
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:28.880]   the Steve Jobs, the Steve Jobs like Town Hall,
[01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:31.720]   like little meeting which 150 Apple employees are
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:34.520]   in the theater saying, you people should be ashamed of yourselves.
[01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:35.120]   What do you do?
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:36.320]   Justify yourself.
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:39.400]   To which developer David Bernard tweets,
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:41.920]   I searched for Twitter on the App Store.
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:43.440]   Ooh, look what I found.
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:45.680]   Kinky BDSM Kinky fetish.
[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:47.640]   Birdie for Twitter.
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:49.720]   For fans, search engine for fans only.
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:52.320]   This is what you find when you search for Twitter in Apple's
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:58.600]   App Store, two dots, sex actions, and truth social.
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:46:59.120]   So--
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:00.800]   And I go on and on.
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:01.800]   So I think there's--
[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:05.080]   A proud day for the App Store.
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:08.040]   Yeah, I will say, though, that every time we bring this up,
[01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:09.160]   I talk to other people, because I've
[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:13.280]   worked on a bunch of teams that build apps for the App Store.
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:16.520]   And we definitely take two weeks to--
[01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:18.400]   there's in the schedule, there's two weeks to get it
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:20.320]   into the App Store, because we know that, oh, we'll go in
[01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:21.400]   and Apple will kick it back.
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:23.240]   And then we'll fix something, and then we'll put it in.
[01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:24.880]   And then we'll go in.
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:26.640]   But it's in our schedule.
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:29.040]   There's two weeks that is the submission before.
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:30.640]   And then there's usually another two weeks before we talk
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:31.320]   about it.
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:35.200]   And these are big apps that we put together.
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:37.280]   And then I talk to people that I've developed for.
[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:39.240]   And I just have to say that there's definitely
[01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:43.080]   a vocal bunch of folks that are there that are talking about it.
[01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:45.720]   But just none of us see the drama that we're talking about here.
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:48.000]   So I'm not saying that it doesn't happen.
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:49.720]   I'm not saying that they can't do it better.
[01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:50.240]   Oh, but--
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:51.880]   I'm just saying that I've heard about it.
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:54.560]   If it happened to you, we would be hearing about it, right?
[01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:55.320]   So you've been lucky.
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:55.960]   Right.
[01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:57.320]   But I don't know if I'm lucky.
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:58.680]   I've been doing this on and off for 10 years.
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:00.640]   Maybe you're doing it better than they are somehow?
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:02.440]   Well, I'm just saying that we--
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:04.240]   a bunch of-- it's not just me, because I
[01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:05.560]   keep on asking a bunch of people that I've
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:07.600]   done development with, or that I know that are developers,
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:09.720]   and they're like, yeah, it's not a problem.
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:13.920]   And so they're like, we never had a problem submitting.
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:15.640]   We don't know what they're talking about.
[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:17.320]   There's definitely things that get kicked back,
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:19.000]   and then we just take them out or move them around.
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:22.000]   And then we put them back in, and then it's fine.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.480]   And so I just need to water this down just a little bit
[01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:29.200]   in the sense that it's kind of one of those things that I've
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:30.400]   heard that it happens.
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:32.200]   I've just never actually seen it.
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:34.680]   And so the thing is is that--
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:37.840]   and the thing-- people who start traveling
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:42.400]   find over-- I guess the way I kind of view it is that when
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:44.920]   people start to travel, it's very overwhelming to do all
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:46.200]   the things that you need to do, especially
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:47.640]   like if you have to go in and out of customs.
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:48.320]   You have to do all that.
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:50.080]   Like, gosh, this is really hard.
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:53.360]   And as frequent flyers, we're kind of like, yeah, sure.
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:54.840]   It's not that hard to do.
[01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:56.480]   It's just you just get used to all the little things
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:57.320]   you have to do.
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:59.080]   When people-- like another example is when people
[01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:01.240]   work with the union, the first time I did the union,
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:02.480]   I was like, this is crazy.
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:03.600]   This is not exist.
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:04.800]   Blah, blah, blah.
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:06.080]   After a while, I just got used to it.
[01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:08.400]   And we hire someone to manage it, and it just kind of gets
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:09.240]   done.
[01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:12.720]   And it works fine.
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:16.840]   And so the thing is that I just see it as--
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:19.440]   we forget that there is a--
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:22.120]   that they left an open door and let just about anybody
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:25.040]   submit an app to a platform.
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:28.320]   That's, in my opinion, a horrible idea.
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:29.640]   Like, it's a horrible idea.
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:31.560]   It'll just let Yahoo's all submit stuff.
[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:32.920]   And then they complain about the fact
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:34.760]   that they don't understand why it doesn't work well sure,
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:35.880]   but figure out how it works.
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:39.240]   But most people that I've worked with have just figured out,
[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:40.560]   I mean, the vast majority of the people.
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:43.040]   And these are people that build all kinds of different apps.
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:44.720]   Now, I admit they're mostly corporate apps
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:47.120]   where we have a team that works on the thing.
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:51.560]   And it works-- but it's--
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:53.400]   I'm always amazed that people just
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:55.720]   don't figure out the way the system works and then make it work.
[01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:56.600]   I think that's unfair.
[01:49:56.600 --> 01:49:58.440]   I think just because it hasn't happened to you.
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:49:59.400]   I think that's unfair.
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:00.720]   It's not just me.
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:02.360]   You're not-- those people are not
[01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:04.600]   running the kinds of apps that are triggering this.
[01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:07.040]   Look, enough people are saying it.
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:08.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:09.160]   Like Avery--
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:10.120]   Like Avery, stop writing Avery.
[01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:11.320]   And don't mention Twitter.
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:14.040]   And then, I mean, I think Alex, this is--
[01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:16.360]   what you're saying is purely anecdotal.
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:16.720]   Great.
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:17.920]   I'm glad you haven't had that problem.
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:19.000]   But people are having high--
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:20.000]   There's pretty high percentage that have said
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:21.160]   that they're really happy with it.
[01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:22.800]   Like we say, oh, well, there's 30%.
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:25.000]   There's 30% of people who aren't happy with the app store.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.280]   Well, if there were 30% of the United States that
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:29.600]   didn't like the way it was going, we wouldn't even listen to them.
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:31.840]   Like we'd be like, well, there's 70% that do.
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:32.360]   I'm sorry.
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:34.400]   So like, no, but really, like if you--
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:37.360]   the thing is is that 30% is not a big number.
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:37.800]   Like it just--
[01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:38.600]   By the way, and I will just--
[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:39.840]   It seems absurd.
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:41.920]   It wasn't-- it took me 12.
[01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:45.160]   When I search for Twitter, the top 12 results were related.
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:48.440]   Sort of, it took me 12 to get to sex actions, truth,
[01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:50.080]   social, and so forth.
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:55.640]   So it takes a little while to get down to those BBW dating.
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:58.040]   I don't know why those come up with Twitter, but if they do.
[01:50:58.040 --> 01:50:59.200]   Look, there's clearly problems.
[01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:01.560]   That's not anecdotal.
[01:51:01.560 --> 01:51:02.680]   There's clearly problems.
[01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:04.360]   And I agree with John Gruber.
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:07.600]   There should be somebody representing developers better
[01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:10.720]   than what's happening inside of Apple.
[01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:11.920]   I'm sorry that you can get better.
[01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:13.480]   Every system's not a problem.
[01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:14.800]   No, no, I didn't say it wasn't a problem.
[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:15.880]   Every system can get better.
[01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:17.560]   But as systems get this big, I mean,
[01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:19.800]   I've just worked in a lot of systems that are this large.
[01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:21.280]   It's almost impossible to fix all of it.
[01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:23.200]   And you pull one string and something else is the part.
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:24.040]   Well, Apple's going to-- I'm telling you, Apple's
[01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:28.680]   going to pay the price because the FTC, the DOJ,
[01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:30.240]   they're going to be paying the price.
[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:31.680]   And they're going to have to bend.
[01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:35.320]   I wish they'd bend without having to be sued.
[01:51:35.320 --> 01:51:37.360]   I don't think it'll be-- I mean, Apple will pay some price,
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:42.440]   but the people that are really going to-- the small developer
[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:44.400]   is going to pay the biggest price,
[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:47.280]   because what Apple will do is tighten everything up.
[01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:49.760]   And so right now, anybody can do it.
[01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:51.080]   And everyone's-- it's all there.
[01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:53.360]   But the thing is to respond to all of this.
[01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:55.680]   Apple's response to whatever happens with the government
[01:51:55.680 --> 01:51:59.160]   is going to negatively affect the small developer.
[01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:01.720]   And the developers are making $1 million or more.
[01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:03.440]   They have a lot of things that they can probably
[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:04.880]   get out of this and squeeze out of this
[01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:06.320]   and make it work and everything else.
[01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:08.480]   The small developer just wanted to make it work
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:11.000]   who is willing to just work inside of whatever's there.
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.160]   The vast majority of them out there, 98%.
[01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:17.160]   They will be negatively affected by how Apple responds
[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:18.240]   to what it's getting.
[01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:19.920]   You can't legislate all of this stuff.
[01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:22.680]   And Apple will just try to make it more streamlined for them.
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:24.840]   And it will negatively affect the small developer.
[01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:26.600]   That's why I keep on pushing it back,
[01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:29.440]   is because I am technically a small developer.
[01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:31.920]   And so I know that I will be negatively affected
[01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:34.160]   by the response that governments do.
[01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:36.120]   Apple's going to do something that's going to make it work.
[01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:38.880]   I don't have one Apple to do it so that they don't get forced
[01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:40.320]   to do it by government.
[01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:42.080]   Yeah, I mean, the threat of a response
[01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:45.360]   has so negatively affected them that they get
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:48.640]   to keep a larger percentage than they ever used to, right?
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:51.000]   Like the threat of response, I get what Alex is saying,
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:54.240]   which is often the actual government response
[01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:57.600]   leads to very weird distortions that aren't--
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:00.520]   Yeah, you get the cookie menu, right?
[01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:02.040]   Yeah, you don't want that.
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:04.240]   But you do want the pressure put on them to behave better.
[01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:06.760]   And I think what it comes down to is Alex said,
[01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:08.640]   at some scale, it becomes impossible.
[01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:09.800]   And I think that's the issue.
[01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:11.280]   I didn't think it's impossible.
[01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:13.720]   It makes it impossible to make everybody happy,
[01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:16.520]   like with all of these, whether it's YouTube or Facebook
[01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:20.040]   or Apple, the system is so big and so complex,
[01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:21.800]   it's like trying to change the weather.
[01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:22.800]   I get that it's--
[01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:24.360]   And so things is that you can make progress,
[01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:25.640]   you just can't fix it.
[01:53:25.640 --> 01:53:28.440]   I get that it's unwieldy, but this is the choice is,
[01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:31.440]   either Apple needs to take more steps to make it work better,
[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:34.600]   or because Apple has this exclusivity
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:36.600]   and it's the only way onto the platform,
[01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:39.520]   the other end result is that Apple is going to lose
[01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:43.760]   part of their business model because you can't have both.
[01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:46.000]   And I think--
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:49.120]   And I think John Gruber thinks, and I think Costa thinks,
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:52.480]   that Apple isn't doing everything they could.
[01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:54.080]   And that's the thing is I get it.
[01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:56.520]   I get what you're saying, Alex, but I don't believe
[01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:58.440]   that Apple is doing everything it could
[01:53:58.440 --> 01:54:00.360]   to prevent scams on the App Store
[01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:03.200]   and to prevent weird rejections like this.
[01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:05.200]   I think that they could spend more money
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:07.760]   out of the huge amount of money they make on the App Store
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:09.160]   in order to make these systems better.
[01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:10.480]   Would they be perfect?
[01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:12.760]   No, but then you try to build in a system
[01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:15.040]   to find the mistakes and correct them.
[01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:17.560]   But the problem is, if they don't do that
[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:19.800]   and they're the only path onto their platform,
[01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:21.440]   they're going to get regulated.
[01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:23.560]   So they have to choose, do I spend money
[01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:25.680]   to make this stuff go away?
[01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:27.640]   Or am I going to lose my exclusivity?
[01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:29.520]   Because the truth is that, yes,
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:32.640]   if Apple is no longer the exclusive path on
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:34.520]   because somebody's forced them not to be,
[01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:37.360]   I think the next step is that Apple does crank up
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:38.920]   all of the difficulty levels
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:41.200]   and makes it a much more curated store.
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:43.640]   And then the stories are going to be people complaining
[01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:45.360]   that they didn't get into the App Store.
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:47.200]   And that will hurt small developers.
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:51.240]   And I should point out, Apple is by far the best App Store
[01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:53.080]   out there if you compare it to Microsoft
[01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:54.760]   or the Google Play Store.
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:59.200]   Those stores are horrible, filled with junk scams,
[01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:02.800]   misrepresentations, and neither company seems
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:03.840]   to be able to do anything about it.
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:05.840]   So Apple is the best of the worst,
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:09.400]   but I think Apple maybe could do better.
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:10.240]   Why not?
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:11.720]   We're going to move on because it's 110 degrees
[01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:14.040]   in the shade and Jason's got nowhere
[01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:15.040]   to get into this garage.
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:17.440]   The shade is gone, Leo, it's gone.
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:19.400]   So we're going to move on.
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:22.320]   Real quickly, just a couple of big, quick stories,
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:24.840]   OWC, other world computing, just today
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:27.360]   announced that they've bought the Apple Trading Company
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:29.920]   interesting timing, sell your Mac.com.
[01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:33.680]   So I don't know how soon that can happen,
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:35.640]   but given that Apple's announcing a whole bunch
[01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:38.040]   of products tomorrow, that might have been a very,
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:39.840]   very good timing.
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:43.840]   Mac OS, according to a eclectic light company,
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:49.960]   which has been a very good source for inside Apple OS stuff,
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:54.520]   he has now observed that Apple is scanning pretty much
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:58.280]   all the time, whenever you're not doing something else,
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:01.400]   to find bad stuff, which is a good thing.
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:05.800]   In effect, it's turned Apple's protection
[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:07.320]   into an antivirus.
[01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:09.760]   That's how any viruses work.
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:11.440]   Yeah, so it's not just doing it on action.
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:13.160]   It is actually scanning multiple times a day,
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:14.160]   looking for stuff.
[01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:15.600]   Yeah, that's a big difference.
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:17.880]   And probably a good thing, and it's certainly
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:21.280]   I haven't seen any slowdown in my Mac.
[01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:26.840]   So XProtect Remediator, which is an executable code
[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:30.520]   modules which scan for and remediate detected malware.
[01:56:30.520 --> 01:56:37.520]   He also provides a list at eclecticlight.co.
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:38.600]   Good news.
[01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:41.120]   Good news.
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:42.360]   Let's see real quickly.
[01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:45.360]   A USB 4.0, you're going to love this, Alex.
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:48.920]   USB 4 version 2.0 will further confirm--
[01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:49.920]   Oh, thank you.
[01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:50.440]   Yeah.
[01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:51.440]   It's a big difference.
[01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:52.440]   Yeah.
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:53.440]   It's a big difference.
[01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:54.440]   Yeah.
[01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:55.440]   It's a big difference.
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:56.440]   Yeah.
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:56:57.440]   It's a big difference.
[01:56:57.440 --> 01:56:58.440]   Yeah.
[01:56:58.440 --> 01:56:59.440]   It's a big difference.
[01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:00.440]   Yeah.
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:01.440]   It's a big difference.
[01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:02.440]   Yeah.
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:03.440]   It's a big difference.
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:04.440]   Yeah.
[01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:05.440]   It's a big difference.
[01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:07.440]   It's a big difference.
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:08.440]   Yeah.
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:09.440]   It's a big difference.
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:10.440]   Yeah.
[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:11.440]   It's a big difference.
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:12.440]   Yeah.
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:13.440]   It's a big difference.
[01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:14.440]   Yeah.
[01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:15.440]   Yeah.
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:16.440]   Yeah.
[01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:17.440]   Yeah.
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:18.440]   Yeah.
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:19.440]   Yeah.
[01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:23.600]   If it comes out, you will see labels and icons and you'll know what your cable does.
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:28.120]   My request is that there's got to be like a rule that there's a certain blue or there's
[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:31.600]   a certain green or whatever that you're only allowed to use when a certain logo that
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:33.240]   you're only allowed to use if it's you--
[01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:34.240]   I wish they would do that.
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:35.240]   --if it's just new format.
[01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:36.240]   Yeah.
[01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:40.400]   And you can't do anything else with it and everything else because that way we could maybe
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:42.400]   tell, but it's just so hard.
[01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:43.600]   It's so hard to figure out.
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:46.080]   I have so many USB-C cables and throw them out.
[01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:47.400]   I have them taped.
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:48.880]   I have taped color on them.
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:50.640]   --to tell me what their speed is.
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:51.640]   Me too.
[01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:53.320]   Because I just-- I don't-- some of them are like 10 megabytes.
[01:57:53.320 --> 01:58:00.560]   Does somebody type C cable tester that you can figure out what capabilities the cable has?
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:02.560]   This Blackmagic Speed Test.
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:03.560]   Oh, you're plugging into a drive?
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:04.560]   I know what drive it is.
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:08.600]   I plug it into a drive, but I hit test and it just tells me how fast it is and I go OK.
[01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:10.440]   Because I know how fast the drive is.
[01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:13.880]   So the drive is cable of 2,000 megabytes a second or so.
[01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:20.080]   And so I can tell where the cable sits inside that world.
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:21.800]   I just mark them accordingly otherwise.
[01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:24.280]   Because we hooked into cameras and we need them to go.
[01:58:24.280 --> 01:58:30.520]   800, 900 megabytes a second is the-- for like 8K, 120 or that kind of thing, out of
[01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:32.720]   a Blackmagic camera, you need it to run about that speed.
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:35.080]   And so slower cables.
[01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:38.000]   We got to get Benson Leong to create a box.
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.800]   Benson has already tests USB-C cables.
[01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:43.840]   He works at Google's Google engineers, friend of the show.
[01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:45.900]   And you already test USB-C cables, but you know,
[01:58:45.900 --> 01:58:47.400]   it bends and make a box that you just plug it in.
[01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:49.700]   It says, does it read out, it says all the things
[01:58:49.700 --> 01:58:50.540]   that cable can do.
[01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:51.740]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - That would be really good.
[01:58:51.740 --> 01:58:52.660]   Wouldn't that be good?
[01:58:52.660 --> 01:58:54.660]   - I mean, there's USB testing, a little testing.
[01:58:54.660 --> 01:58:57.260]   - Yeah, test power or test speed, you know, you want it all.
[01:58:57.260 --> 01:58:58.580]   I want it all, I want it all, I want it all.
[01:58:58.580 --> 01:58:59.420]   I want it all.
[01:58:59.420 --> 01:59:00.240]   I want it all, I want to read out.
[01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:02.180]   It says, this is USB 4 type 2.0, or something.
[01:59:02.180 --> 01:59:03.780]   - Yeah, that'd be great.
[01:59:03.780 --> 01:59:05.440]   - Tell us your wide color of sticker to put on.
[01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:06.760]   - Yeah, there you go.
[01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:08.440]   - Exactly. - Exactly.
[01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:10.400]   - Update your Chrome.
[01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:15.400]   Right now, zero day Google Chrome for Mac and Windows.
[01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:18.060]   Google has pushed out an update.
[01:59:18.060 --> 01:59:21.160]   It's a zero day, which means it's being,
[01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:23.900]   it's in the wild, it's being exploited right now.
[01:59:23.900 --> 01:59:26.540]   CV 2022 3075.
[01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:30.420]   I am sure that Steve Gibson in about 10 minutes,
[01:59:30.420 --> 01:59:33.740]   we'll be talking about this, but a little PSA,
[01:59:33.740 --> 01:59:35.340]   public service announcement update,
[01:59:35.340 --> 01:59:37.400]   your Chrome if you haven't already.
[01:59:37.400 --> 01:59:39.820]   Usually all it requires is closing Chrome and reopening,
[01:59:39.820 --> 01:59:41.520]   and you should get the newest version.
[01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:44.560]   Unless you're offline, but then why do you have a browser?
[01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:47.160]   And Brazil, just in the nick of time,
[01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:49.440]   has ordered Apple to suspend the iPhone sales
[01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:52.400]   if they ain't gonna put a charger in the box,
[01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:55.960]   and find them, you know, pittance $2.38 million.
[01:59:55.960 --> 02:00:01.280]   But you won't be able to sell iPhones in Brazil anymore.
[02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:02.560]   If you don't-- - Have a prediction here.
[02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:06.400]   It's like the thing where France had your iPhone box,
[02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:08.480]   was inside another box with a pair of headphones
[02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:09.560]   because that was the rule.
[02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:10.600]   - Yeah. - Well, guess what,
[02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:12.060]   Brazil, you're getting the box with--
[02:00:12.060 --> 02:00:13.600]   - A box with a box. - Is that a box?
[02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:14.840]   Is a box in that box?
[02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:16.400]   - There'll be a charging brick in there.
[02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:17.440]   - Yeah. - Whee!
[02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:20.320]   - It has not stopped iPhone sales.
[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:24.480]   iPhone US market share hits all time high,
[02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:27.480]   overtaking Android, I'm sorry Andy.
[02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:28.960]   - Yep. - And it also dominates
[02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:31.580]   global premium sales, obviously.
[02:00:31.580 --> 02:00:33.120]   - I am not an investor, I'm okay with it.
[02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:34.520]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:38.420]   Pre-global Apple, the premium segment has a wholesale price
[02:00:38.420 --> 02:00:42.260]   of over $400, Apple has 57% of the world market.
[02:00:42.260 --> 02:00:47.260]   In the ultra premium slice of $1,000 plus devices,
[02:00:47.260 --> 02:00:49.860]   Apple owns 78% of the segment,
[02:00:49.860 --> 02:00:52.060]   I don't know who else, who has the rest,
[02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:53.460]   who has the other 22?
[02:00:53.460 --> 02:00:56.700]   - Google or Samsung, probably.
[02:00:56.700 --> 02:00:58.060]   - Samsung, Samsung. - Samsung always--
[02:00:58.060 --> 02:00:59.660]   - Yeah, they're folders, yeah, yeah, that must be.
[02:00:59.660 --> 02:01:02.860]   - Yeah, they got a lot of nice high-end phones too, right?
[02:01:02.860 --> 02:01:05.140]   - It just goes to show Apple's policy has always been,
[02:01:05.140 --> 02:01:06.300]   we don't care about market share,
[02:01:06.300 --> 02:01:10.380]   we care about making the most money we can off of every customer
[02:01:10.380 --> 02:01:12.060]   we have and retaining those customers
[02:01:12.060 --> 02:01:13.460]   for as long as we can retain them.
[02:01:13.460 --> 02:01:15.180]   So yeah, it's good.
[02:01:15.180 --> 02:01:18.060]   - Yeah, and as Andy knows, the other,
[02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:20.020]   I mean, the corollary to that is,
[02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:22.540]   there are points below which Apple doesn't feel like
[02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:25.380]   they wanna go because they don't think the product
[02:01:25.380 --> 02:01:27.980]   is gonna match their brand and is gonna be good enough.
[02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:30.060]   And we can argue about where that line should be drawn,
[02:01:30.060 --> 02:01:32.180]   but you put them both together and that's the answer,
[02:01:32.180 --> 02:01:35.740]   which is, there's a level below which Apple
[02:01:35.740 --> 02:01:38.940]   will never go, they will never be the low price leader.
[02:01:38.940 --> 02:01:41.380]   I'm amazed that after, you know, when I started
[02:01:41.380 --> 02:01:43.220]   in this business in the 90s, like market share
[02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:45.380]   was all anybody ever talked about,
[02:01:45.380 --> 02:01:48.060]   and I kinda like that we kind of never even talk
[02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:51.420]   about market share anymore, it's kind of refreshing,
[02:01:51.420 --> 02:01:52.740]   not technically. - And if anything,
[02:01:52.740 --> 02:01:54.700]   like the European Union might be different,
[02:01:54.700 --> 02:01:57.660]   but in the United States, an antitrust is really complicated
[02:01:57.660 --> 02:02:01.060]   when you have less than 70 or 80% of the market,
[02:02:01.060 --> 02:02:02.540]   it's really uphill battle.
[02:02:02.540 --> 02:02:05.620]   And so going for a higher market with a smaller,
[02:02:05.620 --> 02:02:08.100]   with the same revenue at a smaller market share
[02:02:08.100 --> 02:02:09.980]   is to Apple's advantage.
[02:02:09.980 --> 02:02:12.660]   Like if, you know, they probably will probably see them
[02:02:12.660 --> 02:02:15.660]   keep leaning towards the higher, those higher numbers
[02:02:15.660 --> 02:02:17.860]   because having a small, the smaller the market share is,
[02:02:17.860 --> 02:02:22.100]   if they can maintain revenue, the better it is for them.
[02:02:22.100 --> 02:02:23.980]   - I mean, in the wind tell era, it was seen as like
[02:02:23.980 --> 02:02:25.780]   a zero sum game where it was like a kiss of death
[02:02:25.780 --> 02:02:26.980]   if you weren't the market share winner.
[02:02:26.980 --> 02:02:30.180]   That was the, in the wind tell era, like it was always
[02:02:30.180 --> 02:02:32.100]   like windows in Intel and they control everything
[02:02:32.100 --> 02:02:34.380]   and everything else is the Mac is doomed forget about it.
[02:02:34.380 --> 02:02:37.660]   And in our era today, it is this multi-platform era
[02:02:37.660 --> 02:02:40.820]   where like PCs and windows are doing their thing,
[02:02:40.820 --> 02:02:42.260]   Apple's doing their thing with the Mac,
[02:02:42.260 --> 02:02:44.620]   there's iPhone, there's Android, there's iPad,
[02:02:44.620 --> 02:02:47.060]   there's Chromebooks and like,
[02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:49.660]   they're interesting business dynamics going on
[02:02:49.660 --> 02:02:51.300]   in various markets and all of that.
[02:02:51.300 --> 02:02:55.100]   But I don't feel anywhere that there's somebody saying
[02:02:55.100 --> 02:02:58.860]   like that the, you know, the specter of doom
[02:02:58.860 --> 02:03:01.900]   for a platform is hovering over your market share numbers.
[02:03:01.900 --> 02:03:03.940]   It just feels like we've left that era behind
[02:03:03.940 --> 02:03:05.900]   and I, for one, do not miss it.
[02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:08.620]   I don't miss that idea that if your numbers are down
[02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:11.100]   this quarter, it means your whole platform is doomed.
[02:03:11.100 --> 02:03:13.260]   - I do think that one thing that Apple is getting better
[02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:15.900]   and better at and they're uniquely set up for this
[02:03:15.900 --> 02:03:18.820]   is the lock in across all the platforms.
[02:03:18.820 --> 02:03:22.300]   So if you're an Apple user, it just becomes more
[02:03:22.300 --> 02:03:24.780]   and more cumbersome to use anything else.
[02:03:24.780 --> 02:03:26.900]   Like because there's so many things that so easily
[02:03:26.900 --> 02:03:29.140]   integrate your computer with your Apple TV,
[02:03:29.140 --> 02:03:31.660]   with your phone, like everything just talks to each other
[02:03:31.660 --> 02:03:33.220]   and because Apple's building all the chips
[02:03:33.220 --> 02:03:35.260]   and all the software and all the development,
[02:03:35.260 --> 02:03:37.460]   it gets so tight where, you know, it used to be,
[02:03:37.460 --> 02:03:39.940]   I used to have in this studio, I used to have a couple PCs
[02:03:39.940 --> 02:03:43.220]   and I had a Linux box and I had some other stuff in there
[02:03:43.220 --> 02:03:44.420]   and it was just too much trouble.
[02:03:44.420 --> 02:03:46.500]   Like I was just like, okay, enough of this.
[02:03:46.500 --> 02:03:49.780]   And so I still have them, I still use them
[02:03:49.780 --> 02:03:51.740]   for a couple of the development things that we do,
[02:03:51.740 --> 02:03:53.220]   but I don't keep them in my studio anymore
[02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:54.620]   because it's just too much like,
[02:03:54.620 --> 02:03:56.660]   it was so much of my time was being spent
[02:03:56.660 --> 02:03:58.260]   trying to get these computers to talk to each other
[02:03:58.260 --> 02:04:00.700]   with the Mac, it's just like, oh, I just drag this over here
[02:04:00.700 --> 02:04:02.380]   and I move over here and I move over there
[02:04:02.380 --> 02:04:05.380]   and it's just, I think the lock-in is getting pretty intense.
[02:04:05.380 --> 02:04:06.780]   - Yeah, it is pretty disappointing.
[02:04:06.780 --> 02:04:09.460]   I think it shows something that Apple,
[02:04:09.460 --> 02:04:12.100]   a trick that Apple has never demonstrated
[02:04:12.100 --> 02:04:15.740]   any proficiency at, meaning that they're really good
[02:04:15.740 --> 02:04:17.420]   when they get to control as much
[02:04:17.420 --> 02:04:19.180]   of the playing field as possible
[02:04:19.180 --> 02:04:21.860]   when you introduce variables that almost every other developer
[02:04:21.860 --> 02:04:24.620]   of every other hardware device has to deal with,
[02:04:24.620 --> 02:04:27.260]   they know about it completely.
[02:04:27.260 --> 02:04:31.100]   And so it's fine, I mean, if you're happy with the products
[02:04:31.100 --> 02:04:33.300]   that Apple is creating, if you are,
[02:04:33.300 --> 02:04:35.020]   I think there are gonna be a lot of people
[02:04:35.020 --> 02:04:36.340]   who are very thrilled to have an iPhone
[02:04:36.340 --> 02:04:38.660]   that's matched to an Apple Watch that's matched to AirPods.
[02:04:38.660 --> 02:04:43.660]   However, I think that sometimes, particularly in Apple fandom,
[02:04:43.660 --> 02:04:47.300]   this becomes a, oh, well, see, why can't Samsung
[02:04:47.300 --> 02:04:48.940]   just do anything nearly as nice as this
[02:04:48.940 --> 02:04:52.540]   and Google doesn't make a phone as nice, nearly as nice as that.
[02:04:52.540 --> 02:04:55.100]   Yeah, but when you buy other phones, other devices,
[02:04:55.100 --> 02:04:56.940]   you can use whatever you want with it.
[02:04:56.940 --> 02:05:01.940]   Apple, they really do make it difficult to not,
[02:05:01.940 --> 02:05:04.580]   to reach outside of that platform in a way, shape, or form.
[02:05:04.580 --> 02:05:09.580]   Even, I have as a, even two-factor authentication,
[02:05:09.580 --> 02:05:14.460]   which is, I'm glad that Apple has an authentication system
[02:05:14.460 --> 02:05:17.900]   that says, hey, you're trying to log into a brand new machine
[02:05:17.900 --> 02:05:20.300]   that didn't exist before with your Apple AD,
[02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:23.100]   we are going to authenticate you through another Apple device.
[02:05:23.100 --> 02:05:26.260]   That's fine, it's a lot better than a SIM card
[02:05:26.260 --> 02:05:29.420]   swap being able to steal your identity and stuff like that.
[02:05:29.420 --> 02:05:31.380]   But nonetheless, it means that as someone who uses
[02:05:31.380 --> 02:05:34.940]   an Android phone, that means that I have to go to the other room,
[02:05:34.940 --> 02:05:38.580]   reach into my bag, get up my iPad for another Apple device
[02:05:38.580 --> 02:05:40.180]   that was going to receive this message,
[02:05:40.180 --> 02:05:41.860]   whereas if they simply said, oh, by the way,
[02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:45.020]   we're using standard authentication scheme,
[02:05:45.020 --> 02:05:47.500]   we will have apps available for pretty much every mobile platform
[02:05:47.500 --> 02:05:50.140]   that's going to be, you might want to authenticate with.
[02:05:50.140 --> 02:05:52.460]   See, that's the sort of stuff that makes,
[02:05:52.460 --> 02:05:53.740]   that makes you feel right.
[02:05:53.740 --> 02:05:56.980]   If I'm scoring Apple as an Olympic judge,
[02:05:56.980 --> 02:05:59.340]   that's why they don't get tens across the board,
[02:05:59.340 --> 02:06:01.260]   that's why there's a point deductions always
[02:06:01.260 --> 02:06:02.980]   whenever I think about them that way.
[02:06:02.980 --> 02:06:04.380]   I think that the funny thing is,
[02:06:04.380 --> 02:06:05.820]   for me, when that happens,
[02:06:05.820 --> 02:06:09.260]   like suddenly all these computers light up with this code,
[02:06:09.260 --> 02:06:10.620]   like here's the code.
[02:06:10.620 --> 02:06:15.100]   And so it's on like every monitor has the code that I need
[02:06:15.100 --> 02:06:17.180]   for to get into whatever I'm getting into.
[02:06:17.180 --> 02:06:19.700]   And the thing is, is that I think that Apple users,
[02:06:19.700 --> 02:06:21.020]   the people who are buying all these,
[02:06:21.020 --> 02:06:22.940]   that's the lifestyle that they're,
[02:06:22.940 --> 02:06:25.660]   I mean, Apple is catering to the lifestyle that we prefer,
[02:06:25.660 --> 02:06:27.220]   which is, I just want it to be.
[02:06:27.220 --> 02:06:31.180]   Like, I don't think Apple users buy Apple because they're geeky.
[02:06:31.180 --> 02:06:32.940]   I think they buy them because they're doing things
[02:06:32.940 --> 02:06:33.940]   and they just don't want,
[02:06:33.940 --> 02:06:35.620]   they don't want all the other stuff to get in the way.
[02:06:35.620 --> 02:06:37.020]   They don't want to spend a bunch of time
[02:06:37.020 --> 02:06:38.860]   trying to figure out how this interfaces with that.
[02:06:38.860 --> 02:06:40.420]   They just want it to all work.
[02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:41.860]   You know, and I think that,
[02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:43.300]   and I'm sure that there's a small percentage
[02:06:43.300 --> 02:06:44.940]   that don't want that, but I bet you it's,
[02:06:44.940 --> 02:06:46.260]   you know, Apple tends to face,
[02:06:46.260 --> 02:06:50.940]   go, what does 90% of the people want to do 90% of the time?
[02:06:50.940 --> 02:06:53.620]   And that is, you know, we just want it to work, you know?
[02:06:53.620 --> 02:06:56.980]   And it's, and I've had times in my life
[02:06:56.980 --> 02:06:59.340]   where I've had many, many different platforms,
[02:06:59.340 --> 02:07:01.900]   but I've kind of, kind of passed that now.
[02:07:01.900 --> 02:07:05.420]   - Well, that's a, that's a excellent point.
[02:07:05.420 --> 02:07:07.180]   But the other thing is that,
[02:07:07.180 --> 02:07:11.300]   the thing is like my Sony wireless earbuds,
[02:07:11.300 --> 02:07:13.700]   they actually interact with more devices
[02:07:13.700 --> 02:07:15.860]   a lot more easily than any Apple earbuds
[02:07:15.860 --> 02:07:17.620]   that I've ever tried.
[02:07:17.620 --> 02:07:19.580]   A lot of other services, they also,
[02:07:19.580 --> 02:07:21.580]   they also just plain work.
[02:07:21.580 --> 02:07:24.060]   It's not as though, they're times when Apple
[02:07:24.060 --> 02:07:27.980]   is really giving me an advantage by having all this,
[02:07:27.980 --> 02:07:30.420]   all this tight integration between each other,
[02:07:30.420 --> 02:07:31.860]   but they're times where you're just doing
[02:07:31.860 --> 02:07:34.980]   a very, very average job, and so I'm giving up something
[02:07:34.980 --> 02:07:37.740]   without, feels like getting anything returned.
[02:07:37.740 --> 02:07:41.540]   And so, like I said, it's gonna be on a case-by-case basis,
[02:07:41.540 --> 02:07:42.900]   a person-by-person basis.
[02:07:42.900 --> 02:07:46.660]   They're parts of my coverage of Apple
[02:07:46.660 --> 02:07:49.060]   and coverage of companies, which is very, very practical,
[02:07:49.060 --> 02:07:50.540]   very, very standard, which is,
[02:07:50.540 --> 02:07:52.020]   "Hey, how old is this phone work?
[02:07:52.020 --> 02:07:53.940]   "How well, is it a good value based on the other one?
[02:07:53.940 --> 02:07:54.940]   "Hey, they've got new features.
[02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:57.460]   "Is it snake oil or does it actually work?"
[02:07:57.460 --> 02:08:01.140]   But there is, because people like Jason and I,
[02:08:01.140 --> 02:08:03.140]   we've been looking at this company for decades
[02:08:03.140 --> 02:08:04.420]   for like most of our lives.
[02:08:04.420 --> 02:08:07.540]   And so, you do get to think of it as a character
[02:08:07.540 --> 02:08:09.700]   and try to judge them as,
[02:08:09.700 --> 02:08:12.260]   "Are they doing everything they could possibly be doing?"
[02:08:12.260 --> 02:08:14.620]   I mean, are they demonstrating excellence
[02:08:14.620 --> 02:08:15.980]   and they're challenging themselves
[02:08:15.980 --> 02:08:17.260]   in every way they possibly can,
[02:08:17.260 --> 02:08:18.500]   and they're challenging themselves
[02:08:18.500 --> 02:08:21.180]   in ways that would pay off for the user.
[02:08:21.180 --> 02:08:23.620]   And there are sometimes where they would much rather
[02:08:23.620 --> 02:08:26.660]   just stand there with a bat on their shoulder
[02:08:26.660 --> 02:08:28.020]   and just watch the pitch go by
[02:08:28.020 --> 02:08:28.900]   rather than swing at it,
[02:08:28.900 --> 02:08:31.140]   because it's just not worth it for them.
[02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:35.780]   - Yeah, and they're playing a different game a little bit,
[02:08:35.780 --> 02:08:37.780]   and I think that sometimes the frustration with Apple
[02:08:37.780 --> 02:08:39.780]   is that they're playing a different game
[02:08:39.780 --> 02:08:41.060]   than some of their competitors,
[02:08:41.060 --> 02:08:43.900]   and they're places they choose not to go.
[02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:45.540]   And like, instead of making headphones
[02:08:45.540 --> 02:08:47.580]   for a whole bunch of different devices,
[02:08:47.580 --> 02:08:49.100]   they make headphones for Apple devices,
[02:08:49.100 --> 02:08:50.940]   and they do work with other devices,
[02:08:50.940 --> 02:08:53.060]   but that's not the point of them and they don't care.
[02:08:53.060 --> 02:08:55.860]   The Apple Watch is fundamentally an iPhone accessory.
[02:08:55.860 --> 02:08:57.780]   That's the device it works with,
[02:08:57.780 --> 02:08:59.060]   and that's all it works with.
[02:08:59.060 --> 02:08:59.980]   I will point out though,
[02:08:59.980 --> 02:09:01.260]   just I wanna throw it out there
[02:09:01.260 --> 02:09:03.060]   since this is where we started,
[02:09:03.060 --> 02:09:05.180]   that if you do the math,
[02:09:05.180 --> 02:09:07.460]   there have to be more people who own iPhones
[02:09:07.460 --> 02:09:09.620]   and have Windows PCs than have Macs.
[02:09:09.620 --> 02:09:11.180]   Just throw it out there. - Yeah, that's right.
[02:09:11.180 --> 02:09:12.020]   That's right, yeah.
[02:09:12.020 --> 02:09:13.700]   - Let's do the math. - Which is weird.
[02:09:13.700 --> 02:09:15.660]   - So, it is weird, but like,
[02:09:15.660 --> 02:09:17.340]   we talk about the Apple ecosystem plan.
[02:09:17.340 --> 02:09:19.020]   I think that's why Apple's ecosystem,
[02:09:19.020 --> 02:09:21.340]   they feel like there's always more market share
[02:09:21.340 --> 02:09:24.460]   for them to gather and more customers for them to grab,
[02:09:24.460 --> 02:09:26.180]   because they know that there's so many people
[02:09:26.180 --> 02:09:28.620]   who use Windows PCs and iPhones,
[02:09:28.620 --> 02:09:31.580]   and that's an opportunity for them on the Mac side.
[02:09:31.580 --> 02:09:33.500]   - Right. - But, you know, it is,
[02:09:33.500 --> 02:09:35.700]   and here's another thing, which is,
[02:09:35.700 --> 02:09:38.020]   I wonder if we're not giving enough,
[02:09:38.020 --> 02:09:39.620]   and I'm not saying we meaning me,
[02:09:39.620 --> 02:09:40.460]   'cause I don't wanna do it,
[02:09:40.460 --> 02:09:41.980]   don't please don't make me run Windows 11,
[02:09:41.980 --> 02:09:44.620]   but like, the average iPhone experience
[02:09:44.620 --> 02:09:48.900]   is somebody with Windows 11 or 10 or eight.
[02:09:48.900 --> 02:09:50.420]   - The reason for that though, Jason,
[02:09:50.420 --> 02:09:52.980]   is 'cause their business bought them the computer,
[02:09:52.980 --> 02:09:54.300]   and they bought the iPhone,
[02:09:54.300 --> 02:09:57.300]   and this has been kind of seen everywhere,
[02:09:57.300 --> 02:09:59.020]   business drives, and by the way,
[02:09:59.020 --> 02:10:01.340]   if you've ever had to use Windows 11,
[02:10:01.340 --> 02:10:02.980]   you have my deepest sympathy.
[02:10:02.980 --> 02:10:05.580]   (laughing)
[02:10:05.580 --> 02:10:07.260]   I don't, just don't tell anybody,
[02:10:07.260 --> 02:10:10.460]   but I don't understand why anybody uses Windows anymore.
[02:10:10.460 --> 02:10:12.500]   It's gotten worse, not better.
[02:10:12.500 --> 02:10:14.540]   It's really crappy.
[02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:16.980]   And there are other good choices out there,
[02:10:16.980 --> 02:10:18.980]   including Mac OS.
[02:10:18.980 --> 02:10:21.980]   I'm just stunned, but it's because businesses, you know,
[02:10:21.980 --> 02:10:23.300]   they keep buying them.
[02:10:23.300 --> 02:10:24.740]   We buy also some-- - Our editors,
[02:10:24.740 --> 02:10:26.220]   I feel sorry for you, John.
[02:10:26.220 --> 02:10:27.900]   I don't know why you're using Windows 11.
[02:10:27.900 --> 02:10:30.060]   Oh yeah, 'cause we bought it for you.
[02:10:30.060 --> 02:10:31.700]   But do you use an iPhone?
[02:10:31.700 --> 02:10:33.380]   - No. - Oh, nevermind.
[02:10:33.380 --> 02:10:35.220]   - Android, well, then. - You don't know anyway.
[02:10:35.220 --> 02:10:37.020]   - Any better, that's all, that's fine.
[02:10:37.020 --> 02:10:38.900]   I think it does come down to there are a lot of people
[02:10:38.900 --> 02:10:42.140]   that can't afford $1,000 minimum for a laptop.
[02:10:42.140 --> 02:10:43.060]   - Yeah. - And so that might be--
[02:10:43.060 --> 02:10:43.900]   - That's, sure.
[02:10:43.900 --> 02:10:48.380]   - And I do think more highly of Windows 11 than you do,
[02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:50.260]   although I would not-- - Have you been--
[02:10:50.260 --> 02:10:51.100]   - Have you been-- - Have you--
[02:10:51.100 --> 02:10:52.820]   - Do you have to use it though? - Do you use it?
[02:10:52.820 --> 02:10:53.820]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[02:10:53.820 --> 02:10:54.820]   - Well, I have to-- - Okay.
[02:10:54.820 --> 02:10:58.660]   - To make sure that I remain a global citizen,
[02:10:58.660 --> 02:11:01.460]   yeah, I've got Linux machines, I've got--
[02:11:01.460 --> 02:11:03.660]   - Yeah, but if you try to use Windows 11
[02:11:03.660 --> 02:11:08.180]   as your daily driver for more than two weeks,
[02:11:08.180 --> 02:11:10.580]   come back to us then and let me know what you think.
[02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:14.740]   - Well, I will say that my daily driver laptop
[02:11:14.740 --> 02:11:19.100]   was a Lenovo X1 running, I think, Windows 10.
[02:11:19.100 --> 02:11:22.820]   - Okay. - Because, like, I did not want to buy--
[02:11:22.820 --> 02:11:24.900]   I desperately needed a new laptop,
[02:11:24.900 --> 02:11:27.980]   but I absolutely at the time did not want to give any money
[02:11:27.980 --> 02:11:30.780]   to Apple for a piece of junk, like 2016--
[02:11:30.780 --> 02:11:32.820]   - The butterfly keys, yeah. - The butterfly keys, yeah.
[02:11:32.820 --> 02:11:35.340]   - But I also understand if you only have $800 to spend,
[02:11:35.340 --> 02:11:37.100]   you're not going to get an Apple Mac.
[02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:39.220]   You're going to get some-- - Right mouse, yeah.
[02:11:39.220 --> 02:11:40.660]   - That makes a lot of sense.
[02:11:40.660 --> 02:11:42.660]   Put Linux on it though, do yourself a favor.
[02:11:42.660 --> 02:11:44.940]   (laughing)
[02:11:44.940 --> 02:11:46.580]   - Scribner for Linux, we need that.
[02:11:46.580 --> 02:11:48.660]   - Oh, is that why you're using?
[02:11:48.660 --> 02:11:50.220]   'Cause you use Scribner, interesting.
[02:11:50.220 --> 02:11:55.220]   - A lot of it was that there, I have to say that I like Linux,
[02:11:55.220 --> 02:11:58.300]   but at least when I've got a problem with Windows,
[02:11:58.300 --> 02:12:01.580]   I know that I can find the answers for it with Linux.
[02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:03.820]   It's like, okay, well, first of all,
[02:12:03.820 --> 02:12:05.500]   you're going to have to check the new driver
[02:12:05.500 --> 02:12:06.900]   for your graphics chip.
[02:12:06.900 --> 02:12:09.060]   Like, I have to check the what for my what?
[02:12:09.060 --> 02:12:12.820]   Oh no, it's simple, it's simple, just run this script.
[02:12:12.820 --> 02:12:14.020]   Like, after a while.
[02:12:14.020 --> 02:12:15.580]   - Windows just is crap.
[02:12:15.580 --> 02:12:16.780]   I mean, it's just crappy.
[02:12:16.780 --> 02:12:18.460]   I mean, it's crappy like that.
[02:12:18.460 --> 02:12:22.020]   It's not the best for me.
[02:12:22.020 --> 02:12:25.660]   - It's poorly designed and it's buggy and it's unreliable.
[02:12:25.660 --> 02:12:29.540]   And the people who do have to use it like our editors
[02:12:29.540 --> 02:12:31.020]   live in the edit.
[02:12:31.020 --> 02:12:33.620]   You don't deal with Windows particularly,
[02:12:33.620 --> 02:12:36.260]   as long as your editor is working, your premiere is working,
[02:12:36.260 --> 02:12:37.700]   I suppose if you lived in Skrivener,
[02:12:37.700 --> 02:12:41.420]   you wouldn't experience the crap velocity that is Windows,
[02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:42.580]   but it is really bad.
[02:12:42.580 --> 02:12:43.420]   - No, I do.
[02:12:43.420 --> 02:12:47.140]   When I was using that laptop, that Lenovo laptop,
[02:12:47.140 --> 02:12:49.660]   I was using it regular apps, I was using Office Suite,
[02:12:49.660 --> 02:12:51.060]   so I was using everything.
[02:12:51.060 --> 02:12:55.820]   And I have to say that it was so much better of a laptop
[02:12:55.820 --> 02:12:59.460]   in many ways, even than the MacBook that I have right now.
[02:12:59.460 --> 02:13:01.220]   There are things that I liked about it.
[02:13:01.220 --> 02:13:05.380]   And I would have appreciated the ability to look out there
[02:13:05.380 --> 02:13:08.940]   and find a laptop that was exactly the laptop that I want,
[02:13:08.940 --> 02:13:12.300]   not the one that a company that only offers essentially
[02:13:12.300 --> 02:13:15.660]   two different dresses were willing to sell me.
[02:13:15.660 --> 02:13:20.660]   So I don't disagree with you that Mac is superior.
[02:13:20.660 --> 02:13:22.860]   I share your opinion on that.
[02:13:22.860 --> 02:13:24.020]   I don't think it's garbage.
[02:13:24.020 --> 02:13:26.700]   If it were garbage, you're not talking about the other chain.
[02:13:26.700 --> 02:13:27.780]   - Let me put it this way.
[02:13:27.780 --> 02:13:30.860]   Microsoft did an update last week
[02:13:30.860 --> 02:13:34.460]   that showed Chrome and all Chrome-based apps,
[02:13:34.460 --> 02:13:36.940]   like Electron Apps, to be a virus.
[02:13:36.940 --> 02:13:41.900]   Compelling many people to call my radio show,
[02:13:41.900 --> 02:13:44.340]   saying, "I have a virus.
[02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:44.980]   "No, you don't.
[02:13:44.980 --> 02:13:48.540]   "You have Chrome and Windows."
[02:13:48.540 --> 02:13:49.540]   And I'm so sorry.
[02:13:49.540 --> 02:13:51.740]   All of all of that.
[02:13:51.740 --> 02:13:53.980]   I know you probably wanna move on.
[02:13:53.980 --> 02:13:55.300]   - I really do.
[02:13:55.300 --> 02:13:57.340]   - The only thing I'll say to button this up is that
[02:13:57.340 --> 02:14:00.820]   that's the difference between windows runs on 82%.
[02:14:00.820 --> 02:14:01.660]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:14:01.660 --> 02:14:02.500]   - Of the desktop everywhere.
[02:14:02.500 --> 02:14:04.100]   They have to make an operating system
[02:14:04.100 --> 02:14:05.860]   that works with absolutely everything.
[02:14:05.860 --> 02:14:08.180]   And they don't have control over the apps,
[02:14:08.180 --> 02:14:10.220]   all the apps that are being created for it.
[02:14:10.220 --> 02:14:11.900]   They don't have all the control over all the hardware
[02:14:11.900 --> 02:14:13.300]   that's being done.
[02:14:13.300 --> 02:14:16.660]   That's why one of the benefits of Apple is that, again,
[02:14:16.660 --> 02:14:17.660]   they have so much control
[02:14:17.660 --> 02:14:19.380]   and the customer benefits from that.
[02:14:19.380 --> 02:14:20.860]   But I just don't want to,
[02:14:20.860 --> 02:14:22.860]   I don't like extrapolating that to,
[02:14:22.860 --> 02:14:23.900]   "Oh, well, this is crap."
[02:14:23.900 --> 02:14:26.140]   And I'm not saying that's this,
[02:14:26.140 --> 02:14:27.500]   but some people will extend that to,
[02:14:27.500 --> 02:14:29.140]   "Oh, why is Microsoft?
[02:14:29.140 --> 02:14:30.500]   "Don't care about their design.
[02:14:30.500 --> 02:14:32.260]   "Why do they not care about reliability?"
[02:14:32.260 --> 02:14:34.540]   It's like, that's because they are the water company
[02:14:34.540 --> 02:14:36.460]   that's keeping water to the entire community.
[02:14:36.460 --> 02:14:38.500]   They are not a boutique salon
[02:14:38.500 --> 02:14:42.180]   that gives you bespoke artisanal bottles to 8%
[02:14:42.180 --> 02:14:43.740]   of the people who have the money to spend
[02:14:43.740 --> 02:14:45.660]   on bespoke artisanal flavors.
[02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:48.500]   - Our show today brought to you by,
[02:14:48.500 --> 02:14:50.620]   oh, it's what I was gonna argue that
[02:14:50.620 --> 02:14:51.980]   that's exactly the argument I made
[02:14:51.980 --> 02:14:53.660]   about the app store about a half an hour ago.
[02:14:53.660 --> 02:14:54.980]   (laughing)
[02:14:54.980 --> 02:14:55.820]   Keep it, keep it, keep it,
[02:14:55.820 --> 02:14:57.460]   I don't think it is, but go ahead.
[02:14:57.460 --> 02:14:58.540]   I really don't think it is because.
[02:14:58.540 --> 02:15:00.020]   - Our show today brought to you by cash
[02:15:00.020 --> 02:15:03.500]   like quite literally, they are our CDN.
[02:15:03.500 --> 02:15:06.700]   They have been practically since Twitch started.
[02:15:06.700 --> 02:15:11.580]   Early on, we were having difficulty serving everybody,
[02:15:11.580 --> 02:15:13.500]   the podcast on a website,
[02:15:13.500 --> 02:15:14.500]   and we knew we had a problem.
[02:15:14.500 --> 02:15:16.980]   In fact, you may remember, if you've been a longtime listener,
[02:15:16.980 --> 02:15:18.940]   sometimes it'd be brought to you by AOL,
[02:15:18.940 --> 02:15:21.260]   we'd use AOL bandwidth, we were using,
[02:15:21.260 --> 02:15:23.900]   I don't, we were using somebody's crappy laptop
[02:15:23.900 --> 02:15:26.180]   in the DSL extreme.
[02:15:26.180 --> 02:15:28.420]   It was all sorts of weird ways to get this working.
[02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:30.580]   And then Matt Levine from CashFly,
[02:15:30.580 --> 02:15:33.140]   who heard and felt my pain, came to us and said,
[02:15:33.140 --> 02:15:34.340]   let's fix this.
[02:15:34.340 --> 02:15:37.420]   And from then on, in fact, we transitioned.
[02:15:37.420 --> 02:15:40.100]   When we added video, we, CashFly was right there.
[02:15:40.100 --> 02:15:42.860]   We transitioned to video painlessly.
[02:15:42.860 --> 02:15:46.500]   CashFly's really, really an amazing company.
[02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:49.020]   50 Pops all over the world,
[02:15:49.020 --> 02:15:51.780]   which means your content's closer to your customers,
[02:15:51.780 --> 02:15:54.020]   outperforming any local CDN.
[02:15:54.020 --> 02:15:58.060]   And now CashFly's doing low latency, virtually,
[02:15:58.060 --> 02:16:01.700]   ultra low latency, virtually no latency, video streaming,
[02:16:01.700 --> 02:16:05.340]   less than one second latency.
[02:16:05.340 --> 02:16:09.220]   That's the time to ditch your unreliable web RTC solution
[02:16:09.220 --> 02:16:11.860]   for their web socket live video workflow.
[02:16:11.860 --> 02:16:15.300]   It can scale to more than a million users.
[02:16:15.300 --> 02:16:17.820]   No one wants to wait for content to load with CashFly's
[02:16:17.820 --> 02:16:19.340]   ultra low latency video streaming.
[02:16:19.340 --> 02:16:21.420]   You dramatically increase your sites
[02:16:21.420 --> 02:16:24.780]   and application speed for global audiences.
[02:16:24.780 --> 02:16:28.420]   Plus with CashFly's storage optimization system,
[02:16:28.420 --> 02:16:30.380]   you take a load off your origin servers,
[02:16:30.380 --> 02:16:33.500]   you can reduce your, let's say S3 bills, for instance,
[02:16:33.500 --> 02:16:37.540]   reduce bandwidth, increase your cash hit ratio to 100%.
[02:16:37.540 --> 02:16:40.820]   And I know you don't want to be managing your CDN.
[02:16:40.820 --> 02:16:43.740]   Let CashFly do it with their elite managed packages.
[02:16:43.740 --> 02:16:45.500]   You get VIP treatment.
[02:16:45.500 --> 02:16:49.020]   24/7 support and response times in less than an hour.
[02:16:49.020 --> 02:16:50.980]   I love CashFly.
[02:16:50.980 --> 02:16:53.260]   They saved our bacon, let them save yours.
[02:16:53.260 --> 02:16:56.940]   Ultra low latency video streaming, lightning fast gaming,
[02:16:56.940 --> 02:16:59.260]   which delivers downloads faster, zero lag,
[02:16:59.260 --> 02:17:00.620]   glitches or outages.
[02:17:00.620 --> 02:17:03.020]   They do things like mobile content optimization,
[02:17:03.020 --> 02:17:06.100]   which offers automatic and simple image optimization.
[02:17:06.100 --> 02:17:08.540]   So your site loads faster on any device.
[02:17:08.540 --> 02:17:10.780]   Multiple CDNs for redundancy and failover,
[02:17:10.780 --> 02:17:14.380]   intelligently balancing your traffic across multiple providers.
[02:17:14.380 --> 02:17:18.100]   I can go on and on 10 times faster than traditional methods.
[02:17:18.100 --> 02:17:20.220]   And when we use traditional methods,
[02:17:20.220 --> 02:17:22.460]   often they didn't work at all.
[02:17:22.460 --> 02:17:25.220]   On six continents, they're 30% faster
[02:17:25.220 --> 02:17:28.660]   than other major CDNs, 98% cash hit ratio.
[02:17:28.660 --> 02:17:33.660]   Get this 100% availability in the past 12 months, 100%.
[02:17:33.660 --> 02:17:38.140]   And I love the 24/7, 365 priority support,
[02:17:38.140 --> 02:17:40.620]   cashfly.com.
[02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:43.020]   They'll always be there when you need them.
[02:17:43.020 --> 02:17:44.100]   They sure were for us.
[02:17:44.100 --> 02:17:48.300]   C-A-C-A-G-F-L-Y, cashfly.com.
[02:17:48.300 --> 02:17:50.700]   Thank you for your support of MacBreak Weekly CashFly.
[02:17:50.700 --> 02:17:53.300]   Cashfly.com.
[02:17:53.300 --> 02:17:56.940]   Jason Snell, pick of the week.
[02:17:56.940 --> 02:17:58.620]   - I know this is gonna be a repeat a little bit,
[02:17:58.620 --> 02:17:59.900]   but it's been a long enough time
[02:17:59.900 --> 02:18:01.380]   that I'm gonna just go back there.
[02:18:01.380 --> 02:18:03.820]   I'm sure somebody over the years has picked keyboard maestro,
[02:18:03.820 --> 02:18:05.220]   but not enough people know about it.
[02:18:05.220 --> 02:18:07.820]   This is Peter Lewis, who has been a Mac developer
[02:18:07.820 --> 02:18:10.300]   for a bazillion years.
[02:18:10.300 --> 02:18:11.900]   And for the last couple of decades,
[02:18:11.900 --> 02:18:13.620]   he's been doing keyboard maestro.
[02:18:13.620 --> 02:18:15.140]   It is $36.
[02:18:15.140 --> 02:18:17.780]   It is the premier Mac automation software.
[02:18:17.780 --> 02:18:19.260]   He's not kidding.
[02:18:19.260 --> 02:18:20.460]   There are lots of things on the Mac
[02:18:20.460 --> 02:18:22.100]   that you can't automate very well.
[02:18:22.100 --> 02:18:24.420]   When you hit a wall, it doesn't work in AppleScript
[02:18:24.420 --> 02:18:26.140]   or it doesn't work in shortcuts.
[02:18:26.140 --> 02:18:28.460]   And then you're left with some stuff.
[02:18:28.460 --> 02:18:31.820]   There are other tools like a hazel
[02:18:31.820 --> 02:18:34.180]   that'll act on files that are really great.
[02:18:34.180 --> 02:18:35.820]   But if you need to automate something
[02:18:35.820 --> 02:18:37.820]   that's not automatable,
[02:18:37.820 --> 02:18:41.060]   but obviously you can click on it with your mouse,
[02:18:41.060 --> 02:18:42.780]   keyboard maestro will work with it.
[02:18:42.780 --> 02:18:46.020]   And the example that I like to give that I just did this,
[02:18:46.020 --> 02:18:49.060]   I recently migrated my six colors membership Slack
[02:18:49.060 --> 02:18:51.620]   from Slack to Discord.
[02:18:51.620 --> 02:18:53.700]   And I was deactivating the old Slack.
[02:18:53.700 --> 02:18:57.820]   And I discovered that Slack doesn't let you batch deactivate.
[02:18:57.820 --> 02:18:59.420]   - Oh, one by one.
[02:18:59.420 --> 02:19:00.580]   - You have to click on a button.
[02:19:00.580 --> 02:19:02.980]   You have to click on a button, click on the yes.
[02:19:02.980 --> 02:19:04.500]   I actually wanted to delete this.
[02:19:04.500 --> 02:19:06.620]   Then an alert pops up that you have to click
[02:19:06.620 --> 02:19:08.980]   the big red button that says yes, delete this now.
[02:19:08.980 --> 02:19:10.620]   And then you scroll down to the next one
[02:19:10.620 --> 02:19:11.860]   and you keep doing this.
[02:19:11.860 --> 02:19:13.660]   Well, keyboard maestro is not just a,
[02:19:13.660 --> 02:19:16.060]   it's a macro tool you can assign keyboard shortcuts
[02:19:16.060 --> 02:19:17.380]   to just about anything.
[02:19:17.380 --> 02:19:19.620]   It does everything you think you can run an Apple script,
[02:19:19.620 --> 02:19:20.740]   you can run a shell script.
[02:19:20.740 --> 02:19:22.860]   You can do all of these built in actions.
[02:19:22.860 --> 02:19:27.260]   But one of its actions is looking at your screen
[02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:30.940]   and clicking on whatever image you put in.
[02:19:30.940 --> 02:19:33.940]   So you can take a screenshot of anything.
[02:19:33.940 --> 02:19:35.300]   It can be a webpage.
[02:19:35.300 --> 02:19:36.940]   It doesn't have to be an interface element.
[02:19:36.940 --> 02:19:38.500]   It can be a webpage.
[02:19:38.500 --> 02:19:40.820]   And you say, okay, this button here and you paste it in,
[02:19:40.820 --> 02:19:43.300]   click that and then wait half a second.
[02:19:43.300 --> 02:19:45.780]   And then you'll see this click that
[02:19:45.780 --> 02:19:49.460]   and then wait a half a second and then click this,
[02:19:49.460 --> 02:19:52.260]   wait two seconds, scroll up a little bit
[02:19:52.260 --> 02:19:53.660]   and repeat a thousand times.
[02:19:53.660 --> 02:19:54.780]   It's doing what you would do.
[02:19:54.780 --> 02:19:55.900]   That's awesome.
[02:19:55.900 --> 02:19:59.020]   And you know, it is, is it sad that there are certain
[02:19:59.020 --> 02:20:01.620]   interfaces that are not automatable in any way
[02:20:01.620 --> 02:20:04.020]   because there's no automation system that will get
[02:20:04.020 --> 02:20:07.060]   that little CSS floating button in that web,
[02:20:07.060 --> 02:20:08.980]   on that webpage in your browser.
[02:20:08.980 --> 02:20:09.820]   Yes, it is sad.
[02:20:09.820 --> 02:20:12.860]   I wish there were more automation tools that have those hooks.
[02:20:12.860 --> 02:20:15.300]   But the fact is sometimes you don't get the hooks
[02:20:15.300 --> 02:20:16.540]   and you have to make them yourself.
[02:20:16.540 --> 02:20:19.020]   But if you can click yourself,
[02:20:19.020 --> 02:20:21.700]   you can automate keyboard maestro to click
[02:20:21.700 --> 02:20:24.940]   and to look for what to click on next and then click that.
[02:20:24.940 --> 02:20:26.580]   And then, and that's what I ended up doing.
[02:20:26.580 --> 02:20:28.300]   I built this thing in about five minutes
[02:20:28.300 --> 02:20:30.460]   and then set it to repeat a thousand times
[02:20:30.460 --> 02:20:32.380]   and walked away and I came back
[02:20:32.380 --> 02:20:34.540]   and all thousand people who were in that slack
[02:20:34.540 --> 02:20:35.700]   had been deleted.
[02:20:35.700 --> 02:20:36.780]   It was amazing.
[02:20:36.780 --> 02:20:39.220]   So keyboard maestro, if you're at your wits end
[02:20:39.220 --> 02:20:41.980]   and you're like, surely there must be a way
[02:20:41.980 --> 02:20:44.020]   for me to automate this.
[02:20:44.020 --> 02:20:46.060]   There is the keyboard maestro will get there.
[02:20:46.060 --> 02:20:47.860]   It is the last resort sometimes,
[02:20:47.860 --> 02:20:49.860]   but I use it for other simple things,
[02:20:49.860 --> 02:20:51.980]   but it's moments like this where I'm so happy
[02:20:51.980 --> 02:20:53.180]   that I have keyboard maestro.
[02:20:53.180 --> 02:20:55.740]   - Native to Apple Silicon, 36 bucks,
[02:20:55.740 --> 02:20:58.780]   not to have to click a thousand times in slack.
[02:20:58.780 --> 02:20:59.620]   Seems worth it.
[02:20:59.620 --> 02:21:00.460]   - Worth it.
[02:21:00.460 --> 02:21:01.300]   Just for that, it's worth it.
[02:21:01.300 --> 02:21:02.460]   I use it for other simple things
[02:21:02.460 --> 02:21:05.300]   like keyboard shortcuts to play and pause my music
[02:21:05.300 --> 02:21:07.100]   and stuff like that that I wanted to have assigned
[02:21:07.100 --> 02:21:08.460]   specifically to certain keys.
[02:21:08.460 --> 02:21:09.820]   It does that stuff too, right?
[02:21:09.820 --> 02:21:12.500]   It's a general purpose macro utility,
[02:21:12.500 --> 02:21:15.380]   but it's got some really unique features
[02:21:15.380 --> 02:21:19.180]   that are just worth every penny, yeah.
[02:21:19.180 --> 02:21:22.820]   - Don't ever hesitate to re-recommend
[02:21:22.820 --> 02:21:24.020]   something that good.
[02:21:24.020 --> 02:21:25.020]   I don't even know.
[02:21:25.020 --> 02:21:26.700]   I'm gonna just see if we've ever recommended people.
[02:21:26.700 --> 02:21:28.860]   - It's not in our show doc for this year.
[02:21:28.860 --> 02:21:30.380]   It may have been on a long ago.
[02:21:30.380 --> 02:21:32.420]   - No, I don't think we ever recommend.
[02:21:32.420 --> 02:21:34.420]   I'm looking at MBW picks.
[02:21:34.420 --> 02:21:35.260]   - Wow.
[02:21:35.260 --> 02:21:37.700]   - Yeah, I don't think we've ever featured.
[02:21:37.700 --> 02:21:38.540]   Wow.
[02:21:38.540 --> 02:21:40.300]   - Then it's long overdue.
[02:21:40.300 --> 02:21:42.380]   - So, Mac break weekly now, we give the seal of approval.
[02:21:42.380 --> 02:21:44.140]   Keyboard Maestro is so good.
[02:21:44.140 --> 02:21:46.460]   It is just so powerful.
[02:21:46.460 --> 02:21:47.340]   It's worth it.
[02:21:47.340 --> 02:21:51.340]   - It's one of those apps where I've always kind of known
[02:21:51.340 --> 02:21:52.740]   about it in the back of my head,
[02:21:52.740 --> 02:21:54.220]   but never really thought twice about it.
[02:21:54.220 --> 02:21:55.780]   Now I'm gonna buy it.
[02:21:55.780 --> 02:21:56.620]   It sounds great.
[02:21:56.620 --> 02:21:58.860]   - Yeah, I wish the interface was a little better, right?
[02:21:58.860 --> 02:22:00.220]   Like it's a little old interface,
[02:22:00.220 --> 02:22:02.940]   but the fact is at its base, it is a workflow,
[02:22:02.940 --> 02:22:04.140]   like something like shortcuts
[02:22:04.140 --> 02:22:06.020]   where you're building actions top to bottom,
[02:22:06.020 --> 02:22:09.660]   except the number of actions and the power that those have
[02:22:09.660 --> 02:22:12.020]   is so much more than anything like shortcuts
[02:22:12.020 --> 02:22:14.740]   could ever even dream of because, again, it's the Mac.
[02:22:14.740 --> 02:22:15.620]   It's an open system.
[02:22:15.620 --> 02:22:16.980]   It's a third party utility.
[02:22:16.980 --> 02:22:19.580]   And it can do things like use the screen reader interface
[02:22:19.580 --> 02:22:20.860]   to match items on screen.
[02:22:20.860 --> 02:22:22.780]   And you don't even have to click on them, right?
[02:22:22.780 --> 02:22:25.540]   You can wait for that item to appear
[02:22:25.540 --> 02:22:27.980]   and then do something else or click near it,
[02:22:27.980 --> 02:22:28.940]   but not right on it.
[02:22:28.940 --> 02:22:31.380]   And like all of that is there, it's all controllable.
[02:22:31.380 --> 02:22:32.220]   It's awesome.
[02:22:32.220 --> 02:22:33.860]   - Doug Ammon, our chatroom says it also works
[02:22:33.860 --> 02:22:34.940]   with a stream deck, John.
[02:22:34.940 --> 02:22:36.260]   So that would be kind of cool.
[02:22:36.260 --> 02:22:38.860]   - I use it for all my stream deck stuff.
[02:22:38.860 --> 02:22:43.460]   And in fact, it'll let you do things like change
[02:22:43.460 --> 02:22:46.060]   what's on the stream deck, which is really great
[02:22:46.060 --> 02:22:48.580]   because most scripts you can run a script
[02:22:48.580 --> 02:22:51.060]   from the stream deck, but I have them like,
[02:22:51.060 --> 02:22:54.380]   right now, my Twit icon on my stream deck
[02:22:54.380 --> 02:22:58.620]   is lit up in orange because I'm in the middle of the show.
[02:22:58.620 --> 02:23:00.500]   And then when I press it again at the end of the show
[02:23:00.500 --> 02:23:02.540]   and turn off all my lights and all of that,
[02:23:02.540 --> 02:23:04.380]   it'll turn back to regular colors.
[02:23:04.380 --> 02:23:06.060]   - You are automate all the things, Jason,
[02:23:06.060 --> 02:23:08.700]   is that all? - I am, I want you to automate
[02:23:08.700 --> 02:23:10.220]   all the things, but yeah, if you've got a stream deck,
[02:23:10.220 --> 02:23:12.660]   keep where my store was fantastic for that too.
[02:23:12.660 --> 02:23:13.500]   - Wow.
[02:23:13.500 --> 02:23:15.540]   - Do it. - Yeah.
[02:23:15.540 --> 02:23:20.300]   - Mr. Andy Inako, wait, that's gonna be a tough one to top.
[02:23:20.300 --> 02:23:21.860]   What do you got?
[02:23:21.860 --> 02:23:26.100]   - I got Drive DX by BinaryFruit.com.
[02:23:26.100 --> 02:23:28.100]   It really gave me the information I needed.
[02:23:28.100 --> 02:23:31.500]   It's a drive diagnostic utility that goes beyond
[02:23:31.500 --> 02:23:33.900]   what disk utility does and which basically saying,
[02:23:33.900 --> 02:23:36.100]   "What's the smart status of this drive?"
[02:23:36.100 --> 02:23:37.820]   The smart status is okay.
[02:23:37.820 --> 02:23:40.540]   Like, yeah, but there's like ghouls and goblins
[02:23:40.540 --> 02:23:43.500]   and hoary netherworlding scents coming out of my drive.
[02:23:43.500 --> 02:23:46.100]   I don't think this drive is working correctly.
[02:23:46.100 --> 02:23:49.460]   Yeah, I'm reviving my 2012 Mac mini,
[02:23:49.460 --> 02:23:51.340]   which with the Fusion drive.
[02:23:51.340 --> 02:23:52.660]   And it was working fine for like,
[02:23:52.660 --> 02:23:55.700]   I updated it all the way to the latest OS you get.
[02:23:55.700 --> 02:23:57.580]   And it was working fine for a few days,
[02:23:57.580 --> 02:24:01.260]   but then when I was like ripping DVDs and transcoding them,
[02:24:01.260 --> 02:24:03.860]   it would just say, "Well, you've got 80 gigabytes
[02:24:03.860 --> 02:24:06.460]   worth of disk space free, but oh, I can't write this
[02:24:06.460 --> 02:24:07.700]   because I'm out of disk space."
[02:24:07.700 --> 02:24:09.380]   Or that stuff where, "Oh, there's no,
[02:24:09.380 --> 02:24:10.740]   I can't page any stuff to memory."
[02:24:10.740 --> 02:24:12.140]   So I knew something was up,
[02:24:12.140 --> 02:24:14.220]   even though it seemed to be working.
[02:24:14.220 --> 02:24:17.740]   Drive DX was able to say, "Yeah, this is not,
[02:24:17.740 --> 02:24:20.580]   this is working, but imminently going to die."
[02:24:20.580 --> 02:24:22.580]   It will basically, instead of just giving you
[02:24:22.580 --> 02:24:24.620]   a thumbs up, thumbs down, you have to sort of trust
[02:24:24.620 --> 02:24:27.540]   whatever it says, it will give you all the data
[02:24:27.540 --> 02:24:28.940]   on what's going on with this drive,
[02:24:28.940 --> 02:24:30.980]   including in the case of this Fusion drive,
[02:24:30.980 --> 02:24:32.940]   here's all the reallocated sectors
[02:24:32.940 --> 02:24:33.860]   that have been going on here,
[02:24:33.860 --> 02:24:36.940]   meaning that it keeps having a remapped sectors,
[02:24:36.940 --> 02:24:39.020]   to mark them as closed and damaged
[02:24:39.020 --> 02:24:42.260]   and not for virtual use anymore.
[02:24:42.260 --> 02:24:44.620]   And so that's why it was basically working,
[02:24:44.620 --> 02:24:45.900]   but failing for me.
[02:24:45.900 --> 02:24:48.700]   So that sort of made me think,
[02:24:48.700 --> 02:24:49.580]   it was already backed up,
[02:24:49.580 --> 02:24:51.820]   but I made sure I did an absolute,
[02:24:51.820 --> 02:24:53.980]   another backup of that second,
[02:24:53.980 --> 02:24:58.700]   and also put an order immediately for a replacement SSD
[02:24:58.700 --> 02:25:01.780]   to swap out that Fusion drive for a new one.
[02:25:01.780 --> 02:25:03.500]   It's exactly the tool that I've wanted,
[02:25:03.500 --> 02:25:06.020]   every single time that I've had a drive fail.
[02:25:06.020 --> 02:25:08.060]   I don't necessarily need to have a,
[02:25:08.060 --> 02:25:10.180]   I know that it's failing, I know that it's not working,
[02:25:10.180 --> 02:25:12.100]   I just need to know how bad is it,
[02:25:12.100 --> 02:25:14.180]   or sometimes I might, maybe,
[02:25:14.180 --> 02:25:15.980]   especially with an older drive,
[02:25:15.980 --> 02:25:16.980]   it seems to be working,
[02:25:16.980 --> 02:25:18.740]   but is it actually really working?
[02:25:18.740 --> 02:25:20.740]   Is it going to suddenly fail on me
[02:25:20.740 --> 02:25:22.020]   without any warning whatsoever?
[02:25:22.020 --> 02:25:23.860]   Well, this will give you the warning that you need
[02:25:23.860 --> 02:25:26.500]   to know that, hey, if you haven't been backing up your drive,
[02:25:26.500 --> 02:25:27.420]   this is a good chance,
[02:25:27.420 --> 02:25:29.940]   this is a good opportunity to suddenly drop everything
[02:25:29.940 --> 02:25:31.020]   you're doing this afternoon
[02:25:31.020 --> 02:25:33.500]   and do an emergency backup right now,
[02:25:33.500 --> 02:25:35.700]   before something really, really bad happens.
[02:25:35.700 --> 02:25:38.260]   It's a 20 bucks, but you can download it for free,
[02:25:38.260 --> 02:25:39.860]   and it'll give you a free trial,
[02:25:39.860 --> 02:25:42.460]   and you can just basically run it on your drive.
[02:25:42.460 --> 02:25:43.860]   Even if you have a healthy drive,
[02:25:43.860 --> 02:25:46.100]   it'll also basically continue to monitor
[02:25:46.100 --> 02:25:47.180]   the health of your drive,
[02:25:47.180 --> 02:25:49.180]   and give you warnings of a C stuff
[02:25:49.180 --> 02:25:52.180]   that is kind of itsy about what's going on with this drive.
[02:25:52.180 --> 02:25:53.660]   So very, very valuable to me,
[02:25:53.660 --> 02:25:55.660]   and I was very, very happy to spend the 20 bucks
[02:25:55.660 --> 02:25:56.500]   to actually own it.
[02:25:56.500 --> 02:25:59.060]   I know, Jason, while your Twitch button is orange,
[02:25:59.060 --> 02:26:01.500]   it's 113 degrees now.
[02:26:01.500 --> 02:26:02.500]   Oh God.
[02:26:02.500 --> 02:26:04.140]   It's glowing.
[02:26:04.140 --> 02:26:05.820]   Yeah, I know exactly why.
[02:26:05.820 --> 02:26:09.700]   So let's get Alex's pick and get out of here,
[02:26:09.700 --> 02:26:11.340]   so Jason can get out of the garage.
[02:26:11.340 --> 02:26:13.140]   Alex, your pick of the week.
[02:26:13.140 --> 02:26:15.220]   Yeah, so I have a preview that it's not a pick yet.
[02:26:15.220 --> 02:26:16.380]   I've decided to create a new category.
[02:26:16.380 --> 02:26:17.700]   It's a preview, not a pick.
[02:26:17.700 --> 02:26:18.540]   It's announced.
[02:26:18.540 --> 02:26:20.620]   It's not a thing that was announced today,
[02:26:20.620 --> 02:26:22.500]   and I'm super excited, but I haven't touched it yet,
[02:26:22.500 --> 02:26:25.140]   so I don't have an opinion.
[02:26:25.140 --> 02:26:27.700]   But I think that it potentially is a real game changer.
[02:26:27.700 --> 02:26:29.900]   Sony released what's called the ad.
[02:26:29.900 --> 02:26:31.700]   I'm sorry, I threw a curve to the poor.
[02:26:31.700 --> 02:26:32.700]   Oh, this is not it.
[02:26:32.700 --> 02:26:33.540]   Back in.
[02:26:33.540 --> 02:26:35.620]   Oh, Sony FR7.
[02:26:35.620 --> 02:26:37.020]   No, no, no, no, this is good.
[02:26:37.020 --> 02:26:38.380]   Yeah, I picked it up.
[02:26:38.380 --> 02:26:43.020]   So the little preview here is the Sony, the FR7.
[02:26:43.020 --> 02:26:45.620]   This is basically an A7.
[02:26:45.620 --> 02:26:46.700]   Well, it's a lot more than that,
[02:26:46.700 --> 02:26:48.900]   but like an A7 on a Pantilt Zoom camera.
[02:26:48.900 --> 02:26:50.420]   What?
[02:26:50.420 --> 02:26:51.660]   The PTZ head.
[02:26:51.660 --> 02:26:52.900]   The time has come now, Leo,
[02:26:52.900 --> 02:26:54.780]   for you to change all the cameras in your set.
[02:26:54.780 --> 02:26:56.100]   To PTZ.
[02:26:56.100 --> 02:26:59.860]   So it's Pantilt Zoom camera with a full frame sensor,
[02:26:59.860 --> 02:27:03.260]   and it's built for filmmakers.
[02:27:03.260 --> 02:27:06.740]   So it's got in the interface,
[02:27:06.740 --> 02:27:08.660]   if you look at the, they jump forward,
[02:27:08.660 --> 02:27:11.620]   there's like an iPad interface that is just gorgeous.
[02:27:11.620 --> 02:27:14.380]   So can I handle the lenses?
[02:27:14.380 --> 02:27:17.420]   I mean, yeah, so up to, it doesn't handle long, long lenses,
[02:27:17.420 --> 02:27:19.260]   but I think it's up to the 200 mil or something,
[02:27:19.260 --> 02:27:20.740]   something like 100 or whatever.
[02:27:20.740 --> 02:27:22.580]   Anything you do is a studio.
[02:27:22.580 --> 02:27:24.900]   In a studio, it's studio in filmmaking,
[02:27:24.900 --> 02:27:26.020]   it's what it's built for.
[02:27:26.020 --> 02:27:28.100]   You're not gonna put this in the back of your next conference
[02:27:28.100 --> 02:27:30.300]   and shoot it like a lot of people use PTZs,
[02:27:30.300 --> 02:27:32.660]   and you're probably not gonna use it in sports environment.
[02:27:32.660 --> 02:27:36.860]   But in a studio environment or in a, yeah, so you can--
[02:27:36.860 --> 02:27:38.900]   Is it a S7S body?
[02:27:38.900 --> 02:27:39.980]   That's their film.
[02:27:39.980 --> 02:27:41.900]   It's not really the, it's a new body,
[02:27:41.900 --> 02:27:43.860]   it's a new setup, it's really built for this,
[02:27:43.860 --> 02:27:46.220]   but it's the same sensor I think.
[02:27:46.220 --> 02:27:47.060]   I'm not sure about it.
[02:27:47.060 --> 02:27:48.540]   Here it says here, good video.
[02:27:48.540 --> 02:27:51.060]   There's a smart, there's a web app there that controls it,
[02:27:51.060 --> 02:27:54.780]   and it looks, I mean, I very rarely do I go,
[02:27:54.780 --> 02:27:56.300]   okay, this camera is a game changer.
[02:27:56.300 --> 02:27:58.180]   Usually like, well, this one's really good for high end,
[02:27:58.180 --> 02:28:00.180]   this one's good for, this is cost effective,
[02:28:00.180 --> 02:28:01.700]   this works inside of my system.
[02:28:01.700 --> 02:28:04.100]   You know, there's a bunch of things that we talk about there.
[02:28:04.100 --> 02:28:05.260]   We don't talk about like, okay,
[02:28:05.260 --> 02:28:06.740]   this could change a lot of things in the region.
[02:28:06.740 --> 02:28:08.740]   You wouldn't use this instead of a camera operator,
[02:28:08.740 --> 02:28:10.740]   but on a jib where you can't have the operator
[02:28:10.740 --> 02:28:12.020]   somewhere like that, right?
[02:28:12.020 --> 02:28:14.060]   Well, a lot of times what we do is we use
[02:28:14.060 --> 02:28:15.860]   these high end Pentale Zunes.
[02:28:15.860 --> 02:28:17.660]   Now, when I do it in the past,
[02:28:17.660 --> 02:28:20.140]   I've used Telemetrics head with a black magic camera
[02:28:20.140 --> 02:28:22.900]   and a Gabriel lens.
[02:28:22.900 --> 02:28:26.660]   That package costs about $40,000 a unit,
[02:28:26.660 --> 02:28:28.220]   you know, for all of the pieces that I put together.
[02:28:28.220 --> 02:28:30.340]   But you can program a move into it, is that why?
[02:28:30.340 --> 02:28:32.380]   Oh, you can do all that stuff, but this one,
[02:28:32.380 --> 02:28:34.140]   we'll do it for less than 10.
[02:28:34.140 --> 02:28:36.340]   So it's about 9,600 and something around that one.
[02:28:36.340 --> 02:28:38.220]   Oh, we should buy three of them, John.
[02:28:38.220 --> 02:28:39.060]   Yeah, right.
[02:28:39.060 --> 02:28:40.580]   It's by three, it's by three.
[02:28:40.580 --> 02:28:42.420]   So anyway, so, but the thing is,
[02:28:42.420 --> 02:28:44.740]   is that it is, what's gonna change here,
[02:28:44.740 --> 02:28:47.140]   I think the reason I'm excited about it as a preview,
[02:28:47.140 --> 02:28:48.900]   is if it lives up to the game,
[02:28:48.900 --> 02:28:50.380]   I think you're gonna see an enormous number
[02:28:50.380 --> 02:28:52.700]   of influencers start to use it for their studios.
[02:28:52.700 --> 02:28:53.540]   Wow.
[02:28:53.540 --> 02:28:56.020]   And it's really gonna change the way we think,
[02:28:56.020 --> 02:28:59.300]   you know, they're already been using the R7's a lot.
[02:28:59.300 --> 02:29:01.460]   But you can imagine, you know,
[02:29:01.460 --> 02:29:02.580]   this is the kind of thing that would,
[02:29:02.580 --> 02:29:04.540]   Justine as a Rick would probably just,
[02:29:04.540 --> 02:29:05.540]   you know, really have some fun with it.
[02:29:05.540 --> 02:29:07.060]   Is that a black magic, really?
[02:29:07.060 --> 02:29:09.500]   Can see, they all seem to, you know,
[02:29:09.500 --> 02:29:10.900]   the full frame sensor is a big deal.
[02:29:10.900 --> 02:29:11.740]   Oh, red.
[02:29:11.740 --> 02:29:12.580]   Okay.
[02:29:12.580 --> 02:29:14.420]   You know, the small form factor with a PTZ,
[02:29:14.420 --> 02:29:16.700]   putting a, you know, really getting this all working
[02:29:16.700 --> 02:29:19.860]   with the black magic camera would be a lot less seamless.
[02:29:19.860 --> 02:29:20.700]   Right.
[02:29:20.700 --> 02:29:21.540]   And so a lot of people just want it to be seamless.
[02:29:21.540 --> 02:29:22.980]   Anyway, so I'm just putting it out there.
[02:29:22.980 --> 02:29:24.420]   It's worth seeing because I was so excited
[02:29:24.420 --> 02:29:26.420]   that I saw it this morning, I saw the video
[02:29:26.420 --> 02:29:28.180]   and we were talking about it on office hours.
[02:29:28.180 --> 02:29:30.460]   And it's just worth, we don't know yet
[02:29:30.460 --> 02:29:31.300]   whether we're gonna pick it,
[02:29:31.300 --> 02:29:33.700]   but it looks really promising.
[02:29:33.700 --> 02:29:35.580]   Look, somebody's put on a slider.
[02:29:35.580 --> 02:29:39.420]   Now you've got motion.
[02:29:39.420 --> 02:29:40.500]   You got a lot of motion.
[02:29:40.500 --> 02:29:43.460]   You got a slider and a PTZ.
[02:29:43.460 --> 02:29:44.300]   Wow.
[02:29:44.300 --> 02:29:46.900]   It's really well designed, you know, and so.
[02:29:46.900 --> 02:29:47.740]   Very interesting.
[02:29:47.740 --> 02:29:49.820]   I think it could be really, really interesting
[02:29:49.820 --> 02:29:51.660]   as far as, you know, what it can do.
[02:29:51.660 --> 02:29:52.500]   So we'll see how that goes.
[02:29:52.500 --> 02:29:55.260]   The, my pick is actually a different,
[02:29:55.260 --> 02:29:56.100]   completely different thing.
[02:29:56.100 --> 02:29:56.940]   This is Canvas.
[02:29:56.940 --> 02:29:57.820]   This is what you had up before.
[02:29:57.820 --> 02:29:58.660]   Yeah.
[02:29:58.660 --> 02:30:03.660]   This is Canvas by Avi, Avi, Avi, and Avi.io.
[02:30:03.660 --> 02:30:07.940]   So Canvas, we just had them on office hours this morning
[02:30:07.940 --> 02:30:09.540]   for the second hour.
[02:30:09.540 --> 02:30:11.180]   And it's a really impressive package.
[02:30:11.180 --> 02:30:12.620]   So what this does is this is a,
[02:30:12.620 --> 02:30:14.660]   when you're doing shows, you're doing stage shows
[02:30:14.660 --> 02:30:18.180]   or other kinds of shows and you need to set up a lot of cues.
[02:30:18.180 --> 02:30:21.740]   This works in a way that is similar to things like Isadora
[02:30:21.740 --> 02:30:26.100]   or QLab, but it has a lot more features related to audio.
[02:30:26.100 --> 02:30:31.100]   So panning, audio editing, a really beautiful interface,
[02:30:31.100 --> 02:30:31.940]   nodal interface.
[02:30:31.940 --> 02:30:33.500]   So you can say, I want to take this trigger
[02:30:33.500 --> 02:30:35.700]   and I want to affect this and I want to make this, you know,
[02:30:35.700 --> 02:30:39.180]   so when I hit a button, I want all the stuff to happen,
[02:30:39.180 --> 02:30:40.500]   you know, all the way down the path.
[02:30:40.500 --> 02:30:43.540]   And the ability to, I mean, we're really interested in it
[02:30:43.540 --> 02:30:46.100]   because of the ability to run those cues.
[02:30:46.100 --> 02:30:49.620]   Now I can take OSC and a lot of other kind of cueing information,
[02:30:49.620 --> 02:30:52.340]   but what most of these lack is what you just showed there,
[02:30:52.340 --> 02:30:57.340]   which is the ability to edit audio itself.
[02:30:57.340 --> 02:31:01.540]   It's really hard and these apps, you either can play it
[02:31:01.540 --> 02:31:03.580]   or you can't, but you can't edit it, move it around,
[02:31:03.580 --> 02:31:05.740]   get it all working, add markers, have those markers,
[02:31:05.740 --> 02:31:08.420]   be cues, have those cues, be triggers.
[02:31:08.420 --> 02:31:09.420]   Here you can see animation.
[02:31:09.420 --> 02:31:11.420]   That's, you know, panning between speakers,
[02:31:11.420 --> 02:31:14.140]   which don't have to be a five one configuration.
[02:31:14.140 --> 02:31:16.500]   It's just like, I got a whole bunch of speakers in a building
[02:31:16.500 --> 02:31:18.860]   and I want something to run from here to here to here to here
[02:31:18.860 --> 02:31:21.220]   to here and you can build those out.
[02:31:21.220 --> 02:31:24.460]   It's in beta right now and you can sign up for the beta
[02:31:24.460 --> 02:31:26.820]   and it's free to download one, you know,
[02:31:26.820 --> 02:31:28.820]   in the beta program right now.
[02:31:28.820 --> 02:31:31.620]   So it's worth jumping in and kind of playing with it.
[02:31:31.620 --> 02:31:35.580]   The developer, Chris Baines seems very responsive,
[02:31:35.580 --> 02:31:38.380]   like he was great this morning and jumped into after hours
[02:31:38.380 --> 02:31:39.900]   and hung out with everybody for a little while
[02:31:39.900 --> 02:31:41.860]   and they're, you know, on Discord,
[02:31:41.860 --> 02:31:43.660]   they have a Discord server.
[02:31:43.660 --> 02:31:45.420]   You know, they're super responsive, you know,
[02:31:45.420 --> 02:31:47.380]   and so they're really working hard on this
[02:31:47.380 --> 02:31:48.900]   and I think it's a, if you're into that,
[02:31:48.900 --> 02:31:52.780]   if you need that kind of thing, the queuing for an event,
[02:31:52.780 --> 02:31:54.700]   it's a really impressive app.
[02:31:54.700 --> 02:31:57.060]   You know, we use a lot of different apps like this
[02:31:57.060 --> 02:31:59.340]   and this one's just definitely worth checking out.
[02:31:59.340 --> 02:32:04.580]   - Canvas from AVAI.
[02:32:04.580 --> 02:32:08.340]   Thank you, Alex Lindsay for your picks of the week
[02:32:08.340 --> 02:32:12.420]   and thank you all for being here on the hottest day of the year.
[02:32:12.420 --> 02:32:17.420]   That's AVAI, AVAI, I'm sorry, AVAI.io.
[02:32:17.420 --> 02:32:20.660]   Let me get that right, AVAI.io.
[02:32:20.660 --> 02:32:23.260]   Oh, the rainiest day of the year for you, Andy and Akko.
[02:32:23.260 --> 02:32:25.540]   When are you gonna be on GBH next?
[02:32:25.540 --> 02:32:26.740]   - I'm on the day early.
[02:32:26.740 --> 02:32:31.500]   I'm on Thursday at about 1245, go to wgphnews.org
[02:32:31.500 --> 02:32:33.580]   just streaming live or later or on YouTube.
[02:32:33.580 --> 02:32:35.940]   - I can guess what you'll be talking about.
[02:32:35.940 --> 02:32:38.580]   - I guess, I'm also, actually, I'm also on WGN in Chicago
[02:32:38.580 --> 02:32:39.780]   earlier that morning. - Nice.
[02:32:39.780 --> 02:32:43.540]   - It's on 845, I think. - Nice.
[02:32:43.540 --> 02:32:46.820]   - And you'd have to go to WGN, Google WGN for this trip.
[02:32:46.820 --> 02:32:47.980]   - Everybody knows WGN.
[02:32:47.980 --> 02:32:49.260]   - Everybody knows, exactly.
[02:32:49.260 --> 02:32:52.420]   Great flamethrower of Chicago, Illinois.
[02:32:52.420 --> 02:32:53.260]   - Indeed.
[02:32:53.260 --> 02:32:54.900]   - Thank you, Andy and Akko.
[02:32:54.900 --> 02:32:57.220]   We'll see you tomorrow morning, 10 a.m., right?
[02:32:57.220 --> 02:32:58.060]   - Absolutely.
[02:32:58.060 --> 02:33:01.620]   - Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern for our Mac,
[02:33:01.620 --> 02:33:05.260]   Apple, iPhone, launch coverage.
[02:33:05.260 --> 02:33:07.020]   That's where Alex Lindsay will be.
[02:33:07.020 --> 02:33:09.780]   He'll be at officehours.global for the coverage.
[02:33:09.780 --> 02:33:14.780]   They do their dissection of the stream.
[02:33:14.780 --> 02:33:15.900]   - It's good, clean, fun.
[02:33:15.900 --> 02:33:17.660]   Yeah, it's about, but usually somewhere between 80
[02:33:17.660 --> 02:33:20.220]   and about 150 of us, so it's just imagine a dream
[02:33:20.220 --> 02:33:22.740]   in all of chit chatting and talking about it.
[02:33:22.740 --> 02:33:24.620]   So it's a good time.
[02:33:24.620 --> 02:33:27.260]   - Somehow, if we could figure out how to merge the streams,
[02:33:27.260 --> 02:33:28.100]   we would do it.
[02:33:28.100 --> 02:33:28.940]   - We should figure that out.
[02:33:28.940 --> 02:33:29.780]   We should figure it out.
[02:33:29.780 --> 02:33:31.820]   Maybe we can figure out a way that you guys can cut to it.
[02:33:31.820 --> 02:33:32.660]   Like you don't have to do it.
[02:33:32.660 --> 02:33:33.780]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[02:33:33.780 --> 02:33:34.620]   - Yeah.
[02:33:34.620 --> 02:33:35.580]   - Like jump in and we talk for a little bit
[02:33:35.580 --> 02:33:37.180]   and then we go back to what we were doing,
[02:33:37.180 --> 02:33:39.340]   or maybe after the show at some point.
[02:33:39.340 --> 02:33:41.300]   - Alex, that looked like a jump cut.
[02:33:41.300 --> 02:33:42.580]   Do you think there was an edit there?
[02:33:42.580 --> 02:33:43.420]   - Exactly.
[02:33:43.420 --> 02:33:46.060]   I think that they took an important product.
[02:33:46.060 --> 02:33:47.580]   - How did they do that drone shot
[02:33:47.580 --> 02:33:49.260]   from the basement to the cellar?
[02:33:49.260 --> 02:33:53.060]   - This weekend tech extended cinematic universe.
[02:33:53.060 --> 02:33:53.900]   I like it.
[02:33:53.900 --> 02:33:55.460]   - Hey, multiverse.
[02:33:55.460 --> 02:33:57.100]   - Multiverse.
[02:33:57.100 --> 02:33:59.700]   - Officehours.global every day of the week,
[02:33:59.700 --> 02:34:02.740]   definitely the place to be if you're interested
[02:34:02.740 --> 02:34:03.980]   in all of this.
[02:34:03.980 --> 02:34:06.500]   And we have one quick note is that IBC,
[02:34:06.500 --> 02:34:07.540]   the big broadcasting,
[02:34:07.540 --> 02:34:09.460]   this is the NAB of Europe,
[02:34:09.460 --> 02:34:14.460]   is this weekend and we have a crew covering IBC.
[02:34:14.460 --> 02:34:15.460]   There'll be two hours.
[02:34:15.460 --> 02:34:17.260]   It's very early in the morning because it's IBC.
[02:34:17.260 --> 02:34:20.020]   They'll be live, but it'll be 5 a.m.
[02:34:20.020 --> 02:34:20.860]   (laughs)
[02:34:20.860 --> 02:34:23.740]   It'll be out live on the Officehours YouTube page
[02:34:23.740 --> 02:34:25.700]   for about two hours and they're gonna wander around.
[02:34:25.700 --> 02:34:27.660]   I think we've got 10 people on the ground
[02:34:27.660 --> 02:34:31.260]   and 30 supporting them in the cloud.
[02:34:31.260 --> 02:34:33.140]   So 30 people kind of working with them
[02:34:33.140 --> 02:34:34.260]   and they've been working on it for months.
[02:34:34.260 --> 02:34:35.660]   And so we're really excited about it.
[02:34:35.660 --> 02:34:37.900]   It's gonna be again at 5 a.m.
[02:34:37.900 --> 02:34:39.740]   You can find it on our YouTube channel
[02:34:39.740 --> 02:34:40.860]   and it should be some great coverage.
[02:34:40.860 --> 02:34:44.340]   - Is this like one guy's setup here that I'm looking at?
[02:34:44.340 --> 02:34:46.380]   It's just like how he does Officehours.
[02:34:46.380 --> 02:34:47.740]   - That's what all of us look like.
[02:34:47.740 --> 02:34:48.740]   - Oh my God.
[02:34:48.740 --> 02:34:50.420]   - That's insane.
[02:34:50.420 --> 02:34:54.180]   - There was a last on Friday or last week,
[02:34:54.180 --> 02:34:55.340]   I think it was Friday.
[02:34:55.340 --> 02:35:00.340]   We, yeah, last week we broke down how we do our show.
[02:35:00.340 --> 02:35:01.980]   - Ruthless reviews.
[02:35:01.980 --> 02:35:03.980]   Ruthless reviews of the kit that we use.
[02:35:03.980 --> 02:35:04.980]   So if you watch that one,
[02:35:04.980 --> 02:35:07.100]   you'll see all these big kits, but all of our,
[02:35:07.100 --> 02:35:08.740]   like it all looks normal on the front,
[02:35:08.740 --> 02:35:10.420]   but on the back end they all look like that.
[02:35:10.420 --> 02:35:12.260]   - He's got a teleprompter.
[02:35:12.260 --> 02:35:14.340]   - He's got, no, no a sergeant.
[02:35:14.340 --> 02:35:15.900]   He's, yeah, that's a--
[02:35:15.900 --> 02:35:17.460]   - This is cray cray.
[02:35:17.460 --> 02:35:18.460]   - This is above average.
[02:35:18.460 --> 02:35:19.300]   - It's not as high.
[02:35:19.300 --> 02:35:20.140]   - Above average.
[02:35:20.140 --> 02:35:20.980]   - Yes.
[02:35:20.980 --> 02:35:22.460]   - But a lot of us have pretty complicated kids.
[02:35:22.460 --> 02:35:26.180]   Noah's is probably one of the most refined of the bunch.
[02:35:26.180 --> 02:35:28.940]   Yeah, so he's got, but that's a, you know, you buy,
[02:35:28.940 --> 02:35:31.780]   so if you wanna see like how we set up for Officehours,
[02:35:32.180 --> 02:35:34.100]   this is insane.
[02:35:34.100 --> 02:35:36.340]   Okay, nobody does this for Twitter.
[02:35:36.340 --> 02:35:37.420]   I can tell you right now.
[02:35:37.420 --> 02:35:40.340]   Someday we should do ruthless reviews of your guys set up,
[02:35:40.340 --> 02:35:41.780]   except nobody would admit it.
[02:35:41.780 --> 02:35:43.900]   I know nobody'd want a picture of it.
[02:35:43.900 --> 02:35:45.700]   (laughs)
[02:35:45.700 --> 02:35:47.260]   All right, Officehours.global.
[02:35:47.260 --> 02:35:52.260]   And of course, if you need to hire Alex 090.media.
[02:35:52.260 --> 02:35:55.420]   Jason Snell, six colors.com.

[02:36:09.940 --> 02:36:11.700]   Anything else you wanna plug?
[02:36:11.700 --> 02:36:14.940]   - No, I, you know, there's an Apple event tomorrow,
[02:36:14.940 --> 02:36:16.620]   so watch for that, watch.
[02:36:16.620 --> 02:36:17.860]   - Oh yeah, so you're gonna tell me
[02:36:17.860 --> 02:36:19.180]   what you're doing on Relay FM.
[02:36:19.180 --> 02:36:21.140]   You and Mike Hurley after the event?
[02:36:21.140 --> 02:36:25.700]   - Yeah, about 130 Pacific will be live from Cupertino,
[02:36:25.700 --> 02:36:28.860]   probably from on the Apple Park campus somewhere,
[02:36:28.860 --> 02:36:29.740]   or right across the street.
[02:36:29.740 --> 02:36:30.660]   - How do you stream that?
[02:36:30.660 --> 02:36:31.980]   - How does he stream that?
[02:36:31.980 --> 02:36:35.060]   - Just, you know, well, it'll be audio only,
[02:36:35.060 --> 02:36:36.540]   but I think Mike will stream it.
[02:36:36.540 --> 02:36:38.580]   I think I will be doing a Zoom conversation with Mike,
[02:36:38.580 --> 02:36:40.260]   and then he'll be streaming it on Relay.
[02:36:40.260 --> 02:36:42.020]   But we'll get the audio stream out there.
[02:36:42.020 --> 02:36:45.460]   That's usually our biggest show of the year too.
[02:36:45.460 --> 02:36:47.940]   So we'll break it all down right afterward,
[02:36:47.940 --> 02:36:49.820]   and then I'll be writing about it for the rest of my life
[02:36:49.820 --> 02:36:51.140]   at sixcolors.com.
[02:36:51.140 --> 02:36:54.260]   - Okay, it's exciting.
[02:36:55.260 --> 02:36:58.700]   I wish we were gonna have a Mac break weekly tomorrow,
[02:36:58.700 --> 02:37:00.700]   but we will have one in a week.
[02:37:00.700 --> 02:37:01.620]   In a way that's good.
[02:37:01.620 --> 02:37:02.620]   The dust will have settled,
[02:37:02.620 --> 02:37:03.580]   the smoke will have cleared,
[02:37:03.580 --> 02:37:06.100]   the reality distortion field will have been shut down,
[02:37:06.100 --> 02:37:10.380]   and we can talk honestly about what we learned tomorrow.
[02:37:10.380 --> 02:37:13.060]   I hope we will see you all though tomorrow
[02:37:13.060 --> 02:37:14.420]   for the Apple event,
[02:37:14.420 --> 02:37:16.660]   which we will kind of comment on,
[02:37:16.660 --> 02:37:19.060]   any denial, comment on as it's ongoing.
[02:37:19.060 --> 02:37:22.580]   We do Mac break weekly on Tuesdays,
[02:37:22.580 --> 02:37:26.300]   11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time, 1800 UTC.
[02:37:26.300 --> 02:37:28.940]   You can watch us do it live at live.twit.tv,
[02:37:28.940 --> 02:37:31.740]   chat with us live at irc.twit.tv.
[02:37:31.740 --> 02:37:34.740]   Of course, club twit members get their very own green room
[02:37:34.740 --> 02:37:36.860]   behind the scenes in the club twit discord.
[02:37:36.860 --> 02:37:39.500]   That's part of the many benefits.
[02:37:39.500 --> 02:37:42.220]   A mere seven bucks a month gets you all of our shows,
[02:37:42.220 --> 02:37:44.580]   including this one, ad-free.
[02:37:44.580 --> 02:37:46.940]   It gets you access to the club twit discord,
[02:37:46.940 --> 02:37:49.580]   and the special events that are always going on
[02:37:49.580 --> 02:37:50.780]   in the club twit discord,
[02:37:50.780 --> 02:37:52.380]   all the great conversations.
[02:37:52.380 --> 02:37:55.820]   Plus shows that we don't put out to the public.
[02:37:55.820 --> 02:37:56.860]   The club supports them,
[02:37:56.860 --> 02:37:59.980]   so their club only like Hands on Mac,
[02:37:59.980 --> 02:38:01.940]   with Micah Sargent, Hands on Windows,
[02:38:01.940 --> 02:38:04.340]   with Paul Therat, the untitled Linux show,
[02:38:04.340 --> 02:38:06.180]   with Jonathan Bennett, the Giz Fizz,
[02:38:06.180 --> 02:38:08.220]   with Dick D Bartolo, Stacey's book club,
[02:38:08.220 --> 02:38:12.020]   with Stacey Hickenbaum, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:38:12.020 --> 02:38:13.940]   And the twit plus feed,
[02:38:13.940 --> 02:38:16.260]   with all sorts of behind the scenes stuff
[02:38:16.260 --> 02:38:18.900]   that doesn't make it to the shows.
[02:38:18.900 --> 02:38:20.380]   For seven bucks a month,
[02:38:20.380 --> 02:38:21.500]   I think we should raise the rates,
[02:38:21.500 --> 02:38:22.700]   but we're not gonna,
[02:38:22.700 --> 02:38:24.700]   there would no twit.tv/club,
[02:38:24.700 --> 02:38:25.520]   twit least says,
[02:38:25.520 --> 02:38:26.980]   draw on the line.
[02:38:26.980 --> 02:38:28.780]   Should we do that a yearly membership
[02:38:28.780 --> 02:38:29.740]   for the same amount?
[02:38:29.740 --> 02:38:30.700]   We don't give you a discount,
[02:38:30.700 --> 02:38:31.540]   but it just makes it easier.
[02:38:31.540 --> 02:38:33.380]   You only pay once a year.
[02:38:33.380 --> 02:38:35.020]   There's also enterprise memberships,
[02:38:35.020 --> 02:38:37.660]   and those are discounted for large groups.
[02:38:37.660 --> 02:38:39.660]   Twit.tv/club twit.
[02:38:39.660 --> 02:38:41.060]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[02:38:41.060 --> 02:38:42.700]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[02:38:42.700 --> 02:38:43.820]   Now get back to work,
[02:38:43.820 --> 02:38:46.100]   'cause break time is over.
[02:38:46.100 --> 02:38:47.940]   Thank you everybody.
[02:38:47.940 --> 02:38:49.780]   The world is changing rapidly.
[02:38:49.780 --> 02:38:52.580]   So rapidly, in fact, that it's hard to keep up.
[02:38:52.580 --> 02:38:55.180]   That's why Micah Sargent and I, Jason Howell,
[02:38:55.180 --> 02:38:56.340]   talk with the people making
[02:38:56.340 --> 02:38:58.860]   and breaking the tech news on Tech News Weekly
[02:38:58.860 --> 02:39:00.140]   every Thursday.
[02:39:00.140 --> 02:39:02.380]   They know these stories better than anyone,
[02:39:02.380 --> 02:39:05.540]   so why not get them to talk about it in their own words?
[02:39:05.540 --> 02:39:07.020]   Subscribe to Tech News Weekly,
[02:39:07.020 --> 02:39:10.420]   and you won't miss a beat every Thursday at twit.tv.
