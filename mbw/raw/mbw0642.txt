[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:47.920]   Well hello everybody welcome to a very special episode of Mac Break Weekly we like to do this once a year
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.920]   Carsten has worked so very hard to put together what we call what we like to call the best of
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:02.920]   What I like to call daddy's drinking time so we're going to take some time and enjoy some of the past memories
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.920]   Are these in chronological order? Okay so they're in chronological order starting with the beginning of the year
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:19.920]   the mini controversy you might remember it about the iPhone seems Apple was slowing it down
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.920]   Alright let's talk about batteries because that was the story that kept poor Renee Richie working through the holiday break
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:36.920]   Sorry this story broke like the Christmas Eve when it was it was it never really broke that was the thing like Apple did this almost a year ago
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.920]   And then there was a reddit thread about a guy who replaced his battery and got some attention and then John Poole from Geekbanger and his geek like his benchmarks
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.920]   And it just it slowly started gaining ground it was like a snowball just going downhill towards Christmas
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:03:00.920]   So but as usual reddit is you know where you find this stuff this one 24 days ago PSA iPhone slow try replacing your battery
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:14.920]   And so this one has been updated since the original post Apple at first didn't say anything there was just all of this information and then Apple finally said yeah they coped to it
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:28.920]   And they explained why so I'm gonna rather than paraphrase Apple I'm gonna let you paraphrase Apple what what did Apple they said we slow it down yeah
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:42.920]   Why yeah so alright so what happened was about a year ago there was this issue where iPhone 6 and some iPhone 6s were draining fast and shutting down or just just shutting down even when they had charge
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:55.920]   And it was a bit of a brew haha and Apple eventually made a comment saying that there was a percentage of people who are having this issue and they were gonna make changes to try to prevent it and it was a bad issue back then because you couldn't even restart the iPhones unless you went and physically plug them in
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:06.920]   They were just off off and so Apple did two things one they made it so that the iPhones could reboot without being connected to external power so they would come back on and they made a change in iOS 10.3.2
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:18.920]   And before that they actually ran in an earlier version of iOS that ran a bunch of diagnostics and tried to figure out what was going wrong got the information and then used that to make the update and what they ended up doing was adding
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:33.920]   Battery Health Power Management to the throttling mechanism in iOS and all CPUs are almost always throttle typically for heat because if they get too hot it's incredibly damaging so the processor will start really fast and then ramp down as the heat builds up inside a device and
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:46.920]   iPhones are tiny tiny little devices but what this was doing was making sure that as the battery health deteriorated especially if it was deteriorating quickly due to exposure to heat or exposure to cold or massive amounts of charge cycles anything like that
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:05:00.920]   It was no longer causing those power spikes which were causing the device to shut down so everything sounded fine back then Apple pushed out the update everyone sort of went on with their lives and then as the devices got a little bit older and the batteries aged a little more
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:16.920]   People started seeing profound performance degradation in some of these devices maybe like by 25% or 33% and when you're dealing with an iPhone that's quite a bit especially because Apple is famous for single thread performance is what makes the interface feel so snappy
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:30.920]   And it was not intuitive why it was happening because if your phone drains or it shuts off you might suspect the battery and you might take it in and get the battery serviced but if your phone is slow you don't suspect the battery at all so people weren't really they didn't understand what the problem was
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:43.920]   So this threaded thread came out and the guy changed the battery and suddenly everything was great and John Poole saw it who runs Geekbench and his wife's iPhone was slow and he started running all these benchmarks and it showed that how much certain iPhone models
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:54.920]   over time were downgrading or throttling the performance in order to maintain the battery life and prevent the shutdowns and it wasn't all of them I think the figures that we're seeing is like 33% of them
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:03.920]   But that is when you're talking about iPhone owners that is a huge number of devices so that became big news and then Apple started you know to start putting out statements
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:10.920]   Yes we are we're doing this what they call advanced power management which is throttling on the CPU and then Leo it just it's snowballed further
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:21.920]   And part of the problem is that there's always everyone keeps on saying that Apple's slowing down their phones so there's a conspiracy theory that's been kind of that this is it fits very well what people have been saying for a while which is
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:32.920]   Apple wants you to buy a new phone so when you get iOS 11 your older phone's not going to work as well and that's just to prod you into getting a new phone that's not for any technical reason
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:49.920]   Now let's give somebody let's give people a TLDR because CR1 and somebody in the chat room said I had explained this to every single family member yes the whole holiday season so let me try this for now and see if this represents it fairly
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:07:08.920]   Because batteries in phones age all batteries all batteries yes and at some point they won't be able to do the things they used to do Apple when in the operating system checks the battery if it's an older battery
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:36.920]   it will keep the up keep programs from doing things that are really taxing to the battery yes the choice would be the battery will shut down if it doesn't do this and that means the phone will show so Apple prefers to have a slower phone as you would probably a slower phone with an old battery that's still in the phone that crashes all the time or that still makes phone calls and this I learned today Apple's software checks the battery and if you put a new battery in
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:08:01.920]   it immediately gets paid immediately will speed up so it's not that the phone is old it's the battery is old and it should like the iPhone this only affects iPhone 6 iPhone SE iPhone 6S and with iOS 11.2 they're starting to bring iPhone 7 into it as well if you have an iPhone 5S earlier it will still shut down and it's also this is not unique to Apple there's reports as of yesterday of Samsung Galaxy notes shutting down
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:30.920]   and there's old stories about this is the second story which is HTC LG Motorola and Samsung all Android and set manufacturer said we don't do this which led more fuel to the fire because but no because like if you go back a couple even like one plus earlier this year and several years ago a Nantec and Geekbench caught them never running their CPUs at peak only for benchmark apps where they run them at peak and the reason Samsung gave in their statement was because they didn't want to overload the GPU or this is a new device that's not a good thing to do with it.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:43.920]   You can't really overload the GPU or the CPU and that's the same you have we have increasingly desktop quality processors in devices that have teeny tiny little phone size batteries and you can't balance those things you only have to make choices about which one you're going to.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:56.920]   You do in fact see this on even laptops you'll get an i7 on a laptop but because of thermal issues you'll never see it run at full speed it always be somewhat slowed down so this is similar to that.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:07.920]   iPads will like I pads the battery is so big that it doesn't people have been asking about that a lot of iPads the battery is so big the density so high that it never hit even when the battery the batteries have to get really really old before you start seeing any.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.920]   I expect a shutdowns or degradation so they don't do this and I had to only do this and I know.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:22.920]   Yeah he was fairly modern and but I guess it's an iPhone 6 s platform so it's the 6 6 s s e and now the iPhone 7.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:32.920]   But you wouldn't see this on a brand new s e or an s e this less than a year sold what what how old is the battery have to be before you start to see this apple only replace it when it hits 80% capacity.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:43.920]   Which is the magic number for them but you might see this when it starts going to around 85% which was also part of the problem because apple care didn't really understand it and they were refusing to replace batteries that didn't hit that magic number.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:57.920]   Even though damage is not always consistent like if you put your iPhone on a radiator leave it out in the heat in Arizona or on an air vent you know in a freezing cold New England day that he damages that battery far greater than age might otherwise integrate into games.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.920]   So apple got some heat.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:10.920]   If so to speak for at first for the conspiracy theory that they were doing this on purpose apples explanation seems to have calmed most people down.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.920]   But people are still mad at apple saying you should have communicated before.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:20.920]   And there's a 999 billion dollar lawsuit against apple.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:33.920]   I'm really bad about this because apple did like I don't know who was brief but apple did briefings for iOS 10.3.2 and their phone briefings where they sit you down and apple's marketing team are incredibly smart they all have engineering degrees they really know their products.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:43.920]   And they explain the issue and what they were doing to it and they talked about advanced battery power management and I never asked what that meant and I didn't bother to explain it but there's no magic involved.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:51.920]   They didn't hide it they just stop and nobody asked him well but no but they should have they should have they should have expressly said we are like we are doing exactly ABCD in order to fix.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:11:02.920]   But the term they use was advanced and I know what that power management is because like they thought all for thermals and I know I understand basically how the system works and it never occurred.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:09.920]   They never explained it I never asked and a year later I feel like complete moron and it's not entirely but I do feel my responsibility.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:26.920]   That's totally beside the point it's like I just just last month of the month before my Macbook battery started to die and I got a warning from the operating system saying hey your battery is starting to become really really unhealthy followed by hey your battery is definitely broken you definitely need to get it replaced right now.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:40.920]   So there's you have to we have to wonder what Apple's excuse was for not putting up some sort of a dialogue or some sort of a check box at some point saying hey I noticed that your battery is really really old I think you're going to want to take it back to get the battery replaced soon.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:55.920]   If you here's it's also making sure people know that if you go to the Apple Store they'll charge you only about like 99 bucks out of warranties 79 bucks or something when it's closer to warranty or release and just inform this people inform people that this is what's going on and this is what
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:09.920]   we're going to do to make your experience better and that people would have liked that as opposed to all the people that in the past year have come to me saying hey my battery for some reason my phone is really really slow all of a sudden I don't know why that's happened
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:25.920]   and people coming to the leaving to the conclusion that Apple has slowed has intentionally slowed down my phone because they want to get me to buy a new one at which point you know you have I have to explain to them that Apple is really really good at making you make an emotional decision
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:54.920]   to buy a new phone without without crippling your old one I mean this was clearly a problem over the past year and was something that as simple as tell the tell the pilot the status of their aircraft at all times don't there's no reason for Apple to have hidden this from the user so it doesn't matter whether Apple should have briefed the press or briefed other people about what was happening last year you tell the user that I'm going to make your phone go really slow right now and this is why I'm making that happen
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:13:03.920]   and if worse comes the worst if you would rather just have the phone die at 40% that's up to you but here's what's happening with your phone and what we want to do about it
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:22.920]   so there was a there was a problem with this though there was a dialogue Apple did put it into you into the battery settings but it wasn't a pop up you had to go look for it and also it seems to be triggered way too late in the cycle like you seem to be down throttled well before that dialogue I was actually talking to John pulling a podcast he's like I never got a dialogue and I oh there it is
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:41.920]   so you saw it how funny yeah which was much later than when he ran all his tests which isn't really helpful to him and I think it almost would have been better if Apple let your phone fail once you absolutely understand the problem and then when it came up that said your iPhone shut down unexpectedly we can manage this so it won't happen again but you will have reduced performance do you want to do that or do you want to make a genius appointment
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:14:10.920]   I think a lot of times you know Apple works pretty hard at not having people may have to make decisions you look like you know I think that's I mean I think that's if Apple fails in communication it's always that yeah it's always worth for you don't need to know this we're just going to handle it and they're right 99% of people wouldn't notice except for all the news stories right and it fits in with a conspiracy but I had like I think they did the right thing though because now they've announced final point in the story that they're going to offer battery upgrades 50 bucks off 29 bucks 29 bucks is great nothing yeah
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:39.920]   what are what are the what's the criterion for that do you have to prove that it's 85% or 80% was the old criteria but it's my understanding and I think Apple is going to talk about this later today it's my understanding that or they gave Mac rumors maybe a comment or better already they're going to start doing it way before they originally said they originally said they were going to do it mid January because they want a time to ramp up supply but they said they're going to start doing it now and they'll ramp up as they go and apparently they're not going to worry about the diagnostics like maybe if you bring a brand new phone in they'll say dude this is a brand new phone
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:49.920]   it's 100% you don't need a replacement but if your phone is anywhere on the you know as any sort of significant where to it I think you just going to replace it no questions asked
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:15:04.920]   your review are you called an unreview of the home pod emerged today as long with Neil I Patel and Joanna Stern Joanna likened it to the bottom half of a sesame bagel compared to a everything bagel
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:26.920]   she only knows New York bagels Leo so that can be that can be forgiven not much real bagels not the same you have my little friend here I think yeah you got it you've had it for a week when you were the reviews of the week yeah so one thing I learned from Neil I's Patel and Neil I Patel's article is that Apple has a materials department a soft materials department that made the rapper
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:42.920]   yes for the home pod the acoustically transparent cloth mesh and there's a cloth cord even yeah I can hold up I you know I hope this is more resilient than the lightning cords and the magsafe cords because they don't want it everywhere
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:52.920]   I know it's really beautiful it's hardwired though into the back of the home pod oh that's too bad yeah so you can't just buy it to slip it to South African power
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:16:11.920]   I have no idea what you're talking about Renee I think that's the rubber cord standards for cords are wonderful did your hamster get to that what the heck no just just life just just just just you know atmosphere air got to it it was a hard winter in Boston land Leo and we had to end yet to struggle to survive
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:30.920]   so my you know summary of the reviews I've read so far including yours Renee is it sounds really good sounds really good yeah yeah it really does there's a lot of technology here and you think you know Apple is not a speaker company but they've been slowly and quietly accumulating a ton of speaker talent over the last few years
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:41.920]   and they've added all their computational talent the same thing that let them make portrait mode on iPhone let them do this acoustic modeling in rooms and build out the system and they said this project has been going on for six years
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:58.920]   Niele and myself and some other people got to tour their their giant secret sound lab which was astonishing in its in its size and tools and stuff they had there and they deliberately created it to be able to make a 3D sound stage just from one one speaker
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:11.920]   and it just it really punches above its weight it's pretty cool to listen to so was this why you were in a cup of tin was for this tour yeah so you and Jim Dowernple has the article and pictures on the loop of it
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:20.920]   so tell us about this is this is the anechoic chamber that they use to test and of course every speaker company has one of these
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:46.920]   one of the other things that they used to do is to make a note of the other things that were the same thing that was happening in the book and that was very similar to the other things that were seen before and they were more rooms and those rooms were bigger and had more stuff in it and I think that's what happens when you have Apple's budget as we're learning later to show Apple is on a scale that no other company is on it's not a no it's totally and so it was one room that it was a room within a room that was being suspended
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:59.920]   and so I think that's a good thing to do is to make sure that you're not allowed to jump on as a trampoline I learned that very quickly and it has just cardboard accout there was sometimes it was cardboard accout
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:15.920]   sometimes it was foam acoustic tiling and they had these huge loop arrays of speakers and microphones they could beam stuff at the home pod pull stuff out of the home pod and just little little home pods in the middle of this whole room and was really cool is they had the iPhone team and they have a whole iPhone vibration team whose only job it is to make sure the iPhone doesn't buzz or make low frequency sounds or do other things to disturb you and to make sure that no matter where you put your phone in the room
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:44.920]   and to make sure that no matter where you put the headset on your ear it sort of tries to beam form the sound from the speaker into the position that you're holding it and they brought it in so that if you if you were sleeping there was no sound you wouldn't hear any buzzes or vibrations or anything from home pod or you wouldn't hear any sort of noise distortions and they went from room to room they had a bunch of Apple employees who were testing it and they got acoustic models back from them and they built a room that was the average of all the different environments that it was in and they could tweak that to sort of figure out what it was like with ambient noise
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:56.920]   and they had a room that was made out of concrete and steel feet and feet of concrete and steel that isolated all noise down to minus two decibels and when they closed that door it was just the most unnatural sort of feeling in the world
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:05.920]   and they're using that to test sort of like noise coming out of the device it was all super interesting after seeing all that it be you'd be hard pressed to not think this thing sounded better than anything else
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:31.920]   but does it really I mean yeah seriously can you put that out of your mind that they did all that and listen to it one of my concerns it's very easy and everybody does this you know there's what we what we haven't seen yet is the graph of frequency response which we used to see stereo review every time there's a new system they would have from 20 hertz to 20K you know the the frequency response and you want flat frequency response if you want an accurate speaker
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:52.920]   but as JBL learned early on and many others bows nobody wants a flat speaker you want a speaker that's tweaked to sound better which often means little bumps in the equalizer at certain places the problem with doing that is that it sounds better on some kinds of music and not on other kinds of music
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:20:19.920]   and that's one problem with a lot of modern day speakers is that they sound great with modern pop music but you Andy put them on your you know Donna Demerow thing on opera and it's not going to sound as good and that's tricky now I'd be interested Apple might be smart enough they're putting enough power in this thing it's got the brains of an iPhone 6 to know what kind of music is playing and to change even the frequency curve
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:32.920]   so does it sound fine across the board what is it have you did you do a curve do you know what it's curve is that see yeah no so I'm the opposite of an audio file and I was approaching this like wouldn't idiot like me actually even notice a difference compared to different speakers
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:42.920]   but they did explain as part of the tour that they did they made sure they did everything in those rooms to make it absolutely scientifically perfect to be that sort of that neutral speaker but you don't really want that I think
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:21:11.920]   no so then they handed it off to the the audio files at Apple and the people who are artistic about sound and they tuned it for human beings is there a way in the settings to say what the frequency responses not that I've seen and it does it is continuously modeling so it senses for any change in the room any it will sense changes in volume and remodelate everything so that the bass doesn't get deformed if it's too low or the volume is too high so it's continuously analyzing everything about itself and all the reverberation and echoes and everything
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:40.920]   and echoes and everything to make sure it sounds good so I don't know specifically that is adjusting for kind of music but it is always adjusting for whatever metrics it can pull out of the environment here's just for eye candy while we talk about it I just dean unboxing her home pod and probably she's not conscious of this but I noted she's not only wearing a series 3 Apple watch but also a slave shackle bracelet so she's got kind of the both worlds in there somehow it's bigger than I thought but maybe she's smaller than I thought I don't know
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:55.920]   it could be it could be either one nicely boxed as usual beautiful cable normaled into the speaker which is usually not a good idea because if it frays or breaks you have to bring it to Apple to fix or Burke Burke could fix it if you have if you have a Burke
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:06.920]   a round Apple sticker in there so did you play it on a variety of music every name yeah I asked it to play a bunch of like it asked to play a bunch it starts off when you set it up it asks you to ask for music right away because
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:21.920]   you don't have to do any sort of true play tuning or you put the little speaker in the room and try to find this way let's look at that because that she's showing the the manual which is a simple trifold like most modern manuals but the setup is really cool
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:35.920]   yeah tell us about that so it asks you to ask for a song and then it tries to pick a song based on its understanding of music that you've liked in the past and as soon as it starts playing that song it starts detecting the acoustics in the room and then it does all itself tuning
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.880]   self tuning, and that takes between like,
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.700]   one, two, three, maybe five seconds,
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.280]   and it has an accelerometer in it.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.300]   So anytime you move it, it'll automatically run that.
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:45.700]   - Oh, no. - So there's no separate.
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.220]   There's no separate audio runners.
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:49.560]   There's no like, (makes Australia sound)
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.380]   to go through, it just does it on its own.
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.700]   - I also note that it pairs instantly,
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:57.140]   just like the EarPods do, when you open up,
[00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:00.200]   when you put the phone near it, it just pops up.
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.660]   So you do, I think you'd have to have an
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:03.880]   iPhone or iPad, right?
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.400]   Do you use this? - Yeah, you absolutely do.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.840]   - So I have the whole setup, I put it up on
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.040]   iMore, on youtube.com/iMorevideo,
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.800]   but you have an iPhone or iPad,
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.600]   the little AirPods-like interface comes up,
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.920]   and you just tap your way through it,
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.360]   and there's a few choices to make.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.160]   And it's smart too, like if you have accessibility
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.600]   turned on in your phone, it'll automatically
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.720]   enable accessibility or touch accommodations,
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.520]   or any of the other accessibility features
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.240]   on the HomePod as is setting it up.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:30.360]   If you have Siri set to male American or female British,
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.600]   it'll copy that over for you while it's setting it up.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.160]   - Let me go to your iMore review,
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:38.400]   'cause I wanna show you're setting up of the HomePod
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.880]   instead of hers.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.280]   - Well, mine is just the setup,
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.080]   so you don't have to sit through the unbox.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.200]   I did a separate one just for the setup.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.000]   - Yeah, nice.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.440]   - But it works, sorry.
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.880]   - Oh, I was gonna ask, does,
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:55.880]   when you select your first thing for it to play,
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.240]   is the genre gonna influence how it sets up the device?
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.440]   Like this is going to be tuned towards
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.320]   folk acoustic as opposed to ear splitting metal.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:08.160]   - No, I mean, I just asked to play a podcast first,
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.640]   'cause of course I did.
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.600]   - So it's tuning in, that's probably the wrong thing, right?
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.320]   - No, totally, but then it'll,
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.680]   as you play more human music,
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.960]   like Proxico continues to adjust.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.960]   - Yeah, if it needs to.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.080]   And as it moves around or as a room changes,
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.240]   like if it's in the corner of a bookcase,
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.640]   it knows that compared to if it's against a wall,
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.320]   compared to if it's in the middle of the room,
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.080]   it senses all those differences in this environment.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.560]   And if it's in the middle of a room, for example,
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.000]   it'll use those seven tweeters
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.400]   to send sound 360 degrees around.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.280]   It's hard to think of it in terms of like stereo or 5.1.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.400]   It definitely takes the mix into account.
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.600]   It always wants to represent what the artist
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.000]   wanted to do with the song.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.080]   But then it takes that information
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.560]   and uses that to play sound in the room as best a can.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:49.440]   And if it's against a wall,
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.000]   it'll bounce stuff off the wall
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.400]   to get the same sort of effect,
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.000]   to do the center versus the ambient placement.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.920]   - So Renee, in his usual overachiever mode,
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:03.920]   wrote 10,000 words and a podcast and multiple videos.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.840]   So you really have, is this the setup video in here?
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:07.680]   This is the unboxing.
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.520]   - If you go halfway through,
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.720]   if you go halfway through, it'll start the setup.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.560]   - Yeah.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.600]   Yes, see, that's the look I like
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.240]   with a slate wall behind you, I like that.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.600]   - That's what I'm gonna have for the pod.
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.760]   I actually have an adapter to make that camera work with.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:19.960]   - Perfect, it's beautiful.
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.440]   - So there's that little trifold again.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.280]   - Yeah.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.640]   - But you know, it's nice, that's all you need.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.840]   - So would you use this instead of your stereo?
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.880]   I mean, is it that much better?
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.160]   - Well, the other thing I was gonna point out too,
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.480]   is it makes this little tone when you first start setting it up,
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.960]   that is the same thing as the pattern on an Apple Watch
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:36.880]   or iPhone when you set it up,
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.960]   or the code you type in for an Apple TV.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.960]   So it just knows that it's pairing to that device
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.360]   and you don't have to do anything else about it.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.040]   - Oh, you also placed it, it's asking
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.880]   where are you putting in the house?
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:47.920]   - If you have home kit setup,
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.520]   it'll ask you what room you're putting it in.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.680]   And that way, if you say turn off the lights,
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.080]   it knows you mean the lights in that room.
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.240]   You can say turn off all the lights,
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.140]   if you really want all the lights,
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.560]   but it's a where of which home kit room it's in, for example.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.000]   - Because of course, Apple wants you to have one for every room.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.600]   - Well, it's also useful for security.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.760]   So for example, you can say, I only want,
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.960]   I don't wanna let anybody airplay to it.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.720]   I wanna only let people who are on my network,
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.880]   which means you've shared your wifi password with them
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.440]   and you trust them, or I only wanna share it with people
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.840]   who have shared my home kit home with,
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.440]   which is generally only your family.
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.880]   And that prevents like Jim Dowerimple
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.640]   driving up and streaming Aussie Osborne to you
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.960]   in the middle of the night.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.960]   - Which he would.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.560]   - If he could, you know, he would.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.160]   - He totally would, just he wouldn't come back
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.280]   to Canada to do it, but yeah, no, he totally would.
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.880]   - I really, but that's cute.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.160]   - Well, yeah, and it says, you know,
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.760]   it says like, you can't tell, but I'm smiling.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.160]   It does all these little sort of, it's very human.
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.480]   I mean, like that's the one thing that I think Siri
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.960]   and Amazon get really right in that they make it almost
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.400]   like a character that you want to talk with.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.160]   And I get that Google is like, it's a Star Trek computer.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.000]   - We are, are all about.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   - But I find that a character is just more relatable.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.240]   And someone was asking me, like,
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.760]   they find it very uncomfortable to talk to it.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.240]   But I think if you think about it, like,
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:59.240]   the gym and synergy or, you know, Michael Knight and Kit,
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.480]   once it has a personality, it becomes more approachable to you.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:07.400]   - You, it sounds like you've got a new friend Renee.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.000]   - So I have a Sonos, I don't have it set up now,
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.440]   but I have a Sonos home theater system.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.480]   I've been using it for years.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.960]   I have like five or seven, so I'll speak because by now.
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.440]   - That's a fair comparison, yeah.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.840]   - And it sounds unmistakably, even to my non-audio file years,
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.800]   unmistakably better than Sonos.
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.360]   There was an audio file on Reddit who said
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.640]   it was about 20% better.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.200]   I don't know what that means,
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.880]   but I can hear that it's cleaner, it's crisper,
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.920]   it just sounds pressure-
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:30.760]   - Pressure and brighter to me.
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:31.600]   - Does the bass, yeah.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.600]   I could hear the brightness on it, but how about the bass?
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.440]   - The bass is good.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.000]   The only thing that I find weird about the bass is
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.840]   I'm used to having a Sonos sub, and, you know,
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.800]   that's big and boom, and it rocks the floor,
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.800]   and Apple went out of their way to make this not like,
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.800]   it sits on the shelf, and it's not supposed
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.560]   to knock itself off the shelf.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.400]   - I can't.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:51.120]   - So I do miss that, but if I didn't have Sonos,
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.440]   I would get this immediately.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:55.960]   And even though I have Sonos, when AirPlay 2 comes out,
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.000]   I would strongly consider, you know, I'm in dirt,
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.120]   I'm gonna do this anyway, but I was calling it
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.160]   consider a paired match of HomePods
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.680]   instead of a Sonos theater.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.080]   I just wish Apple had a dedicated sound bar mode.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.560]   If I wanted to, I want to say,
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.640]   just right now AirPlay is great, it's sticky,
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.400]   so you pair it to your Apple TV,
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.480]   it'll keep doing AirPlay.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.280]   If you ask questions, it'll pause what you're watching,
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.000]   answer the question, it'll say play pause, all those things.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.280]   But if you do anything else with it,
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.480]   if you do a different AirPlay stream
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.920]   where you ask for Apple music,
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.680]   you then have to go on and repair it.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.040]   And it's just swipe, swipe, click.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.800]   It's not hard, but it's annoying enough
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.760]   that I wish I could just say dedicate this HomePod
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:29.600]   to the TV.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.560]   I know what I'm doing, pretend it's a sound bar.
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:32.720]   - Right.
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.360]   I hope you're all gonna have a wonderful holiday season.
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.720]   I hope you enjoyed your turkey time.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:41.240]   Hanukkah's already common gone practically.
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.360]   But we're doing this, where are we doing this?
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:45.720]   Is this Christmas day?
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.600]   This is actually Christmas day?
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.920]   - This is the day after Christmas.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:54.240]   Or as I think of it, nugging time.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:59.600]   Oh, wow, that is good.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.880]   Somebody pointed out, say thank you
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.240]   that my eggnog had expired,
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.020]   but tastes brand new to me.
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:12.800]   One of the problems they had in the brand new campus,
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.760]   the Apple campus had opened up this year.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.260]   Apple Park, they called it,
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.360]   there's a lot of glass.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.160]   Actually, Steve Jobs had a big hand
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.280]   in the design of the new Apple Park,
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.160]   the round spaceship campus.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.960]   And he loved the idea of curved glass
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.600]   to tell a story about the Fifth Avenue Apple Store,
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.360]   which is, if you've seen it,
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.760]   it's kind of part underground, part above ground.
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.880]   They've redesigned it now,
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.360]   but in the original Fifth Avenue Apple Store,
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.760]   had this above ground.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.760]   It was all glass, the elevator down,
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.320]   or the staircase down.
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.360]   And Steve, when they were designing that,
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.160]   said, "Make the panes bigger, they're not,
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.160]   they're too small."
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.720]   And make 'em bigger, make 'em bigger.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.880]   The architect finally said, "Steve,
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:59.000]   this is also a wall, it has to hold up the roof.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.360]   If you make 'em too big, it'll all fall down."
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.400]   I think Steve got his wish though with Apple Park,
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.480]   but there was one little problem.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.800]   Well, watch.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:12.640]   911 recordings reveal.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.000]   There is a problem.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:15.880]   - You can giggle at this.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.080]   - You can giggle at this.
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.200]   - You thought iPhone 10 screenshots were a problem.
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.120]   You had no idea.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.880]   - There is a problem.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:26.360]   Houston, we have a problem at the new Apple campus.
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.720]   Apparently, the San Francisco Chronicle's
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:33.840]   done an investigation and has dug up some 911 calls
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.200]   like this one.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.120]   I walked into a glass door on the first floor of Apple Park
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.360]   when I was trying to go outside.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.160]   That's a January 4th, 911 call.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:45.200]   Two other calls made two days earlier, January 2nd,
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.560]   which was the day Apple employees started moving in.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.680]   We had an individual ran into a glass wall pane
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.000]   and they hit their head.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.520]   And Apple caller said on one of the calls,
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:55.680]   they have a small cut in their head
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.120]   and they are bleeding, slightly disoriented.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.680]   The other caller, we had an employee,
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.360]   he was on campus, he walked into a glass window
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.000]   hitting his head,
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.520]   has a little bit of a cut on the eyebrow,
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.280]   none life threatening, nor requiring hospital visits,
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.200]   but the chronicle is reporting
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.840]   that a city official in Cupertino,
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.160]   where the headquarters is located,
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.080]   warned Apple about the risk of absent mind employees
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.960]   walking into glass walls and doors.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:17.960]   They have to be marked.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.160]   - They're looking at their phone.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.920]   - Well, if you have these doors,
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.800]   we've had them for years, sliding glass doors
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.720]   in California, every house has them.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.200]   You put stickers on them, right?
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.880]   - Yeah, they were putting stickers up
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.000]   the last time I was there, which was months ago,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.480]   it was probably just a huge building
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.520]   and they didn't have all the stickers in the right place.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.440]   It's the same, I don't know if it's a sticklerist insult,
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.560]   the same thing you see in the glass, Apple stores,
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.320]   where they have sort of that frosted look
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:44.160]   at a round eye level when you walk towards the wall.
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:47.240]   - It's required by California's code of regulations.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:52.320]   You have to identify and address hazards in the workplace.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.200]   - I've walked into these walls, it's not funny.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.440]   - It isn't, it's damaging.
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.160]   - No, I haven't done that at Apple,
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.360]   but I've done that myself at a place at Twilight
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.960]   where they didn't, yeah.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.040]   There's a door to the left,
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.560]   there's entrance to the left,
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.000]   entrance to the right, there is just a wall,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.560]   floor to ceiling, pane of glass in the middle
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:11.480]   with nothing on it.
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:15.520]   Yeah, one of these bumps here is because of that.
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:16.360]   - So, yeah.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:19.080]   - Nobody went to the hospital, nobody was seriously injured.
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:23.800]   Apparently some birds have been seriously injured,
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.840]   no humans.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:29.760]   - Yeah, we've had folks get bloody noses,
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.680]   you know, at clients, you go, not at Apple's,
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.960]   but at, there's a lot of clients that we have
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:38.920]   that have a lot of glass in a lot of their offices.
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.560]   And we've definitely, we had one client
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.320]   who had almost all glass everywhere.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.920]   And one of our guys took a hit the glass really hard,
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.200]   you know, and so it's a pretty common problem
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.480]   with glass heavy solutions.
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.080]   This is not anything new to Apple.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:56.000]   I mean, it happens probably every time they build a new one.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.080]   And they go, oh, I didn't think that maybe we should put
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.560]   some markers, some lines.
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.720]   - Can I share with them?
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.720]   - Eventually it always ends up with designs.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.400]   - Can I share with them like a little trick
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.320]   that I came up with at my old place,
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.880]   I did have like, again, big sliding glass doors.
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.880]   And every time that I would get like a new iPhone,
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.880]   and remember when they used to have like those,
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.640]   those adhesive covers on them for this play purposes
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.440]   that had, I used to, I was used to play,
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.760]   when I was, as soon as I signed for the package,
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:26.040]   I could, I was wrestling to get to my office with it.
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.920]   I would peel it off, unpeal it and put it on the glass.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:31.160]   And yeah, I think that's what they should do.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.680]   They should revive shipping iPhones with stickers.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.000]   - I have a suggestion.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.200]   Now, what's your name?
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.680]   - What's sayin'? - Seth.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.760]   - Seth, Seth works in Reading, Pennsylvania,
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.880]   Reading California in the school district there.
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.120]   He's installed many Apple computers
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.720]   going back to Apple two days, right?
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.680]   - Many, many, many.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:56.480]   He brought me exactly what Apple needs,
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:59.200]   which is some rainbow Apple stickers.
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.040]   - Yes.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.000]   - Right, just put those on the windows, Apple.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.840]   That would be, it would fit in, it would be beautiful.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.200]   Would have some great memories.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.040]   - Seth, thank you.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.280]   This is, look, and guys, if you want me to send you some,
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.120]   I will.
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:11.960]   These are amazing.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:15.040]   Well, all three of you have gathered together
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:19.480]   to celebrate the, you know, if Apple buys texture,
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.160]   how long can it be before they buy me?
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:25.600]   I'm just saying, I'm for sale, I'm coming.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.560]   We don't know how much texture our sponsor,
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:30.440]   which is Netflix for magazine, $10 a month,
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.000]   gives you 200 magazines.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.600]   Now, an Apple property.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.720]   - You said you talked to them about their plans,
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.040]   Renee Richie?
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.560]   - Well, I started seeing different reports.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.360]   Like some reports said that Apple was gonna be full,
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.440]   that Eddie Q had said that Apple was gonna be folding it
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.280]   into the news app.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.120]   And when you, CNN did not make the video or the audio of it.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.400]   I mean, for a TV show, they did not make anything
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.800]   available immediately.
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.920]   So I managed to get, you know, thanks to the generosity
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:57.400]   of some people, I managed to get a bootleg copy
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.160]   and very carefully go through it.
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.000]   And the question was very leading.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.680]   - Is this of his South by Southwest talk?
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:04.680]   - Yeah, South by Southwest talk with, with Darrell.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.600]   And he said, you know, like the question was very leading.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.520]   Like what is texture gonna do for Apple news?
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.720]   And at the end, Eddie talked about the integration of them.
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.000]   And then a lot of people reported that
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.640]   as Apple folding it into Apple news.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:16.800]   And when I asked about it, they said like,
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.000]   no decisions have been made yet.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.200]   And that could just be them covering their bases
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.800]   because maybe that's what they're thinking of doing,
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.920]   but they don't know if it'll work out the way they want.
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.520]   Or if the subscription service is more valuable,
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.680]   some other plays or if it's gonna go in iBooks
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.600]   because that's gonna be, iBooks is gonna become books,
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.920]   a whole different app.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.040]   So there's a lot of possibilities.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.000]   I think they just wanna keep their options open,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.160]   but they did say a couple of things.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.520]   One is that they're gonna keep all the existing apps going
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.720]   'cause they have a big subscriber base.
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.520]   They have iOS, Android, Kindle Fire and Windows.
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.360]   I think Windows 10,
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.240]   but it might just be a generic Windows app.
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.760]   And all of those are gonna keep going
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.560]   and everyone who's gonna have the same functionality
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:48.800]   they've had before.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.520]   It's only available in the US and Canada,
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.680]   so it's not an international app by any means yet.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.960]   And it's partly owned by Rogers in Canada.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.320]   So strange partnerships there.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.320]   - But it was founded by--
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.720]   - I think it was founded by Connie Nast and hers.
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.960]   I think Meredith has a stake.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.760]   - To be a hoo for magazines, yeah.
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.960]   - Yeah, I mean, it's easy to see
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.280]   how a lot of the conversation got misconstrued.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:10.440]   He was, I thought it was a lot of interesting stuff
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:11.280]   he was talking about,
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.080]   about how the point he was making was that it was part
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:17.880]   of a larger sort of philosophical initiative
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:22.600]   to talk about the Apple News app as curated news
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.480]   as a place where at some point,
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:28.280]   some human with an IQ larger than room temperature
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.600]   has looked at this news article and said,
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.240]   "Okay, this is not garbage.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:35.640]   "We will let the Apple News app see this."
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:39.960]   And so he was talking about texture as magazine content
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.000]   because it's been bought and paid for
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   because it's not generally news of the last 45 seconds.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.120]   It's a little bit better vetted.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:52.080]   So he felt as though it's a better addition
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:56.120]   for that large portfolio of Apple News and Apple content as,
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.280]   this is a safe place.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:01.040]   You can trust what we're talking about right here.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:04.000]   I'm sure it'll go, it'll be Apple treat it the same way
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.480]   they did PRSS.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:10.960]   The digital magazine platform they acquired three years ago
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.600]   that was never heard from again.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.520]   They had a long record of, I mean,
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.840]   like there's the newsstand bodies
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.240]   delivering the streets,
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.800]   the Rupert Murdoch property,
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:21.880]   I'm blanking on the daily.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.320]   Oh yeah, the daily.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.560]   But those were shut down by the daily.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:29.360]   The PRSS is probably the closest thing
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.080]   to the texture acquisition.
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:33.840]   Apple bought them in September three years ago,
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.040]   almost four years ago.
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:39.240]   And if I go now to the PR, can you show my screen?
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.560]   If I go now to the PRSS website,
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:45.640]   it's a vital and growing concern.
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.640]   No, this red site cannot be reached.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.800]   They just basically took it over and shut it down.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:53.440]   So I think all bets are off as to what Apple might do with this.
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:56.440]   It's clear that Apple doesn't want an app
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.800]   called Texture in its portfolio, does it?
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.000]   Yeah, I could see that.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:02.840]   Really?
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.840]   Yeah, I'll start, go ahead, Alex.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:09.000]   I think that, I think one of the things
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.200]   that Apple may try to do,
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.720]   and maybe I'm wishful thinking.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.960]   So we don't know, but I think that it does give you access
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.120]   to the idea of approaching publishers
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:21.600]   to possibly add more content that is more interactive
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.240]   into the content that's being distributed.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:27.400]   So I think that the big texture is great.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.640]   I'm a subscriber, I'm a user.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:34.280]   But you still feel like this is still kind of taking
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:37.280]   an old technology and putting it into your iPad,
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.000]   as opposed to really building content
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.040]   that's designed for that next,
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.520]   whatever that next thing is.
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:46.720]   Well, I think that is, how all in is Apple on Apple News?
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.800]   Is that still important to Apple?
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.720]   It's both important and not it?
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:54.480]   It's not true, I'm sorry, I'll make it very quickly.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.440]   I think that Apple News is not so much the app itself,
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.760]   so much as the conduit,
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.600]   so long as it's part of that dashboard,
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.840]   the first thing you wanna look at when you wake up,
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.360]   and the thing you wanna keep dipping into as the day goes by,
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:08.040]   I think that's a very important strategic solution for them.
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.240]   So this would make sense as something that would,
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.400]   as Eddie Q did or did not say,
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.480]   what was the actual quote Renee?
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:19.160]   I actually spent part of the night transcribing it,
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.120]   so I would have it available.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.320]   So the question was, how does acquiring texture
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.520]   advance the grand strategy of Apple News?
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:28.120]   And at the very end, Q says that,
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.080]   well, basically I'll tell you what,
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.680]   the whole thing he says is I think there are a few things
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.360]   that we've always cared about at Apple News.
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.760]   First of all, we wanted to bring great articles
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.960]   from trusted sources in a beautiful layout,
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.160]   and that was the premise of Apple News we started with.
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.240]   If you do that, lots of customers will use it and love it.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:42.640]   Obviously texture with the brands I just told you about,
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.920]   they have magazines from Esquire,
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.200]   to Vanity Fair, to Times, to Sports Illustrated,
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:47.520]   some of the best magazines in the world.
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:48.720]   They have some incredible content,
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.080]   and content takes a long time to create.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.320]   So there are in-depth articles,
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.800]   and so we're really excited about bringing that
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.360]   into Apple News to augment all of the other stuff
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.280]   that we have from thousands of other publishers.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.960]   But the key to our key is curation.
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.040]   We want the best articles,
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.520]   we want them to look amazing,
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:05.120]   we want them to be from trusted sources
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.440]   so that we don't have a lot of the issues
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:07.800]   that have been going around in the marketplace.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.720]   >> So I can see why that was synopsized
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.760]   as they're gonna fold it into Apple News.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.800]   That's sort of what it sounds like.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:14.640]   The other point is--
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.680]   >> He is shorting your app in several ways.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.520]   Sorry.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.920]   It is shorting your app in several ways
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:21.280]   because it came out, it launched in the US,
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.960]   it quickly went to the UK and Australia,
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:23.960]   and then it stopped.
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.840]   Apple put out Apple Music in 100 countries
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.280]   the same time, the same day.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.360]   They haven't done that for news,
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.720]   but they have spent a lot of time improving
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:31.560]   the features of news.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:34.320]   It's got Siri-based machine learning intelligence.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.320]   They've been doing a wonderful job,
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.400]   now they're doing March Madness,
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.560]   but they did the Winter Olympics,
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:38.680]   and they did the Oscars.
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:40.040]   They've got a huge team of editors,
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.440]   they've hired an editor-in-chief.
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:44.200]   And I think what Apple sees is almost like
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.760]   they think they have part of Tim Cook's Mandate,
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.040]   and it was Steve Jobs' thing too.
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:49.560]   They want to save news,
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.280]   which sounds ludicrous on its face,
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.840]   but they look at Amazon and Google,
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.240]   and they have these problems where they basically
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.680]   took other people's content and monetized it
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.160]   and sucked all the revenue out of it,
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.880]   and it's destroyed a lot of publishers.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:01.080]   They said, "Come on, we'll put you in news,
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.760]   "we'll put you in Facebook video."
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.920]   And then he turned on and said, "Oh, sorry,
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:06.240]   "we don't mean it," and those companies went bankrupt.
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.920]   And I think that Apple has almost like
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:10.560]   an Aaron Sorkin-esque romantic feeling
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:13.120]   of what news can be and what news should be,
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:16.920]   now it can power and inform and create communication.
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.480]   And they want to, as much as they can,
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.520]   use iOS as a platform for doing that,
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.000]   similar to how when they acquired Beats,
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.320]   they use that as a platform,
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.000]   sort of created an all-encompassing music library
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.240]   in the sky.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:29.880]   - Yeah, advertising came up a lot
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:32.040]   during that conversation in which this,
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:33.840]   when you're getting content from these magazines,
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.360]   you're not necessarily getting content
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.920]   that needs to be subsidized by advertising.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.320]   This is a point that Eddy Q was making
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:42.040]   that whereas stuff that comes online,
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:43.720]   at some point you have to get people to click,
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.880]   you have to get people to actually imprint
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:46.880]   and add on the thing.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:50.000]   And this will help to elevate the level of content
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.280]   to have this texture content.
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:55.720]   It's more complicated than that, however,
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:42:00.600]   a lot of the, you forget about how much newspaper
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:05.480]   ad revenue came not from people advertising,
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:09.520]   the things that you see advertised on the web typically,
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:11.320]   but you're talking about classified ads,
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.960]   you're talking about legal ads,
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:15.480]   you're talking about just like the weekly,
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.400]   the weekly supermarket supplement,
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.280]   you're talking about things that they,
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.160]   things that would have gone away anyway,
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:26.320]   unless someone fire bombed an LCD plant
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:29.480]   and made sure that phones and tablets never existed.
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.840]   So it's a little bit more complicated than that,
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:34.520]   but this is the first time I've heard Apple talk about news
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.440]   as something other than, oh, well,
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:38.000]   these other people have this app,
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.520]   we're gonna have this app too.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.400]   It's interesting for them to brand it
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:45.360]   as part of their overall company identity as look.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:48.200]   It's a nightmare out there because of largely,
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:51.360]   because it's ad based and profile based content.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.120]   We're a safe place where you can be.
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:54.960]   We're not gonna tell you that it's the safest,
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:59.960]   it's a objectively no danger of anything happening everywhere,
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:03.480]   but at least you can trust if you click on an Apple News app
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:06.440]   that there are fewer shenanigans going on
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:10.360]   than maybe you would find elsewhere on Facebook and Google.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.200]   - Is the business model for texture,
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:13.680]   is it the same as Netflix where,
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.360]   or not necessarily Netflix, but let's say,
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:17.040]   Alinda.com or something like that,
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:20.560]   where are they, everyone getting the equal amount of income
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:25.560]   or are they getting per sub like we would with cable?
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.600]   - They haven't said, they haven't said anything.
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:28.520]   - They haven't said anything used.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:29.840]   - 'Cause that'd be really interesting to see.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.840]   - So they haven't disclosed almost anything.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:34.480]   - Right, 'cause it's interesting to know
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.880]   whether it's based on how many people are reading
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.600]   your magazine as opposed to,
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:40.920]   like maybe you get a base amount per sub
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:44.640]   and then a higher amount based on usage.
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:47.360]   And I just be curious how that looks,
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:50.320]   but I do think that what Apple gets access to,
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.480]   depending on how they use it,
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.920]   is a lot of walled gardens,
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.560]   a lot of the content in those magazines
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:57.880]   is not ending up in Facebook,
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:00.880]   is not ending up in a lot of these things
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.080]   because they don't make it available
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:03.080]   unless you're a subscriber.
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:04.840]   And so I think that those are things
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:08.160]   that are now going to be accessible in the news feed
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:12.600]   that haven't been, you know, in an increase that.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.040]   If you feel like you can publishing through,
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.040]   texture is gonna give you a larger market
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.680]   and you can end a sustainable market,
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.040]   you may be more interested in doing that
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.920]   than putting it up on the web.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:22.760]   - Yeah, particularly thinking--
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:23.880]   - For publishers.
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:29.720]   But particularly if this deal gives them the launching pad
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:32.400]   from which develop deeper relationships
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.960]   with magazines like the New Yorker, with Esquire,
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:37.840]   because they have deep, deep, deep content.
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:40.720]   And so we're not just talking about nostalgia buffs
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:42.840]   who would like to read,
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:46.800]   Frank Sinatra has a cold by Harlan Ellison,
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:47.920]   which I recommend you because you seek
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.520]   and find out because it is a hell of an article.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.360]   But it means that when there's a piece of news
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.760]   like when Harlan Ellison finally dies,
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:56.160]   there's gonna be lots of obituaries,
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.440]   but here is the place you can find
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:59.400]   one of his most important pieces of writing
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.800]   and it will surface right to the top.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.320]   When there is-- - If you look for that one though,
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:03.720]   you won't find it, it's gay to least.
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:04.800]   But other than that, yeah.
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.400]   - I'm sorry, my part.
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.800]   - I would like to read Harlan Ellison's version of that.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:13.800]   - I forget because one of the key scenes
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.920]   in that is Harlan Ellison picking a fight.
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:19.400]   It's a wonderful article, which everybody should read.
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.320]   More of our holiday special coming up in just a bit,
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:22.560]   but you know, this time of year,
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:25.320]   it's a stressful time for all of us.
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.120]   New Year is coming, right?
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:31.000]   And it would be also a good time to make a resolution,
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.080]   maybe about handling stress in your life,
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.920]   finding a new way to be calm.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.280]   It's our new sponsor, Calm.
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.640]   Calm, C-A-L-M.com.
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:44.640]   The number one app to help you meditate, to help you sleep,
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:45.720]   to help you relax.
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:48.800]   Apple's app of the year last year,
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:51.480]   part of Apple's Best of 2018 list this year.
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:56.480]   If you head to C-A-L-M.com, I have to say it carefully,
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:01.720]   C-A-L-M.C-O-M/MacBreak, we've got 25% now, this is calming.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:06.080]   25% off a Calm, premium subscription,

[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:13.120]   I really love listening to Calm.
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:15.480]   Yeah, if you go to the webpage,
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:17.120]   you'll get an idea of what I'm talking about.
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:17.920]   It's just beautiful.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:19.800]   Guided meditations.
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.080]   They cover a lot of the kinds of issues
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:26.320]   our modern lives are filled with anxiety,
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:29.620]   stress, focus is nice.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.160]   There's a brand new meditation every day
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.560]   that you might wanna just do the daily Calm.
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:37.080]   I like that.
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.080]   You notice I'm talking more calmly.
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:41.640]   There's also sleep stories.
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.880]   This is really kinda cute and fun,
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.960]   bedtime stories for adults, I guess.
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:48.440]   Designed to help you relax before you doze off.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:50.800]   And you know, they have some of the best people.
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:53.480]   My favorite is Lavender Fields.
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:56.960]   Stephen Fry, he takes you to the Lavender Fields of France.
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.120]   Kimmy would like that.
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.920]   She would immediately know we're in Lavender Fields.
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:03.680]   Of course, his wife is a Lavender expert, apparently.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:04.800]   Didn't know that.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:09.000]   Explore New Zealand with Game of Thrones Jerome Flynn.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.360]   Wouldn't that be fun?
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.120]   I love those British accents.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:15.000]   They help you drift right off.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.560]   For a limited time, Mac Break Weekly,

[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:41.680]   Maybe it's Boxing Day.
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:45.360]   Did you forget somebody on your list?

[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:05.960]   A Mac Break Weekly.
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:07.880]   Now back to our best of.
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:12.760]   I'm looking at the picture of the line
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:16.720]   waiting to get in at Chicago's Lane Tech College,
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:19.920]   which is despite its name, a high school.
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:23.120]   Lot of people in the rain waiting to get in.
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:25.640]   It's a big school early on.
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:29.240]   Tim Cook said it produces more PhDs
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:30.880]   than any other high school in America.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.160]   Of course, they don't get their PhDs there,
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.640]   but they go on to get PhDs.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.640]   And it seems like it was a very good place
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:37.480]   to have this event.
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:39.440]   It is a public school in Chicago.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:44.480]   Apple had, you know, there was a lot of speculation
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:45.640]   about what Apple would announce,
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:48.560]   but I can in a nutshell tell you what they announced,
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.000]   which was kind of what the minimum speculation was.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.560]   A new sixth generation iPad,
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:58.240]   featuring the A10 Fusion processor and pencil support.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:01.200]   No smart connector for the keyboard, just pencil support.
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:04.480]   And it will be $329, the base price of the,
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:08.960]   least expensive iPad up to now, $299 for educators.
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:12.120]   That's a 32 gig storage device.
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:14.720]   So it's kind of a minimally configured device.
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.680]   They still, nothing new about the pencil,
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:18.560]   except a $10 price drop for education,
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:20.560]   it'll be $89.
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:23.640]   And there were a lot more software announcements
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.320]   than there were hardware announcements,
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:27.480]   although they did point out that Logitech
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:31.120]   is going to offer a $49 pencil for the new iPad.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.880]   I presume with iPad Pro pencil capabilities,
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.760]   they're calling it a, I think it looks like a crayon.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.280]   It's a digital crayon.
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:42.200]   And their Logitech is offering a $90 a keyboard
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:44.720]   designed for this particular iPad,
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:47.680]   neither of which the crayon nor the keyboard
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:49.160]   will be available to the general public,
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:53.520]   but only to educators and students through Apple Education.
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:54.880]   So it'll get your hopes up.
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:56.960]   It will be available later this summer.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:01.960]   You can get though, the new $329 sixth generation iPad
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:03.680]   is available for order today,
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:05.440]   and you'll be able to pick it up
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:08.320]   or get it delivered by the end of the week.
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:09.880]   - And this was not a big price drop,
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:12.640]   but just more features in the same price.
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:13.920]   - Yeah, I mean, or,
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:16.080]   which is, I'm frankly a little disappointed.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.520]   And I think, you know, what Apple is trying to do
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:21.960]   was get into the education market
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:25.720]   to fend off a real significant challenge,
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.320]   as we've talked about before,
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:30.400]   from the Google Chromebook.
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:34.240]   And I thought one way to do that would be to offer
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.600]   a lower price.
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:37.360]   They decided not to do that.
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.800]   They do say it's faster than a Chromebook.
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.600]   Somehow I don't know if schools really care about that.
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:44.920]   (laughing)
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:48.520]   And then they talked a lot about software,
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:51.360]   and there is a lot of new software designed specifically
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:52.760]   for the classroom.
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:56.400]   I'll show you one of the videos they call homework.
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:57.240]   (laughing)
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:59.200]   - Settled please, eyes up here.
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.200]   Eyes up here, we're not done.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:05.480]   Group three, let's have Ivy and Michaels.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:07.680]   - Ivy is not excited, nor is Michael.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:12.360]   - Ryan, Sally, and Tophas.
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:15.160]   None of them too excited or thrilled
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:17.800]   because they're about to get homework.
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:18.720]   - Your homework?
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:20.920]   It's to explore...
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:23.200]   - Gravity.
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.360]   - She pointed out he did not drop an iPad.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:29.520]   And in fact, one of the weird things about this
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:31.120]   is all the kids have iPads,
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:33.200]   but none of them are in cases, which,
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:34.040]   (bell ringing)
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:35.120]   of course, whatever happens.
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:37.120]   - But Apple never shows them in cases.
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:37.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:38.800]   - They need cases for Friday.
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:40.760]   - Keyboard cover on that one.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:41.600]   - Homework.
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:43.280]   - I think we should show them.
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:44.120]   - Homework.
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:46.200]   - Now I think, I'm not sure maybe, Tanya,
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.560]   it sounds like a shell silver steamed poem.
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.160]   - It is, it is actually.
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.840]   - Homework, homework, or something like that.
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:53.320]   Yeah, it's shell substance.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:54.160]   Okay, listen.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.160]   - Work.
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.000]   - Oh, homework.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.320]   (laughing)
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:00.000]   I hate you.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.280]   - You're buying a watermelon.
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:04.320]   - Now we should get worse, you'll win, first thing.
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:05.480]   - The best, guys, ready?
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:06.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:09.440]   - If only a hippo would smash you to bits.
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.280]   - It dropped.
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:14.320]   - And then a watermelon off.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.160]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:16.160]   - And it tastes good.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:19.520]   - Oh, man, that's amazing, yeah.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.080]   - That's gonna be part of their gravity.
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:23.320]   - We're gonna take baths with a man eating shark.
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:24.720]   - Notice the use of the pencil.
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:27.360]   - Oh, well, I am alone in the dark.
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:28.880]   Eat spinach and liver.
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:32.200]   That 10, 14 times.
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:34.080]   - Dropping a mattress off of a balcony.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.480]   The parents are gonna love that.
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:36.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:38.000]   - That's it.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.360]   - Making videos.
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:41.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:43.800]   - Gravity-free environments.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:46.200]   - It's a lot of work these kids are putting in.
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:48.640]   I think Apple's saying, "Oh, I'm work."
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:51.320]   Oh, homework.
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:53.840]   - The kids are doing this because they have iPads, right?
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:56.640]   'Cause otherwise they just be sitting at home.
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.360]   - You watch a TV. - Last time I left.
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:04.440]   Why simply can't see why you even exist?
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:07.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:10.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:13.760]   - So the most creative kids I've ever heard of.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:21.440]   If you just disappeared, it would tickle me pink.
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:25.240]   - Next up, group three.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.320]   - Homework.
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:27.480]   Oh, homework.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:29.680]   I hate you.
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:34.600]   And that is showing their video.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:40.200]   But we won't get to see it because we are adults.
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:41.560]   - Adults. - But I'm sure it was amazing.
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:43.120]   I'm sure it was wonderful.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:47.640]   - So they have some new software
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:52.320]   that will let teachers monitor classroom performance,
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:55.120]   share assignments with kids.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:56.520]   The biggest, I think the biggest announcement
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:57.640]   from my point of view,
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.200]   from most people watching point of view
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:01.320]   is they're finally gonna update iWork.
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:03.520]   And it looks like, and I bet you have some interest
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:04.760]   in this, Alex.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:06.040]   They're gonna take iBooks Author,
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:07.680]   which you were really excited about when it came out,
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:09.960]   but really did not take the world by storm.
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:14.040]   And they're gonna fold all of its capabilities into pages.
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:14.960]   So--
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.560]   - Well, we'll see if they fold all of them
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:17.880]   or most of them.
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:20.320]   So I have a feeling that, I mean, for me,
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:23.240]   this is kind of falling backwards a little bit,
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:28.080]   as far as going from iBook Author to pages.
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:29.720]   I mean, pages is fine.
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:31.680]   And I'm sure that it'll be more,
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:32.800]   you'll get more books out of it
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:34.480]   than having a separate application.
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:35.480]   Now people can just use that.
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.760]   I think that not a lot of people use iBooks Author,
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:38.960]   and not a lot of people use pages,
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:40.280]   and so maybe you can get them to combine
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:41.560]   into a reasonable number of people.
[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:45.040]   So I think that pages has always been, for me,
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:46.440]   a little heavy.
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:47.760]   It just feels heavy when you use it.
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:50.000]   It's not as responsive.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.160]   It has lots of great media tools
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.840]   that just feel slow when you're working with them.
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:56.880]   So it's not something that I've used,
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:58.160]   that I even use heavily.
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:00.720]   And so I think it'll be,
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:03.840]   to create something that is a slightly better book,
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:06.080]   I think that pages is gonna be great.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:08.240]   I still think they're missing the opportunity
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:09.920]   to build something great.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:14.720]   - The new pages will have pencil support.
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:17.000]   Users will be able to add drawings,
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.520]   and use something called smart annotation.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:21.800]   The underlines and annotations
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:23.720]   aren't just illustrations sitting on the page.
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:25.360]   They're somehow attached to the words around them.
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:27.680]   So I guess when you reflow the document,
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:31.080]   the annotations, you can see here in this animation
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:33.040]   that go all around with it.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   Pages will also allow book authors
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.960]   to include photos, videos, graphics from Apple Pencil,
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:44.360]   and more share finished books into iBooks.
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:48.800]   That was kind of one of the key features of iBooks Author.
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:51.680]   Group authoring will be enabled.
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:53.200]   Teachers can, in fact, group support
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:56.480]   for all the iWorks apps will be enabled.
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:59.680]   Teachers can annotate, send in documents to mark work.
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:01.280]   There'll be a new presenter mode in pages
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:04.600]   transforming the iPad into a teleprompter.
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:06.200]   You can set a screen of text to Autoschool
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.720]   and an adjustable speed.
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:12.840]   And then there's a new app that teachers
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:16.080]   called Schoolwork, which lets teachers
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:18.380]   dole out digital assignments to students.
[00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:22.880]   Apple also talked a little bit about
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:26.800]   the augmented reality capabilities of the new iPads.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.360]   Actually, it's the same as the old iPads,
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:29.800]   except there's a faster processor,
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:33.360]   but they did point out that there are gonna be
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:37.000]   a lot more AR apps for students in education.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.880]   Schoolwork will also support ClassKit.
[00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:44.360]   We'd heard about ClassKit before it's in iOS 11.3.
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:46.320]   That means third party, third party apps
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:49.800]   can link into and out of schoolwork.
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:52.320]   So I imagine that'll happen as well.
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:55.320]   I am not an educator.
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:59.560]   I've had some, you know, I've worked as a trustee
[00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:00.960]   for a high school for six years,
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:03.840]   and I have had kids as you have Tanya in school
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:05.920]   as you have Alex as well.
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:07.120]   I'm not blown away by this.
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:08.680]   I actually had hoped Apple would do maybe
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:09.960]   a little bit more for education.
[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:11.800]   It's great that Apple celebrated education,
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:14.360]   but I thought they would do a little more.
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.120]   You agree, Tanya?
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:16.680]   Disagree. - All right.
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:19.560]   Well, it seems incremental.
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:23.360]   There's nothing here that's really surprising,
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:28.080]   but it seems as though Apple is kind of waving their hand
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:32.400]   and saying, "Hey, we are thinking about education
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:36.320]   "and we are taking some baby steps."
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:38.280]   And a couple of the steps they take,
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:41.320]   I think the schoolwork application,
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:44.200]   we have to see how it will really work in the real world,
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:47.080]   but it seems like a positive step.
[00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:51.880]   And one thing that I noticed was that they will now
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:55.760]   be supporting on these iPads bot for education,
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:59.480]   the ability to have more than one account on an iPad.
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:00.640]   - That's huge. - That's kind of
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:04.240]   awfully interesting, and particularly for a school
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:08.440]   that's trying to get iPads into the classroom,
[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:11.480]   but they can't afford one iPad per kid.
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:14.640]   That could be pretty huge, depending on how it works out.
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:17.800]   We don't want the kids to have to spend 20 minutes today
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:20.280]   just logging in and out of their iPads, of course,
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:23.520]   but hopefully it will be much more smooth and elegant.
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:28.120]   So it feels like Apple's putting a number of things out there,
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:32.760]   kind of almost to see what might become most popular,
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:34.600]   most used.
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:37.760]   They've got the AR, they've got the idea that kids
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:41.280]   could be doing a lot of digital media creation,
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:43.960]   they've got the pencil now,
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:48.920]   a much more affordable iPad that you can now use the pencil with.
[00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:53.120]   So it gives teachers a lot of different directions and schools,
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:54.360]   a lot of different directions.
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:58.920]   They could start moving ahead in if they so wish.
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:04.240]   Apple, also, I think by making this announcement
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:06.600]   and choosing to go in this direction,
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:10.640]   they're saying once again that they're really not planning
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:14.440]   to come up with anything like a Chromebook competitor.
[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:16.760]   They're doing something really different.
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:18.120]   - Yeah, this isn't so different at all.
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:20.400]   In fact, Apple showed things like this,
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:24.480]   you know, dissect a frog application, frog-opedia,
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:26.560]   so you can dissect a frog with a pencil with,
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:28.800]   but not a real frog.
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:30.160]   But this has been around for a while.
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:33.880]   What's new is that you can use a pencil to do the dissection.
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:36.720]   It's an augmented reality app.
[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:39.400]   It might be better using a pencil in your finger.
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:41.360]   But yeah, I'm actually a little disappointed.
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:44.720]   I was hoping to see more frankly from Apple,
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:46.760]   not necessarily more hardware,
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:50.360]   but just more aggressive support for education.
[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:55.160]   Maybe even some subsidies and bigger discounts.
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:57.840]   It doesn't feel like this is something
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:00.720]   that is gonna change the equation
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.320]   when it comes to schools in the iPad.
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.160]   Alex?
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.320]   - Yeah, I don't think they're trying to take over.
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:08.560]   I think that they are taking the schools that are on the edge
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:10.440]   and trying to lean them a little bit their direction.
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:13.160]   So they're handling a bunch of the management issues
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.000]   that were definitely way behind
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.240]   and then trying to show where they stand out
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.080]   against the Chromebook.
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:21.400]   There's just a lot of those very interactive,
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:24.120]   very fun things that they're showing there
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.160]   are definitely more difficult to do on a Chromebook
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.640]   than they are on an iPad.
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:28.680]   They're obviously not,
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.000]   they're not trying to be a Chromebook
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.240]   because that's gonna be harder to go down that path.
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:35.040]   But I do think that they are trying to show
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:38.520]   where they try to look for areas in the education market
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:40.840]   where they exemplify.
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:44.440]   - The big story of the week this week
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:48.760]   comes from Matthew Panzorino in a tech crunch.
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:52.160]   I don't know, he didn't mention anybody else being there.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:56.720]   He was one of the five journalists invited to Apple last year
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:59.640]   during the famous apology tour where Apple said,
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:00.960]   "Oops, we blew it.
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.640]   The Mac Pro is a dead end.
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.920]   We have painted ourselves into a corner
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:08.800]   and we won't have one for you this year,
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.720]   but we're working on a new one."
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:14.840]   Matthew went back almost exactly a year later to Apple
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:18.480]   and got a little peek under the kimono
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:23.480]   and there is a Mac Pro, but it won't be ready this year.
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:28.400]   - Yeah, wouldn't it be great if they'd at least showed off
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:31.840]   something, I think one of the nicest things,
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:35.000]   one of the most valuable things that came out of that piece
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   was Apple's acknowledgement that their normal position
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.320]   of utter secrecy and denial until they actually unveil the thing
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.560]   was not working out for people who have to make plans
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:50.920]   for buying new hardware at a certain set rate of time.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:53.840]   So they made the point of one of the reasons why
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:55.160]   they're conducting these interviews
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.960]   and making these semi announcements was to reassure people
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:01.720]   that here's what we can show you to reassure you
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:04.520]   that if you are gonna be in a position,
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:07.320]   we're gonna need new hardware in 2019,
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:08.520]   we might have something for you,
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.440]   but if you need something this year,
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.120]   you best make other plans
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:15.000]   because that really does, it really caps a lot of people.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.280]   - I think that's so true.
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.600]   I think, I know a lot of people who,
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.520]   they're always asking me about whether or not
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:21.800]   they should upgrade their Mac
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:24.680]   and when it comes to professional Macs,
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.760]   this is definitely something they need to know,
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:30.000]   should I invest now,
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.840]   should I put this on this fiscal year,
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:34.360]   should I wait, is there's gonna be something in September
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:37.120]   if I buy now, did I just waste my money?
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.160]   And I think it was really smart on Apple's part
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:42.360]   to be transparent about the fact that it's not coming this year
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:43.800]   and it'll be here next year,
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:46.480]   but they didn't even give us a specific timeline next year,
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:47.800]   could be in the first quarter,
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:48.920]   it could be at the end of the year,
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:50.640]   but I think it was really smart
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:53.640]   to kind of let us know, let the professionals know
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:57.320]   that if they're thinking of buying
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:01.080]   that they're not gonna get a new Mac Pro until 2019
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:04.720]   and if this has to do with keeping your financial records
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.680]   together, you might go ahead and purchase
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:09.240]   at least some of those professional grade Macs
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.720]   before the end of the quarter
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.480]   because you're not gonna get anything new until 2019.
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.760]   All right, I'm gonna give you the negative spin.
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:19.080]   (laughing)
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.040]   - That's not a surprise.
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:24.160]   - Apple's saying, please buy an iMac Pro.
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:27.800]   They're saying, I mean, you're right, it's that message,
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:30.400]   but you feel like you're saying,
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:31.760]   oh, isn't this wonderful?
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.600]   But really what it's Apple saying is,
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:35.640]   look, just buy the iMac Pro.
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:37.200]   Please don't wait for a Mac Pro,
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.000]   I understand that's a benefit to some people
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.320]   and I even said they should tell people
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.600]   if they're gonna make something this year or not,
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:45.200]   but it may could also really be that they're saying,
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.680]   you know, buy the iMac Pro, please, buy the iMac Pro.
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:53.760]   - I don't know that that's really what they're saying though.
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:58.760]   I mean, do we want, the choice here seems pretty clear.
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:05.440]   Apple can try and release something because people expect it
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:08.840]   or they can wait, make sure it's ready
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:11.560]   and a whole new modular design,
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.200]   whatever that turns out to be
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.800]   and whatever the form factor turns out to be,
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:18.800]   will be released when it's actually ready to go.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.320]   Imagine if they released something
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:24.060]   that really wasn't up to what they wanted.
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.200]   People would be all over it,
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:29.200]   we'd be slamming them saying, why didn't they wait?
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:31.920]   So instead of doing that, they come out and say,
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:34.400]   we're not gonna have it this year.
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.880]   You know, make your plans, if you wanna buy an iMac Pro,
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:39.200]   that's, you know, people can do that.
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.320]   It is a powerful machine,
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:44.200]   but if you wanna wait for this new modular design,
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:48.000]   then here's our sort of timeline.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.160]   - Yeah. - Next.
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:50.560]   - He really has to do it, Matt.
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:51.400]   - That's not a bad thing.
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:54.760]   - We did see that with the previous Mac Pro, to be fair.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:57.600]   Here is something that you have not been asking us for.
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.520]   That does not meet your needs as you choose
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.040]   to define them.
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:01.880]   Good luck.
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:04.600]   - But innovate my ass.
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:09.360]   Tom Boger, Senior Director of Mac Hardware Product Marketing,
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:10.680]   Panzerino quotes him as saying,
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.880]   we know there are a lot of customers today
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:15.920]   that are making purchase decisions on the iMac Pro
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:18.920]   and whether or not they should wait for the Mac Pro.
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:20.680]   He doesn't finish that sentence.
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:24.840]   But I think the, I can finish it.
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:25.680]   Don't wait.
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.640]   Right?
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:31.560]   - Well, that's correct to a certain extent.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.760]   Again, it's valuable to let people know
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:36.040]   that if you were holding off for, let's say, WDC,
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:38.440]   particularly to say that I bet that they're gonna announce
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:41.760]   something then to have at least a year in advance,
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:44.080]   knowing that no, nothing is coming in 2018.
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:46.160]   You don't need to, you don't need,
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.480]   if this isn't waiting for good though,
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:50.280]   you may as well leave the barren spot with the tree,
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.520]   go back to your motorhome with the microwave oven
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:55.160]   and the TV 'cause you're gonna have to dig in.
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:58.280]   I think Apple is also savvy enough to know
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:03.280]   that a lot of people, this frees up them to not simply say,
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.200]   well, I'm just gonna have to buy an iMac.
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:07.080]   It does free up a lot of people to think,
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.680]   okay, this is where I switched to Windows
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.240]   because I can't wait another year and a half
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:12.240]   or whatever. - That's not what I meant.
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:14.040]   - That is not the most important sentence.
[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:17.320]   So I know that that's what you meant, but that's it.
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.240]   That is part of the effect.
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:24.240]   - There are a lot of pros that will wait.
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.560]   - Yeah.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:29.560]   - And some of those industries, including music,
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:33.200]   are already a bit further behind than,
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.360]   - No, interesting.
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:35.600]   - You know, what they already have
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:40.240]   because in music, I don't know about video or photography,
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:44.800]   but in music, once you get your system set up,
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.360]   you leave it alone.
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:49.040]   Sometimes there's no updates, there's no nothing
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:51.360]   because it's working, it's recording,
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:54.120]   and any downtime is money.
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:56.200]   And if they do get a new machine,
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:59.760]   a lot of times they'll run that in parallel
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:02.640]   to the old machine that they know works.
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:05.240]   So you know that a new machine is gonna come
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:08.000]   with the newest operating system,
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.800]   and a lot of times that won't work
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:12.000]   with some music software until it's updated.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.320]   - That's a good point, yeah.
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:18.320]   - Even my music machine, the one that I record
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:22.360]   all my things on in Logic and Pro Tools
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:25.840]   is always an operating system behind.
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:29.640]   So I'm not running high-sear on that intentionally
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:31.560]   because it works right now.
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:34.680]   And I know when I go in and I plug in my guitar
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:37.840]   and I set up the mics, I get everything rolling,
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.440]   everything is gonna work.
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:41.680]   If I update something, it could break.
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:45.360]   So my point is for those industries,
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:48.200]   it's not necessarily a bad thing
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.920]   that they're waiting a year.
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:53.520]   You know, they're not gonna care that much.
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:57.600]   Next year, yeah, studios may bring one in.
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:59.560]   - But you're not, I'm gonna bet, Jim,
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:02.320]   you're not using the trashcan Mac Pro either.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:05.360]   - I am not amusing an iMac.
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:08.040]   - Yeah, so you, 'cause that's the real problem.
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:11.520]   People who bought, as I did, a Mac Pro in 2013
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:15.280]   are now sitting in year five, saying,
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:19.800]   oh, another year, right?
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.800]   But I don't think that any of those--
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:22.800]   - They're gonna buy an iMac Pro.
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:25.480]   They're gonna, well, they may, they may.
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:28.200]   - That's a definite option with the iMac Pro
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:30.120]   being as good quality as it is,
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.880]   but I think that was one of the reasons why Apple
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:35.240]   kind of went for that is that they're not,
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:38.080]   the Mac Pro is just not gonna be ready in time.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.280]   So here's the supplement.
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:41.360]   If you really feel like you have to upgrade,
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:44.680]   if you can't wait, here's the iMac Pro and it works great.
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:48.120]   And it's gonna satisfy a lot of people's needs.
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.760]   But at the same time, just like Jim is saying,
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:54.520]   it's true, the people I know with Mac Pro
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:57.920]   that are using him for music recording or graphics design,
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:00.720]   they are running old software programs.
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.160]   They're running old operating systems
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:05.560]   because they don't wanna break what currently exists.
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.400]   And so they are, they're the waiters.
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:10.000]   They're not in a hurry to upgrade.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.160]   They'll wait until 2019,
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:15.720]   whereas there are some people who, maybe they're machine,
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:18.120]   maybe they're just excited and they wanna try something new
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.280]   and different, the iMac Pro is definitely an option,
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:23.840]   but at the same time, for those Mac Pro users
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:26.080]   that need that Mac Pro spec,
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:31.080]   I think Jim has nailed it that they're willing to wait for sure.
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:34.320]   - I also think Apple has benefited from Intel's,
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:37.600]   you know, laggard improvement of their chips
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:41.080]   that even a late 2013 Mac Pro
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:45.600]   probably doesn't feel too slow compared to five years later,
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:49.040]   mostly because Intel hasn't really done that much
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:50.400]   to make their chips that much faster.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:52.120]   I doubt there are many pros who are saying,
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.560]   oh man, I can't use this Zioni 5,
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:58.160]   it's just too slow compared to what I need.
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:00.080]   Nobody's saying that, in fact, I bet.
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.520]   What you do want though,
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:04.560]   and what was missing in the trash can Mac Pro
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:07.200]   and is missing in the iMac Pro is modularity.
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:09.480]   And that is the good news from Matthew Panzorino.
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:12.440]   Apple says, it's gonna be a modular Mac.
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:15.120]   - And you know, what's-
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:18.760]   - So yeah, and Andy was just saying,
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:21.920]   it depends on what you mean by modular and how modular,
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:25.680]   but if you look back to the Mac Pro, you know,
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:26.800]   the silver one.
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.440]   - The cheese grater, were you fondly-
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:31.880]   - Yes, the cheese grater.
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:36.880]   I mean, I had a lot of PCI cards and things like that
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:40.040]   in there from companies like Universal Audio.
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:42.680]   - Right, to take it to that very easily.
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:43.520]   Although they have-
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:47.160]   - They have a GPU support now in high Sierra.
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.640]   I don't know if eGPU means you'll also have the ability
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:53.040]   to run those external cards on a PCI slot, external PCI.
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.080]   - Well, part of the problem now is that
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:58.480]   when Apple moved away from those things,
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:02.120]   all of these companies came out with external-
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.120]   - Right.
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:06.600]   - DSP to take the load off of the CPU
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.600]   so that when you're running plugins,
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:10.480]   it doesn't tax the computer as much.
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:14.080]   It taxes what used to be the PCI card.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:17.680]   But now is, you know, a piece of outboard gear
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.400]   that's sitting on your desktop or, you know,
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.440]   around the console.
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:25.720]   - Bogar also says, "There is absolutely a need
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:27.840]   "in certain places for modularity."
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.040]   I'm sorry, I can't get off of my spin.
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.080]   But it's also really clear the iMac form factor
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:35.600]   of the MacBook Pros can be exceptionally good tools.
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:36.440]   (laughing)
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:39.360]   I mean, okay, I guess I'm seeing it through,
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:41.800]   you know, a certain filter.
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:45.360]   I do think modularity is pretty important,
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.840]   but you make an excellent point.
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:50.360]   If modularity hasn't been available for five years,
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:54.360]   maybe everybody's moved on to the next thing, Mandy.
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:56.760]   - It depends on how you want to define as always,
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:59.840]   what does the word pro mean?
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:02.680]   For some, it might mean a specific workflow,
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:05.040]   a specific type of usage.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:07.560]   For me, it's always meant we will not,
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.640]   we the manufacturer are not going to dictate to you
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:11.440]   how you must use this machine.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:14.840]   We know that you will have very peculiar and specific needs
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:17.200]   and we'll give you a platform that will let you
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:20.400]   make modifications or build a system
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:24.160]   that will really be focused to what you want to do.
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:29.160]   And historically, that fulfills a really wide range of users,
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.040]   not just the people who are doing pro audio,
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:35.680]   doing pro video, but also people who have some,
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:40.400]   have outgrown the needs of the level of a base level,
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:43.240]   let's say, iMac, a consumer oriented iMac
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:45.800]   or consumer oriented Mac Mini,
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.480]   they just need a little bit more oomph,
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:50.840]   they need more ports, they need a little bit more resources
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:54.040]   for these one off projects that they are potting their head
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:56.960]   against once or twice a year, as opposed to 12 months
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:59.360]   out of the year, that's what you're sort of buying.
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:03.280]   That's kind of what I think has marked the difference
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.520]   between, for instance, the MacBook Pro
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:07.360]   and the ordinary MacBook line.
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:09.360]   And that's always what I've sort of felt
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:11.440]   the desktop line to be as well.
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:15.720]   So my bigger worry would be that they really want
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:19.280]   to get such a specific data oriented idea
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:23.840]   of the typical Mac Pro user
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:27.440]   that they once again sort of lock you into a track
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:30.240]   where no, you don't want to have expansion cards,
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:32.880]   you want to put everything on an external bus instead
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.920]   for sound and for video.
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:36.280]   And we're gonna let you do all that
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:38.320]   by buying all this other stuff,
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:40.600]   which again, will work great for a lot of people
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:43.040]   who are making a lot of money with their Mac Pros.
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:45.680]   It won't do quite so well for people that once again,
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:47.880]   they've outgrown the consumer grade,
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:51.160]   but they're not making a fortune off of contracts
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.600]   that they're fulfilling with their desktop system.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:54.840]   So we're gonna have to wait and see
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:56.360]   what they really have in mind for us.
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:14:00.360]   - Yeah, but I think those people that are in between,
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:02.800]   that's where the iMac Pro comes in.
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:08.280]   Because they do have a lot of the O-Port gear
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:12.960]   where you plug into Thunderbolt or USB or whatever.
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:17.200]   And if they need that extra power, they can still get it.
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:22.200]   I think the Mac Pro, especially in the modular design,
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.800]   is going to be for those high end,
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:28.240]   very high end professionals.
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.040]   And I think the power will show that
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:33.160]   and most likely the price will show that as well,
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.600]   but it's going to be a high end machine.
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:38.520]   - Yeah. - So, but once again,
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:41.920]   for I go in this case, I'm only speaking personally,
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:45.680]   but I just don't have a use for an all-in-one machine.
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:48.400]   It just isn't how I tend to work.
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.080]   I like to have a really nice monitor
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.640]   that I'm already screen them very, very happy with.
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:54.000]   And I like being able to have it
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.240]   on an arm's position anywhere.
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:00.720]   So I would be, if faced with the problem of,
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:03.800]   I'm going to either have to spend money for a screen
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:06.000]   that I don't want in a form factor
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.200]   that isn't what I decree to be optimal for my use.
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:12.600]   Once again, it's a case of, here's $3,000,
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:15.680]   you're going to have to adjust what you want
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:17.520]   to what we're willing to sell you,
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:19.040]   which admittedly is always going to be a problem
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:23.080]   when you have a company that isn't going to license
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:24.880]   their designs to anyone else
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:27.120]   or let anybody else make hack-and-toshes
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.160]   or stuff like that.
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:29.920]   But nonetheless, it's always going to be a problem
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:31.960]   that consumers are going to have to deal with
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:35.720]   as they continue to evolve as users.
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:39.680]   Yeah, but I really don't think that you or even me,
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:44.360]   even recording what I do, are the market for a Mac Pro.
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:46.760]   Yeah.
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:48.760]   The other machines are so powerful.
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:52.680]   You know, even Leo sitting at his desk right now
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:54.960]   is probably not the market for the Mac Pro.
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:57.760]   However, the back end of what Leo does
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:00.440]   with all the streaming and everything else,
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:03.040]   that could be a market that they're looking at.
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:05.840]   Oh, sure, although it's too late for many of,
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:06.720]   I mean, it's too late for us.
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:09.360]   We bought Windows machines running Premiere.
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:11.400]   Well, it's never too late, Leo.
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.240]   Looked to some part of the switching back.
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:17.040]   Unless Microsoft dumps the Pro market,
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.160]   I don't think that's going to happen.
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:23.400]   I know I've been drinking eggnog during the special.
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.800]   Put aside the eggnog, my friends.
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:29.160]   It's time for Hopsie.
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:31.560]   When you come home from work, hard day,
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:32.640]   you'd like to put your feet up,
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:34.240]   you'd like to relax, you don't want to go out
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:36.280]   and go buy some craft beer.
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:39.040]   Wouldn't it be nice if you had a little keg in your own house?
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:40.400]   I do, it's my Hopsie.
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:43.520]   This is like the Kureg for beer lovers.
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:44.680]   Let me show you this.
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:49.680]   This is the amazing Hopsie sub home graft system.
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:50.760]   It's really simple.
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:52.840]   Hopsie comes in these bottles.
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:57.840]   They're about the size of maybe a big bottle of soda, right?
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:59.200]   But this is not soda, my friends.
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:01.440]   Oh no, this is a Czech premium Pilsner.
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:03.720]   Oh, I love the Czech style Pilsners.
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:05.120]   This is from Gordon Beersch.
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:08.320]   What's great is you open up the top and you'll see inside,
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:12.080]   there's just a little plastic nozzle
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:16.320]   that fits really easily right into the top of the Hopsie.
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:17.840]   And then you snap it closed.
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:20.200]   It's refrigerated, so it's staying cold.
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:23.440]   And let me just, I'm just going to get a little bit out of this.
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:25.280]   Now I'm probably not doing it right.
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:26.960]   You know how to pull a good, right?
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:30.440]   You've used a tap before you get this glass wet and stuff.
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:35.080]   Tilt it just right and I'm going to get myself a little glass of,
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:36.680]   I don't know what we're drinking today.
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:38.760]   I think it's an IPA.
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:42.360]   I'm not going to do the whole thing, but that is a beautiful,
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:44.160]   beautiful glass of beer.
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.800]   They have all different kinds of beers.
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:50.560]   From big and small breweries consistently rotating,
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:51.400]   it's a club.
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:55.760]   You get Hopsie beer every month without the price tag
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:57.160]   of these fancy beers.
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:58.760]   You get your own draft beer at home.
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:02.360]   This is, they call it the sub home-graft system.
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:04.200]   It fits right on your countertop.
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:06.000]   It keeps the beer cold.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.920]   It's on tap.
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:09.400]   I'll tell you what, people come over and you say,
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:10.120]   "You know what, some beer?"
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:13.680]   And you do this, they go, "Wow, you're living large.
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:15.640]   You don't even have to have a home bar just to do this."
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:18.440]   Hopsie ships these mini kegs directly to your home,
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:20.760]   even to your office.
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:24.240]   Yes, this is in the office.
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:25.520]   It's fun working for Tuit.
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:26.520]   And let me tell you.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:29.600]   Oh yeah, that's an IPA.
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:30.800]   That's fantastic.
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:33.000]   Juicy, fruity, delicious.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.160]   They've got different packages for the holidays only.
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.960]   So I want you to do this now.
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:40.440]   I know it's Christmas and everything,
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.720]   but get yourself a present, you deserve one.
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:44.440]   You can get the sub home-graft system.
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:46.160]   How much do you think you'd pay for that?
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:47.840]   All right, it's gotta be expensive, right?
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:50.000]   It's made by crops, it's beautiful.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.520]   It's a great device.
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.440]   You're gonna get the home-graft system.
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:57.080]   You're gonna get two, one, two mini kegs
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:02.080]   of a delicious beer and two nice Hopsie glasses, $99.
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:08.200]   That's $140 savings 'cause they want you to get started.
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:10.440]   And plus you get free membership in their
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:12.880]   Hopsie monthly beer club.
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.720]   You start by selecting your holiday package.
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:17.920]   Best sellers, your favorite beers from the best breweries.
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.840]   IPAs and Pale Ales.
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.440]   See, Paul doesn't want that.
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:23.920]   They're hot right now, but Paul's not an IPA guy, right?
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:27.480]   He, well, Hazy West Coast session, Pale Ales.
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:30.520]   I think Paul would go for the easy drinkers.
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:32.440]   It's kind of like summertime on tap,
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:34.040]   actually these are what I like.
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:36.080]   From loggers to cultures to pilsners.
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:39.000]   Yeah, all the exotic beers you hear people talk about,
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.320]   from the best breweries coming to you on tap in your home,
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:46.400]   this is kind of a dream come true.
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:49.400]   Afterwards, you'll choose four mini kegs every month
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:50.920]   as part of your subscription plan.
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:54.320]   That's about equivalent to a six pack, one mini keg.
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.480]   So that's exactly right.
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:59.440]   Up to two weeks, each mini keg, I should say,
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:03.840]   stays fresh for 30 days outside the subhome draft system.
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:05.600]   So you got a month and then you put it in,
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.240]   you got two weeks inside the sub.
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:10.400]   And two weeks, plenty of time, frankly.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:12.880]   They don't last five days here.
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:14.560]   We go through them pretty fast.
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.800]   We love our Hopsies.
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.280]   It's the perfect time to treat yourself.
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.560]   Or you know what?
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:22.440]   When this be, if you're a boss, a good holiday gift
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:24.680]   for the office, for the office crew,
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:26.600]   treat yourself for a friend of Hopsie.
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.800]   And just for the holidays, a great deal.
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:29.640]   Here's what you do.
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:33.240]   Go to trihopsie.com/macbreak.
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:36.240]   Trihopsie.com/macbreak.
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:38.000]   Again, when you use a promo code Macbreak,
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:38.840]   what do you get?
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:42.360]   You get this incredible subhome draft system.
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:44.800]   Too many kegs of beer, they just fit right in here.
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:46.280]   It's gonna go a little pfft when I open it.
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:47.200]   I'll do it.
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:48.040]   Just see the food.
[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:49.040]   (sizzling)
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:50.160]   There it is.
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:51.680]   Here's the many keg right in there.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:52.840]   It just pops right in.
[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:53.680]   Actually, you know what?
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:55.840]   I think it's, we're due for a new one.
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:59.040]   He said, wanting to try this Czech Pilsner.
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:00.560]   (laughing)
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:02.120]   So I'm gonna pop it out.
[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:03.760]   Pop the Hopsie.
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:04.600]   Take it out.
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:05.440]   There you go.
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:08.960]   Yeah, we are due for a new one.
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:09.800]   We'll pop in.
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:11.240]   No other, we got a choice.
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.080]   We could also do a wheat.
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:13.960]   You wanna do the new world wheat?
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:17.080]   This is from a Hermitage Brewing Company.
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:19.280]   I don't know, I'm gonna do the Czech Pilsner.
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:20.240]   You, is it okay?
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:21.640]   Everybody, you don't mind?
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:23.640]   Watch, this is how easy it is.
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:25.520]   You pop it in, just like that.
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:28.520]   The nozzle goes right in here.
[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:31.280]   It's gonna, that's where the tap is gonna be, right?
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:32.640]   It snaps in.
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:33.760]   It's that easy.
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:35.200]   Close that.
[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:38.520]   Close this, it's gonna make a little noise as it chills it.
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:40.800]   And pressurizes it, 'cause that's how it turns in.
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:41.760]   Well, that was fast.
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:43.000]   Pressurized, ready to go.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.960]   Since I finished this, I'm moving onto the Czech.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:50.480]   Pilsner, Hopsy, go to Try Hopsy,
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:54.200]   T-R-Y, H-O-P-S-Y.com/MacBreak.
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:55.640]   Well, I guess I gotta have it for me.
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:57.320]   And use a promo code MACBreak,
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:02.040]   special $99 holiday package deal, terms and conditions apply.
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:06.240]   This, two, two, love it.
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:07.640]   Monthly supply.
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:09.720]   Oh, look at that.
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:11.040]   Oh, that's gonna be great.
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:15.400]   This is called Live and Large, my friends.
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:18.600]   Cheers, Try Hopsy.com/MacBreak.
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:19.920]   Use a promo code MACBreak.
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:20.760]   Let me try it.
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:24.560]   Ah, I feel like I'm in Prague.
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:25.820]   That is so good.
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:29.000]   Smells good too.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.840]   Mm, I'm sorry, let's get back with the show.
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:36.440]   Ah, let's see.
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:38.520]   This is the bad news I was talking about.
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:42.360]   There is a box from a company called Gray Shift
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:45.000]   called GrayKey.
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:49.000]   That is designed to unlock iPhones
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:54.000]   and apparently law enforcement just loves the GrayKey.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.400]   Motherboard has the story.
[01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:59.760]   It is a relatively cheap tool.
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:04.200]   It is something that they have to have the iPhone
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:05.620]   and plug it into.
[01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:10.680]   According to Motherboard,
[01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:13.800]   it works with iOS 11 on an iPhone X.
[01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:16.480]   And that's a little bit of a shocker.
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:17.920]   We've know there have been backdoors
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.600]   and older versions of iOS,
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:22.400]   but this is the current iPhone.
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:24.200]   Secret service is planning to buy at least
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:26.400]   half a dozen GrayKey phones,
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:29.640]   phone boxes to unlock iPhones.
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:30.840]   State Department has bought it.
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:32.720]   Drug enforcement and administration
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:35.880]   interested in the FBI, interested.
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:38.960]   Many local police forces, like the Maryland State Police,
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:41.400]   the Indiana State Police, the Indianapolis Metropolitan
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:42.880]   Police Department.
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:47.880]   Actually, the Indianapolis Metro has received quotes
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:50.880]   from Gray Shift, but not yet bought the GrayKey
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:51.880]   according to Motherboard.
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:54.880]   It's a four by four inches box.
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:55.880]   - Four by four inches box.
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:56.880]   - What hatch is that thing is a paperweight.
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:57.880]   - Right.
[01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:03.880]   It's not cheap, $15,000 if you want one that gives you
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:08.880]   300 unlocks and it has an online connection.
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:10.880]   Or if you're willing to pay twice as much,
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:14.880]   $30,000 you can get the unlimited version.
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:18.880]   - Imagine everyone's using the freeware models.
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:20.880]   - Yeah, that's freeware.
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:23.880]   - Now, do you see Matthew Green's tweet, Leo?
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.880]   - No, what do you say?
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:27.880]   - This is his estimate of how fast it is.
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:30.880]   Four digit passcode, 13 minutes worse, average,
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:33.880]   six minutes, six digit passcode, 22 hours worse,
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:36.880]   average 11 hours, eight digit passcode,
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:39.880]   92 days worse, 46 days average, 10 digit,
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:43.880]   a thousand days worse, about 5,000 days on average.
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:47.880]   Sorry, 10,000 days worse, about 5,000 days on average.
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:52.880]   - That's why I have a 17 character passphrase on my iPhone now.
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:55.880]   So it's a, yeah, we believe it's a brute force device.
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:57.880]   It doesn't have any secret backdoor, it just brute forces it.
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:00.880]   - There's somehow stopping the SEP from counting the amount of times
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:03.880]   that it's done and forced in the delays and then doing the deletion
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:05.880]   after 10 attempts.
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:06.880]   - Right, right.
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:09.880]   - Yeah, see, this is why I'm with Renee, like,
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:14.880]   the success of this box is predicated on Apple's inability
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:17.880]   to raise $15,000 to buy one of their own.
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:19.880]   (laughing)
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:22.880]   As soon as they see how it works, boom, it just stops working.
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:26.880]   And even so, there is no magic, sea cam astronomy,
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:28.880]   backdoor password to unlock a phone.
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:31.880]   It really has to be one of these brute force things.
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:35.880]   And that's easily negated by someone being very,
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:37.880]   willing to inconvenience themselves once every two days
[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:39.880]   by typing in a 12-digit password.
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:43.880]   - Yeah, yeah, so if you're really worried about this,
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:45.880]   have a longer password.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:50.880]   I have a 17-alpha numeric, that's a pain in the butt.
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:55.880]   But fortunately, I don't have to use it very often thanks to FaceID.
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:58.880]   And what did he say?
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:00.880]   That would be a long time to brute force.
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:04.880]   - Yeah, that was the entropy level of the universe again.
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:06.880]   It was a long time.
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:07.880]   (laughing)
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:11.880]   Seems like we just the other day we were doing our Christmas show
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:13.880]   for all of you.
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:15.880]   It was a whole year ago.
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:18.880]   I hope you've had a lovely 2018.
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:20.880]   I know it's had its ups and downs,
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:23.880]   but I hope your family and friends are doing well and okay.
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:28.880]   You're wrapped in the bosom of your family
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:30.880]   at this holiday season.
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:35.880]   You know, the years go by so fast,
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:37.880]   it's kind of hard to believe.
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:41.880]   But I remember it very well, 1998, 20 years ago,
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:44.880]   we launched tech TV in May 1998.
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:48.880]   Shortly thereafter, Apple, Steve Jobs had come back,
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:51.880]   and Apple launched Steve's first computer.
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:54.880]   Remember the Bondi Blue iMac?
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:56.880]   20 years old this year.
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:59.880]   In a way, we also celebrated this week the 20th anniversary
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:01.880]   of the original iMac.
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:04.880]   And it's fun, which was, I think on Sunday.
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:07.880]   It's fun to think about where Apple was 20 years ago,
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:12.880]   compared to right now, 20 years, 21 years ago,
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:14.880]   when Steve Jobs came back to Apple.
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:18.880]   It was just a few million dollars away from bankruptcy.
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:21.880]   So every time this happened in the last 21 years,
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:22.880]   it's been remarkable.
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:25.880]   - And then shortly after, it was as if Steve had just started
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:26.880]   where he left off.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:29.880]   He left with the Mac and came back,
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:31.880]   and then we're gonna do the Mac again.
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:33.880]   - And then again.
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:37.880]   - And he drew that famous quadrant where he said,
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:40.880]   'cause they had dozens of products at the time,
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:43.880]   and he said, and by the way,
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:45.880]   they were also selling clones when Steve came back, right?
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:46.880]   He killed that immediately.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:47.880]   Drew the quadrant said,
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:49.880]   "We're gonna have professional, consumer,
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:51.880]   portable, and desktop for products.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:53.880]   That's it."
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:28:01.880]   And the iMac announcement was the consumer desktop, right?
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:05.880]   So here, I'll put a little bit of Steve here talking about
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:06.880]   his iMac.
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:07.880]   - Come on in.
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.880]   - He's bringing in a camera so he'll show it off.
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:10.880]   - You've got to see this thing in person,
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:11.880]   but I'll do the best I can with video.
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:12.880]   This is iMac.
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:14.880]   The whole thing is translucent.
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:15.880]   You can see into it.
[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:16.880]   It's so cool.
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:18.880]   We've got stereos--
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:21.880]   - Some of that laughter is probably coming from Apple employees
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:24.880]   who watch Steve have a fit the day before,
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:27.880]   according to Walter Isaacson's biography,
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:29.880]   'cause he couldn't get it lit right,
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:32.880]   and he said, "We're gonna stay here until it looks right."
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:38.880]   He also had a fit over the button on the front of the iMac,
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:40.880]   'cause he had been told, he said,
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:41.880]   John Rubenstein had told him,
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:44.880]   "You're gonna have a slot, and then instead it had a drawer."
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:47.880]   And in fact, according to Isaacson,
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:50.880]   almost canceled the introduction of the iMac,
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:53.880]   the day before, over that small point,
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:56.880]   and only went ahead when Rubenstein was able to convince him,
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:59.880]   "Well, next one will have a slot."
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:01.880]   Okay, Steve, okay.
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:03.880]   Watch how much he loves the handle, too.
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:05.880]   - We've got infrared right up here.
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:07.880]   We've got the CD-ROM drive right in the middle.
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:09.880]   We've got dual stereo headphone jacks.
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:11.880]   We've got the coolest mouse on the planet right now.
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:12.880]   - Okay, wait a minute.
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:13.880]   - Oh, man.
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:14.880]   - The worst mouse ever.
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:15.880]   - No, it never is.
[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:17.880]   - It was the coolest mouse in that it did generate
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:19.880]   the frostiest reception, right?
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:21.880]   - You could say it was cool.
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:23.880]   You just can't say it was functional, right?
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:26.880]   - It was a third-party opportunity for other mouse makers.
[01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:27.880]   - Yes.
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:28.880]   - Say it with a drop the ball.
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:29.880]   - There you go.
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:30.880]   - Come on around.
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:33.880]   All of the connectors are inside one beautiful little door
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:35.880]   here, the ethernet, the USB stuff.
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:38.880]   Around the back, we've got a really great handle here.
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:42.880]   - Now, I should point out, this is a 38-pound computer.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:44.880]   No one is going to use that handle.
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:47.880]   - Well, no, it was just a little bit more than that.
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:50.880]   - Well, no, it was just like, it was an echo back to the
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:53.880]   original Mac, so it's part of the design story there's telling.
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:56.880]   But also, there are times where you actually would like to
[01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:59.880]   move a computer from one room to the other, not because it's
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:02.880]   portable, but because, again, you're in an office and you're
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:04.880]   sharing or you're in a school.
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:05.880]   - You don't need a handle, Andy.
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:06.880]   - Well, yeah.
[01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:07.880]   - If it's 32 hands.
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:08.880]   - I'm sorry, Tom.
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:09.880]   - Tom, yeah, you need a handle.
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:11.880]   - Johnny, I've put the handle in.
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:13.880]   He was actually a little nervous because this is a very
[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:14.880]   expensive case.
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:16.880]   I think it was $60 per.
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:19.880]   And I put the handle in and he said he was very nervous about
[01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:22.880]   what Steve would say, but he said, look, we've got to put this
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:25.880]   here because it communicates that it's friendly and it's, you
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:28.880]   know, it's easy to shift around whether it's functional.
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:31.880]   It's really the point and jobs got it and loved it.
[01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:35.880]   He doesn't, what he doesn't mention here is a significant
[01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:36.880]   missing piece.
[01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:38.880]   - The back of this thing looks better than the front of the
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:40.880]   other guys, by the way.
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:42.880]   And then, around the side.
[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:43.880]   - Steve.
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:44.880]   - Let's take one more.
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:47.880]   - One more swing around it so you can see this is what it
[01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:48.880]   looks like.
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:51.880]   And again, you've got to see one of these things in person.
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:52.880]   - It was very pretty.
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:57.880]   - $12.99, G3 at 233 megahertz, had 32 megahertz of RAM,
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:02.880]   upgraded to 128 megahertz, not gigs, 32 megahertz of RAM.
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:05.880]   What was missing was a floppy drive.
[01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:07.880]   As it turned out, that might have been the biggest story of all
[01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:09.880]   that in the Bondi blue because people didn't make computers
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:11.880]   and colors back in those days.
[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:15.880]   The fact that Apple would make a PC without a floppy drive.
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:18.880]   Now, that was the courage, I think Phil Schiller was referring to.
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:22.880]   - I was trying to think of when I stopped using floppy drives,
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:23.880]   but it was long before.
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:25.880]   - People were still using them at this time, but they put those
[01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:27.880]   USB ports on there.
[01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:28.880]   - And the USB?
[01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:31.880]   - Yeah, really, and the CD and said, going for it.
[01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:33.880]   And they were right in that case.
[01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:36.880]   Ironically, this, well, Mac has three headphone checks.
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:39.880]   - I mean, I think the last time I seriously used a floppy
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:41.880]   drive was probably 1995.
[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:42.880]   - Yeah, this was 1998.
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:44.880]   - Right, so three years, it had already been,
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:46.880]   it was already kind of dead for-
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:47.880]   - No, it really wasn't.
[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:49.880]   - For me, no, for me.
[01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:50.880]   - Okay, that's true.
[01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:52.880]   - You were using files that were huge.
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:54.880]   - Yeah, we were using the drives.
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:56.880]   - Cyclist drives, remember Cyclist drives?
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:57.880]   - Oh, I remember those.
[01:31:57.880 --> 01:31:58.880]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:31:58.880 --> 01:31:59.880]   - Remember the Bernoulli boxes?
[01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:00.880]   - Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:05.880]   - I was just unpacking some of the last boxes and I found my
[01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:08.880]   my M.O. cartridges from-
[01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:10.880]   - Oh my God, magnetic optical media.
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:11.880]   - Optical, yeah.
[01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:13.880]   Which were pretty damn cool when they're shining and stuff.
[01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:15.880]   But every time this does come up a lot,
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:17.880]   and this is something that I like to counter,
[01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:20.880]   at least to present the other side of the argument that people say,
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:23.880]   "You see?" and the Apple was ahead of the game and they've got,
[01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:25.880]   and they've made the computer of the future, like,
[01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:26.880]   and brought it to us early.
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:30.880]   So, well, again, we forget about what an absolute colossal pain
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:31.880]   in the butt.
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:32.880]   - At the time.
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:34.880]   - It was to own an iMac at that time because, again,
[01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:37.880]   yeah, eventually people got rid of floppies,
[01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:39.880]   but it was still, there were no flash drives.
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:40.880]   There was no Dropbox.
[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:43.880]   It was still very, very important to a lot of people.
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:47.880]   So, that's why a lot of people were buying third party floppy drives
[01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:50.880]   that were designed to look in Bondi Blue,
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:52.880]   Bondi Blue by other makers.
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:54.880]   There were not, USB was a brand new,
[01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:55.880]   practically brand new standard.
[01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:59.880]   So, it was really, really hard to find anything that would plug into it
[01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:03.880]   without something that would adapt to your old printers and stuff.
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:05.880]   Just on and on and on and on.
[01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:09.880]   So, make sure that that's part of the history as well.
[01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:13.880]   That's why I really don't like the courage story,
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:19.880]   because, again, it's easy to be courageous when your users have no option
[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:23.880]   but to drop the entire platform and switch to another operating system.
[01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:29.880]   It would be courageous if the iPhone were just one maker of computers
[01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:31.880]   that use that stuff.
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:35.880]   I could buy a phone with a headphone jack that runs iOS
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:37.880]   that is not an iPhone.
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:39.880]   So, that's why I just don't like it.
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:44.880]   I'm not angry about it, but I don't like the word courageous in correction to this.
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:46.880]   Also, let's remember with the iMac,
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:49.880]   that they really had to make a first impression.
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:50.880]   They had nothing to lose.
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:55.880]   So, as a quote from Steve Jobs that I hope is permanent,
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:57.880]   that look, if you're going to,
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:33:59.880]   there's nothing that feels worse than failing
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:02.880]   with something that you didn't believe in to begin with.
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:04.880]   And this is the iMac, I think,
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:08.880]   was the inculcation of the idea that if he's going to fail,
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:10.880]   if Apple's, this is going to be the last Mac Apple makes,
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:14.880]   they're going to fail with a Mac that Steve Jobs and everybody who works with it
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:17.880]   really believes and really thinks it's a great machine.
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:19.880]   I had Firewire.
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:21.880]   I missed Firewire.
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:23.880]   (laughter)
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:26.880]   You know, the connector story has been really choppy
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:27.880]   and ugly story.
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:32.880]   Firewire was born too soon and died too early or more too late.
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:37.880]   No, I think that it was, so the rumor, it replaced SCSI.
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:38.880]   Let's not forget.
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:40.880]   The rumor in parallel ports.
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:45.880]   The rumor of both of its success for Apple and its demise was that,
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:49.880]   you know, Apple really pushed it really hard to get all the camera manufacturers to add,
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:51.880]   you know, the Firewire to their cameras,
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:55.880]   because now you can just hook it into your PC or Mac or whatever and do it.
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:35:01.880]   Then Apple then pushed a, you know, because they were part of the consortium.
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:02.880]   Within two.
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:03.880]   So they pushed Sony.
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:06.880]   They pushed a royalty payment out, you know, for the PC manufacturers.
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:08.880]   And Apple paid it too, they didn't care.
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:13.880]   But the PC manufacturers wouldn't pay the royalty.
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:16.880]   Wouldn't pay the royalty and Steve Jobs knew they wouldn't pay the royalty
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:18.880]   and he knew that they wouldn't put it in their computers.
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:21.880]   And what it meant was, is for years, the only easy way to get video
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:23.880]   into your computer was on a Mac.
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:26.880]   And the only way to get video in was a Mac and a camera.
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:29.880]   So it was like, it was just, it just owned that market.
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:30.880]   He didn't care about the money.
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:33.880]   He just wanted to make sure that they, they, they put their feet in the butt.
[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:37.880]   Now in the end, that's what killed Firewire because then, then this big market builds up and,
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:39.880]   you know, and then Apple decided it's going to change it because they're the,
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:41.880]   now they're really the only ones.
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:43.880]   And as, as the camera manufacturers.
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:44.880]   Same thing happening with Thunderbolt.
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:45.880]   No.
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:48.880]   No, I don't see Thunderbolt on a lot of games.
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:49.880]   Thunderbolt's on a lot.
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:50.880]   It tells really drop the ball on it.
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:52.880]   I mean, they drop the ball on that and the DisplayPort connector.
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:54.880]   I think they were supposed to be three generations ahead.
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:58.880]   What they are now, they announced DisplayPort 1.3 and 1.4.
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:01.880]   And I don't think any of them have shipped yet.
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:03.880]   I don't think Thunderbolt is on schedule either.
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:05.880]   And that's entirely, you know.
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:06.880]   Thunderbolt's also confusing.
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:07.880]   I think that's its biggest problem.
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:11.880]   Well, they said it was a benefit that it would match USB-C, but now people buy one
[01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:12.880]   and not know what it is.
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:13.880]   They just think it looks the same.
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:14.880]   What are the capabilities?
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:15.880]   It's the same connector.
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:16.880]   What does it do?
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:17.880]   Right.
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:18.880]   Yeah.
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:19.880]   And what are the cables rated for?
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:21.880]   It's, and you have a poor Google engineer.
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:22.880]   You're asked to prove it.
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:23.880]   I know.
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:24.880]   I'm just leaving every one of those.
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:29.880]   And it's not only that, but you get situations where to save money, you might have like
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:32.880]   two or three USB-C ports on a device.
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:36.880]   But one of them is basically just like a USB 3.0 port.
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:37.880]   One is a video port.
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:42.880]   One is super, super high speed that can be used for networking as opposed to, there are a lot
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:44.880]   of things I don't like about the ports on the MacBook Pro.
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:48.880]   But one of the things I absolutely respect is the idea that nope, these are four apps
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:50.880]   that are four absolutely equal top of the line.
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:52.880]   You can do anything with them ports.
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:53.880]   Yeah.
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:54.880]   I do.
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:37:02.880]   I have to admit that, you know, I stayed with the 2015 as I see you have MacBook Pro.
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:05.880]   Because I wish it had Type-C Thunderbolt.
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:09.880]   But the fact that it has USB and HDMI and SD card reader.
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:10.880]   SD card, yeah.
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:11.880]   I know.
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:14.880]   That actually is a compelling thing to have those ports.
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:16.880]   For me, it's just, it's literally just the Mac safe.
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:18.880]   I would give up everything else.
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:20.880]   Oh, I wish it had Type-C charging.
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:22.880]   I would prefer Type-C charging because it's universal now.
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:24.880]   My problem is that I just travel so much.
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:25.880]   You're not going to lose so much.
[01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:28.880]   Here's where it really becomes an issue where I look down and I go, I don't want it.
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:33.880]   Is when I'm on a plane plugging into the little, you know, the connector there.
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:35.880]   This pin points why it's so hard for Apple.
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:37.880]   And you kind of brought this up Andy too.
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:42.880]   As the only source of Macs, they have a problem because they can't make you and me happy.
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:43.880]   Right.
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:45.880]   You want the Macs safe, I want Type-C.
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:48.880]   I'm just as happy with four, I mean, Thunderbolt ports.
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:55.880]   I think that if Apple had just left the right side of the computer the same and put two
[01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:58.880]   C's on the other side, that's what Lenovo does.
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:01.880]   They have their traditional charger on one side and the Type-C charger.
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:04.880]   Oh, but I'm saying we've all the connectors on one side the same.
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:07.880]   Type-C on the other side as the transition laptop.
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:09.880]   They had done that and then done whatever they're going to do.
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:10.880]   That doesn't have any courage.
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:12.880]   There's no courage involved in this.
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:14.880]   I wish they'd be a little more fearful.
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:16.880]   To me, it always comes down to the keyboard.
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:20.880]   We'll talk actually a little bit about what Apple's plans are with MacBooks.
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:21.880]   And just a little bit.
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:23.880]   I just thought we'd celebrate a little bit.
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:24.880]   The 20th anniversary.
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:26.880]   20 years ago, May 6th.
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:28.880]   By the way, they announced it May 6th, 1998.
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:31.880]   Didn't ship it until August I think of that year.
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:33.880]   It took a while for it to come out.
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:39.880]   But we immediately, that's roughly when it was the same timeframe as the launch of ZDTV.
[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:43.880]   And we immediately ran out and bought as many Bondi Blue iMacs as we could.
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:45.880]   So we could get our hands on.
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:47.880]   Really nice computer.
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:51.880]   I have never asked you this question.
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:55.880]   Do you like the new Macintosh laptop keyboards?
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:57.880]   Are you a butterfly girl?
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:38:59.880]   Yes, I am.
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:03.880]   This is such an uncomfortable situation for me to be in.
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:08.880]   I have the 2016 MacBook, 13-inch MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar.
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:12.880]   And I have had zero complications with the keyboard.
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:19.880]   But I know, beyond a shadow of doubt, there is something wrong with that keyboard when thousands of people have had issues with it.
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:24.880]   So here I am recommending to my friends the new MacBook Pro.
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:37.880]   And I'm watching person after person after person tell me that they've had some kind of breakdown with their keyboard that they had to take it in, have something replaced, take it in a second time, had something else replaced.
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:40.880]   It's dangerous territory here.
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:44.880]   And I really think Apple needs to address this.
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:52.880]   I think the petition to recall the Apple keyboard, it's on the right path.
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:40:09.880]   I don't think the computer needs to be recalled, but I think that similar to the way Apple released a repair program for the series one Apple watch for the battery overheating
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:14.880]   and breaking apart the battery, the watch case, it's something like this.
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:17.880]   It needs to be addressed.
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:21.880]   Apple needs to offer something to help people repair their keyboards.
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:25.880]   And it has to extend well beyond any existing warranty.
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:31.880]   So my MacBook Pro is fine right now in 2017, not even a year after I bought it.
[01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:38.880]   But what's going to happen in four years, five years, is my Mac keyboard going to have the same kind of issues.
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:42.880]   And I'm out of warranty and I have to pay $700 to get it fixed.
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:45.880]   That's part of the problem is how expensive, right?
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:55.880]   You have the butterfly one, Laurie, the first generation, which I tried and rejected and got rid of that exact laptop that you have.
[01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:58.880]   I also didn't like the touch bar, but that's another story for another day.
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:02.880]   Then I got the next MacBook, which is butterfly two.
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:03.880]   That was a little better.
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:05.880]   I acknowledge that.
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:06.880]   But it still bugged me.
[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:14.880]   Now, Apple Insider actually went out and did some deep data diving.
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:29.880]   They collected data from Genius Bars in the US, which is interesting, as well as Apple authorized third party repair shops, to collect the number of problems with number of keyboard incidents.
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:37.880]   So the MacBook Pro, which had the old fashioned keyboard from 2014, and I'll put 2015 in there.
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:41.880]   We're talking 2,120 incidents in 2014.
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:44.880]   Of them, 118 were keyboard problems.
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:46.880]   That's pretty good.
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:53.880]   In 2015, there were 1904 episodes and 114 keyboard incidents.
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:57.880]   But then a big jump when you get to 2016.
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:07.880]   You had fewer total incidents, 1402, but a big jump in the number, almost a 50% jump in the number of keyboard incidents.
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:14.880]   That seems to have settled down in 2017, but then these are newer computers.
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:16.880]   Maybe the butterfly two fixed it.
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:17.880]   Yeah.
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:18.880]   Yeah.
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:26.880]   But the class action suits, I thought it was interesting that there are two plaintiffs named, one of which bought their MacBook.
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:29.880]   I think in 2016, 2015.
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:32.880]   But the other plaintiff bought theirs like this year.
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:35.880]   They bought it in January and they had problems in April.
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:38.880]   So, which seems like good tactics.
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:49.880]   I made a note yesterday when I was reading the complaint that now I need to learn how class actions do this work.
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:57.880]   One of the things that the suit is claiming is that not just that these are tricky, these are problematic keyboards, but they are fundamentally defective.
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:00.880]   Not only are they defective, but Apple knew that they were defective.
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:04.880]   And that's part of the reasons why the suit is going forward.
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:20.880]   And I'm not sure how they're going to prove that because Apple had a problem with the smoking gun email to Tim Cook from 2016 saying these keyboards were having real problems with these before release.
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:21.880]   Something like that.
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:22.880]   Yeah.
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:23.880]   It was just like that.
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:24.880]   Slim, I would guess.
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:29.880]   If the old timers like me, remember the Twiggy floppy drives, the original Lisa.
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:30.880]   That was a problem.
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:34.880]   Apple, they were so determined not to go with another.
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:40.880]   They're so determined to go with an in-house solution that they could not get the damn thing to work and they had to ship on time.
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:48.880]   And so there's all kinds of legal issues afterwards because they could prove that they knew the thing just didn't work properly, but they had made the ship date.
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:49.880]   So, I don't know.
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:51.880]   I agree with Laurie.
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:58.880]   I think that we necessarily need a recall because again, that assumes that the entire design is defective.
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:00.880]   I don't think that's the case at all.
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:04.880]   But a warranty extension, I think, is exactly what is called for here.
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:07.880]   Just they don't have to have a big maya culpa.
[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:08.880]   They don't have to say anything.
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:09.880]   They don't have to advertise anything.
[01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:17.880]   But if you come in with a keyboard with a problem, yes, the first time you bring it in, they're going to spritz it with the compressed air like the service note says.
[01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:22.880]   But if it's clear that if you come back again, they're just going to swap out a brand new keyboard and not charge you for it.
[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:31.880]   I had a, this is why it's always worth it to bring a problematic Apple product back to the Apple store, even if it's out of warranty.
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:35.880]   I had my Macbook Pro 2015.
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:38.880]   Obviously, it's like out of warranty by two years.
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:43.880]   And I got the, after lots of lots of use, I got what I thought was a normal over place.
[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:44.880]   Your battery is finally bad.
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:45.880]   Replace it.
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:48.880]   And I thought that, okay, old age, I've been using it over and over.
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:51.880]   And it's going to pay to replace the batteries. Not going to cost that much money.
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:58.880]   But they took it, they took it in the back and they realized that like a couple of cells were swollen and they replaced the battery for free.
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:03.880]   So again, it's not something that was advertised, but it's always worth it just to see if they'll do something for you under there.
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:05.880]   We're awesome policy.
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:17.880]   And this is if there's ever a time for Apple to be awesome, it's to make people, make, convince people that if they have a keyboard with a problem, it's not going to cost them $700 to fix it because for 700 bucks, you can probably get it.
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:21.880]   You can probably get a Windows laptop with a good, with a much better keyboard.
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:25.880]   We actually point out that Renee Richie was the guy who put these numbers together.
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:28.880]   I think Apple Insider published percentages mostly.
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:34.880]   And the total number of incidents is not the total number across the board, just the ones that Apple Insider counted.
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:38.880]   What's relevant is the percentage of the total incidents that were keyboard incidents.
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:41.880]   And that went, did go up a lot in 2016.
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:52.880]   But nevertheless, even if it's 12 or 13% of overall, that is not, that does not rise to the level of, oh my God, this thing is broken.
[01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:56.880]   So it is really more of a good, I think it's going to be more of a good will.
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:57.880]   Why?
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:01.880]   They have to convince Apple of any failing.
[01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:03.880]   I mean, that's a small number.
[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:05.880]   Well, good will doesn't pay for lawyers.
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:06.880]   Yeah.
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:07.880]   That's the lawyer.
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:11.880]   Well, see, what I'd like to see is the outcome is Apple rethinking the butterfly switch.
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:14.880]   I think they'd be making a better keyboard next time.
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:16.880]   I would like to just get rid of the keyboard.
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:17.880]   Like, I love the iPad.
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:19.880]   Like literally get rid of the keyboard.
[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:21.880]   Just like everything would be iOS.
[01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:25.880]   No, no, no, no, iOS, if you look at like a surface, the surface is great because you choose what you want.
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:33.880]   You know, like that, that way Andy and I can have big keys and then other people can have butterfly keys and you just attach it to the thing and put it together.
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:34.880]   It could still be Mac OS.
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:39.880]   I don't want to get, by the way, I'm realistic that I don't think Mac OS is going to last forever.
[01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:43.880]   I don't want to give it up because I still spend 90% of my time.
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:44.880]   Me too.
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:48.880]   That I spend on a Mac or on an Apple device is in front of a Mac.
[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:52.880]   The petition at Change.org hasn't quite raised 25,000 signatures.
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:57.880]   I don't know how many millions of these they've sold, but that's not a huge number.
[01:46:57.880 --> 01:47:04.880]   Oh, so people like people like signing electronically petition that means nothing.
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:05.880]   That doesn't mean anything.
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:17.880]   But I do think that we've just we've heard too much about we've heard from too many people who've had these problems to think that, okay, well, you know, there was a fly got into the transporter chamber was a one and one in a million problem.
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:20.880]   I think that there is a there is a weakness.
[01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:21.880]   I think it's been demonstrated.
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:23.880]   There's a weakness to this keyboard that makes them.
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:34.880]   So once they go bad, they're just bad and you're just not going to there's no way to really pop off that key cap get in there with a Q tip of the nice, a purple and get that key switch working properly.
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:42.880]   I mean, I think the physics of it are obvious is that is when you have less travel, it's going to be much more sensitive to anything that goes wrong.
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:50.880]   You know, I think that the physics of it just makes sense that the thinner these keys get and the less travel they're going to have when you hit them, the less reliable they're going to be.
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:56.880]   You know, so I think that and I think it's easier to have grit and all kinds of other stuff.
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:02.880]   I mean, I know some people that just go through keyboards because they use them outside, you know, like they use them in construction sites.
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:06.880]   And so they, you know, so it's, you know, they and they go through certain ones faster because of that.
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:12.880]   I don't know which device I can shake more crumbs out of the tray at the bottom of my coaster oven or my laptop keyboard.
[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:14.880]   So it's a it's a tough problem to solve.
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:18.880]   I don't think I don't think that that Apple engineers have been lazy.
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:20.880]   I just think it's a big problem.
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:24.880]   How does that holiday poem go?
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:27.880]   'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house.
[01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:30.880]   Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:37.880]   The children were nestled on their Casper mattresses, sleeping soundly with visions of sugar plums.
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:39.880]   There's Casper in there somewhere.
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:40.880]   There ought to be if there isn't.
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:45.880]   More of our holidays shown a bit after I tell you about my mattress, the Casper.
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:51.880]   Love me some Casper, an online retailer, premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost.
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:49:01.880]   Look, this is a perfect time to tell you about Casper because you, if you have kids, you haven't got a lot of sleep.
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:05.880]   You know, you're kind of woke up at, did the kids wake you up at five in the morning?
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:07.880]   Come on, we got to open the presents.
[01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:09.880]   You ready for a good night's sleep?
[01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:11.880]   You need a Casper.
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:15.880]   The original Casper mattress, not just imagine if you will.
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:17.880]   You go in a bit on this tonight.
[01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:21.880]   It has the original multiple supportive memory foams.
[01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:22.880]   It is magical.
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:26.880]   It's a sleep surface that just the right sink.
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:28.880]   So, you bony bits go right into there.
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:31.880]   But that's firm and it supports you just the right bounce.
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:33.880]   How do they do it?
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:36.880]   Sink and bounce together in one mattress.
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:39.880]   And maybe you've tried other mattresses.
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:42.880]   I know I have and have you noticed you wake up?
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:43.880]   You're sweating?
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:44.880]   You're drenched?
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:45.880]   Because they don't breathe.
[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:49.880]   The Casper mattress breathes and that's important.
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:50.880]   So, you can sleep cool.
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:56.880]   It turns out sleep research, you do need to be a few degrees cooler than during the day in bed.
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:49:58.880]   It's just the way it is.
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:49:59.880]   It's biology.
[01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:02.880]   So, you want to sleep cool, regulate your temperatures through the night.
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:03.880]   You will sleep better.
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:05.880]   Really, that's what Casper is all about.
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:07.880]   Having a much better night's sleep.
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:10.880]   Long lasting comfort and support.
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:12.880]   You can buy it online easily.
[01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:13.880]   It's completely risk-free.
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:14.880]   Casper.
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:16.880]   Casper is reinvented.
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:19.880]   Seriously, they were the guys that changed the mattress industry.
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:21.880]   Oh, yeah, everybody's copying them now.
[01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:24.880]   But Casper, these are the guys who said, "Wait a minute.
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:26.880]   There's something wrong.
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:29.880]   You make a mattress, but you don't sell it to the customer.
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:33.880]   You sell it to a store that doubles the price or more, marks it up,
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:34.880]   then sells it to the customer.
[01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:35.880]   That's wrong.
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:36.880]   We want to sell direct to the customers.
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:38.880]   That's exactly what they do.
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:40.880]   But you see the problem here.
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:44.880]   Customers think, "Oh, I got to go lie on it in the store before I buy it."
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:45.880]   No, no, no.
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:46.880]   Here's the deal.
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:48.880]   Casper, you don't have to lie on the store.
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:55.880]   You get 100 nights to lie on it in your home in situ, as it were,
[01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:57.880]   in the situation, as it is.
[01:50:57.880 --> 01:50:59.880]   So, you really get a sense.
[01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:04.880]   I was eight, I'm 10 minutes in a store, eight hours on the bed, night after night.
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:08.880]   And if at any time in the first hundred days, you go, "Nah, nah."
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:09.880]   They will come.
[01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:11.880]   They will take it, refund you every penny.
[01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:12.880]   No trouble on your part.
[01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:13.880]   It's very easy.
[01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:15.880]   The reason they make it easy, return.
[01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:18.880]   Mostly, I think just to reassure people, because no one returns them.
[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:19.880]   They're great.
[01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:21.880]   Once you sleep on a Casper, you'll say, "What was I?"
[01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:23.880]   I've heard Leo talk about this.
[01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:25.880]   "What was I thinking?"
[01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:29.880]   Casper knows how to make a great mattress.
[01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:33.880]   And, by the way, they're all made in the USA upholding the highest environmental standards.
[01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:34.880]   That's actually important.
[01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:39.880]   Because they come in a box, right, in a very surprisingly compact box.
[01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:44.880]   When you open it up, and if it weren't made with the highest environmental standards,
[01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:46.880]   you might smell like something.
[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:47.880]   Nothing.
[01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:48.880]   You don't...
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:50.880]   I've had other...
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:52.880]   Big name, expensive mattresses.
[01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:55.880]   You had to air out for a few days before you really felt comfortable sleeping on it.
[01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:56.880]   You know what I mean?
[01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:57.880]   Not this.
[01:51:57.880 --> 01:51:58.880]   Put it on the bed.
[01:51:58.880 --> 01:51:59.880]   It's ready to go.

[01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:20.880]   That way they know.
[01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:21.880]   You saw it here.
[01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:22.880]   That makes us happy.
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:23.880]   It makes them...
[01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:24.880]   It makes everybody happy.
[01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:25.880]   And you're going to be happy.
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:27.880]   You're going to go, "Oh, Leo, why did I wait?"
[01:52:27.880 --> 01:52:34.880]   I'm going to go take an app while you watch more of the best of Mac break weekly.
[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:56.880]   We have birthday cupcakes, not just for Alex Lindsey, but today is the tenth birthday of the Apple App Store.
[01:52:56.880 --> 01:52:57.880]   The iPhone App Store.
[01:52:57.880 --> 01:52:58.880]   We were born together.
[01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:01.880]   It's us, the App Store and Nikola Tesla.
[01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:02.880]   Tesla's birthday too.
[01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:03.880]   Pretty sure.
[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:04.880]   Well, in that case, I'm going to have another cupcake.
[01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:05.880]   I have a cup.
[01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:06.880]   All good things.
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:07.880]   I'm an electric cup.
[01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:12.880]   In honor of that birthday, we will sing the first four words of Happy Birthday, which you
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:13.880]   get for free.
[01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:18.880]   If you want to buy a pack of 20 more words, and our purchases are $5.
[01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:20.880]   We already sang it.
[01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:21.880]   It's too late.
[01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:22.880]   You did the chorus.
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:24.880]   I think you did more than 10 words, Andy.
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:25.880]   So expect a bill.
[01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:27.880]   No, 10th anniversary of the App Store.
[01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:29.880]   I think you want to say about that?
[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:32.880]   That was a big deal.
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:33.880]   Is it my memory?
[01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:34.880]   Correct.
[01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:36.880]   Didn't Steve Jobs not want an App Store at first?
[01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:38.880]   That's an urban myth.
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:43.880]   I've talked to a lot of people about it who are actually involved at Apple at the time working on it.
[01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:45.880]   Apple is a platform company.
[01:53:45.880 --> 01:53:47.880]   Apple always wanted an iPhone to be a platform.
[01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:54.880]   However, it was so hard to get the iPhone to ship by June 2007 that they had zero bandwidth
[01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:56.880]   to actually come up with an App Store strategy.
[01:53:56.880 --> 01:54:01.880]   The teams were so exhausted that there was no way they were going to get it done any time soon.
[01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:05.880]   It was going to take a year, maybe more than a year, which is why they tried to do the web app as the
[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:06.880]   sweet solution.
[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:08.880]   But then that fell with such a thud.
[01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:11.880]   They had to go and say, "Look, we know you just did a forced march.
[01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:13.880]   You just did a marathon of sprints.
[01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:17.880]   Can you please pick yourselves up and do it again for next year?"
[01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:21.880]   They all just looked at each other and said, "We absolutely have to do this."
[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:24.880]   They had a little debate about whether it should be AppKit or WebKit.
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:27.880]   Even the WebKit people said, "No, it can't be WebKit.
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:29.880]   It's just not there yet for this kind of stuff."
[01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:32.880]   You can have Web Views inside your apps, but you need POCO.
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:40.880]   They came up with UIKit and then they busted tail to get that ready for that February event.
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:46.880]   I think basically did another forced march for the remaining nine months and got it done.
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:49.880]   Well, it turned out to be a good thing for sure.
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:54.880]   It's created an entire economy around it and it's generated a significant amount of revenue
[01:54:54.880 --> 01:54:55.880]   for Apple.
[01:54:55.880 --> 01:55:00.880]   I don't know how much of the $9.2 billion they made last quarter in services was the App Store,
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:02.880]   but I have to think it was the lion's share.
[01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:06.880]   It made apps popular and it brought them all into popular culture.
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:12.880]   Now, it used to be an obscure thing that maybe you got the Adobe licenses or Microsoft Office
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:17.880]   or your business and maybe you got some shareware or freeware, but it wasn't the movies or music
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:23.880]   or even video games and now it is popular culture and developers are popular culture.
[01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:28.880]   People think about it as an astronaut, fireman, I want to make an app.
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:30.880]   No, it's really true.
[01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:32.880]   I get calls all the time on the radio show.
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:33.880]   I got a brilliant idea for an app.
[01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:36.880]   Can you tell me somebody who can write it for me?
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:37.880]   It's like, "Dude."
[01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:41.880]   Incredible democratization.
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:46.880]   I mean, I mean, kids, 10-year-old is it Flappy Bird?
[01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:48.880]   Flappy Bird, yeah, that was the poor guy that the poor guy did.
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:49.880]   The poor guy did the major.
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:50.880]   The poor guy did the major.
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:53.880]   It was not ready for selling whatever it made.
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:58.880]   Couldn't believe he made millions in a place that you're not supposed to do that.
[01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:04.880]   I mean, I meet 10, 10, 11, 12-year-olds all the time who want to write and some are actually
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:07.880]   writing and some have even published apps in the App Store.
[01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:09.880]   That's a great thing.
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:13.880]   And the fact that it's so inexpensive and so easy and you really can build a business around.
[01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:15.880]   It's almost like the next generation of delivery.
[01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:18.880]   I wonder how many app developers make money in there.
[01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:20.880]   Well, no, but a lot of businesses don't make money.
[01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:22.880]   I mean, most restaurants go under most other.
[01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:26.880]   Is it harder to make a success in the App Store than it is as a restaurant?
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:27.880]   As a restaurant?
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:30.880]   It is much less expensive than a restaurant.
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:32.880]   You were a restaurant.
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:33.880]   And you're only dealing with yourself.
[01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:34.880]   I mean, you're spare time.
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:35.880]   The risk is a lot lower.
[01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:38.880]   There's definitely plenty of people who fail at it and they say, "Oh, you can't make any
[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:39.880]   money on the App Store."
[01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:42.880]   But then there's all these people that, you know, it doesn't mean that you can just put
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:44.880]   it up on the App Store and expect everyone to use it.
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:45.880]   You still have to think about B.R.
[01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:46.880]   You still have to have--
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:48.880]   Well, it has to be great.
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:55.880]   It has to be--and that's the thing is that the UI, the user experience on the iOS app has
[01:56:55.880 --> 01:56:56.880]   to be very good.
[01:56:56.880 --> 01:57:00.880]   I think that unless you do something really obscure, you cannot have anything that's
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:01.880]   hokey.
[01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:03.880]   Because I know as a user, I beg--oh, this is hokey.
[01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:06.880]   You know, like, and I just stop using it almost immediately just over the design.
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:15.240]   You know, unless something is--you know, so you still have to think about that process.
[01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:17.280]   You know, and I think that a lot of people don't.
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:18.880]   They just throw it up there and go, "Well, no one bought it."
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:23.280]   Well, yeah, there had to be some work around that, you know, to make it work.
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:26.980]   But I will say the other thing that people--I've talked to a couple folks that getting recommended
[01:57:26.980 --> 01:57:29.880]   on the fact by Apple is--
[01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:30.880]   That helps.
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:34.880]   It's like literally some of them have retired on that, just on a run on a recommendation.
[01:57:34.880 --> 01:57:40.280]   I mean, a well-built app and then showing up on the front page is there was a--someone
[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:48.040]   I knew--I'll not make it specific--but that their app was featured in one of the ads.
[01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:49.880]   And they just said it was stunning.
[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:50.880]   [laughter]
[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:51.880]   You know, it wasn't up to buy a house.
[01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:54.360]   You know, it was, you know, in a week.
[01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:58.200]   You know, it's just--so there's--you know, there are--and again, there's not that many
[01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:03.160]   other places in the world other than sports, which is just as random, you know, that you
[01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:05.520]   can make that much money that quickly.
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:06.520]   You know, I mean--
[01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:09.600]   There was a couple articles about the Trism Guy and Twitter--tweetie guy, like Lauren
[01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:12.880]   Bricter and I forget the Trism Guy, but how much they were making at the height of the
[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:14.680]   app store and it was ludicrous numbers.
[01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:15.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:18.600]   But that is such an apt analogy, though.
[01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:25.160]   It's like there are people who are--who can start with nothing and by the age of 18, be
[01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:29.720]   signed to a five-year NBA contract worth $10 million a year.
[01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:35.200]   And that's what gets all of these kids, like in neglecting their studies, to make sure
[01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:39.120]   that they become really good at basketball because they don't imagine themselves being
[01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:44.240]   one of the 92.8% of aspiring who blow out a knee at age 14.
[01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:46.240]   Yeah, but the difference is, of course--
[01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:50.840]   The difference is that when you turn 18 and you don't get signed, all you know how to
[01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:51.960]   do is play basketball.
[01:58:51.960 --> 01:58:56.520]   You know, when you turn 18 and you don't get signed for this, but you know how to program.
[01:58:56.520 --> 01:58:57.520]   You can code.
[01:58:57.520 --> 01:58:59.520]   You know, that was a--you got a really good skill.
[01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:01.520]   It's a skill that almost everybody wants.
[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:02.520]   Right.
[01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:03.680]   So it's not a bad thing.
[01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:08.120]   I'm trying to slowly pull my kids into programming just so that they--you don't want to--
[01:59:08.120 --> 01:59:09.120]   Swift?
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:10.120]   Would you teach him Swift?
[01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:11.120]   I don't know, it's all I'm teaching him.
[01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:12.120]   Swift.
[01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:15.720]   I'm not even--well, I mean that and a variety of coding for Arduino and you know that kind
[01:59:15.720 --> 01:59:16.720]   of thing.
[01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:20.080]   So it's, you know, it's a little bit of mixed--the idea of thinking about it.
[01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:22.880]   At first, I don't want them thinking about they could get a job or anything else.
[01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:24.440]   I just want them to see that using--
[01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:25.440]   It's fun!
[01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:26.440]   Like, how does it see it's fun?
[01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:27.440]   It's just a fix thing.
[01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:28.440]   Like a line.
[01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:31.600]   That's why we were talking about like how to water the plants or how to do these other
[01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:32.600]   things.
[01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:33.600]   I just want to fix things.
[01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:34.600]   Like, how to make a whole life.
[01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:35.600]   Like, how to make a whole life.
[01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:36.600]   Like, how to make a whole life.
[01:59:36.600 --> 01:59:37.600]   You got to actually enjoy it.
[01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:40.800]   I learned how to code because I was--I was tired of rolling dice for Dungeons and Dragons.
[01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:41.800]   That's a great reason.
[01:59:41.800 --> 01:59:45.760]   My first app was--it was something just--just created non-player characters because I was
[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:49.120]   a dungeon master and I couldn't--I was like, "This is taking forever to build all these
[01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:50.120]   non-player characters."
[01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:51.120]   That's actually really good.
[01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:52.120]   It's true.
[01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:53.120]   Yeah.
[01:59:53.120 --> 01:59:56.760]   You know, and so that was my impetus and then I did rocket trajectories, which is much
[01:59:56.760 --> 01:59:57.760]   more interesting.
[01:59:57.760 --> 01:59:58.760]   Learned a lot more.
[01:59:58.760 --> 01:59:59.760]   Yeah.
[01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:04.680]   That's why I don't like when people show me curricula for learning--for programming.
[02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:10.640]   I'm always kind of bummed out when it really is more like, "Here, we're going to teach
[02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:11.920]   you how to do math."
[02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:14.560]   Like no, that's not how programming works.
[02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:20.920]   We don't teach--we give kids paper and crayons and tell them to draw whatever they want.
[02:00:20.920 --> 02:00:23.240]   We don't teach them all about the history of the crayon.
[02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:27.840]   We don't tell them about how varying pressure can create great varying lines.
[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:31.760]   The way to teach programming is to say, "What kind of app is not out there yet but you'd
[02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:32.760]   love to have?"
[02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:36.200]   It doesn't have to be--I'm not talking about making success in the app store.
[02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:38.800]   It's like, "For you, for you, Little Alex.
[02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:40.000]   What is the Little Alex app?"
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:44.720]   So I want one so that every time I have a piece of gum, I can keep track of what kind
[02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:46.600]   of piece of gum I had and how it lasted.
[02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:47.600]   Great.
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:51.680]   So for the next four weeks, we're going to build a Little Alex's piece of gum, how long
[02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:55.560]   did that last app, and that's how you learn step by step by step.
[02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:57.360]   That really is the way to go.
[02:00:57.360 --> 02:01:05.440]   But one thing I really wanted to respond to though is that I don't think we should give
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:06.880]   all the credit to the app store.
[02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:11.120]   I think there's a three-legged stool here that the app store would not have had--you
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:15.800]   need the app store, you need a powerful mobile device, and you need mobile broadband.
[02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:21.320]   It wasn't--with any one of these three legs of the stool missing, neither of them would
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:22.600]   have been quite so good.
[02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:27.520]   We had mobile apps and stores where you could get mobile apps, but we didn't have an internet,
[02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:30.520]   and we didn't have something as well done as the app store.
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:33.360]   And it wasn't just the app store.
[02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:39.200]   It was that someone decides to write an Instagram app that can suddenly take this--take this--you're
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:44.720]   no longer taking your phone home and syncing these wonderful two megapixel images and then
[02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:46.800]   emailing them to people on AOL.
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:49.000]   You are basically saying, "Hey, here I am.
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:50.000]   Here's my food.
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:53.000]   Here's the person who was mean to me at the parking lot."
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:56.880]   And that's what gets people to the app store to find out what the next app they want to
[02:01:56.880 --> 02:01:57.880]   get is.
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:00.400]   I hope you're enjoying our holiday wraps.
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:01.400]   That's that Rudolph.
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:03.400]   It's okay.
[02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:06.120]   Mac Break Weekly, wonderful 2018.
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:09.120]   It has been--you know, I think back to the movie.
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:16.200]   Remember the movie, the social network where Sean Parker meets Mark Zuckerberg in a loud,
[02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:23.680]   crowded bar, and Zuckerberg says Facebook could be worth a lot, a million dollars even,
[02:02:23.680 --> 02:02:27.240]   and Parker tells him, "You know what's cool?
[02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:28.440]   A million dollars isn't cool.
[02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:29.440]   You know what's cool?
[02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:30.440]   A billion dollars.
[02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:31.440]   You know what's super cool?"
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:37.440]   I feel like Dr. Evil won trillion dollars.
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:38.440]   Apple was aiming for it.
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:39.680]   Finally, they did hit it.
[02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:40.680]   Watch.
[02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:42.280]   Oh, yeah.
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:45.280]   Did we mention Apple at a trillion dollar market?
[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:46.280]   Yeah.
[02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:47.280]   Did we mention that?
[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:49.560]   I mean, it's a vanity metric, but what a big number.
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:55.440]   Well, you know that it really is--for a little reality check there as well, it's a vanity
[02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:59.440]   number especially given the fact that it wouldn't be anywhere near that if they weren't spending
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:03.600]   hundreds of billions of dollars buying their own stock back.
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:06.920]   I mean, there's a little bit of a--you know, that's stock--the stock when we really talk
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:07.920]   about stock value.
[02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:08.920]   I mean, I think Apple's doing great.
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:09.920]   They're going to keep on making more money.
[02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:10.920]   That's great.
[02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:13.200]   But that is not what's giving them a trillion dollar valuation.
[02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:17.360]   It's giving them a trillion dollar valuation is basically taking an otherwise stagnant
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:23.680]   stock and basically inflating it by buying their own and keeping the investors happy.
[02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:24.920]   Otherwise, people wouldn't move on.
[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:29.280]   I'm also impressed that they've managed to become a trillion dollar company without
[02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:32.400]   amassing a whole bunch of really terrible scandals.
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:38.320]   Like, I have so much respect for so many things that Amazon has achieved, but I do not like
[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:44.600]   the fact that every single conversation about Amazon that consists of more than four sentences
[02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:50.000]   has to include the phrase, but they treat their lowest paid workers like crap.
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:57.600]   That Facebook is a very successful company, but they are essentially a beehive, full of
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:03.800]   horrible ideas implemented carelessly with thought to how best to protect its users from
[02:04:03.800 --> 02:04:07.240]   the community that its own--that's its own servers are created.
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:12.240]   Whereas Apple, all you basically get are a couple of really intense attention getting.
[02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:17.820]   Oh, well, they're recycling a certain element from their phone frames, but they could be
[02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:19.200]   recycling more.
[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:25.040]   Or yes, they're paying their workers in subcontractors in China very, very well and treating them
[02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:30.160]   very, very well compared to other manufacturers, but maybe they could be treating them well.
[02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:34.040]   So the fact that they--I always take things tongue in cheek when you have a company that
[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:38.200]   likes to position itself as, "Oh, well, we are a very ethical company and we are a very
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:42.720]   green company and we are very, very positive and we have values that we feel are very,
[02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:46.920]   very positive," but Apple tends to actually deliver on that stuff too.
[02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:47.920]   So that has to be mentioned.
[02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:51.880]   And I think that one of the things when we look at those sock buybacks, the only thing
[02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:55.640]   I was going to say is that I think that one of the things we see here is the schism between
[02:04:55.640 --> 02:05:00.000]   Apple's personality, I think, and how much money they're making.
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:05.280]   And they're actually making money--they're focused like a startup and they're making
[02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:09.000]   money like a--like the biggest company in the world.
[02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:13.400]   And the problem is they literally don't have a culture of--well, we could just experiment
[02:05:13.400 --> 02:05:14.400]   with a bunch of things.
[02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:18.560]   We could take that $100 billion and we could buy T-Mobile and create a sell-not-work-and-buy,
[02:05:18.560 --> 02:05:19.840]   something else and do this.
[02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:22.480]   They don't want to be distracted and they have something that works.
[02:05:22.480 --> 02:05:27.120]   I think that someday down the road, we may say, "Well, that might have been a good idea
[02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:30.280]   to get distracted and move into other businesses."
[02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:36.160]   So far, they've been able to leverage this really well, but it does create a pretty,
[02:05:36.160 --> 02:05:42.240]   you know, like very top-heavy situation where if the iPhone collapsed for some reason, you
[02:05:42.240 --> 02:05:48.160]   know, Apple would still make billions, but not in the same way.
[02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:55.600]   >> Actually, when you talk about stock buybacks, it reminds me that Elon Musk this morning
[02:05:55.600 --> 02:05:58.080]   dropped a bombshell on Twitter.
[02:05:58.080 --> 02:06:03.720]   Not the first time Elon's done this this morning, a couple of hours ago, and considering taking
[02:06:03.720 --> 02:06:09.600]   Tesla private at $420, that's per share, funding secured.
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:12.720]   And then he tweets, "Good morning."
[02:06:12.720 --> 02:06:19.720]   >> But he's almost becoming like the--what Donald Trump is to high-level politics.
[02:06:19.720 --> 02:06:20.720]   What--
[02:06:20.720 --> 02:06:21.720]   >> I know, I know.
[02:06:21.720 --> 02:06:28.240]   Because he says these things and you don't know whether you can dismiss them because maybe
[02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:34.800]   he had a bad fig in his breakfast or something, or this is just a passing thought that he's
[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:40.120]   not really going to commit to, didn't the stock like just--or maybe he was just trying
[02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:41.120]   to buy the market.
[02:06:41.120 --> 02:06:42.920]   >> The market's taken seriously.
[02:06:42.920 --> 02:06:45.160]   The stock's suspended trading.
[02:06:45.160 --> 02:06:50.960]   So whatever he's meant, he certainly had the effect.
[02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:52.440]   There's no doubt about that.
[02:06:52.440 --> 02:06:59.800]   >> I love the--we were showing the Times infographic from last Thursday on what $1 trillion is.
[02:06:59.800 --> 02:07:06.200]   Apple is worth way more than all the major automakers in the world.
[02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:12.500]   Apple is worth more than the entire media industry, the American media industry.
[02:07:12.500 --> 02:07:18.540]   If you put Netflix, Comcast, Disney, all the major news publishers and all the TV channels,
[02:07:18.540 --> 02:07:24.380]   it would still be $848 billion less than the trillion that Apple is worth.
[02:07:24.380 --> 02:07:26.660]   That's a lot of money.
[02:07:26.660 --> 02:07:29.620]   >> It seems like every single time there's either an article.
[02:07:29.620 --> 02:07:33.140]   There's never been a really cool animated infographic like that.
[02:07:33.140 --> 02:07:39.980]   But they all remind me of the same S.E. TV sketch where it's like a Russian broadcaster
[02:07:39.980 --> 02:07:45.020]   with a big, big map of the USSR behind him saying, "Look how puny they're now.
[02:07:45.020 --> 02:07:47.660]   I'm going to take the country for Australia.
[02:07:47.660 --> 02:07:49.380]   Massive continent, yes.
[02:07:49.380 --> 02:07:53.780]   Look how tiny it is when we put it inside the borders of Russia.
[02:07:53.780 --> 02:07:59.380]   Now let's add--it's like, okay, that's fine.
[02:07:59.380 --> 02:08:05.540]   The fact that it's trying to our company, it doesn't help that keyboard anymore, any
[02:08:05.540 --> 02:08:06.540]   dozen.
[02:08:06.540 --> 02:08:07.540]   And it doesn't solve the dongle problem.
[02:08:07.540 --> 02:08:12.300]   >> No, and in fact, we say that every time we talk about--as we have the last 20 minutes
[02:08:12.300 --> 02:08:20.140]   stock pricing and quarterly results, it's only a small indicator in what we care about,
[02:08:20.140 --> 02:08:22.460]   which is, do you want to--how do you use your Mac?
[02:08:22.460 --> 02:08:23.460]   How do you use your iPad?
[02:08:23.460 --> 02:08:24.460]   What do you want to--
[02:08:24.460 --> 02:08:25.460]   >> Totally different game.
[02:08:25.460 --> 02:08:26.460]   >> It's a different game.
[02:08:26.460 --> 02:08:30.740]   >> Okay, let's go on to the new iPhone 10s.
[02:08:30.740 --> 02:08:35.300]   I wouldn't say that it was a remarkable update they had.
[02:08:35.300 --> 02:08:38.540]   So they took the--here's in broad strokes, here's what happened.
[02:08:38.540 --> 02:08:43.020]   They took the iPhone 10 of last year and they did two things to it.
[02:08:43.020 --> 02:08:49.580]   They gave it the nominal incremental upgrade that we often see in an off year with matching
[02:08:49.580 --> 02:08:55.800]   the same prices and keeping the same sort of prestigious surgical stainless steel, as
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:09:02.580]   was said during the keynote, and the wonderful OLED display, screen to screen, and upgraded
[02:09:02.580 --> 02:09:05.740]   to the processor and all this sort of stuff.
[02:09:05.740 --> 02:09:08.340]   And that was nice.
[02:09:08.340 --> 02:09:16.100]   It's also--they also added a new addition to the 5.8 inch screen display that has on the
[02:09:16.100 --> 02:09:23.260]   regular iPhone XS X pause S, so we don't say XS.
[02:09:23.260 --> 02:09:26.140]   >> Well, I think that they--
[02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:27.140]   >> 2.
[02:09:27.140 --> 02:09:30.660]   >> They want you to say 10s.
[02:09:30.660 --> 02:09:32.660]   >> Yeah, I see.
[02:09:32.660 --> 02:09:35.660]   Apple's--let's have a sidebar here.
[02:09:35.660 --> 02:09:38.460]   I think Apple has lost its product naming mojo.
[02:09:38.460 --> 02:09:44.620]   I mean, I think we're all old enough to remember the day when someone--when it was possible
[02:09:44.620 --> 02:09:51.140]   to buy a Macintosh centrist XL 747.
[02:09:51.140 --> 02:09:56.820]   They began--and you have these--that's different from the 745 because the 747 was a label exactly
[02:09:56.820 --> 02:10:02.980]   for the Sears stores, and the 746 is the one that was available at Office Max.
[02:10:02.980 --> 02:10:08.300]   And so now we're dealing with--we got the XS, which is the super expensive--that's how
[02:10:08.300 --> 02:10:13.220]   I'm remembering it--it's the XS super expensive.
[02:10:13.220 --> 02:10:15.940]   That's the $999 phone.
[02:10:15.940 --> 02:10:21.300]   They have added the 6.5 inch XS Max that does not roll off the tongue.
[02:10:21.300 --> 02:10:23.060]   I will tell you that.
[02:10:23.060 --> 02:10:30.540]   And now the top price--one of the main features and a very long technical rollout of this device
[02:10:30.540 --> 02:10:39.140]   during the keynote, the new A12 Bionic processor is that now this can address a whopping 512
[02:10:39.140 --> 02:10:40.340]   gigabytes of storage.
[02:10:40.340 --> 02:10:44.900]   So if you want to--the largest amount of money, if you're really just there to make sure that
[02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:50.100]   by the end of the year you've spent as much of your expense account as you possibly can
[02:10:50.100 --> 02:11:01.820]   before it rolls over, you can buy a 512 gigabyte iPhone XS Max for $1,449.
[02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:11.020]   If you're going to cheap out the XR--the smaller version will max out at $1,299.
[02:11:11.020 --> 02:11:15.220]   But so you've got the XS, the XS Max.
[02:11:15.220 --> 02:11:23.660]   Underneath that is the "budget" version of this, the XR, which they cut a few corners
[02:11:23.660 --> 02:11:29.380]   instead of getting stainless steel, you get aluminum, instead of getting an OLED screen,
[02:11:29.380 --> 02:11:34.940]   you get an LED display, but this is Apple, so they have to tell you it is a liquid retina
[02:11:34.940 --> 02:11:35.940]   display.
[02:11:35.940 --> 02:11:42.140]   One of the most amazing LED displays ever shipped, they'll be shipping a month later.
[02:11:42.140 --> 02:11:50.820]   And that one is going to be less expensive to the tune of starting at, I believe, $799.
[02:11:50.820 --> 02:11:56.100]   Am I--we're both of you a little bit confused, and are there little birdies just sort of
[02:11:56.100 --> 02:12:00.460]   tweeting in circles, cartoon-like around your head trying to keep all of these things straight
[02:12:00.460 --> 02:12:01.860]   in their features?
[02:12:01.860 --> 02:12:05.380]   >> Mostly I'm confused why you keep calling it an iPhone X.
[02:12:05.380 --> 02:12:06.380]   >> It's a 10.
[02:12:06.380 --> 02:12:09.540]   >> Because it's the letter X, okay?
[02:12:09.540 --> 02:12:11.100]   It's the letter X.
[02:12:11.100 --> 02:12:19.220]   If they wanted to call it the iPhone X, see that was the iPhone 8 called the iPhone V-I-I-I,
[02:12:19.220 --> 02:12:20.220]   it was not.
[02:12:20.220 --> 02:12:21.220]   >> No, it was not.
[02:12:21.220 --> 02:12:24.500]   So you don't call it the iPhone V-I-I-I, you call it an iPhone 8.
[02:12:24.500 --> 02:12:25.500]   This is the--
[02:12:25.500 --> 02:12:29.740]   >> They would have known if they wanted to be the iPhone X, they would have had a 1
[02:12:29.740 --> 02:12:30.740]   and a 0.
[02:12:30.740 --> 02:12:33.740]   They put an X, so they wanted me to call it the iPhone X.
[02:12:33.740 --> 02:12:35.260]   And also X is cooler.
[02:12:35.260 --> 02:12:39.900]   >> The best star word movie is not episode V, Andy.
[02:12:39.900 --> 02:12:43.820]   >> Patrick Stewart, Patrick Stewart does not play Professor 10.
[02:12:43.820 --> 02:12:45.860]   He plays Professor What X?
[02:12:45.860 --> 02:12:47.140]   I rest my case.
[02:12:47.140 --> 02:12:48.500]   >> Yes, okay.
[02:12:48.500 --> 02:12:50.620]   And what operating system does your computer run?
[02:12:50.620 --> 02:12:52.260]   Because it's not OS X, sweetie.
[02:12:52.260 --> 02:12:55.540]   I love you, Andy, but you're calling it an X and it's killing me.
[02:12:55.540 --> 02:13:00.860]   >> Well, I think that OS X is where this all came from because we all knew that it was
[02:13:00.860 --> 02:13:02.700]   telling us that we were moving to Unix.
[02:13:02.700 --> 02:13:04.220]   And so it was like OS.
[02:13:04.220 --> 02:13:06.620]   So to us, it was like OS X because it's like Linux.
[02:13:06.620 --> 02:13:07.620]   It's like Unix.
[02:13:07.620 --> 02:13:10.780]   It's like, all of us just kept on saying OS X.
[02:13:10.780 --> 02:13:12.540]   Not all of us, but many of us did.
[02:13:12.540 --> 02:13:14.140]   And it just seems silly to call it OS X.
[02:13:14.140 --> 02:13:16.980]   And I think that we've just never really gotten out of that habit of like when we see
[02:13:16.980 --> 02:13:20.660]   that, I know that they say 10, but we're going to just keep saying X.
[02:13:20.660 --> 02:13:21.660]   So--
[02:13:21.660 --> 02:13:22.660]   >> Well, we have a--
[02:13:22.660 --> 02:13:23.660]   >> Well, we have a bug.
[02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:26.540]   >> It bugs me in part of the reason that it bugs me is because it never got broken from
[02:13:26.540 --> 02:13:31.980]   the OS X stuff back in the day.
[02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:35.380]   It's 10, 14 now and we still call it--
[02:13:35.380 --> 02:13:39.460]   people, like they're getting away from that by referring to everything by the code name
[02:13:39.460 --> 02:13:43.180]   so that they don't have to worry about is it OS X or OS X.
[02:13:43.180 --> 02:13:46.700]   So the thing that I don't like about it is that all of a sudden we've got all these
[02:13:46.700 --> 02:13:50.060]   weird naming conventions that we didn't have before.
[02:13:50.060 --> 02:13:56.980]   And I don't mind that I don't mind that they want to come up with their own naming conventions
[02:13:56.980 --> 02:14:02.620]   but don't spend 10 years giving me naming conventions and then burn them all down.
[02:14:02.620 --> 02:14:05.300]   That's the part that I'm sort of frustrated about.
[02:14:05.300 --> 02:14:09.940]   Like the last time we got an iPhone that came in colors, it ended in C. It was the same
[02:14:09.940 --> 02:14:13.980]   phone but color but the backs were colored.
[02:14:13.980 --> 02:14:19.420]   So if you bought one that was a different color, it was the 5C instead of the 5.
[02:14:19.420 --> 02:14:21.140]   All the other stuff was the same.
[02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:23.100]   >> It's a minimal like device.
[02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:24.860]   It's a handy minimal like device.
[02:14:24.860 --> 02:14:25.900]   >> Right, that too.
[02:14:25.900 --> 02:14:28.940]   So I was like, oh, so this is the 10C.
[02:14:28.940 --> 02:14:32.140]   No, it's an R. We're not going to tell you why we called it R because remember the S always
[02:14:32.140 --> 02:14:34.380]   used to stand for different stuff on the other phones.
[02:14:34.380 --> 02:14:40.940]   Like the S was for speed and the S was for Siri and the S was for other things.
[02:14:40.940 --> 02:14:44.820]   They always said like this one is the S model because it's got this other thing.
[02:14:44.820 --> 02:14:48.220]   And this time they're like it's R and we're not going to tell you why.
[02:14:48.220 --> 02:14:49.740]   It's just an R now.
[02:14:49.740 --> 02:14:52.900]   And we're going to call the other one 10S and we're not going to have a 10S plus.
[02:14:52.900 --> 02:14:56.420]   We've conditioned you for years that the big phone is the plus but no more.
[02:14:56.420 --> 02:15:00.380]   Now we're going to call it max but next year are they going to have an iPhone 5 or does
[02:15:00.380 --> 02:15:02.620]   everything start with an X now?
[02:15:02.620 --> 02:15:06.860]   Like all of the rest of them are going to be 10 models from here forward and we're never
[02:15:06.860 --> 02:15:08.780]   going to get an iPhone 9.
[02:15:08.780 --> 02:15:11.580]   Like I mean we never technically we never really got an 8 because it's actually the
[02:15:11.580 --> 02:15:14.180]   7S even though they put it out of its misery today.
[02:15:14.180 --> 02:15:18.980]   The thing overall the thing about it that I don't like is that on top of the naming convention
[02:15:18.980 --> 02:15:20.620]   being super confusing.
[02:15:20.620 --> 02:15:26.260]   Now additionally we have the fact that they're selling seven different models because they're
[02:15:26.260 --> 02:15:30.460]   still selling the seven and the eight and the seven plus and the eight plus and now they've
[02:15:30.460 --> 02:15:38.820]   added the 10C and the new 10S and then the 10S plus even though that's not what they're
[02:15:38.820 --> 02:15:39.820]   calling them.
[02:15:39.820 --> 02:15:42.140]   So that takes us to seven models of iPhone.
[02:15:42.140 --> 02:15:47.220]   So like when you walk in it's going to be you know the dozen Android phones down one
[02:15:47.220 --> 02:15:49.820]   side and the dozen iPhones down the other side.
[02:15:49.820 --> 02:15:50.820]   And like that.
[02:15:50.820 --> 02:15:57.740]   But I think that's part of I actually think that that is part of what Apple has to do is
[02:15:57.740 --> 02:16:00.900]   because they are one company serving is the same thing with Max where you have to kind
[02:16:00.900 --> 02:16:05.060]   of cover the gamut is those androids a lot of them are by different manufacturers with
[02:16:05.060 --> 02:16:06.060]   different form factors.
[02:16:06.060 --> 02:16:09.580]   Now Samsung does a lot of different form factors as far as you know how that goes.
[02:16:09.580 --> 02:16:15.700]   And so so providing those is kind of giving that a community that doesn't have other choices
[02:16:15.700 --> 02:16:18.260]   the theoretical choices that they that they want.
[02:16:18.260 --> 02:16:21.980]   I think Apple has to you know manage the fact that there are some people that are going
[02:16:21.980 --> 02:16:25.100]   to want an iPhone that aren't going to want to spend seven hundred and fifty dollars on
[02:16:25.100 --> 02:16:30.300]   one with the fact that that's all they really want you to buy seven fifty and up.
[02:16:30.300 --> 02:16:33.860]   You know like that's like you know they're being nice with the other ones and those are
[02:16:33.860 --> 02:16:34.860]   very solid phones.
[02:16:34.860 --> 02:16:40.620]   I still use a seven you know as my other my international phone and it's a great phone.
[02:16:40.620 --> 02:16:48.980]   So I think that you know the price that price dropping down the the new R is 95% the quality
[02:16:48.980 --> 02:16:54.540]   of or maybe 90% the quality of last year's top of the model for two hundred dollars less.
[02:16:54.540 --> 02:17:00.420]   There was one story this year that resonated throughout all of our shows not just Mac break
[02:17:00.420 --> 02:17:05.060]   weekly but Twit and security now and it's really something probably be considered I think
[02:17:05.060 --> 02:17:11.380]   the story of the year 2018 still something of a mystery it's Bloomberg's story about
[02:17:11.380 --> 02:17:14.820]   the Chinese chip hack.
[02:17:14.820 --> 02:17:19.180]   I asked the Mac break weekly panel what they thought of the story.
[02:17:19.180 --> 02:17:23.660]   Well let's talk about privacy because the big story of the week and I would love to get
[02:17:23.660 --> 02:17:30.060]   your take on this the big hack from Bloomberg Business Week came out on Thursday claiming
[02:17:30.060 --> 02:17:38.700]   that China put a tiny chip on motherboards coming from Super Micro that are used everywhere.
[02:17:38.700 --> 02:17:43.260]   We use them because they're they were Amazon discovered right before they bought the elemental
[02:17:43.260 --> 02:17:48.260]   they wanted it to check security report in the Bloomberg again everything we say will
[02:17:48.260 --> 02:17:55.780]   be according to Bloomberg Business Week and these elementals are everywhere from the
[02:17:55.780 --> 02:17:59.820]   Mormon Church to the Department of Defense to I own 20 of them.
[02:17:59.820 --> 02:18:04.660]   Yeah do you own any of the old Super Micro based because all of ours are we traded that
[02:18:04.660 --> 02:18:08.660]   in for Amazon we go I want you to bring in one and we'll take it apart we'll see if
[02:18:08.660 --> 02:18:10.740]   we can find that ship.
[02:18:10.740 --> 02:18:19.260]   Well okay so I'll complete the story the next day Amazon Apple the Chinese government all
[02:18:19.260 --> 02:18:24.820]   say BS it didn't happen Apple was very aggressive in its denial.
[02:18:24.820 --> 02:18:29.020]   Who barely ever answers press inquiries and answers them in the tercest way possible
[02:18:29.020 --> 02:18:32.380]   when it does answer them put out pages of retort.
[02:18:32.380 --> 02:18:37.540]   Yeah and here's the letter they wrote to the members of Congress who inquired about it
[02:18:37.540 --> 02:18:42.900]   the energy committee the Commerce Science and Transportation Committee.
[02:18:42.900 --> 02:18:46.660]   We were struck by the fact that the gravity and magnitude of the claims seemed to be undermined
[02:18:46.660 --> 02:18:49.380]   by their uncertainty around key details.
[02:18:49.380 --> 02:18:54.540]   Nevertheless we worked tirelessly to ascertain whether these claims are true or failing that
[02:18:54.540 --> 02:19:00.820]   if anything even like them was true in the end our internal investigations directly contradict
[02:19:00.820 --> 02:19:04.820]   every consequential assertion made in the article some of which we know were based on
[02:19:04.820 --> 02:19:09.500]   a single anonymous source although we should point out the article itself had 17 anonymous
[02:19:09.500 --> 02:19:11.100]   synonymous sources.
[02:19:11.100 --> 02:19:16.380]   Well that doesn't surprise me because if you knew this and you talked to Bloomberg Business
[02:19:16.380 --> 02:19:20.620]   Week you're in this letter of name I mean a small room in this letter was signed by the
[02:19:20.620 --> 02:19:23.180]   head of InfoSec at Apple which is unusual too.
[02:19:23.180 --> 02:19:28.020]   Yeah I mean this so one thing some people claimed is maybe the Apple PR department didn't know
[02:19:28.020 --> 02:19:32.980]   but this guy would for sure know Apple's never found malicious chips.
[02:19:32.980 --> 02:19:33.980]   And they have Bruce Sewell's.
[02:19:33.980 --> 02:19:34.980]   Right.
[02:19:34.980 --> 02:19:41.620]   The common thing is that for a publicly traded company to be so assertive puts themselves
[02:19:41.620 --> 02:19:47.740]   at incredible risk of lawsuits and SEC violations and everything else for them to come out and
[02:19:47.740 --> 02:19:51.340]   a publicly traded company to come out and say this and have all of them say it.
[02:19:51.340 --> 02:19:55.380]   Yeah I was on a Zoom and they're like they're not they're risking a lot to say that.
[02:19:55.380 --> 02:20:01.940]   Look at the Department of Homeland Security's Saturday announcement we currently have no reason
[02:20:01.940 --> 02:20:05.940]   to doubt statements from companies that have denied this.
[02:20:05.940 --> 02:20:07.940]   Throw that one away.
[02:20:07.940 --> 02:20:15.020]   Well I don't throw it away because to me that's them saying well okay but we're not going
[02:20:15.020 --> 02:20:17.980]   to that's that's hedging.
[02:20:17.980 --> 02:20:22.460]   If there were that many Super Micro things that were sent in because this has to be part
[02:20:22.460 --> 02:20:23.460]   of a fab.
[02:20:23.460 --> 02:20:28.100]   I agree we will know sooner or later because you and others have these elemental motherboards
[02:20:28.100 --> 02:20:32.020]   and I think that but the thing is if I was Bloomberg I would have found that first.
[02:20:32.020 --> 02:20:33.260]   Like I find one.
[02:20:33.260 --> 02:20:37.100]   Yeah you find one that lot of things we're talking about thousands of processor thousands
[02:20:37.100 --> 02:20:42.660]   of of Super Micro's that are floating around here with this infamous chip that they you've
[02:20:42.660 --> 02:20:43.660]   got to explain.
[02:20:43.660 --> 02:20:46.860]   I would not have made that I would not have created this I would not have written this
[02:20:46.860 --> 02:20:53.860]   or at least not published it until I had a board but but 17 sources is a lot of sources.
[02:20:53.860 --> 02:21:00.460]   When they're anonymous and this is of Bloomberg Business Week is not a fly by night operation
[02:21:00.460 --> 02:21:06.140]   no but they've been working on this for a year and without one someone coming on the
[02:21:06.140 --> 02:21:10.780]   record I have this issue and no board no one first of all no one is going to go on the
[02:21:10.780 --> 02:21:12.540]   record you'd be in jail.
[02:21:12.540 --> 02:21:15.980]   I swear to God no one's going to go on the record on this.
[02:21:15.980 --> 02:21:20.060]   No one is going to go on the record what may happen and what I hope will happen I expect
[02:21:20.060 --> 02:21:25.820]   will happen is somebody who has one of these motherboards finds this chip and by the way
[02:21:25.820 --> 02:21:29.500]   this isn't that chip that's the wrong this isn't the chip that's the that's another statement
[02:21:29.500 --> 02:21:37.460]   by the way by the one person the one person who was quoted by name in it a security researcher
[02:21:37.460 --> 02:21:43.260]   said you know this it doesn't smell right because I talked to Jordan Robertson one of
[02:21:43.260 --> 02:21:50.900]   the journalists who wrote this story and a lot of the stuff that he that I told him was
[02:21:50.900 --> 02:21:58.780]   last year was regurgitated word for word he said this is a security expert named Joe
[02:21:58.780 --> 02:22:03.700]   Fitzpatrick said I would never do it this way frankly a hard way implants too easy to
[02:22:03.700 --> 02:22:10.100]   discover it's much simpler just to do you know firmware modifications and so forth he
[02:22:10.100 --> 02:22:13.220]   also said that he doesn't work for a nation state it would be highly unlikely a nation
[02:22:13.220 --> 02:22:16.620]   state would implement something that's the exact same way that he sort of off the cuff
[02:22:16.620 --> 02:22:18.660]   explained to a reporter how it might work.
[02:22:18.660 --> 02:22:24.660]   No I don't find that convincing either so I there that remains I think the question remains
[02:22:24.660 --> 02:22:30.220]   is Bloomberg lying Alex is that what you're saying or is it sloppy reporting I think it's
[02:22:30.220 --> 02:22:34.020]   sloppy reporting I think that I think that I think that they're gonna it's this is gonna
[02:22:34.020 --> 02:22:37.220]   damage their brand and I think people are gonna lose their jobs you know like it's it
[02:22:37.220 --> 02:22:42.220]   is it is not gonna it because it is true they should have waited until they had evidence
[02:22:42.220 --> 02:22:45.140]   you know they should have waited until they had a board if there's thousands of these
[02:22:45.140 --> 02:22:50.280]   boards around I mean I if if one of these boards exists I bought super micros in the
[02:22:50.280 --> 02:22:51.940]   time frame that they're talking many of them.
[02:22:51.940 --> 02:22:55.620]   2015 so do you have two have two have two have two have four micro based elementals from
[02:22:55.620 --> 02:22:56.940]   2014 2015.
[02:22:56.940 --> 02:23:03.500]   Absolutely well I think you OS I'll bring I'll bring one in I'll send it to I fix it I'll
[02:23:03.500 --> 02:23:07.860]   send I'll send an elemental I fix is pretty good at identifying chips there's
[02:23:07.860 --> 02:23:13.260]   can't actually chip works it often does the works the hard work I happy with so I you know
[02:23:13.260 --> 02:23:19.540]   it's old seen a lot of miles I could I could send one to I fix it if I if if you give me
[02:23:19.540 --> 02:23:22.460]   somewhere to go I'll send it out and they can look at it and see if they can you imagine
[02:23:22.460 --> 02:23:27.020]   if this is the red team three episode of the net of the newsroom just played out it's hard
[02:23:27.020 --> 02:23:32.780]   to imagine the scenario here is is possible that the US government played Bloomberg because
[02:23:32.780 --> 02:23:38.580]   of course the US government which I might point out is doing exactly this thing to others
[02:23:38.580 --> 02:23:44.540]   everybody's doing to everybody like not installing it on to the on the board is well you know
[02:23:44.540 --> 02:23:51.060]   where this okay so I talked to somebody who knows a little bit about this where this sometimes
[02:23:51.060 --> 02:23:57.220]   most often happens is not in the super micro factory but after it's shipped and the and
[02:23:57.220 --> 02:24:04.700]   the box goes through a depot in you know Bethesda somebody opens the box modifies the
[02:24:04.700 --> 02:24:09.380]   motherboard and sends it on that we know that happens we that that actually has happened
[02:24:09.380 --> 02:24:15.340]   we know that happens it happens from us happens from China happens in happens in many countries
[02:24:15.340 --> 02:24:20.260]   is there we know we know that happens Israel we know that happens so that's not a surprise
[02:24:20.260 --> 02:24:26.460]   I mean I guess the the hot potato here is did site super micro do this themselves yeah
[02:24:26.460 --> 02:24:30.300]   I the thing is is that it's it's generally just not not something you want to go back
[02:24:30.300 --> 02:24:34.060]   to the factory where it's going to back to the assembler where it's going to go through
[02:24:34.060 --> 02:24:37.460]   a whole system of checks and everything else before it goes out you want to do it after
[02:24:37.460 --> 02:24:41.900]   that when it's on the way so you know where you're where it's going you know and who you
[02:24:41.900 --> 02:24:45.140]   and who you want to spy on because setting out too many places makes it easier to right
[02:24:45.140 --> 02:24:48.900]   like putting in the part that seems very improbable is putting into the manufacturing
[02:24:48.900 --> 02:24:54.500]   process you know just seems like if it was if they put it in the manufacturing process
[02:24:54.500 --> 02:24:58.660]   that is a lot of computers out there I mean that's the only thing that we're just that
[02:24:58.660 --> 02:25:03.060]   you then disagree with not that it doesn't happen doesn't happen all the time but that
[02:25:03.060 --> 02:25:07.900]   super micro got caught doing it they're by the way they're based in San Jose they're not
[02:25:07.900 --> 02:25:14.220]   they're a US company although run by a Chinese national for me the thing is the denials I
[02:25:14.220 --> 02:25:17.300]   mean like Apple and Amazon could conceive look we're looking into this we don't know
[02:25:17.300 --> 02:25:20.780]   what's happened with is no customer data that's been taken we're going to report back to you
[02:25:20.780 --> 02:25:23.460]   and it would have been fine like it would have been annoying but it would have been
[02:25:23.460 --> 02:25:27.500]   fine we would have gotten over it and onto the next controversy by Tuesday but it's the
[02:25:27.500 --> 02:25:30.260]   denials now it's like it's never the cover up it's just right it's never the crime it's
[02:25:30.260 --> 02:25:34.700]   always a cover up to have Bloomberg double down on their sources and to have Apple and Amazon
[02:25:34.700 --> 02:25:40.780]   goes so I've never ever seen these companies go so wholeheartedly on these denials any
[02:25:40.780 --> 02:25:45.100]   party in this could have deescalated early on and saved a ton of face now there is so
[02:25:45.100 --> 02:25:49.420]   much at stake that you have to believe that there were a couple people at Amazon and
[02:25:49.420 --> 02:25:53.060]   and Apple that know this it didn't even tell anybody who they would have to tell during
[02:25:53.060 --> 02:25:57.500]   the normal course of business at their company including the IT and info sec chains and the
[02:25:57.500 --> 02:26:01.820]   legal chains and it's just them sitting there talking to national security and this one
[02:26:01.820 --> 02:26:06.620]   reporter happened to find out or someone managed to bamboozle a reporter or steer them in the
[02:26:06.620 --> 02:26:09.900]   wrong way to the extent that Bloomberg was really they might have to be said there makes
[02:26:09.900 --> 02:26:15.620]   sense to be 17 someone said but he might have 17 things saying like like he like oftentimes
[02:26:15.620 --> 02:26:19.420]   you get in from like you can tell the quality of a journalist not by the sources they get
[02:26:19.420 --> 02:26:23.100]   but by the narrative they extract from them and sell them to reporters state facts more
[02:26:23.100 --> 02:26:27.500]   often than not reporters and their editors construct elaborate narratives around facts
[02:26:27.500 --> 02:26:30.700]   and that's when they tend to make mistakes it's not just reporting the things that they
[02:26:30.700 --> 02:26:35.500]   hear is trying to turn that into a story and they've done something like more often than
[02:26:35.500 --> 02:26:39.020]   not we've seen that especially with Apple we've seen that with things like iPhone 10 sales
[02:26:39.020 --> 02:26:42.060]   where you get a little bit of data and you make this whole iPhone 10 is not selling narrative
[02:26:42.060 --> 02:26:45.740]   turns out to be completely wrong that is always a danger in journalism and that's where there's
[02:26:45.740 --> 02:26:50.860]   potential exposure here we'll get right back to our holiday special just a little bit but before
[02:26:50.860 --> 02:26:55.100]   we go on I do want to add one little thing a gift you can give to us we do this every once
[02:26:55.100 --> 02:27:01.660]   in a while we have our yearly survey for you and since our listeners are we know such techies this
[02:27:01.660 --> 02:27:06.940]   year it's going to focus on how you use collaborative software work something we'd like to know the
[02:27:06.940 --> 02:27:12.220]   surveys brief shouldn't take you more than six minutes we do not and I really underscore this
[02:27:12.220 --> 02:27:16.460]   because it's important for me and I know it's important for you collect any personal data
[02:27:16.460 --> 02:27:27.820]   all we ask is that you go to twit.to/survey12 for the 12th months I guess twit.to/survey12
[02:27:27.820 --> 02:27:32.620]   and if you do that great you don't have to but if you do it it would be a nice gift for us and
[02:27:32.620 --> 02:27:37.980]   it would help us a little bit in planning our future endeavors if you know what I mean and now
[02:27:37.980 --> 02:27:48.700]   on with the show Renee's got his review up almost all the best for way way less 250 bucks less than
[02:27:48.700 --> 02:27:58.140]   an iPhone 10s 350 bucks less than a 10s max but it sits right in the middle right size wise yeah
[02:27:58.140 --> 02:28:03.340]   and Gruber did some math pointing out that you can get 128 gigabyte version of the 10r and not of
[02:28:03.340 --> 02:28:09.660]   the 10s so if you're just a little over 64 but don't want to pony up for the 256 you can save
[02:28:09.660 --> 02:28:17.420]   even more money just by going with the 128 so they don't offer a lot of back there. They go to 256
[02:28:17.420 --> 02:28:22.540]   and then 512 which is like half a terabyte in your pocket. And I never honestly 64 is probably
[02:28:22.540 --> 02:28:27.740]   enough for everything I do. It depends how much 4k and stuff like that that you shoot so
[02:28:28.220 --> 02:28:36.300]   if you use the iCloud photo and yeah you know and if you don't put 100 books on there and your
[02:28:36.300 --> 02:28:43.820]   entire music library 64. You're 19 metallic original sound I'm not pointing at Jim Dalrym
[02:28:43.820 --> 02:28:47.900]   specifically but some people like having all their music with them. Some people want it all
[02:28:47.900 --> 02:28:54.540]   and don't want to stream it. I understand that. Nice hunkered glass. Okay show us let's see
[02:28:54.540 --> 02:29:02.780]   so it is glass glass back. Yes the front glass is exactly the same as the iPhone 10s the back
[02:29:02.780 --> 02:29:07.420]   glass is somewhere in between the 10 and the 10s it's stronger than the 10 not quite as strong
[02:29:07.420 --> 02:29:13.660]   as the 10s. Now some people said that the bezels were unsightly compared to the 10s.
[02:29:13.660 --> 02:29:19.500]   They're not unsightly. They're just bad a little bit bigger. Yeah I turn on the flashlight somehow
[02:29:19.500 --> 02:29:25.340]   that's great. I have to touch to the rescue. There we go. You can see I'm slightly bigger.
[02:29:25.340 --> 02:29:29.420]   If you're coming and it's an LCD not an OLED but if you're coming from an iPhone
[02:29:29.420 --> 02:29:37.260]   6, 7 or 8 you're not going to notice that. No not at all. I mean if I hold up one of these next to it
[02:29:37.260 --> 02:29:41.900]   close I keep getting beta things today Leo it's my beta day and one of my hold up this next to it.
[02:29:41.900 --> 02:29:47.740]   Yeah it's nothing of the same. You do get a notch because I'm hard. But yeah I mean yes
[02:29:47.740 --> 02:29:51.500]   and by the way you're getting all of the internals of the 10s.
[02:29:51.500 --> 02:29:58.460]   It's rather interesting because Apple according to Wall Street Apple's only job is to sell more
[02:29:58.460 --> 02:30:03.740]   iPhones or to sell more expensive iPhones and they've been doing that with the plus and with the 10
[02:30:03.740 --> 02:30:08.620]   line they've been really raising average sales prices and now with the 10R I mean some people are
[02:30:08.620 --> 02:30:14.300]   liking it to the iPhone 5C but that did not have touch ID had the previous generation processor
[02:30:14.300 --> 02:30:21.740]   it really was an iPhone 5 not an iPhone 5S. The iPhone 10R is an iPhone 10 as the same processor
[02:30:21.740 --> 02:30:29.100]   same two-depth camera same wide angle camera on the back it is much closer to an iPhone 10s than it is
[02:30:29.100 --> 02:30:35.900]   an iPhone 10 and that could 250 bucks cheaper that could really skew Apple's
[02:30:35.900 --> 02:30:41.180]   ASPs down again which would not make Wall Street happy but Apple really wants to take the technology
[02:30:41.180 --> 02:30:46.380]   that they have in the 10 line and make it accessible to more people they they have this annoying habit
[02:30:46.380 --> 02:30:51.020]   that Wall Street hates which is to try to grow rather than just monetize and I think it's good
[02:30:51.020 --> 02:30:55.340]   long term thinking that I think it'll get them yelled at short term. Yeah Bravo and screw Wall
[02:30:55.340 --> 02:30:58.860]   Street because I don't think Wall Street's got their best interests at heart they just want to
[02:30:58.860 --> 02:31:05.100]   know cash in as quick as they can. It's still a 750 dollar phone but it's not cheap. That's it but
[02:31:05.100 --> 02:31:11.340]   that said it's a very very pleasant sign that Apple has Apple has consistently tried to do this
[02:31:11.340 --> 02:31:19.740]   we're we feel as though we have a list of price levels that our customers are comfortable with
[02:31:19.740 --> 02:31:24.860]   however that said we are going to continue to try to take the features of the higher end phones
[02:31:24.860 --> 02:31:29.340]   and bring them into the lower price points so the fact that they decided not to make the iPhone 10
[02:31:29.340 --> 02:31:35.660]   into a luxury brand that's here's a here's a here's the thousand dollar an up phone always but simply
[02:31:35.660 --> 02:31:40.460]   to say we're going to use this to put to drop into the one end of this pipeline features that in a
[02:31:40.460 --> 02:31:45.660]   year or two's time is going to be in the mainstream 750 dollar phone that's really really great.
[02:31:45.660 --> 02:31:53.260]   What Renee is missing what don't you get so you don't get the well that's not missing that was
[02:31:53.260 --> 02:31:59.980]   that's gone from a long gone long gone handy you don't get the OLED display you get an LCD display
[02:31:59.980 --> 02:32:05.260]   Apple says it's their best LCD ever I find it like they're so good at color calibration and color
[02:32:05.260 --> 02:32:10.460]   matching it is you know it's traditional iPhone dpi same dpi they've had since the iPhone 4 the
[02:32:10.460 --> 02:32:15.820]   same dpi they had on the iPhone 8 but you like in daily use you really can tell it doesn't do the
[02:32:15.820 --> 02:32:21.260]   inky blacks of OLED and doesn't have the extreme contrast of OLED so Apple's not advertising it
[02:32:21.260 --> 02:32:27.660]   as an HDR panel even though some LCD TVs say well we go brighter so that counts as HDR Apple doesn't
[02:32:27.660 --> 02:32:33.660]   want to play that game so they say it's not like it'll play HDR 10 and HDR and Dolby vision content
[02:32:33.660 --> 02:32:38.540]   but it will split it'll do the best job it can but they're not claiming that it's HDR so you're
[02:32:38.540 --> 02:32:43.660]   missing the panel and then you're missing the telephoto lens on the back so you have the exact same
[02:32:43.660 --> 02:32:50.860]   wide angle lens as the iPhone 10 s 30% larger with deeper and bigger pixels and the HD the smart HDR
[02:32:50.860 --> 02:33:00.220]   feature but you don't have that 2.4 aperture telephoto lens so no 2x optical zoom and no real
[02:33:00.220 --> 02:33:05.340]   depth data like you'd get off the true depth camera sorry off the dual camera system on an
[02:33:05.340 --> 02:33:10.540]   iPhone 10 they do something very similar to the Google pixel which is they use the parallax data
[02:33:10.540 --> 02:33:14.700]   from the phase adjust focus system what Apple calls focus pixels and they mix that with a
[02:33:14.700 --> 02:33:18.540]   segmentation mask the thing that's really interesting though the thing that I spent most of my time
[02:33:18.540 --> 02:33:23.100]   asking about and looking into is that Apple had their camera teams go and get a bunch of high-end
[02:33:23.100 --> 02:33:28.540]   lenses and cameras which I'm sure they hate it to do and this shoot the crap out of them and then
[02:33:28.540 --> 02:33:34.540]   build up a model a physical model of what an iPhone lens could be and it's different between the
[02:33:34.540 --> 02:33:39.580]   iPhone 10 s because that's the telephoto and the iPhone 10 are because they did it for the wide
[02:33:39.580 --> 02:33:45.740]   angle so taking the same shots they they they didn't want to have a perfect sanitized computational
[02:33:45.740 --> 02:33:50.700]   lens they wanted it to be quirky and have a personality like a real-world lens so the bokeh is not just a
[02:33:50.700 --> 02:33:55.900]   disc blur that's layered on top there's not just like a smooth fill over the back there's it actually
[02:33:55.900 --> 02:34:01.020]   renders on the silicon this entire world that as much as a computer vision can understand
[02:34:01.020 --> 02:34:07.500]   and like overlapping lights and distortion around the outside it like you get with the real lens and
[02:34:07.500 --> 02:34:12.380]   it just it's it's hard to describe it but when you look at what it used to do and what it does now
[02:34:12.380 --> 02:34:17.500]   or what some other phones do they really do just apply a Gaussian or a disc blur it's it's like night
[02:34:17.500 --> 02:34:22.860]   and day it's really really cool technology the other reason people might want it is it's it's one of
[02:34:22.860 --> 02:34:30.860]   those size things it's it might be just right here's a great image that you took comparing the iPhone
[02:34:30.860 --> 02:34:36.860]   10 on the left the iPhone 10 are on the right or other the 10 s on the left iPhone 10 are on the
[02:34:36.860 --> 02:34:41.580]   right and the 10 s max on the far right the middle one is the i let me start over
[02:34:41.580 --> 02:34:49.580]   in order from left to right the 10 s the 10 are in the 10 s max so it's between the two right
[02:34:49.580 --> 02:34:55.900]   yeah it's i mean because of the bezels it's probably closer to the 10 to the max than it is
[02:34:55.900 --> 02:35:00.380]   to the regular size one but it feels between i actually do like it better because i find
[02:35:00.380 --> 02:35:05.660]   i found the max is a little bit big for me i was a large i full fan yeah a lot of people are saying
[02:35:05.660 --> 02:35:12.940]   the 10 s max is just too big but i want more than the 10 s this is right there right and it has all
[02:35:12.940 --> 02:35:17.660]   the features that the 10 s has that i wish the 10 the max has that i wish the 10 s has like display
[02:35:17.660 --> 02:35:22.620]   zoom and when you rotate it sideways it has a split view controller some yeah so i really like
[02:35:22.620 --> 02:35:30.220]   all that okay so i'm i'm presuming you're gonna keep your 10 s max as your as your real phone or not
[02:35:30.220 --> 02:35:35.980]   i would so i worded the 10 s max but i think george is probably going to just rob me of that and i'll
[02:35:35.980 --> 02:35:39.820]   end up getting a 10 s because i like i know a lot of people are saying they're going to go with the
[02:35:39.820 --> 02:35:44.700]   10 are that they think it's a much better phone i really really like the camera system on the 10
[02:35:44.700 --> 02:35:53.260]   s i shoot in uh in um 2x all the time uh and i like the olette screen because i'm a complete nerd
[02:35:53.260 --> 02:35:59.500]   over hdr so for me it's worth the extra 250 bucks to get those two features i think i'm the exception
[02:35:59.500 --> 02:36:02.620]   not the rule though and i think most people will be super happy with the the 10 are
[02:36:02.620 --> 02:36:09.340]   let's talk ipad baby i'll also like cold dead hands we'll switch from my wired headphones to a
[02:36:09.340 --> 02:36:16.220]   bluetooth for the searching but only if Renee if only Renee had an ipad or to show us or or Andy
[02:36:16.220 --> 02:36:23.740]   did they they've got to have an ipad line or let's see no no where's the folio case he's got the folio
[02:36:23.740 --> 02:36:27.820]   case yeah these keys by the way are like bubble wrap for me i can't stop put this is like my worst
[02:36:27.820 --> 02:36:32.540]   change because i can't stop pressing on like bubble wrap all right all right here let me turn this bad
[02:36:32.540 --> 02:36:41.500]   boy around here we go uh this is a 12.9 see this is what i was really interested in i had the old 12.9
[02:36:41.500 --> 02:36:46.380]   it was just too big but now what they've done is the same size screen with a smaller form factor i
[02:36:46.380 --> 02:36:50.300]   feel like that might be the one to get people thought it was the 11 inch and they're like what is
[02:36:50.300 --> 02:36:55.020]   the what is the 12.9 look like they were like that is the 12.9 and wait wait wait wait till you hold it
[02:36:55.020 --> 02:36:59.660]   i was i was surprised like after the after the demo area i went to look at the specs i was surprised
[02:36:59.660 --> 02:37:06.860]   to find out that the new 12.9 inch is not that much lighter than the old one it felt so much lighter
[02:37:06.860 --> 02:37:11.980]   in my hands because it's just feels so much smaller because it is so much smaller so it's
[02:37:11.980 --> 02:37:17.020]   it's quite a nice piece of kit they pulled that trick that i forget was it google or microsoft
[02:37:17.020 --> 02:37:20.540]   who said that you could balance it on your finger because they arrayed everything around it so i
[02:37:20.540 --> 02:37:24.380]   was doing that at the thing and it made them very nervous you can do that you can set yeah
[02:37:24.380 --> 02:37:28.860]   you can take me a second to get my finger that'll be actually handy for sushi you could put it right
[02:37:28.860 --> 02:37:33.420]   on the surface there that glass there totally drop my ipad now don't please don't please don't
[02:37:33.420 --> 02:37:40.300]   there so you can just totally we look at that see these actually that's a good so he's got his
[02:37:40.300 --> 02:37:46.780]   finger on the apple and he's it is see that's the kind of real attention to detail i love apple
[02:37:46.780 --> 02:37:49.740]   well it makes it feel lighter because it weighed the balance is distributed nicely
[02:37:49.740 --> 02:37:54.620]   that makes a huge difference just like a magazine or a pad of paper also balances
[02:37:54.620 --> 02:37:58.700]   around the center so that's such an important little detail wow yeah you don't want it to be
[02:37:58.700 --> 02:38:05.100]   heavy in one end and it's kind of the thing you might not notice but you will subconsciously uh i
[02:38:05.100 --> 02:38:10.940]   do have to say the lack of a headphone jack baffles me i just i just i mean i asked about it we didn't
[02:38:10.940 --> 02:38:15.180]   feel coming did we we it was a surprise i mean they got headphones they were happily showing
[02:38:15.180 --> 02:38:20.300]   the schematics where like they're you would have plenty of room but we'd you'd have to make it because
[02:38:20.300 --> 02:38:25.100]   you the liquid retina goes past what you would see where the bezels are like he goes inside there
[02:38:25.100 --> 02:38:29.340]   to house it so there's no room in those bezels you'd have to make it thick enough to put it underneath
[02:38:29.340 --> 02:38:34.300]   the display and they didn't want to do that they didn't want to add like a Han Solo box like they
[02:38:34.300 --> 02:38:39.340]   would let me and falcon they have a camera bump for crying out loud yeah but it's not thick enough
[02:38:39.340 --> 02:38:43.660]   like the sorry go ahead any though that's that's what i'm going to say i mean it's okay it's okay
[02:38:43.660 --> 02:38:49.900]   for them to say we have lots of decisions to make we decided that we didn't want to put a headphone
[02:38:49.900 --> 02:38:54.460]   jack in there the only thing that i would that i really really gets gets my hackles up is if they
[02:38:54.460 --> 02:38:58.860]   were to say well we had no choice our hands were tied well no you could have done it if you wanted
[02:38:58.860 --> 02:39:05.340]   to you just didn't want to and i do think that on an ipad pro that's a dumb move i do think that's dumb
[02:39:06.300 --> 02:39:10.700]   for fortunately it has a type c port and i can use my pixel three headphones
[02:39:10.700 --> 02:39:18.540]   and the the battery is long enough so what do you think the type c it can do anything type c can do
[02:39:18.540 --> 02:39:24.860]   except external storage it can do external storage it's just that ios and the files app has no concept
[02:39:24.860 --> 02:39:28.380]   external story so you have to get an app that understands internal storage and then you can
[02:39:28.380 --> 02:39:33.020]   plug it in and you're fine it doesn't have a driver if you plug it in as is it'll think it's a camera
[02:39:33.020 --> 02:39:36.940]   base and you got to think that that's a glaring hole that apple's gonna fill with ios 13 they could
[02:39:36.940 --> 02:39:41.420]   easily get over the next the next six months or the next six to eight months it's gonna be explosive
[02:39:41.420 --> 02:39:45.660]   watching what happens with that usbc i i'm but don't be like a real a rial app that'll let you
[02:39:45.660 --> 02:39:50.380]   plug in a drive within three seconds i bet yeah and i'm could i plug in a keyboard and mouse now no
[02:39:50.380 --> 02:39:55.580]   no it has no a keyboard i don't know like the the bluetooth is still for that but it has no concept
[02:39:55.580 --> 02:40:00.780]   of a like ios itself doesn't know that the key beyond the insertion pointer on the trackpad mode
[02:40:00.780 --> 02:40:04.700]   it doesn't understand it they would have to add something like focus ui which is what lets you
[02:40:04.700 --> 02:40:09.660]   choose on an apple tv which icon you're on they would have they actually have to build out a system
[02:40:09.660 --> 02:40:15.020]   because ios was designed for the iphone and that's like uh the ipad is based is is hobbled by a lot
[02:40:15.020 --> 02:40:20.300]   of early decisions for the iphone when they didn't really foresee what it was going to be now and
[02:40:20.300 --> 02:40:23.420]   that's another one of those things that they're going to have to go through and until you can't
[02:40:23.420 --> 02:40:27.500]   just drag and drop mac on because that's that's yeah terrible they have to actually architect it for
[02:40:27.500 --> 02:40:31.820]   ipad but that but that really shouldn't that that shouldn't affect how it works with usb
[02:40:31.820 --> 02:40:35.660]   keyboard right because you can plug in a usb keyboard into the lightning port with route
[02:40:35.660 --> 02:40:43.580]   down okay just want to make sure yeah so uh you know i think ny patel's verge article for me
[02:40:43.580 --> 02:40:49.500]   was pretty right on in which he says look you can't deny it this is amazing hardware that
[02:40:49.500 --> 02:40:55.820]   as apple point out the curves green corners the every in every respect the super fast 12x
[02:40:55.820 --> 02:41:05.020]   bionic uh but without it it's hard to edit text unless you have a mouse you can't do with your
[02:41:05.020 --> 02:41:13.580]   finger very well and no trackpad no mouse and the software today for ios isn't really desktop
[02:41:13.580 --> 02:41:19.260]   quality the lack of file system you could fix that i guess it's just it's just it's it's a lot of
[02:41:19.260 --> 02:41:24.860]   promise but it's i would i'm gonna try anyway to use it as my main system but i have a feeling i'll
[02:41:24.860 --> 02:41:32.060]   have the same reaction ny lie does yeah i just think that it's just like with the day one of uh of
[02:41:32.060 --> 02:41:39.020]   the first version of the ipad i don't think you can judge it as a laptop or as a laptop replacement
[02:41:39.020 --> 02:41:43.580]   you have to think about it as the things you there are things that you do with your laptop
[02:41:43.580 --> 02:41:48.620]   and can you do those same things with with this device and sometimes in a lot of cases the answer
[02:41:48.620 --> 02:41:54.700]   is going to be no particularly if it involves i've got arbitrary file x on arbitrary file storage
[02:41:54.700 --> 02:42:00.860]   device y i just need to get this damn thing visible to this file system that's going to be a complete
[02:42:00.860 --> 02:42:08.620]   fail however when you look at the caliber of mobile of productivity apps have been designed
[02:42:08.620 --> 02:42:13.740]   for the for the ipad and yes we're talking about art apps yes we're talking about drawing apps but
[02:42:13.740 --> 02:42:19.500]   we're also talking about things like scrivener by literature and latte it's a really hardcore
[02:42:19.500 --> 02:42:25.660]   book length writing tool that is the one that most brilliant translations of a desktop app
[02:42:25.660 --> 02:42:31.500]   to mobile to a tablet i've ever seen i really don't think that uh windows has got there quite
[02:42:31.500 --> 02:42:36.940]   yet in terms of making taking a taking a dev taking a nap that works great on a big screen and making
[02:42:36.940 --> 02:42:42.380]   it work as well in that context of a smaller screen i've been using a chrome book for the past
[02:42:42.380 --> 02:42:48.460]   couple of weeks particularly since uh my macbook died uh and it does many things very very well but
[02:42:48.460 --> 02:42:53.180]   not at the same level of polish and then beyond that you do get the ability to use this pencil
[02:42:53.180 --> 02:42:56.940]   in a way that's not oh isn't it great you're taking notes when you're handwriting notes and
[02:42:56.940 --> 02:43:02.300]   you're doing little sketches and doodles no with the ipad pro you really can do professional caliber
[02:43:02.300 --> 02:43:09.260]   artwork with it and people do so i don't i i agree with the broad strokes of that argument if you
[02:43:09.260 --> 02:43:13.420]   buying this if you've got a thousand bucks or for thirteen hundred bucks for a new laptop and you buy
[02:43:13.420 --> 02:43:20.140]   an ipad pro instead you are going to be let down however if you have 13 12 or 1300 dollars for a
[02:43:20.140 --> 02:43:27.820]   mobile uh answer to i need to do xyz double x double y double z and you find the solutions for the ipad
[02:43:27.820 --> 02:43:29.820]   i don't think you'll be terribly disappointed at all
[02:43:29.820 --> 02:43:40.140]   well here we are at the end of 2018 it's been a great year from apple's point of view new
[02:43:40.700 --> 02:43:48.860]   macintosh computers new ipads new iPhones i hope we've been able to tell you a little bit about what
[02:43:48.860 --> 02:43:53.980]   to expect to understand a little bit better about what apple's up to and we hope to do a lot more
