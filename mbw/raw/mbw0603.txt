[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.760]   because they had their event today.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.040]   Andy Inako is at the event.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.520]   He's on his way back to the hotel room.

[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.320]   Meanwhile, the rest of us who watched from afar,
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.400]   including Alex Lindsey, he's in Washington DC
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.320]   at the Pixel Core.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.480]   Hello, hello, Alex.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.760]   Good to have you.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.720]   Did you, you couldn't really watch a stream.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.200]   So I guess you like, like the feeds.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.080]   Watch the feeds, the live blogs.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.720]   Also with us from tidbits.com, the wonderful Tanya Inks.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.120]   Hello, Tanya.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.760]   Hello, hello, it's great to be here.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.160]   Nice to see you.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.360]   Did you, whose coverage were you watching?
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.240]   I was hanging out on an internal slack board
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.360]   that we have just for tidbit staffers,
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.560]   but we were watching, well,
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.680]   reading the live tweets from a bunch of folks
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.520]   in particular six colors.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.600]   That was a really nice one to pay attention to.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.960]   Jason Snow was there.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.760]   So was Renee Richie,
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.200]   if he's not here with us because he's in the classroom
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.640]   right now with Serenity Caldwell.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.600]   Yeah, in fact, there was a lot of
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.800]   coverage from people we know.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.840]   Andy was there.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.960]   Renee was there Serenity,
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.800]   but also Harry McCracken, a lot of tech press.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.960]   Did Adam go?
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.640]   No, we had a fellow Julio Oteka.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.800]   The last name was escaping.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.680]   Yeah, our favorite Oteka Sabata.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.520]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.480]   Oh, hey, the Sabata.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.960]   Yeah, Julio's great. Yeah.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.880]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.880]   So he's so he was working for you.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.200]   That's right.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.440]   He does some writing for tidbits.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.560]   I've seen his pipeline.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.200]   Well, I'm not sure if he was working exclusively for us,
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.520]   but he did write his article.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.160]   I'm not sure if we've got it posted yet,
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.000]   but it's definitely in progress today.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.200]   Nice.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.600]   Yeah, Julio writes for the Minneapolis.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.000]   He's a twin cities writer.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.840]   I'm sorry, the St. Paul Pioneer Press.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.160]   There he is.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.240]   Julio Oteka, great guy.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.680]   Well, good.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.440]   Yeah, he was.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.960]   He was so excited to be there.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.120]   He was having a good time.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.480]   I'm looking at the picture of the line waiting to get in
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.880]   at Chicago's Lane Tech College, which is despite its name,
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.840]   a high school, a lot of people in the rain waiting to get in.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.880]   It's a big school early on.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.640]   Tim Cook said it produces more PhDs than any other high school in America.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.880]   Of course, they don't get their PhDs there, but they go on to get PhDs.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.080]   And it seems like it was a very good place to have this event.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.000]   It is a public school in Chicago.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.360]   Apple had, you know, there was a lot of speculation about what Apple would announce,
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.120]   but I can in a nutshell tell you what they announced, which was kind of what
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.680]   the minimum speculation was, a new sixth generation iPad featuring the A10 fusion
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.560]   processor and pencil support.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.480]   No smart connector for the keyboard, just pencil support.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:43.600]   And it will be $329, the base price of the least expensive iPad up to now, $299
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.400]   for educators.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.840]   That's a 32 gig storage device.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.960]   So it's kind of a minimally configured device.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.280]   They still nothing new about the pencil, except a $10 price drop for education.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.680]   It'll be $89.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.640]   And there was a lot, there were a lot of more software announcements than there
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.440]   were a hardware announcements, although they did point out that Logitech is going
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.840]   to offer a $49 pencil for the new iPad.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.640]   I take, I presume with iPad Pro pencil capabilities, they're calling it a, I
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.600]   think it looks like a crayon, it's a digital crayon.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.440]   And and their Logitech is offering a $90 a keyboard designed for this particular
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.240]   iPad, neither of which the crayon nor the keyboard will be available to the
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.840]   general public, but only to educators and students through Apple education.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.600]   So don't get your hopes up.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.680]   It will be available later this summer.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.920]   You can get though the new $329 sixth generation iPad is available for order
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.320]   today and you'll be able to pick it up or get it delivered by the end of the week.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.280]   And this was not not a big price drop, but just more features in the same price.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.400]   I mean, or, which is, I'm frankly a little disappointed.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.320]   And I think, you know, what Apple is trying to do was get into the education
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.080]   market to, to, to fend off a real significant challenge, as we've talked about
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.920]   before, from the Google Chromebook.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.080]   And I thought one way to do that would be to offer a lower price.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.680]   They decided not to do that.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.960]   They do say it's faster than a Chromebook.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.120]   Somehow I don't know if schools really care about that.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:25.840]   And then they talked a lot about software and there is a lot of new software
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.920]   designed specifically for the classroom.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.960]   I'll show you one of the videos they call homework.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.400]   So please eyes up here eyes up here.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.600]   We're not done group three.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.600]   Let's have Ivy and Ivy is not excited.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.480]   Nor is Michael Ryan, Sally and Thomas.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.600]   None of them too excited or thrilled because they're about to get homework.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.600]   Your homework is to explore gravity.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.880]   She pointed out he did not drop an iPad.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.720]   And in fact, one of the weird things about this is all the kids have iPads,
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.640]   but none of them are in cases, which of course, we never have.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.760]   Of course, but Apple never shows the cases.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.800]   Keep work cover on that one.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.520]   Homework.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.880]   Now I think I'm not sure maybe, Tonya, you know, it sounds like a shell
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.000]   silverstein palm.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.760]   It is.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.160]   It is actually OK.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.560]   Homework homework or something like that.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.640]   Yeah, it's it's a shell.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.720]   So OK, listen.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.520]   Oh, homework.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.120]   I hate you.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.840]   You're buying a watermelon.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.920]   Now we should get worse.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.120]   You want to think.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.720]   Ready?
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.040]   If only a hippo would smash you to bits.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.720]   They're dropped.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.080]   Aig and then a watermelon off.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.720]   And it tastes good.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:56.720]   That's going to be part of their gravity.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.040]   Take baths with a man eating shark.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.320]   Notice the use of the pencil.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.520]   A lion alone in the dark.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.440]   Eat spinach and liver.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:09.760]   That 10 or two times dropping a mattress on the balcony.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.960]   The parents are going to love that.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.880]   Actually, making videos.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.080]   Gravity free environments.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.240]   It's a lot of work.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.120]   These kids are putting in.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.120]   I think Apple's saying homework.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.560]   The kids are doing this because they have iPads, right?
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.760]   Because otherwise they just be sitting at home.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.920]   You watch it.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:33.120]   You watch it.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:33.920]   My list.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:40.000]   Why simply can't see why you even exist?
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:49.280]   It's the most creative kids I've ever heard of.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:54.840]   If you just disappeared,
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.960]   it would tickle me pink.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.920]   Next up.
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.600]   Group three homework.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.040]   Homework.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.240]   I hate you.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:10.120]   And that is showing their video.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:15.080]   But we won't get to see it because we are adults.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.320]   And adults.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.200]   But I'm sure it was amazing.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.720]   I'm sure it was wonderful.
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:24.800]   So they have some new software that will let teachers
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.160]   monitor classroom performance, share assignments with kids.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.280]   The biggest, I think the biggest announcement from my point of view,
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.920]   from most people watching point of view, is they're finally going to update
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:36.400]   iWork.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.560]   And it looks like, and I bet you have some interest in this, Alex, they're
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.360]   going to take iBooks Author, which you were really excited about when it came out,
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.240]   but really did not take the world by storm.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.880]   And they're going to fold all of its capabilities into pages.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.960]   So we'll see if they if they fold all of them or most of them.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.320]   So I have a feeling that, I mean, for me, this is kind of falling backwards a little bit,
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.680]   as far as going from iBook Author to pages.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.720]   I mean, pages is fine.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.600]   And I'm sure that it'll be more, you'll get more books out of it than having a separate
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.080]   application.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.120]   Now people can just use that.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.560]   I think that not a lot of people use iBooks Author and not a lot of people use pages.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.200]   And so maybe you can get them to combine into a reasonable number of people.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:21.280]   So I think that pages has always been, for me, a little heavy.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.360]   It just feels heavy when you use it.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.600]   It's not as responsive.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.480]   It has lots of great media tools that just feel slow when you're working with them.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.600]   So it's not something that I've used, that I even use heavily.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:39.440]   And so I think it'll be, to create something that is a slightly better book,
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.960]   I think that pages is going to be great.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.360]   I still think they're missing the opportunity to build something great.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.320]   The new pages will have pencil support.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:55.280]   Users will be able to add drawings and use something called smart annotation.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.280]   The underlines and annotations aren't just illustrations sitting on the page.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.960]   They're somehow attached to the words around them.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.400]   So I guess when you reflow the document, the annotations,
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.480]   you can see here in this animation that go around with it.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:17.600]   Pages will also allow book authors to include photos, videos, graphics from Apple Pencil,
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.000]   and more share finished books into iBooks.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.680]   That was one of the key features of iBooks Author.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.280]   Group authoring will be enabled.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.720]   Teachers can, in fact, group support for all the iWorks apps.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.080]   Will be enabled.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.560]   Teachers can annotate, send in documents to mark work.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.520]   There'll be a new presenter mode in pages, transforming the iPad into a teleprompter.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.040]   You can set a screen of text to Autoscroll and an adjustable speed.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:49.440]   And then there's a new app that teachers called Schoolwork,
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.600]   which lets teachers dole out digital assignments to students.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:12:00.800]   Apple also talked a little bit about the augmented reality capabilities of the new
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.400]   iPads.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.920]   Actually, it's the same as the old iPads,
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.440]   except there's a faster processor.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:12.400]   But they did point out that there are going to be a lot more AR apps for students in education.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.440]   Schoolwork will also support ClassKit.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.200]   We'd heard about ClassKit before it's in iOS 11.3.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:24.880]   That means third party, third party apps can link into and out of schoolwork.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.760]   So I imagine that'll happen as well.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.640]   I am not an educator.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.560]   I've worked as a trustee for a high school for six years,
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.640]   and I have had kids as you have Tanya in school, as you have Alex as well.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.720]   I'm not blown away by this.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.600]   I actually had hoped Apple would do maybe a little bit more for education.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.640]   It's great that Apple celebrated education, but I thought they would do a little more.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.720]   You agree, Tanya?
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:51.200]   Disagree.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.120]   Well, it seems incremental.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.320]   There's nothing here that's really surprising.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:04.560]   But it seems as though Apple is kind of waving their hand and saying,
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:11.360]   "Hey, we are thinking about education, and we are taking some baby steps."
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:16.960]   A couple of the steps they took, I think the schoolwork application,
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.760]   we have to see how it will really work in the real world.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.240]   But it seems like a positive step.
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:31.360]   One thing that I noticed was that they will now be supporting on these on iPad's bot for education,
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.040]   the ability to have more than one account on an iPad.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.920]   That's huge.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:41.440]   That's found it awfully interesting, and particularly for a school that's trying to
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:47.120]   get iPads into the classroom, but they can't afford one iPad per kid.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.240]   That could be pretty huge, depending on how it works out.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:55.440]   We don't want the kids to have to spend 20 minutes the day just logging in and out of their iPads,
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.280]   of course, but hopefully it will be much more smooth and elegant.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:05.120]   So it feels like Apple's putting a number of things out there, kind of almost to see
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.360]   what might become most popular, most used.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:16.160]   They've got the AR, they've got the idea that kids could be doing a lot of digital media creation,
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:24.080]   they've got the pencil now, a much more affordable iPad that you can now use the pencil with.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:30.080]   So it gives teachers a lot of different directions in schools, a lot of different directions.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.600]   They could start moving ahead in if they so wish.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:43.120]   Apple also, I think by making this announcement and choosing to go in this direction, they're
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:48.960]   saying once again that they're really not planning to come up with anything like a Chromebook
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.680]   competitor. They're doing something really different.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.280]   Yeah, this isn't so different at all. In fact, Apple showed things like this
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:03.040]   Dissectafrog application, Frogopedia, so you can dissect a frog with a pencil with but not
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:08.240]   a real frog. But this has been around for a while. What's new is that you can use a pencil to do
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:14.080]   to the dissection. It's an augmented reality app. It might be better using a pencil in your
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:19.840]   finger. But yeah, I'm actually a little disappointed. I was hoping to see more, frankly,
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:25.920]   from Apple, not necessarily more hardware, but just more aggressive support for education.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:34.000]   Maybe even some subsidies and bigger discounts. It doesn't feel like this is something that
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.720]   is going to change the equation when it comes to schools in the iPad. Alex?
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:43.440]   Yeah, I don't think they're trying to take over. I think that they are taking the schools that are
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.360]   on the edge and trying to lean them a little bit their direction. They're handling a bunch of the
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:53.840]   management issues that were definitely way behind and then trying to show where they stand out
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.640]   against the Chromebook. There's just a lot of those very interactive, very fun things that they're
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:03.120]   showing there are definitely more difficult to do on a Chromebook than they are on an iPad.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:07.200]   They're obviously not. They're not trying to be a Chromebook because that's going to be harder
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:12.480]   to go down that path. But I do think that they are trying to show where they try to look for
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:20.640]   areas in the education market where they exemplify. Although Google before the event today,
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:27.680]   Google announced a Chrome OS tablet for 329 that's specifically, obviously targeted against this
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:36.720]   329 iPad. It's from Acer. It has the Android apps on it as well as the Chrome OS apps.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:44.240]   So it's going to be fairly... I think it was great. It was key for Google to do that.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.560]   To put it in there to make sure there's an even choice. Of course, the price points are the same.
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:53.040]   People have to look at whether they're still going to... They could still use Google Classroom
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:57.120]   on the iPad. Do they want to take advantage of all the stuff that Apple's doing and take
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:01.920]   advantage of what Google's doing by using an iPad as opposed to the Chromebook? But if you're
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:08.480]   really happy with that ecosystem that you already probably have with the Chromebooks,
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.880]   it is a nice way to make sure that people stay in that fold even if they've decided that a
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.120]   tablet is the right way to go. So I think it was a great thing for Google. I think that Apple still...
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:21.920]   I think that's part of why Apple probably pushed really heavily on that they're going to put a
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:26.960]   bunch of support services out. There's things that are easier. You can definitely build a better
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:32.000]   document from a graphics perspective. You can build a better document pages than you could in
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:39.440]   in the Google Ecosphere. I mean, we use a lot of Google products in that area. But
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:48.240]   I wouldn't say that they're fun to use. They're useful. But somewhat a little bit painful.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:57.360]   Google, Apple just shipped out the updated pages. I just got an AM key note and numbers just came
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:04.240]   out on the Apple Store. So if you want to try pencil support, I'm waiting till pages downloads
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:10.160]   here. Your kids, I know Alex love their iPad. Yeah, they're on there. They probably spend more
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:16.560]   time than I should let them. But admittedly, I will say that a solid 25 to 30 percent of their
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:22.560]   time is on Roblox on it. But the other time I spent taking pictures and they know everything
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.280]   about that iPad, how the iPads work and all the bits and pieces. I can definitely... My plan
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:32.480]   when I get back from DC, which will be next later this week, is to actually go through some
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.280]   of the things that they showed here and try to do them with my kids and see what they think and
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.960]   see whether that's up. See whether they think that it's good and whether they can do it. They're
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:43.520]   eight and tens. They're a little lower than the target that they showed here. But I think that
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:49.040]   they're pretty precocious. I think they'll catch on. Here it starts when you launch the new pages.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:53.920]   It starts with a video showing a pencil. It says, "Make your mark get creative with artwork and
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:19:01.120]   annotations using Apple Pencil." You can also use your finger, which is very reassuring.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:08.560]   I should just download a document. Let's see and open it, I guess, and see.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:16.560]   Now, where do I go for pencil stuff? Let's see here. Collaboration, working on a document
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:20.320]   with others, invite them to edit in real time. By the way, that is one thing that's
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:24.960]   kind of cool that you'll get 200 gigabytes of iCloud storage with your classroom account,
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:29.760]   although Google offers unlimited storage with its account. So there's the sharing button.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:35.120]   New shapes, enhance your document with a variety of new editable shapes. That's kind of cool.
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:39.360]   Let me look at the animals. So let's just... And that's all stuff that we've seen in the keynote.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:44.080]   So all those shapes are shapes that are available in keynote now. So those aren't nothing new,
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:48.640]   except that they're available. Put them in the page. Smart annotation beta. Tap to start adding
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:54.000]   marks that move with your content. Let's see. Tap. Oh, here we go. Here's an annotation so I
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:02.720]   could circle that. And then if I take this goat... Hello, goat. Take this goat and move it in. Look,
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:07.600]   the almost moves around with it. Okay, that's cool. Smart annotation beta. Smart annotations
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:13.520]   follow your text. Okay, it's in beta, it says. All right. Well, it seems to work.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:19.680]   Great. Yeah, that's nice because they're not just a layer of ink on top of the screen.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:25.680]   Well, I mean, I can see that way beyond classrooms. I mean, that's being able to review documents
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:31.520]   and red line them and so on and so forth, underline things that you want to go through is useful
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:38.080]   way beyond school. Change tracking, presenter mode. Yeah, you know, I mean, I haven't used
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:44.480]   pages in a long time, but it does seem like there's quite a bit of new stuff. What's new in
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:51.600]   pages? Let's take a look. Draw, write, annotate, create beautiful books in the ePub format.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:58.720]   Collaborate in real time on documents stored in box. That's interesting given that Apple has iCloud.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:07.680]   Box, huh, maybe schools like box. That's odd that they wouldn't say collaborate
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:18.480]   with iCloud. Yeah, I think the box thing is a new addition in this version of pages.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:24.800]   I assume that iCloud collaboration is still happening. So it seems like box is a new option.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:32.720]   One more thing. Okay. Yeah. And one thing I'm very curious to know is one of the limitations
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:40.640]   of iBooks Author was if you wanted to create a book and sell it, you were limited to the iBook Store.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:47.600]   Yeah, and I think this is, it says you can create documents that you could then sell.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:52.080]   Yeah, you can sell on the iBook Store. So I don't, I think they're still pushing that as...
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.600]   But ePub, but ePub is an open standard, right? So we...
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:02.560]   It's very easy to take an ePub and convert it to, for example, a Moby, which is what you need to
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:09.360]   sell on Amazon. But that was kind of not really permitted before. So if that's been stripped away,
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:14.000]   and I'm not saying it is because I haven't looked, but it's my guess, not only does that
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:22.160]   easier for people who really just want to do education stuff and maybe on the side sell their
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:26.960]   thing, but it may make pages worth another look for your typical eBook publisher.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:37.600]   It says I can export now to ePub. So that would imply, yeah, ePub is here, that would imply that I could...
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:42.880]   Yeah, with iBooks Author, it was actually in the License Agreement. It wasn't like a technical...
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:48.560]   Ah, they had the capability. Okay. Yeah. But as a professional, you know, as an actual publisher,
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.520]   you wouldn't violate a license agreement. Of course.
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:58.160]   But it seems like for educators, though, now they don't have to go and learn a whole
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:03.600]   another program, iBooks Author. Even though a lot of iBooks Author was very similar to pages,
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:08.000]   you could transfer a lot of the skills. I think if they can just have one program that they need
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.440]   to learn, their kids are doing word processing in pages anyway, perhaps, and now they can do
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:18.080]   word processing in pages and maybe get an eBook out of it without having to do a whole import
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:23.360]   export layout thing, that may make it a whole lot easier to get a whole lot more informal
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:27.680]   publishing going on from the education market. That seems positive to me.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:34.320]   A few educators, I've talked to since this announcement, were generally very excited about
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:38.640]   the fact that Apple actually went to a school and really at the beginning, there was a lot of
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:43.520]   celebration of education in general. And I think they appreciate the attention they're getting.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:48.240]   That's a big part of just making you feel warm and fuzzy about Apple and education.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:54.320]   So maybe that's all they really needed was that little PR push. I'm a little disappointed that
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:24:01.360]   there wasn't, I felt like we should maybe have seen more. Now, in June at WWDC, of course,
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:05.840]   that'll be Apple's opportunity to update the MacBooks and the MacBook Pros and maybe even the
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:11.040]   MacBook Air. Who knows? Maybe even the Mac Mini. So that's only a couple of months off. And June
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:17.040]   is the time frame for a lot of this stuff anyway for people to buy, except for the iPad, which you
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:24.480]   can get today. We have so little, usually after an Apple event, there's a two hour show,
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.560]   and that's still not enough to talk about, but I feel like that's it, right?
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:33.680]   There's nice. Is there anything more to say about the announcement today?
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:37.840]   When Andy joins us, we can get a little bit of a sense of what happened in the room, but...
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:48.000]   Sure, I thought it was cool of Apple to focus on education as far as what might be coming up at
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.520]   WWDC for announcements. We have a lot of time to speculate about that, and Apple has a lot of
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:58.640]   hardware that they might be telling us more about at that time. So that's kind of fun.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:08.400]   It was interesting. I thought that Apple chose to not have their event in Cupertino or in a
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:16.720]   way... It wasn't really part of the music industry or anything like that. It was its own special event.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:23.440]   It kind of helped Apple do more of those in the future. I feel like the typical Apple announcement,
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:28.960]   it used to be so exciting with Steve Jobs or when Tim Cook was new to have the kind of
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:35.520]   streamed event very controlled from some kind of Apple-run theater situation.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:39.520]   And I thought this was nice for change, just they did do something different,
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:44.560]   shake things up a little, they don't have to always keep on doing things exactly the same way.
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:48.640]   Maybe we'll see more of these, I don't know, more intimate events in the future.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:54.880]   Good point. A lot of the press were invited after the event to visit the classrooms
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:26:00.880]   at the school and actually sit in and watch active classrooms. Renee and Serenity, I think,
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:08.160]   went to a math class. So that's neat. It is a great thing to celebrate education.
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:16.080]   I'm glad. But I just... I don't know if education is going to... I don't know if this is going to
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:21.200]   change Apple's position in education. I think people who are already in an iPad will welcome
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:25.920]   these new features, but I doubt that they're enough to convince somebody who isn't yet
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:33.200]   an iPad school to go out and get iPads. I was thinking about that. I was thinking about the
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:37.360]   situation that a lot of school districts face, particularly public school districts, where there
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:42.560]   is not a lot of money to go around. And they're really going to go for the most affordable digital
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:49.040]   solution that they can find. Certainly in my home school district, it's a city school district here
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:55.120]   in New York state. They went with Chromebooks, certainly on the high school level. They're just
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:27:01.760]   so affordable. It pointed out to me, you need a Chromebook for less than a textbook, in some cases,
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:08.000]   these days. And I was thinking, boy, it would be really nice to see Apple address that kind of
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.760]   problem. And they didn't really hear. I mean, they did bring the Apple pencil to a much more
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:20.800]   affordable iPad, which is a piece of the puzzle maybe, but they really didn't get in there in a
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:30.800]   dress. Low income school districts, low income folks, which it seems like Apple is basically
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:35.440]   saying, you know, we've got a premium product. And here are the great things we're doing with that.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:44.240]   It's, it's not ideal. Something Apple, it'd be great if they could address it feels like right
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.640]   now, kind of the DNA and the company is more about just that, making a premium product,
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:54.800]   pushing things forward. And what do you guys, yeah, well, and also, and I mentioned this
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:28:00.560]   during iOS today and Alex, you're a creator, they talked a lot about creative tools with drawing
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:07.680]   and the pencils and video, you know, making books and stuff. But one thing the iPad isn't great at
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:12.720]   is I think one of the most fundamental creative skills that are really important for kids to learn,
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:19.680]   which is to write and to type things. And this is exactly where the iPad's a little bit weak,
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:25.040]   because it doesn't come with a keyboard. And and that's great to, you know, and I know kids today
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:30.560]   love video and all that. And Alex, you know, maybe Alex, am I an old fart, is writing no longer a
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:37.360]   big deal? Do you not need to write anymore? Oh, we lost Alex. He just hung up. I said,
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:44.080]   first said that he said, that's it. I'm done. What what my first thought was, I thought, well,
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:49.520]   if I was a third grade teacher, which I'm not, but if I was, what would I use an iPad for? And the
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:55.440]   very first thing came to my mind, even before, you know, cameras and scientific experiments,
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:02.080]   all this kind of stuff was, wow, what a great tool for teaching handwriting. But is it, but is it,
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:08.240]   isn't it better? I mean, don't you need to do it on paper with a pencil? Yeah, I'm thinking. So,
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:12.480]   I don't know anything about this really right. But just think about it. A lot of how kids learn
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:17.040]   to handle it when they're very young is they do tracing, right? Because for that,
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:21.920]   really boring, right? But I think you make an app and I bet there are apps for tracing that would
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:26.240]   make it so much more fun. All right, you're right. Because that's an issue with the younger kids,
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:31.600]   especially younger boys, fine motor skills. So you give them a pencil and you give them something
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:37.600]   engaging and fun. At least they're going to develop their motor muscles. And that'll help them. I
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:43.120]   think ultimately, if it's penmanship, you need, I don't know if, frankly, I don't know if people
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:48.720]   are going to be doing a lot of handwriting in the year 25, 25, but you still need to be able to
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:53.600]   write your numbers. And I remember our son, he moved to the typewriter pretty quickly because
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:58.880]   you didn't have to write. But for instance, we would go to the local food call up and you have to
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:05.440]   like write the bin numbers on your dried nuts, whatnot, right? And we'd be like, look, you know, you
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:11.120]   can't. That's a very good point. I can't hear. Can't tell whether it's seven or one. You can't buy
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:16.720]   whole grains and whole foods. If you can't write the number on the twist tie. Yeah, yeah. I mean,
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:21.520]   there's a kid says, but I don't have a stylist and a tablet, please.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:29.200]   Take a picture, pick a photo with your eye. Well, I mean, if it is true that if you look at how
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:35.600]   teenagers and even younger kids are communicating, it is, it's very visual. It's very much photography.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:40.800]   We got Alex back in the, sorry about that. Absolutely have to be able to sing and they have to be
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:45.120]   able to connect ideas together and they have to be able to like run this stuff through their bodies
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:53.280]   and their minds and analyze it and come up with, you know, ideas that make sense. And writing,
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:59.040]   I believe the kind of writing where a keyboard is really very helpful really facilitates that
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:04.160]   process for a lot of people, even if it is painful and slow and difficult. And yeah, it was a
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:12.720]   disappointment to me that Apple did not include the smart keyboard connector onto the new iPads.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:16.880]   I know you can attach a Bluetooth keyboard and that works well enough, but it's also
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.200]   like just one more thing that you have to keep connected and the smart keyboards really are
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:30.160]   superior in my opinion. Well, I mean, I feel bad for the kid now, who I just remember to not only
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:37.040]   charge the iPad, but has to charge the keyboard and has to charge the pencil and gets to class and
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:43.440]   it's all dead. And by the way, your kids now in college, but I know kids younger than that,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.200]   the last thing they do is plug in their devices at the end of the day.
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.320]   Oh, I don't know. I will say that my kids are eight and 10 and they are
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:54.880]   consciously conscious of their of their battery. They are very unusual. Alex,
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:32:01.040]   the funny thing is when my daughter was when my daughter was three, she would walk out or
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:05.200]   little almost three, she would walk up to me and she kept on to take the iPad and she showed to me
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:09.200]   and she'd go up and each up and each up and I couldn't. It took me a long time to realize that
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:14.800]   she was trying to say the iPad needs charge. I bet you,
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:18.000]   Chuck, I bet they chop up and he chopped up and he chopped up and he chopped.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.640]   You know, your kids are very sophisticated. Well, and they they know where it is.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:26.720]   They you know, they, you know, they a lot of where they sit in the house is where the charger is.
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:30.560]   So I think they also play a lot of things. They do a lot of things with the iPad that are very
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:34.560]   processed or intensive. So they don't it doesn't last very long if they if they.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:40.720]   I just know that every time I see my college kid son, actually just graduated, but
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:45.920]   and my and my daughter, the very first question they ask and their friends too, when they come
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:52.960]   over, can I you got a charger I can use? Inevitably, inevitably, they're walking around with 10
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:57.840]   percent charge all the time. Okay, right, right. Because a lot of times what you're doing with
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:02.160]   these social networks, though, also is also driving the the battery, you know, you won't last very
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:06.080]   long and you can you know, you get maybe a half a day if you're spending a lot of time on Facebook.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:10.640]   I think that's part of the problem. So I was you were gone, Alex, but I was asking the question
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:16.640]   and I think Tonya and I agree on this that Apple's, you know, mentioning all these creative things
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:21.920]   you could do with an iPad, but the one thing it's not great at is writing. Well, I think that I,
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:27.120]   you know, I the iPads that we have have got keyboards. And so I don't remember which one we got,
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:31.360]   but it's a nice little keyboard. It's not the Apple one. It's a bigger, thicker keyboard. I think
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:37.120]   it's logo or whatever. I don't think it's Logitech's, but the the blue tooth, right?
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:40.800]   You're not using the smart connector. It's not using the smart connector.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:46.240]   Yeah. The the one of the things that I think is interesting and I what I think is really
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:52.800]   important is that if kids are using the keyboards, it has to come very quickly with typing lessons
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:57.120]   and typing classes. One of the things that I'm kind of crippled, I will admit, I mean, I can,
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:02.080]   I can bang out 40, 50 words a minute, but but it's with like, like three, you know, these fingers,
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:06.080]   like I don't do touch typing. I don't know how to do that. And when you compare that, I mean,
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:10.080]   I just because I started programming when I was nine and I didn't have any typing lessons until
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:14.080]   I was 14. And by then I just could never go back to, you know, like I would take the typing lessons
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:19.440]   in school and then I would go home and program. So it was, you know, and, and, you know, I couldn't,
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:23.280]   I didn't have time to try to do touch, touch typing. So I never really, you know, now it's all
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:27.680]   muscle memory. I can't, I mean, I can, again, I can type pretty fast, but it's only with half of my,
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:32.800]   half of my digits, you know, the, when I watch my kids, what I'm afraid of is they're sitting there
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:38.960]   talking to, you know, other kids on, you know, Roblox or whatever. And, and they are, you know,
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.960]   going through that, but they're just typing with a couple fingers. And, and I'm afraid that giving
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:47.280]   them the keyboard without giving them that class and making sure that they can use it effectively
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:52.400]   means that forever they're never going to be as fast. I don't think that, I think that handwriting
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:57.200]   is probably, I mean, I, I barely hand write at this point. So I mean, I don't know why I would
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:02.160]   expect my kids to hand write more than I do, which is maybe a couple of times. I mean, I only
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:07.440]   write in caps now. I don't, I don't do cursive. I don't do lowercase. It's like, there are a thing
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:13.440]   that I have to do. I am looking, there are typing tutors for the iPad. There are, I'm just saying
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:18.480]   that they look like I have school gives kids typewriters. They have to, I think it's really important
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.600]   that they that they, that that comes with something. And I do think that that's one problem with the
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:25.680]   iPad is that you won't use it on the glass. You really want to be able to type on something.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:31.680]   But I, I do think that, I think it's important for them to do. I think that, you know, a lot of
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:36.320]   their content is going to be created over time with voice and, you know, a lot of other things.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:41.920]   But I do, you know, so I, I have a feeling that as my kids get to high school, there's a high
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:45.840]   probability that they'll, they'll use the keyboard to correct what they wrote, what they said.
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:50.400]   I do think that typing is a different thing than, than speaking though. I mean, you know, I'm the
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:55.600]   voice that I, I've done a lot of dictation and a lot of typing. And the voice that I dictate with
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:59.680]   is different than the voice that I write with. It was my hand. Like literally my hands are a
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:04.080]   different, different personality than my, than my voice. And so it's, it's just an interesting,
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:08.480]   it's definitely using a different part of my brain or a different way that I look at things
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.520]   when I'm speaking versus when I'm, when I'm typing. It's interesting.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:17.360]   Let's take a little break. And Andy Enoch will join us a little bit. He was at the event. He'll
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:24.160]   give us a little perspective on what it was like to be there. Adam, I'm sorry, I almost called you
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:29.360]   Adam. Ex tiny eggs is here. It's great to have you. I see all those running numbers behind you,
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:34.880]   all the races you've run in, all the metals over your right shoulder. Oh, yeah. I'm in a good time.
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:39.600]   Thank you for taking a little time off the road to join us today. She's at tidbits.com.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:45.120]   You sold to take control of titles about a year ago. That's correct. Congratulations.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:53.200]   Joe Kistle, he was one of our main authors. And he has just taken right over. It's been great.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.320]   That's nice. And it gives you a little more free time. Are you working more on tidbits or?
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:02.640]   I'm helping out behind the scenes with tidbits. We're doing a major infrastructure project right
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:08.800]   now actually. When is that, when is that launching? Probably later this week.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:16.720]   We will have a brand new tidbits website. Every last bit of the infrastructure,
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:23.840]   the mailing list, the way we accept advertising, every single little last thing is going to be
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:29.440]   redone. We are so excited. And of course, part of why we had time to focus on that was
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:35.840]   that Joe Kistle is now running the take control books. And that gave us a lot more time to focus
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:43.920]   on our core website. So yeah. That's awesome. Not that your website isn't great, but it does.
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:50.320]   It does look like it might harken back to an earlier day. And that's not even the first
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:56.960]   redo of the poor thing because we started so long ago, we had to convert it to a web to begin with.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:01.040]   That's right. You weren't on the web at all in the beginning. The longest running
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:08.480]   Macintosh newsletter, 27 years and counting. And a must subscribe. In fact, I'm a tidbits member.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:12.560]   Everybody should be a tidbits member because it really is an important resource for the Apple
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:16.960]   community. But I do notice, for instance, Tonya, when I when I zoom in a little bit, stuff starts
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:22.880]   to disappear. You need mobile, you need mobile responsive design in here. That's coming. I know
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:27.840]   next. Luckily, that was definitely on our checklist. So I'm not telling you now.
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.960]   We'll guess what the next one is. But it's going to stay purple, right?
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:37.440]   Yeah, we were going to still have a kind of a purple, a little bit of a purple aspect. Yeah.
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:42.240]   Very important. Very excited. And you see all the typing that goes on here?
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:49.040]   If it if it weren't for typing, we wouldn't have tidbits. You're not going to do it.
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:54.480]   It's even even I'm more with serenity who can actually draw really well doesn't do a whole lot
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:59.760]   of cartoony articles. In fact, only one of my memory. That's great to have you.
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:04.080]   I know where she talks about the pencil, right? And all things you can do with my pet pro.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:08.960]   It's beautiful. I actually people ask me whether they should get the Apple pencil. What it's good
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:14.000]   for. And I actually send them the URL to the article by serenity because it's it just totally
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:20.560]   wraps it. It's a classic. Yeah. The Apple pencil drawn review of the Apple pencil.
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:27.440]   Yeah. Just see this is this is what we're going to be getting a lot of in the future when kids just
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:31.920]   use iPads in school. Everything's going to look like this. That's right.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:38.960]   As the mother of a Cornell University freshman right now. Congratulations.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:43.920]   It's actually really just like what will they take for their college essay if they'll take an
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:48.480]   essay written with the Apple pencil. It looks like that. Great. But if not, yeah, then you got a
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:54.400]   problem. And you got to start your engines. Yeah. Folks only 10 years to get your child able to
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:58.560]   coherently write a couple of those essays. Just saying.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:05.760]   Yeah. I mean, I will say that the one thing that I think that the iPad do make easier and I think
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:10.400]   that's really important is that that kids get a lot better at using visual media. So whether it's
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:15.120]   you know, making little movies, making pictures, making, you know, doing design and layout,
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:19.440]   you know, of all those things are going are very important in the real world.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:24.960]   I have gotten things done because I can build a reasonably good keynote deck.
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:28.640]   So, you know, that those are, you know, being able to put all those pieces together and being
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:32.640]   able to tie that together, I think is something that is going to be very, very important in the
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:36.400]   future from a communications perspective and getting jobs and all the other bits and pieces.
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:42.400]   And I don't want to deprecate the ability to create graphics and video and use keynote.
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.520]   All those things will be important too. You need it all. Yep.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:49.120]   Yeah. And I don't want to deprecate that. In fact, one of the jokes that we make
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:56.320]   at tidbits is we are very tux-tavy and we have very slowly been getting more comfortable and
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:41:04.000]   more agile with the graphics and the video and all that. But I think that the era that we were
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.440]   educated in, which would have been, you know, we're, we got graduated from college in the late 1980s.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:16.480]   So, you know, that era of education definitely, you know, prepared us for a certain future,
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:22.160]   which of course we're not particularly living in. But I do support kids being able to express
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:26.160]   themselves with, you know, beyond just typing. Absolutely. It's very important.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:32.000]   Well, that takes us to our first sponsor. Active campaign. If you want to reach out to
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.120]   customers and clients, it's nice to have graphics. But you need more than just, you know, a pretty
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:43.440]   picture or a mass email, you need something targeted directly to that person's interests and needs.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:47.920]   If you have a growing business and you want to close more sales, you got to check out active
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:52.080]   campaign, much more than marketing automation. You get the right type of message to the right
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:57.440]   person at the right time and they've got the tools to help you do it. No more, you know, spam,
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:02.960]   blast emails with, you know, the same message to everybody on your mailing list with the smart
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:08.240]   tools available to active campaign. This is kind of, in fact, impressive. You can show different
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:15.680]   content in your messages, depending on contact information, interactions, social data interests.
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:21.840]   The messages are personalized and they are not just personalized in email on your website
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:25.520]   when they visit your website or on their mobile device when they're out and about.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:29.600]   You'll design eye-catching campaigns with their drag and drop campaign builder
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:35.600]   and maximize engage mode with something we used to call AB testing. But they call it split testing
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:42.000]   because it's not just A and B, it's A, B, C, D and E, it's five up to five version split testing.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.520]   So you find the exact content and layout and settings that your subscribers respond to. No more
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:53.440]   guessing. You'll know what works with active campaign. Multi-user editing means everybody,
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:58.880]   you know, you can have multiple people working on the same deck. You got a revision history
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:05.600]   capability integrations with lots of other tools, conditional content, geo tracking,
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:10.320]   site tracking, social sharing, integration with Google analytics and on and on and on.
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:16.080]   And of course, it looks great on mobile and with every active campaign subscription image hosting
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:22.000]   is free. You want to identify, nurture, convert and retain more customers. You need active
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.680]   campaign. And we've got a really great deal for you. If you go to active campaign.com/twit,
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:34.720]   a two week trial free, but also you get the second month free. You also get two free one on ones
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:39.840]   with their platform consultants. You also get free migration from whatever pathetic little
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:48.720]   tool you're using today. Active campaign. That pathetic little tool active campaign.com/twit
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:57.280]   active campaign.com/twit. We thank you so much for their support of Twit. So we're learning new
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:03.440]   information now from the Verge because they got to play with Apple's rather Logitech's
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:11.840]   new keyboard that is designed for education and will not be available to you, but only in fact to
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:16.800]   education through Apple's education store. I don't want to get that. Well, it's cheap. It's
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:22.960]   $89. They also have a $49 crayon, but this is why you probably don't want it. Look at the size of
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:32.160]   this thing. It is massive. Logitech says it can survive a four foot drop. A huge plastic brick
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:40.800]   around the iPad. And interestingly, it isn't a Bluetooth keyboard because the case plugs into
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:47.520]   the lightning port. And then that controls the keyboard. It's a special smart connector. As you
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:54.240]   can see right here, the Logitech developed. So this is this is a rugged case. This is a big
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:59.760]   rugged case. I won't be available till later this summer. And this is what they intend for school.
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:03.600]   It is a chicklet keyboard though. Look at that. That does that does not look very attractive. And
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:08.720]   I feel bad for anybody who has to write a school paper on it. But this is this is obviously what
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:13.040]   you need if you're going to have iPad expensive iPads in the school. Hey, look who's here. Look
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:19.520]   here. Thank you. Andy and I go for heading back to your hotel room. He's just off his visit
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:26.000]   to a high school. How was it going back to school, Andy? Oh, Tim Cook did stuff me into a locker.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.160]   But you know, he is an alpha jock on the campus. I don't do that. Yeah, no, it really it. I'm not
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:35.760]   joking. You did if you thought that they were going to simply put up a huge white tent in the
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:41.360]   parking lot. No, they they rent they took out the entire high school. You literally had to go to
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:47.280]   classrooms for like briefings and for the demo area and for demos of what the IT side of it is like
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:52.480]   and with the creative side of it is like. And yes, it was like having that dream all over again where
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:56.240]   oh my god, I'm back in high school and I don't I haven't gone to any of my classes and I don't
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:46:00.480]   know where my classes are or what classes I'm taking. But it was a very it was a pretty special event.
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:05.280]   At least you weren't naked, Andy. Now, where were the students at Lane Tech? Were they all
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:11.280]   staying home that day? I don't know. Maybe they gave them each 25 cents to go to the movie.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:16.400]   For three hours or so. Because I didn't I didn't see any. I didn't see any of them. They brought in
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:21.840]   now they had like like hundreds what seemed like hundreds of like concierges like in beautiful like
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:28.560]   like Green Bay Packers. Call it must be the school calls at the high school. Apple like down jackets
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:35.040]   with the Apple Yellow Apple logo in the green and the green body. And these were like actual like
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:39.760]   people who worked at Apple stores from like all over the country. So they're all really, really
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:44.560]   happy and really, really friendly. It was it was a school day. It was a real school day. But these
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:48.720]   you know, getting back to that Logitech keyboard, it really does go to show you that this is it's
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:52.640]   almost like developing something for the military when you as opposed to developing something for
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:56.720]   consumers. The reason why it connects through that lightning connector and not through Wi-Fi
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:02.640]   is because school districts are concerned about cheating. So what happens what happens if you
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:09.120]   have an open open wireless network or ability to do a point to point communication. It's the same
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:18.160]   reason why it's the same reason why iPad has a problem in in school in school districts that
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:23.120]   demand keyboards attached to their to their computers they buy for schools. Again, you could
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:27.360]   say, Oh, just buy a $20 Bluetooth keyboard. No, no, you can't you can't do that because again in
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:31.120]   testing you they're worried about if they have out open Bluetooth. So that's one of the features
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:36.800]   of the new class kit is it can put it in a test mode, a kiosk mode. And I bet you disable Bluetooth
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:40.480]   when it does that. So that keyboard wouldn't work if it were Bluetooth keyboard.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:46.800]   Yeah, you get when the last thing I attended was an IT demo of really having full control from the
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:51.520]   not just the IT department's dashboard, but from the teachers dashboard, they can simply they can
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:56.720]   they can lock out specific students or the whole classroom or groups by saying that,
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:02.400]   okay, now we're going to the Safari app and I'm sending I'm opening a page in your devices and
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:06.960]   everything else is locked down. And they're going there they're going through a script and I did have
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:13.280]   somebody I think looking at me a lot more closely when they saw that that I was deliberately saying,
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:17.280]   Oh, so there's you're saying that the kid can't get out of this mode. So I was doing things like
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:22.080]   holding down the home key for 10 seconds. I was I tried to power it down and I was able to make
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:26.640]   it go to sleep. I was able to make it to bring up accessibility controls, but otherwise I couldn't
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:30.560]   make it do anything that the teacher didn't want to do at that moment. So they really thought a lot
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:35.680]   about this. So we have already talked, as you might imagine it is you've been making your way back
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:41.680]   to your hotel. We had some time to talk about what we thought and so forth. You were there you saw
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:49.680]   tell us your your thoughts. I was really pleased by everything that that I saw today. It was I
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:55.760]   what I was looking forward to is apart from, you know, new announcements and demos. It's that's
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:01.680]   subtle question of are we seeing evidence that Apple cares about this market? And it was just an
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:07.120]   hour and a half of we we feel as though this is what they're explicitly saying, but the feeling I
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:14.240]   got was this is them saying that we feel as though a core part of this company is education. And we
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:18.560]   are trying we are just we are really really eager to make sure that we are as competitive with any
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:24.080]   other thing that's out there. And I was in preparation for this. I was talking to a lot of friends and
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:28.000]   mind and contacts that were there are usually the smart people I talked to when I need to learn
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.320]   about computers and education. And they gave me a whole list of reasons why either they personally
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:38.240]   didn't want to use iPads in their classrooms or reasons why they had tried to sell they would they
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:42.800]   had tried to convince their school districts to do something else but failed and really is went boom
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:49.760]   boom boom boom they went all the way down that list from an actually affordable device to to
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:54.880]   administration tools to security tools. They really really hit everything now whether it's
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:59.760]   going to be a business success. That's not my bailiwick but I really thought this was of this is a
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:04.560]   great product and I'm really really excited about what they're doing with education.
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:08.960]   They didn't drop the price at all. They just added capabilities. This is the same
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:16.800]   299 education that the previous iPad 5th generation was. And and and really is for anybody even for
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:23.680]   320 for the blistering $329 for the consumer version of it. I got to use one for about 10 or 15 minutes.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:31.920]   It feels like a regular regular iPad. I use a large iPad pro almost every day. And again I was
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:38.160]   zooming in zooming out. I was trying to try to stress the CPU. It really felt it didn't feel like
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:43.680]   Apple's least expensive computer in the lineup. It felt like a real iPad. I think that there are
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:48.560]   a lot of people that might have need might have wanted an iPad in their personal lineup who might
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:53.280]   have had and but only had a budget for a Chromebook or cheap Windows book but something with that
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:58.400]   kind of CPU and plus full Apple pencil support not stripped down Apple pencil support but full
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:03.680]   Apple pencil support. That really does seem like a great price for an inexpensive computer for
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:09.840]   finally an economically accessible computer. It's a generation old process for the A10 fusion not
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:17.360]   the A11. It's in the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 10 and the iPad pros. But they did say it's faster
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:24.000]   than a Chromebook or most Chromebooks out there. I don't know. Does speed really an issue in education?
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.400]   Is that what they said? Is that is one of the points your educators checked off?
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:33.520]   Not really but it's it's really important for what they're trying to sell. They are trying to make
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:38.160]   the point that this is not a Chromebook. This is an iPad. This is something that is that has a
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:42.880]   different mission statement than a simple Chromebook. It's not there to just give you reading writing
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:48.640]   spreadsheets and writing papers and test prep. This is for creativity. And so if they are really
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:53.040]   going to say that you can record and produce iMovie on this. If they're really going to say that you
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:58.240]   can draw and write and paint with it you can you can do AR with it. It has to be a top drawer
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:03.440]   experience and because it's that with the A10 that means it's about as fast as an iPhone 7
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:09.120]   that really does put it up there. Now it's not inexpensive especially when you consider you have
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:15.120]   to pay the education price of $89 for the pencil if you want to take advantage of the pencil.
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:25.440]   Yeah. That is more than many Chromebooks. Is that price still acceptable to your friends in education?
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:32.800]   It's in the ballpark. It's a really complex answer that people were giving me last week.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:38.080]   One of them is that they love to see hardware that's less than 200 bucks that isn't crap.
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:42.640]   So that's maybe it's well within the margin of what they think is tolerable.
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:46.640]   Particularly if they can make the case that this is going to be a durable thing that's not going to
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:52.880]   fall apart have keys flipping off of it and the uptime is going to be very, very good.
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:58.400]   On the other hand, the only major thing that I think they left unaddressed is that it
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:05.840]   still can only be an iPad and this vision of how you can teach lessons with the iPad as opposed to
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:11.520]   simply having any other generic computer was very compelling and very points inspirational.
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:16.880]   But one of the problems is that again, it still can only be an iPad. Whereas when you get a Chromebook,
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:23.040]   you can really make it into whatever you want when your lesson plans change. When you have
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:26.880]   when you've got 300 that you're moving from one school district to another school district
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:29.760]   because they have a whole different set of needs, it's a little bit more flexible.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:34.800]   But super competitive, I really do think it's a very competitive mode. It's expensive, but it's
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:38.720]   not cheap. Excuse me, it's inexpensive, but it's not cheaply made.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:45.600]   I think one of the things that Apple should do, we'll see what they do. They generally don't do
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:49.520]   what I'm about to say, which is that they should spur the market on by a lot of investment in
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:55.680]   content. But having a lot of really, really high-end content for specific subjects that are exclusive
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:54:00.640]   to this ecosystem, I think could also be something as people are making those decisions.
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:07.360]   It's not like a couple little chop skis, but some really good AR, some continuing to build those
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:12.160]   tools. They've shown some of these tools here, but really pushing the content end of things that
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:16.880]   there's a curriculum that people can work into so that all things are not even. You're buying
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:21.040]   into a curriculum as well as buying into that. There's a lot of complexities with that.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:26.080]   And so I wouldn't say curriculum, I would say a lot of additions, really cool math things or
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:31.280]   really cool science things that they can show off. And they should seed companies to do that.
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:35.680]   And if they really want to take this market, they should open up the person and start to
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:40.640]   dole out hundreds of millions of dollars. I mean, when people want to land in this area,
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:44.240]   that they should hundreds of millions of dollars or a billion dollars or two billion dollars in
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:51.520]   educational content that may not be, again, the curriculum world goes very slowly. You start in
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:55.680]   Florida and you get them to approve it or literally you start in Florida. And then you kind of work
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:55:00.640]   your way through the systems and that could take a decade, but lots and lots of extra tools that
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:05.200]   make science interesting, make art interesting, all of these things that they're showing off,
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:12.080]   but they need 10 of those in every vertical. And if it's only, if it's technologically driven,
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:17.600]   it's got tons of AR, tons of video, tons of interactivity, and then they, and it drives those
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:22.800]   as things you could use in the classroom. I think that puts a lot more pressure on schools who are
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:25.920]   saying, well, you know, the parents will be like, well, I want that or some of the school districts
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:29.760]   will say, well, we can't have that if we don't, you know, if we don't have that content. And
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:32.560]   especially if it's taking advantage of the pencil and taking advantage of things that
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:35.440]   would be hard to do on any other platform.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:42.240]   I like the position that they seem to be taking because when you have, yes, when you have content
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:47.120]   and curriculums that are specifically designed to take advantage of the iPad, that is wonderful,
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:52.000]   but that's non portable. That means that the school system is now locked into having this
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.080]   hardware and supporting this hardware or less than after adapt to entirely new course curricula.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:03.040]   What they seem to be making the point during the presentation that it's not a, it's not,
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:07.760]   there's not supposed to be a moment of okay class now take out your iPads. It's supposed to be a
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:13.840]   moment of we are doing our math unit that using whatever curriculum and whatever sources are
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:19.200]   approved and used by our school system. But we're using the kids can now use the iPads to sort of
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:23.440]   enhance their understanding about it. Just like they're doing a, they've already had a course
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:28.880]   curriculum on on coding. Now they have a course curriculum on creating. They're going to be showing
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:34.320]   that off for the first time at the Big Apple store here in Chicago later tonight. And that's,
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:38.320]   that's one of the things that they wanted to make a point of that you can teach, you can teach
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:45.680]   social studies, but rather than, rather than simply use a keyboard and a screen to write a report
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:51.360]   or to read web content that's been prepared, how about you actually create an iMovie and annotate
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:56.880]   and animate and narrate an iMovie about the subject to show off what you know. So that's what they're
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:57:01.760]   trying to get at. >> I think that's great. And I, and just to correct, I didn't want to say that
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:05.280]   they should create curriculum that they're locked into, but lots of extras. So what you're talking
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:10.480]   about. But even math extras and everything else, things that wrap around that curriculum. So they
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:15.280]   might still end up using Google Classroom for the core using the things that are already available
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:19.920]   to the school, but then, oh, there's all these extra tools and extra, even extra content that,
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:25.120]   that could be used that, that, that may be very driven towards the iPad. And of course that does
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:29.360]   create some, some reasons. It wouldn't lock you into the curriculum as much as there just be a lot
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:32.960]   of bells and whistles that you wouldn't have if you didn't have it. And then that leads you to that,
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:37.760]   the good thing for schools there is that a lot of 50% of the schools are already using Google,
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:42.720]   you know, Google Classroom. So they could use both together, but they might lean towards the
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:46.800]   Apple hardware while still using the Google Classroom, you know, which would, which would
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:50.400]   let Apple start to kind of edge their way into that process. >> Well, that's another thing Apple
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:54.240]   announced, of course, is a competitor to the classroom, which is, you know, something Apple really
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:59.280]   needed to do. This is called Schoolwork. It's an app for education, integrates with ClassKit,
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:06.560]   which lets third-party developers add their, you know, app to the schoolwork tracking.
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:09.920]   >> Now, what do you think the schoolwork, did you play, get to play with it or find out more about it?
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:15.520]   >> I didn't get to play with it myself, but I love the idea of having this ClassKit API.
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:22.640]   Part of it is not, again, if you are used to education with laptops, where a lot of it is
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:26.560]   okay class, now follow along with teacher in what you see presented on the screen,
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:32.640]   you can have, let's say that there is like a math lab sort of app. If that app supports ClassKit,
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:37.520]   the teacher's console, the teacher's iPad, can actually not just simply say, "Okay,
[00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:43.920]   Class, now open up the math app and follow along with me." The ClassKit app, excuse me,
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:50.480]   ClassKit APIs will let the teacher actually take over all of these apps to do a specific thing
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:55.760]   and run through a specific lesson plan. And that's going to, like a ARKit, that's going to be really
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:59:00.720]   cool to see how educators and how developers decide to support that in six to ten months.
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:08.640]   >> Really, ultimately, all of this comes down to what teachers can and want to do with it.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:13.360]   If you have a teacher that's expired and excited in the side-stance, you know, start using all these
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:18.800]   apps and start building curriculum or using existing curriculum really pays attention to this,
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:24.400]   who's really motivated to do it, this could be an amazing thing. But I also know that teachers
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:29.840]   are often overwhelmed, they don't have the resources that they'd like. They're in child
[00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:35.520]   gen requirements. They may not, they may not, you know, if even in one school, it could vary from
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:42.800]   classroom to classroom. >> One of the things that I would say- >> Go ahead, Alex.
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:43.840]   >> Go ahead, Andy. >> No, no.
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:50.080]   Okay, so one of the things that I think is important is to look for teachers that are interested in
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:54.720]   doing this and finding ways to do everything you can to support. And they've already talked
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:58.480]   about this, having ambassadors that are going to come to the schools and work with them.
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:03.920]   But they need to think about a way to do that ongoingly. So, and this could be literally live
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:08.080]   classrooms for the teachers that want to teach, you know, with their product. But really stepping
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:12.640]   out and getting their arms around helping teachers that are interested, because a lot of times what
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:18.160]   you end up with is a teacher or a handful of teachers in a given school system that are
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:23.440]   thinking outside the box. I had a friend of mine was in the Baltimore school, is in the Baltimore
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:29.040]   school district, actually a principal now. But a few years ago was a teacher in the Baltimore
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:32.480]   school district. And the Baltimore school district has smart boards and no one was using them.
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:35.600]   Like, you know, they sometimes used projection, but they never touched it.
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:38.880]   She started building a whole bunch of stuff around them because she was interested in that.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:43.440]   And then you end and what ended up happening is a lot more people started doing it because they
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:48.560]   saw what she was able to create. And so I think that that is a, you know, that's an
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:53.680]   that's an example of someone who just one teacher stepping out and then having it have a ripple effect.
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:59.600]   Finding those teachers and finding ways to really do absolutely everything you can to support them
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:03.040]   is going to be one of the key factors of Apple being able to do that. They have ambassadors,
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:06.160]   but they need to think about ways that they can literally support them every day.
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:11.440]   Like, how do you have them like they can send you a private forum for a handful of seed teachers,
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:15.200]   where they're going to be able to give you, you know, feedback and show you examples.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:19.120]   And those are the kind of things that I think Apple has to do if they really want to move into this market.
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:26.320]   Tonya, I saw you nodding. I mean, it's it's, you know, I we love teachers.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:31.360]   And I know that there are teachers who are inspired by the opportunity that this presents,
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:35.280]   but I also know teachers who are overwhelmed by the opportunity presents.
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:41.040]   Yeah, I mean, you're going to get everyone on that entire gamut. You're going to get the teacher who
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:44.880]   would be all over any kind of program Apple could offer, but even without the program,
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:47.840]   they're going to do great stuff. And then you've got teachers who are like, well,
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:56.720]   I just figured out my entire curriculum and it's not that overwhelmed or teachers whose technology
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:00.960]   skills are still coming online. And for them, you know, maybe just checking their email once a week
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:07.520]   is pretty awesome. So yes, all of the above, if Apple wants this to happen,
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:15.040]   I completely agree the more support that they can provide as far as examples and support and
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:22.400]   everything excellent. It's all good. Not sure what else to say. I mean, unless they want to actually,
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:26.560]   uh, I don't know, have little mini Apple stores in the local high school.
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:31.360]   Well, in some ways it might be possible to get people more inspired by Apple and how, you know,
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:36.400]   I mean, I think Apple's more inspiring than Google Chromebooks are. I mean, you know, the,
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:42.160]   it's if nothing else, they have beautiful ads and pretty pictures and you can look at that and go,
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:46.320]   boy, that would really be great. And you don't really see that kind of thing going on on the Google
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:52.560]   side. It's a little more pedestrian and mundane. On the other hand, teachers often don't get the
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:57.200]   choice of what they want to do and implement. I just know that from my own experience working with
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:03.120]   teachers in the high school, some teachers took to whatever technology they were given and really
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:10.000]   made it sing. And some teachers were so phobic or sometimes even anti technology, it didn't matter
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.920]   what you put in their hands. It wasn't going to make a difference. Somebody in the chat room,
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:21.840]   thank you. I don't have your name put the UNESCO education research and foresight working papers,
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:27.360]   the future of learning. This is from a few years ago talking about saying, well, for one thing,
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:31.360]   students are now, they said, going to be active learners, they're going to be much more engaged
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:36.480]   in their education. I think that's the kind of thing that an iPad in a kid's hand could make a
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:40.800]   big difference because kids like teachers get inspired by the technology that they have in their
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:46.800]   hands and an iPad is much more inspiring. But they also talk about how teachers are going to have
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:52.400]   to change their role. They say teachers have to evolve into creative workers, jointly constructing
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:58.800]   knowledge with learners in the classroom. And so this is in some ways, if Apple's vision is to come
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:06.160]   true, it's going to require teachers kind of embracing it and embracing a new role somewhat.
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:11.760]   Well, and I think that Apple has to take a more aggressive view of this than if they're serious
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:16.240]   about it. A lot of times Apple releases stuff and then goes, and then people will of course flock to
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:20.560]   it and we'll be happy. We know that. Well, that's a Silicon Valley problem.
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:25.840]   Right. But well, it isn't, I will say, I don't think it, I don't think that's the way Google
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:32.080]   approached it. I think Google approached the classrooms with a lot of focus. And so there's a
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:35.600]   lot of outreach, there was a lot of support, there was a lot of, I mean, Google definitely
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:40.480]   put their back into it when it comes to doing that. And so this report also says it says,
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:47.360]   this is going to require meaningful professional development and lots of support.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:52.080]   This is significant undertaking teachers will need new forms of professional development to
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:55.520]   support them if they're going to meet the needs of 21st century learners.
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:05:03.040]   Well, Apple, Apple's definitely in that. First of all, they've got, they've got so many former
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:07.520]   teachers working and working on the inside too. And they don't feel like they're work. The ones
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:11.600]   that I've talked to, in addition to the ones I talked to today, you get the feeling that they're
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:16.400]   still working for, they feel like they're still working as elementary school teachers. They're
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:22.240]   just helping kids through Apple and helping a larger classroom of kids by making these products
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:26.720]   and services better. There is a great deal of outreach. Today, they even showed off something
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:31.680]   that's been around for a while, the Apple teacher program, which is kind of like a social network,
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:36.560]   Apple social network for teachers. It really is like having an Apple watch where though, if you,
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:42.080]   if you don't know how to set up iMovie, if you don't know how to add to edit audio,
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:48.480]   if this is not like a, this is not a courseware for kids. This is courseware for teachers who
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:53.840]   want to learn how to integrate this stuff into their iPads and into their lessons. And so you
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:58.560]   actually get just like on the Apple watch, you get a sticker, you get a badge for achievements.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:05.440]   They said they were about to award their one millionth badge for achievements on the Apple
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:09.280]   network here. So they're definitely, definitely, definitely. They're not just putting it out there
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:13.760]   and hoping people come to buy it. This is, this has been a super interactive process.
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:19.920]   And again, it's just good to see where we're asked every time, every time they have a Mac
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:25.120]   announcement, it's like, we love the Mac. And to show that, here's a demo of a new feature we're
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:30.320]   adding to mail sometime in the next few months. That's, this isn't what was happening today. This
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:34.800]   was, you know, if we want to make sure you know that we love you, we want to make sure that it's
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:38.240]   not just something we're saying, it's something that we're actually doing and hear our physical,
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:41.040]   actual tangible results of all the work that we've been doing.
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:47.520]   Apple has created some new curriculum for teachers called everyone can create,
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:54.000]   create, you know, towards this goal. And they showed this off as well at the, at the school.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.040]   Yeah, I think this is an opportunity for actually, it's a great opportunity for Apple to take some
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:06.400]   leadership and step forward and say, we understand the needs of the, of 21st century learners and
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:13.840]   21st century teachers. And we're here to particularly to help teachers. That would be welcome. And
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:19.200]   like, as you said, Alex, I would love to see Apple put some money into this. They've got plenty of
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:24.480]   cash. If they really are committed to this, it's, it's going to be more than just releasing
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:30.320]   another iPad with pencil support. It's got to be, it's got to be really about helping teachers
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:35.360]   reinvent the classroom. It's, I do think they're doing that through the services and the software
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:39.840]   that they're making. Whether it comes down to actual monetary investment and actually creating
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:47.760]   content. I don't know. And I, my, my intimate knowledge of what teachers require in education
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:53.120]   is only through the wonderful people who try to help me become less ignorant. But it's so hard to
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:58.400]   create to, outside of simply giving people grant money to go off and do whatever they feel as they
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:03.600]   need to do. It's hard for them to make an impact on a national and international scale because
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:08.880]   the needs of each school district is different, let alone the needs of each school system.
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:11.920]   I'll give you an example though. And it's kind of, it sounds like they're kind of doing this.
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:16.240]   You've got these Apple stores. You've got an opportunity in these Apple stores. They're
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:22.480]   already doing it to do all sorts of really great learning events. Spend, you know, spend
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:26.000]   a significant portion of the time that you spend in the Apple store teaching,
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:30.160]   teaching teachers, showing teachers what they could do, supporting teachers. That's one way they
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:34.080]   could do it that wouldn't, you know, it would just be a fine tuning of what they're already doing.
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:38.000]   Well, I think a lot of those stores actually have private classrooms for that as well.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:38.320]   Okay.
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:44.000]   So there's, there's more to those Apple stores typically than, than, than just what's out in front.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.920]   So there's definitely some opportunities to do that. And, and you know, Apple can also do a tour.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:51.920]   I mean, they do tours in other areas where, you know, for developers and so on and so forth,
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:58.320]   go to hotel room, you know, get 400, you know, 400 teachers and, and have a, you know, conversation
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:02.800]   or, or better yet, do some of it online. There's this thing called, you know, HLS live streaming.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:06.880]   I think that Apple has something to do with. Yeah, they, they might do it again.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:07.600]   They figure out a way to do it.
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:12.240]   I do think, I do think they're doing it. It's just not a public facing feature that anybody
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:15.360]   can just jump into. So I think they're, I think they're doing a good job. I can,
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:21.600]   anyone can always do a better job. But I did, after people I've been talking to today and also
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:26.880]   a little bit earlier, the education for teachers resources are pretty, are very, very good.
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:32.000]   It's just that before they didn't have a whole lot of firepower with which to come to the purchasing
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.240]   people at the schools and at the schools and say, here is why we're not going to get Chromebooks.
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:38.800]   Here's why I'm going to make the case for making iPads.
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:44.720]   I hope this is the visible tip of a massive iceberg of support for education. It sure looked
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:49.600]   that way when Tim Cook took the stage this morning. I mean, he, he, it was clear Apple
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:53.040]   feels strongly about education. I don't feel like it was lip service,
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:57.520]   you know, in, in service of them making more money on the education market. But
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:01.280]   there's always that feeling. Somebody in the chatroom,
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:06.800]   writer in the chatroom says that it's going to be tough for Apple because educators already feel
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:12.000]   burned by the early iPad, iPad around education. I think to like the LA school district, which bought
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:17.760]   tens of millions of dollars of iPad and now is suing Apple and Pearson because there wasn't
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:22.480]   the curriculum, there wasn't the support. It really did not work out for them. And they, you know,
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:29.040]   they lost a lot of money on that. And I think that that feeling in the air is going to be something
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:36.240]   Apple also has to counter. Yeah, it was a similar situation to the main iPad buying program,
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:40.080]   the state of Maine, to invest in very, very heavily. And I think part of it was because they
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:45.280]   were selling the iPad as a content, as a container for curriculum and content, as opposed to
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.160]   this is a, this is the new Blackboard. This is the new composition book. This is something that
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:54.640]   you can use to teach whatever, whatever the thing is you want to teach. And even if you want to send
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:59.920]   people into the woods to look for bugs. Now we're saying, why don't use the camera on the iPad to
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:04.400]   take pictures of these bugs? And why don't you use iMovie to make a movie about what you've learned
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:11.680]   about bugs? It's a strong move. Yeah. Let's also point out that I love the fact that there's a
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:18.080]   $329 computer for consumers that I finally, I think is quite competitive with what you could get for
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:21.520]   less than $400 in the window side of it. It doesn't do with everything that a Windows,
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:27.520]   that a regular notebook would do. But it's a wonderful package. And I've always thought that
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:32.800]   the thing that really disappointed me about Apple is they don't seem to care that, excuse me,
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:36.640]   they don't visibly seem to care about people who don't have a whole lot of money to spend.
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:40.720]   But now they're really delivering a lot of value. And well, what do you know, all it took was having
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:46.000]   serious competition and a customer base that was able to make their own free choices of whether
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:53.440]   to go with Chromebooks or iPads. And I think that if you are enjoying as a regular consumer,
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:59.440]   the $329 new iPad, thank the education market for forcing Apple to finally say,
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:05.440]   well, you know what, maybe we can make a superior computer for about a money that most people can
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:16.160]   afford. I have to say, you know, I think my general inclination is that schools should not support
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:22.080]   closed proprietary platforms. That schools should be all about open software, open platforms.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:31.440]   That that is ultimately the best for society. And picking a winner in a big corporation is just
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:37.120]   not the role of public schools anyway. So I am kind of, I hate to say it, here we are on
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:43.760]   Macbreak Weekly. I'm not exactly sanguine about Apple's foray into education. I think they can
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:48.160]   they could show us a lot of cool and interesting things that can be done. That's great. And then
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:53.040]   I think the open community needs to take it over and push it forward. I'm just I feel very,
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:58.000]   that's a political point of view. Go ahead, time. We need a nonprofit. We would need a nonprofit
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:03.200]   to support that that initiative in a very strong way. I mean, Apple does put a lot of muscle behind
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:07.120]   this. I think that's an interesting idea to talk more about or to think more about. But it seems
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:12.960]   like the first thing that we need practically speaking is some kind of nonprofit that really
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:17.440]   wanted to take that on in a big way. I think there are a lot of things that are going to be
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:23.840]   not open is it's fragmented. It doesn't have the power of a single trillion dollar company
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:29.760]   pushing it. But it has many, many smaller companies that are actively interested.
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:32.160]   They're very interested. And I just I feel like that's.
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:37.200]   Yeah, but for a school district, they're not going to have the resources to sort out a whole
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:43.520]   bit of small companies and what to use. Well, but for years, they use Moodle, which was an open
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:47.040]   source classroom. It didn't turn out. That's only because they didn't have anything better.
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:51.840]   I mean, it was a yeah, it was like, I tried it. I mean, I was very excited. I was like, I'm going
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:57.040]   to use Moodle for some of the education stuff we were doing. And it was disaster. Like, it was so
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:03.360]   bad. And I have to admit that Moodle is the reason that I would disagree with you is that as this
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:08.880]   kind of open thing, it was, you know, there's a lot of people that use it and it's just gruel. I mean,
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:13.040]   and you just like, you know, it's, you know, and the problem is is that what I care about more
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:16.880]   than anything else is my kids learning efficiently. Like we can talk about whether they should learn
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:20.640]   about open platforms and we can talk about all those things. And I do want them to learn how to do
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:24.320]   bits and pieces of that. I have them building their own little computers and, you know,
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:28.560]   with teaching them how to use, you know, like literally like little little, those little Piper
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:32.400]   ones where they have to put it all together and they hack through all of those things. So it's not,
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:36.480]   you know, they, I definitely want them to be self-sufficient in that area. But when it comes to
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:40.240]   school, I want them to get through their schoolwork as fast as possible.
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:45.440]   I know, but you know, I, for the same reason, I'm not a fan of for-profit education. I'm not a fan of
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:52.560]   for-profit education entities. I, you know, I think Pearson's profit motive clearly is bad for
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:58.160]   education. I think I think you could argue the same for, you know, the only thing that is interesting
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:03.520]   is that Google does seem to have that kind of open source, open mentality. For instance,
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:09.440]   classroom works on every platform. I can guarantee you Apple's schoolwork is not going to work on
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:13.760]   anything but Apple. But I think the problem, the problem that the challenge of Google have,
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:16.880]   and I don't think it'll be a challenge. I think Google will be fine with this because
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:20.080]   I don't think Apple's going to push hard enough to make this work. But if Apple decided that they
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.280]   really wanted to push down this path and they really wanted to make it a great experience,
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:27.760]   it would be very hard for Google across all the platforms to compete with the quality of
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:31.760]   experience that you'd have on the iPad. So that, you know, the, if Apple decided they really wanted
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:37.600]   to push down that path, it's just too hard to do what, what they're doing. The advantage of that
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:43.360]   closed market is that it's, you have less variables to manage every time you create a new piece of
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:50.080]   content or new piece of tool, a new tool. And so the, that's the hard part. And now the advantage that
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:54.880]   the Google has is Apple, you know, they made a nice announcement and everything looks pretty and,
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:59.120]   you know, I'm sure everybody clapped and they'll probably put some money into it. But I don't think
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:03.680]   that they're going to do what would be necessary to really, you know, really take on this market
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:08.000]   if they did. It would be very hard to compete with because in the end, the educators that are
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.040]   going to make those choices are going to look at that content. They're going to look at the overall
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:14.960]   experience of the student. They're not going to talk about open networks or anything else. I mean,
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:19.840]   some of them, a handful of them will. But it's, you know, the bottom one is if kids are enjoying it,
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:24.560]   if kids are more engaged because it's more fun, because it's really cool tools, you know, to me,
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:28.080]   they're learning more and then when, you know, then they're going to move on to something else,
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:33.360]   you know, that's, I think I think more about the efficiency of the knowledge acquisition than
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:40.320]   there anything else. This is, I don't know how this has survived the tenure of Betsy DeVos as
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:47.600]   secretary of education, but tech ed.gov, the office of educational technology, U.S. government
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:55.200]   education, Department of Education, go open. Why use openly licensed educational resources,
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:59.360]   resources that are openly licensed benefit schools in a number of ways, mostly. But most
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:03.440]   notably, they help to increase equity, keep content relevant and high quality and power teachers
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:10.560]   and save money. This is exactly the opposite of what Apple is promoting. And I have to,
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:15.200]   I may, and again, it's a political point of view probably as much as anything else, but I agree with
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:23.840]   it. So, well, having said that, let's get back to the iPad adulation. Go ahead, Annie.
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:30.960]   No, I'm just, it's, it's, I don't think that this is, I think this really is a situation where Apple
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:38.640]   can't, it's, we forget that the Mac has way less than 10% of the desktop market, like it's
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:44.960]   in like 8.3, 8.4%. And so, but they're very, very successful in developing, selling a solution to
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:50.560]   people that are eager to have the sort of experience that the Macintosh provides. So, I certainly don't
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:56.640]   think that they are going to have the same supremacy that they once had in education.
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:01.760]   But at least it's going to be a very, very credible and very, very vibrant pocket,
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:06.640]   pocket dimension, so to speak, for all these people to work in. So, all the problems that
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:10.880]   you're mentioning are absolutely valid. And there's stuff that I keep hearing time and time again
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:16.720]   that they just, they really do need a container of people, IT people really want, and it's educators
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:21.760]   by large, they really, really want a container that they can adapt and put things into. And they
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:25.680]   don't like getting the answer back that, oh, well, this doesn't do that and you'd have to wait for
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:29.680]   the company to want to make that change in order for you to be able to do that. But there are going
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:34.080]   to be plenty of school systems that maybe they have been able to reinvent themselves on the ground
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:38.160]   up. Maybe they have a brand new soup yet super intended. Maybe they have a, I have to say this,
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:42.960]   but it's absolutely true. Maybe they have a demographic shift. That means that it's a much
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:48.000]   wealthier school district. And now they have the ability to reinvent classrooms and take the asbestos
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.720]   off the hot water pipes, simple things like that. And that really is part of the dimension of what
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:57.680]   we're looking at. We have, again, we have classes that have asbestos on hot water pipes. They can't,
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:02.320]   they feel that they've been told that so long as they don't rip them down, it's okay where it is.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:06.640]   And they don't have the money to properly make it to get the asbestos out of classrooms or upgrade
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:11.440]   the heating system or anything like that. So Apple, I don't think they can still make a solution for
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:15.840]   those school districts. And that's really, really too bad. I wish they, I hope that they do create
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:22.080]   open source, rather open software that can, that people can run on a Chromebook, that people can run
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:27.600]   on a Raspberry Pi. That would be such an amazing thing for Apple to do. But I'm not willing, but
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:32.480]   it's okay for me to say that so long as some kids find their voices, find their passions,
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:36.640]   so I don't think find a connection to knowledge and learning that would not have been there
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:41.280]   if this school, if the school district were still using a static page or even still using a keyboard
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:47.280]   and a mouse, I'm certainly all for it. All right, let's take a little break. We'll have more.
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:52.880]   Tanya, angst is here from tidbits.com. Wonderful to have you, Tanya. Thank you for being here for
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:58.960]   Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core. And we got Andy and I could head over to his hotel. Now, Andy,
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:02.720]   I don't know if this is a sensitive topic or not. Do you mind if I bring this up?
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:10.400]   Okay, well, I mean, the, I just find a kill a lot more comfortable in this.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:17.440]   My movement is preer. I know Andy, I know Andy, but going commando is just not. Oh, I didn't say
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:21.920]   I was going commando. I was, I were something under me there. Now I'm talking about the Chicago.
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:26.720]   This is the windy city, you know, I'm talking about the Chicago sun times,
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:31.760]   which Andy has been with. What do you said? 17 years. That's a long time.
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:35.680]   Yeah, I think I started with my 1999, actually 2000.
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:43.920]   That's great. And now it's the CWOB.com. Although I'm glad to say you posted on Facebook.
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:47.440]   It was the one reason I was glad I undeluted my deleted Facebook pages.
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:53.520]   I found out what was going on with Andy, that you are still at this event and covering it for
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:57.680]   another publication and that your future lies elsewhere, I guess is what we're saying.
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:02.800]   Yeah, I mean, the coverage that I was planning on writing for the sun times as of Thursday
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:07.360]   last week is going to be in Fast Company tomorrow. So look for it in fastcom.com.
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:13.120]   I'm going to be fine. As I was so flattered and leaving a little bit humbled by all the
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:17.360]   concern and well wishes that I was getting, because the news came down on Friday, I want to
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:22.320]   make sure that because there's so many people, companies that tend to send me things without
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:26.400]   me asking for them because they, because I'm a newspaper columnist, want to make sure the word
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:31.280]   got out really, really quickly. And I had to really reassure a lot of people that I enjoyed
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:36.640]   my tenure with the sun times. I was honored beyond measure to be a columnist for the newspaper that
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:44.480]   was Roger Ebers newspaper, for instance. But it's been a while since they were my primary source of
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:48.800]   income. I was still freelancing for them and they hadn't increased my column rate.
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:57.440]   I think since George W. Bush. So right now, as I was saying, as I replied to somebody else,
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:01.680]   it's like, I'm glad to say that's not question of where I'm going to be writing, but excuse me,
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:06.400]   if I'm going to be writing tech anymore, but where. So I'll be certainly hoping so I can find a
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:10.640]   regular columnist in somewhere else. But there are a couple of things I'm looking at right now,
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:16.400]   and there's almost certainly going to be a newsletter or an update to a new version of my
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:21.120]   website. So that will be able to do a lot of the stuff that I was unable to do for the sun times,
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:24.880]   because it had to go through editors and I couldn't just post things right to the site.
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:28.560]   One of the reasons why we were talking, we have been talking for I had not posted anything to
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:35.360]   the sun times in months, because we were really talking about, look, I really, really, I really,
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:39.040]   really think we can have an opportunity to do this, that and the other. So we were talking for a
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:44.240]   while, but just didn't work out. So again, nothing, nothing against the sun times. There's still,
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:49.120]   again, they've got such a legend to live up to and they're people working really, really hard
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:54.000]   every single day and living up to that legend. So please don't cancel your sometimes subscriptions.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.600]   It's still a wonderful, wonderful paper. Yeah, we know. Thank you for bringing that up.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:01.040]   Yeah, and we know Annie will find a great home. And of course, you always have a home with us,
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:07.520]   and I'm sure I'm sure Mike Hurley. You'll understand if you'll understand the next time I visit,
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:14.080]   I might take more snacks home. You take all you want. If you've got any other like twit clothing items,
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:18.800]   or like hand goods or non all the fleeces you can wear and we'll get you a case of a Mexican
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:27.840]   Coca-Cola just for you. CW, but now the place to find Andy, now more than ever, c w O B dot com.
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:36.560]   And I'm sure on a publication near you soon. I said they brought to you by zip recruiter. If
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:43.120]   you're hiring zip recruiter has changed the world for the better. Let me tell you this right now. Of
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:48.080]   course, you know, one of the best features of zipper recruiter is you can post once there and get
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:54.000]   to 100 plus job sites with a single click of the mouse. That means, of course, that you're going
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:00.000]   to reach out to as many places as many corners of the world as possible. The right person's out
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:05.120]   there. But how do you find him? But zipper recruiter goes a step beyond that as well, because they not
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:13.040]   only reach out and put your posting everywhere. They also look for the right people and introduce
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:19.200]   them to you. Zip recruiter learns what you're looking for, identifies the right people with
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:24.480]   the right experience and invites them to apply to your job. That is the smarter way to hire.
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:30.080]   Zip recruiter built the platform that finds the right job candidates for you. It's revolutionized
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:36.240]   how you find your next hire. In fact, it's so successful. 80% of employers who post a job on
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:41.120]   zip recruiter will get a quality candidate through the site in as little as one day and just one day
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:46.320]   and just one day and zipper recruiter doesn't stop there. They even spotlight the strongest
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:50.080]   applications you receive in the zipper recruiter interface. So you don't even you can't even miss
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:53.520]   a great match. The interface is also great. It really makes it easy for you to screen,
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:25:00.720]   rank and hire the right people fast. The right candidates are out there. Zip recruiter is how
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:05.600]   you find them. Businesses of all sizes trust zipper recruiter for their hiring needs. Now,
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:10.880]   you can try it for free. That's right. Free. Just go to zip recruiter.com/macbreakzip.
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:21.760]   recruiter.com/macbreak. It is the smartest way to hire zip recruiter.com/macbreak.
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:31.200]   So the Apple event is over. Was not as we had hoped perhaps the tent the time that Apple announced a
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:38.160]   new Macbook Air, a new Mac Mini, a new iPad Mini, none of the above. In fact, really nothing has
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:46.240]   changed. Nothing much has changed in the Mac lineup. So will it be in June, Tanya, angst?
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:53.360]   Yes, I believe in June, we'll see many new things. It's fun to speculate. But certainly we could
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:26:00.000]   see a new iPad Mini. We could have some clarification about the whole laptop range, right? Because we
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.760]   got MacBook Airs and MacBooks. And it's sometimes a little hard to figure out what's where with the
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:12.000]   lineups and the weights and the prices, we could see new desktop Macs. We could have
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:18.160]   announcements of future iMac Pros or Mac Pros. Sky's the limit. Who knows?
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:25.520]   I am. Go ahead, Danny. There was just one piece of Mac news, the classroom app that's used as the
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:30.320]   dashboard is coming to the Mac. So now if the teacher wants to use the Mac to control all those
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:35.200]   iPads and the work, that's nice. That's good. Did anybody say, "Hey, Tim,
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:41.040]   it's like a presidential press conference." That question, as you're going out the door,
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:47.760]   Tim, what about the new Mac Pro? Tim, Tim, I can't hear you. I can't hear you. Anybody at all?
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:53.760]   No. There was the traditional scrum in which Tim made an appearance on one of the demo floors and
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:57.280]   was surrounded by cameras of people who want to get pictures of him and with him. And I'm sure
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:00.080]   there was somebody who had asked that question, but I didn't hear it.
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:08.880]   Nothing. Dead silence. So we need, I mean, we need so many new Macs, but, oh well. And how about,
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:16.560]   I wonder, does this in some way indicate maybe an increased commitment to the iPad from Apple and
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:23.440]   iOS and maybe making iOS the operating system of the future? Or is this just, it doesn't seem like it.
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:29.360]   I don't know if it indicates anything that we didn't know before about their interest in the iPad.
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:35.040]   It does show exactly what Apple can achieve when they declare something to be a priority inside
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:41.120]   the company. So they have made a beautiful $300 computer and they have built an entire
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:46.320]   educational ecosystem about it. That's not just simply a me too sort of solution. That's how
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:50.800]   deeply they can mobilize when they feel as though this is an important market. You could, if we were
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:56.880]   going to be a little bit lean back in the chairs, stiffening whiskey, we could say, "Yeah, but,
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:00.880]   you know, so they weren't integrating Macs into the classroom. They're not making a $500
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:07.360]   MacBook Air, are they?" So it's still up in the era. Hopefully we'll have the same sort of
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:12.800]   evangelical event about the Mac in the future as we did about the iPad. But if you have any doubt
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:19.120]   that they really are building the company up on the back of iOS, this would have dispelled the last
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:24.880]   of it. Maybe there's some hope. Kara Swisher, it's been announced at MSNBC and the Vox that Kara
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:33.600]   Swisher and Chris Hayes will be interviewing Tim Cook for airing on April 6th at 8pm on MSNBC
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:39.680]   Revolution. Apple changing the world. Yeah, I don't think there'll be any tough questions. But
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:46.080]   maybe, maybe. I think that's a public event tomorrow as a matter of fact here in Chicago.
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:46.480]   Yeah.
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:53.120]   So it says something that Tim is staying an extra day here. And he's certainly not just
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:56.960]   not going to the Navy Pier and taking a ride in the Ferris wheel.
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:03.440]   He's definitely, Ramo Manuel was made an appearance backstage, excuse me, in the demo room.
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:07.280]   He's definitely talking to educators. He's definitely talking to government. He's definitely
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:12.640]   making the hard pitch. And Chicago, I think they, when they have all the great news,
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:17.200]   hopefully the great news coming up about how people are using the new iPads, hopefully a lot
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:18.640]   of us going to be coming out of Chicago.
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:24.160]   Good. And I also hope there'll be something about a MacBook or a MacBook Air, something
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:25.280]   like that. Hopefully.
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:30.800]   There is a rumor Ming Chi Quo at KGI Securities, who's become the king of Mac rumors,
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:38.000]   has said that there will be a series for Apple Watch this year, and that it will be bigger,
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:44.160]   a 15% larger display. I don't think you can get any more bezel-less. So that, I guess,
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:49.760]   means a larger watch as well. With better battery life and hands-to-health monitoring.
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:50.080]   Go ahead.
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:52.880]   That they could mean greater pixel density?
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:53.680]   Oh, maybe. Yeah.
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:58.480]   There have been rumors that they're going to use micro LED for the Apple Watch, but that
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:01.920]   wouldn't be this year. That's a couple of years off. That's a very interesting result.
[01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:09.600]   I say they're going to make a bigger wrist for me? Well, I know.
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:17.920]   My mine actually went down from what I had before. So I'm still the 42 inch,
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:23.600]   I mean, compared to a citizen kind of watch that I had before it was. So I would definitely-
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:30.080]   If it had better battery life and more capabilities, maybe. Really, the challenge of the watch is
[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:36.720]   that that small display is very hard to put a good user interface on. It's funny how it's grown
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:40.720]   on me. I really think that this is 40. But, Tanya, you probably wear a 38. You don't wear the 48.
[01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:46.880]   Yeah, I wear a 38. So I'm looking at it and I'm thinking that perhaps they could sort of wrap the
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:52.960]   display around the edges a little. Yeah, kind of a curved display. And I could probably get a
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:58.880]   few more pixels into it by really taking advantage of the edge. Actually, as I look at mine, I
[01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:06.240]   noticed that even though the glass goes around, the display itself is actually kind of centered.
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:13.040]   There. Yeah. So those bezels actually aren't really used. The non bezels. So there really are
[01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:16.960]   bezels on this. And maybe they could make it bigger without making the display go around.
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:21.360]   That's our feature request for Apple. Okay. Make it bigger.
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:27.120]   The only feature request is watch faces. Yeah. I think that's the only thing that I miss for
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:30.960]   the whole thing is just watch faces. Like, every time someone asks me, what would you put on the
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:38.560]   watch? I mean, watch faces. Really? Like more watch faces? Yeah. I saw a new, a proposed watch face
[01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:42.640]   on Reddit. Let me see if I can find it. Somebody I just I don't I don't understand it. I mean,
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:46.640]   like I literally just can't quite get my head around. I know people say, Oh, Apple's never going to
[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:51.120]   give us control of watch faces. I'm like, I don't understand why. Why can't we control design our
[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:56.960]   own? Because you know, it's on on Android where are now just what if what it's called where OS?
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:01.040]   The ugliest watch faces ever. But I guess it's your choice, right? You can.
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:04.880]   It's my choice. You know, the thing is, is that I want a technical watch face that does a bunch of
[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:09.600]   things that I need to do. And I you know, and you know, when I'm in production, I want to be able to
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:13.120]   have seconds and I don't want to be the goofy exercise. Every time I say I want seconds, everyone
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:17.200]   sends me to the exercise one. I don't want that. That looks like the lungs on Robin Williams and
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:22.480]   Morgan Mindy. And so I want I but I want like a technical looking one that has a whole bunch of
[01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:26.400]   information that I'm interested in. And I know that Apple is not going to design that because I
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:32.160]   have very specific needs. More complications. Let me do it. Here's the Apple watch face concept
[01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:38.640]   from P seven OEL on Reddit. I would be I would like but see this is an example of that's with four
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:44.560]   complications plus the calendar plus the day date. This is a very nice display. Very easy to use.
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:49.360]   You know, there's no reason why Apple shouldn't allow this kind of third party display. Right?
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:55.360]   Well, it's it's great to have even beyond making a practical watch face like that.
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:33:00.080]   I've I have a watch face where Android where that's a planet and there's a cartoon rocket ship.
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:03.680]   That's the second hands. I've got another one that there's it's just a digital display,
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:08.320]   but there's a kitty cat. And when when the when the watch goes into sleep mode, you know,
[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:12.400]   where it's just black and white and just the just the screen, the kitty cat goes to sleep.
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:18.080]   And it's it's it's just it's the same reason why the watch bands are such a wonderful idea for
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:23.200]   the Apple watch. It makes this watch into your watch. And so yeah, most of these things are
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:27.600]   most of these third party watch faces for Android were kind of junk. But really, again,
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:32.400]   all I care about is my kitty cat and my rocket ship. After that, I'm glad that both of those
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:38.720]   exist. It makes that watch mind. Sometimes Apple takes the lack of choice to a fetishistic extreme.
[01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:44.240]   Yes. Oh, but you got new watch bands.
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:51.200]   Now see, if Renee were here, he would be so excited.
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:34:01.680]   New spring watch bands from Apple. And oh, and look new iPhone and iPad cases as well.
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:09.520]   The yellow blue and red silicone cases. I'm sorry. Did I say yellow, blue and red? I met lemonade,
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:18.400]   red raspberry and denim blue. The $49 leather cases now will come in bright orange, spring yellow,
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:26.640]   electric blue and soft pink. You've got sleeves for the pencil and pink and blue,
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:33.120]   soft pink and electric blue, as well as new iPad, smart covers. And here are the new bands. Yes.
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:41.760]   Wait for it. Lemonade, red raspberry, denim blue, new Nike bands and cargo khaki and black,
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:50.080]   barely rose and pearl pink and black and white woven nylon bands and hot pink flashlight.
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:58.000]   Tahoe blue and marine green, classic buckle and soft pink spring yellow and electric blue.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:03.520]   It's very springy colors. This is really, I bet you this is a huge profit center for Apple now.
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:12.240]   These are $50 bands at best. In some cases, 150, if you get the new single tour from MS, $439.
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:19.840]   I don't know how Renee Richie can afford this. It's going to bankrupt the boy.
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:28.000]   Sometimes, can you put a price on style though? No, no, really.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:35.360]   Well, I think the new colors look great. But one of the things I was just noticing this week,
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:39.600]   someone was asking me, "Should they get a sports watch band for their Apple watch?" And I realized
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:44.880]   I'm still using my original band that I bought with the original watch. I've moved it up onto the
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:51.280]   new watches as I've gone through. But this thing has been through crazy long runs in the mud.
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:58.000]   It's been through 100 miles cycling outings. It's had sweat mud, not too much in the way of tears,
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:02.960]   not too much blood, such as a lot of use, in and out of the shower, in and out of the pond.
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:10.720]   It looks great. There aren't any stains on it. It hasn't ripped. You have the floral elastomer.
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:15.840]   I'm a little cheap sometimes about how much I want to pay for a watch band,
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:21.440]   which I'm probably going to break or abuse and have to throw out in a month or two.
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:27.120]   I was a little unhappy with the cost. But I've completely gotten my money's worth.
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:32.640]   I have maybe a half dozen Apple watch bands, including this one, this leather one, which is
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:39.280]   a cheap third party knockoff. I have a couple of third party knockoffs, which I mostly regret.
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:42.720]   But there's so much cheaper. It's hard to resist them.
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:45.440]   I bought a few, and then I just went back to the original.
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:49.440]   The floral elastomer does your right wear very, very well.
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:55.280]   Tanya, would you ever consider another maker's runners watch?
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:58.240]   Yeah, I have a Garmin.
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:02.720]   That's what the real runners wear, the serious runners.
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:07.520]   Well, the problem is, let's just say, for example, that you're running as fast as you can around a
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:13.600]   track. You have to pay attention so that you keep turning at the right turning radius,
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:18.960]   or you'll trip or go into the wrong lane. Let's say you want to know how fast you're going.
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:24.960]   If you lift up your wrist to look at your Apple watch, that tiny little pause.
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:32.800]   Oh, that's not good. Not happening. That's just one of the reasons why the Garmin is stand out.
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:38.320]   You can also turn on or off a Garmin while wearing sick heavy mittens.
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:44.320]   So we should mention Tanya lives in Ithaca, New York, where thick heavy mittens are
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:51.840]   do-re-gird nine months of the year. Oh, totally. So the Apple watch is really great. I have
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:59.120]   Strava on it. I will use it in a pinch. It has gotten better, but I think for people who are
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:08.560]   more serious about their running and cycling, Garmin is still still where it's at.
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:13.280]   What about Fitbit, which is the number two wearable after Apple, but quite distantly after Apple?
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:17.120]   They just announced this Fitbit Versa, which is really an Apple watch.
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:24.400]   Or maybe it's Pebble meets Apple watch. $200. I've seen some reviews saying that the notifications
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:31.440]   aren't great, that they have some flaws. But it does do a lot of the things the Apple watch
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:37.200]   looks. You might fool somebody. Oh, and it's also hard to change the bands, I think they say.
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:45.840]   I can tell you my mom, my mother-in-law, and my father-in-law, Fitbits. You like them a lot.
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:50.400]   Yeah, I see a lot of them as I'm walking around. I see a ton of Fitbits on people's wrists.
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:56.320]   In the case of my father-in-law, he even has an Apple watch, but prefers Fitbit.
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:02.400]   Interesting. My father, my father, who is retired now, but he was in the tech industry his whole
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:08.240]   life. He finally got his hands on one of our old Apple watches, and he converted over. But I think
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:15.280]   he liked all the features and didn't get boggled by all the settings and choices. So he's different,
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:21.200]   I think, than your typical retiree in that regard. I think Fitbit took some tips from Pebble when
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:26.640]   they acquired them. I think that the Versa is aimed directly at the Apple watch, and as a lower price
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:36.000]   point, I think may end up eating some of the Apple sales. The company that makes Apple's products,
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:43.520]   Foxconn, seems to be diversifying, they just bought Belkin for a lot of money.
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:49.920]   They bought a Apple thing, didn't they? Well, Belkin owns Weemo. Belkin had been acquiring
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:56.800]   stuff, so they bought Linksys from Cisco a while ago. They own Weemo. So, Fin, PHYN,
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:08.080]   $866 million for Foxconn. Do you think Apple should worry that it's chief manufacturer of the iPhone
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:16.480]   as ambitions in other areas? Not directly competing with Apple? No, because any company would be very,
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:20.800]   very happy to sell a part to Apple in this kind of quantity that they need for iPhones.
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:27.680]   I can't think of any part that's so strategic in nature that they can withhold it from Apple and
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:34.640]   affect anything that Apple wants to do. And Samsung builds the most competitive phone
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:38.880]   to Apple, and Apple still buys billions of dollars of good stuff from them for the iPhone.
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:44.800]   Good point. Excellent point. Yeah, I'm actually really liking the S9 Plus.
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:51.680]   It is a worthy competitor. It's the anti-Apple phone. It has a headphone jack, it has an SD card,
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:58.640]   it has fingerprint and face recognition, and it even has a terrifyingly scary Animoji feature.
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:04.960]   It just really doesn't look good. But you want to see my Animojis from the Samsung Galaxy S9?
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:08.560]   Oh, gosh, I can show you. I'm very curious now what makes them terrifying.
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:13.760]   They're in the what we call Uncanny Valley. So, this is supposedly me.
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:23.920]   There I am blowing you a kiss, Alex. Anderson Cooper is a lawyer. And Bill Clinton having a baby.
[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:27.520]   Yeah. None of them look like, I mean, none of the...
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:31.120]   Why do you have hair white? Well, I chose the white hair. I can make it different colors.
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:34.800]   The closest thing they had to my actual hair. You've seen me, right?
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:40.640]   Tanya, you're not... My hair is white-ish. And I decided on the blue suit.
[01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:45.600]   Look, this is as close as I could get to having it look like me. It takes a picture of you.
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:47.600]   And George Washington. George Washington. George Washington.
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:52.640]   It does look like a wig. It looks like a powdered wig. Now I will never see it with the same eyes.
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:56.320]   Tanya, just for that, you're getting this sent to your messages.
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:03.200]   Walked into a barbershop and said, "Give me the mic pence."
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:10.000]   It kind of looks like that, doesn't it? That you can see a little bit of me in that face.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.800]   Yeah, the eyes are better. A little bit.
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:16.400]   I look like Bill Clinton in 1992.
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:22.560]   So they don't have anything that's animated. It's all animated, but it's not what the emoji does.
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:24.960]   Where you're talking. No, no, I can do that. You can't drive it.
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:29.360]   No, I can do that. Yeah. It's not very good. I could do it. I don't have the phone on me.
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:36.080]   It's not very good. It's not a selling point. But I do think that this really cleared,
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:40.160]   as you look at all the features of this fun, that Samsung was saying, "Okay,
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:44.560]   we want to give you a real alternative to an iPhone X. So we're going to do,
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:48.880]   you know, it's the anti-iPhone X. It's nice. I mean, it's an alternative.
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:54.640]   And it's cheaper. Oh, I didn't mention this. It starts at $720 for the S9. The S9 plus is 840.
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:58.160]   I'm liking it quite a bit. It's the best Samsung phone yet.
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:02.400]   I think the three most significant phones out there are whatever the latest iPhone is,
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:09.040]   whatever the latest Pixel phone is, and the latest Galaxy Note. Because the Galaxy Note is,
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:13.360]   I don't care about anything but having a phone that could do bloody anything and anything I
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:17.520]   want it to do. I'm willing to have a huge stupid screen. I'm willing to have, if it means that I
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:23.680]   can read books on it and have a stylist, I want a stylist and I want a card slot and I want it.
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:26.960]   It's, I love how it's like, no, no, no, I want everything.
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:27.760]   I want it all.
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:37.440]   WWDC Lottery is over. Apple is sending emails to the victors.
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:45.440]   Good luck to you all. January 4th, McHenry Convention Center in San Jose. That's going to be the next big
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:53.520]   Apple event. That's not too far off. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see some other things, I'm sure,
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:44:00.400]   at that. Apple is proposing some new emojis and I like the emojis they're proposing.
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:07.760]   Guide dogs, wheelchairs, and other disability-themed emoji, including there's a prosthetic arm and
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:12.480]   a prosthetic leg. Here's a hearing aid. And I do think this is more, I think for Apple,
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:16.960]   this is definitely more than marketing. I think this is something that comes from Tim Cook.
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:21.600]   I think that he's really interested in inclusion, interested in trying to make this available,
[01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:27.520]   and making people feel comfortable with the technology. I don't get this as a marketing
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:32.000]   thing as much as just Tim Cook thinks it's important. Yeah. No, I completely agree with you,
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:36.480]   and I agree with him. I think these should be in the, you know, specification. They're proposing
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:43.840]   them. The next meeting of the Unicode Emoji Committee is April in San Jose, as a matter of fact.
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:49.040]   And Jeremy, I'm sure, will come on the show and talk about these. And then we'll find out if they
[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:56.480]   get approved. Let's see. In some point in the next year for emoji 12.0.
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:45:03.520]   Yeah, it's about time. I'm all for it. Plus, I can use that hearing aid emoji.
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:12.320]   I can't hear you. I don't know what you're saying. Don't talk to me.
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:16.480]   No, I think this is fantastic. I'm very happy that they're doing that.
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:26.800]   Any other stories before we take a break here? We mentioned the student accounts that actually,
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:32.080]   let me clarify this. And you can help me, Andy, if I get it wrong. You'll get an Apple ID as a
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:38.320]   student using the new software. It can be tied to your Apple ID. Apple wants to be very clear,
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:43.520]   though, that no information will pass to Apple from this student ID, which will be assigned to
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:49.200]   you at your school. That it's completely private. The only you and your teacher will know anything
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:56.000]   about that. Yeah, that's correct. The administrator that's misstraying these iPads, they can actually
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:01.840]   set it up so that as soon as a student is added to the student database, they can have software
[01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:06.880]   automatically generate an Apple ID for them. And then as soon as they leave the school system,
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:12.080]   they can then delete that ID. So they can spontaneously generate like a thousand Apple IDs in like a
[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:16.960]   minute. So it's pretty different from what we're expecting. That's fantastic.
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:23.280]   And yeah, they didn't hit the privacy angle as hard as I thought they might have and as hard as
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:27.440]   they could. They were made, they made sure where it was relevant to say that and we don't have any
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:31.760]   ID. All this stuff is just between the student and the teacher. Apple never gets this information,
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:38.000]   this never leaves the cloud. They could have hit that a lot harder, particularly given news of
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:44.320]   next last week. But perhaps it was more gentlemanly to leave that alone, just to keep it to what
[01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:49.200]   they needed to say. Yeah, and actually, I think Google has a pretty good privacy story. After getting
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:55.200]   danged with classroom, they've made a real effort to make sure that the students are private and
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:59.040]   they say, we don't want the student information and we're not going to get the student information
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:04.720]   if they use a classroom. Tim did talk about Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. He said,
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:09.840]   Facebook's collection of user data should not exist. This is an easy thing for Tim Cook to say because,
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:13.920]   of course, Apple doesn't collect this kind of stuff and would love Facebook to, well, I don't
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:21.360]   know if they'd love it, but they can easily go after Facebook. Apple CEO said the situation is dire
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:27.120]   and he thinks regulation is necessary. This is why he's talking in of all places, China.
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:37.440]   Yeah, privacy is not exactly at a premium in China. He says, that's kind of a bad timing.
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:43.840]   Well, and we talked about this on Saturday, snuck in at the last at the 11th hour into the omnibus
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:48.480]   spending bill that the House has said it passed and President Trump signed into law last week,
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:53.840]   snuck in at the last minute was the cloud act, which a lot of companies, I think including Apple,
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:48:00.000]   supported that basically give law enforcement warrantless access to user data.
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:09.040]   And that there you can even have a treaty with a foreign power that lets that foreign power
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:16.000]   get data from American companies about any of their citizens. And in that, if for instance,
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:23.360]   somebody from China is having a conversation with me, in that conversation will be me as well.
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:28.160]   And no warrant required. This is just going to be handed over. I think the big companies like
[01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:33.360]   Apple and Microsoft, Google and Facebook wanted this bill because it kind of lets them off the hook.
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:38.720]   But not a good thing for privacy by any means.
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:47.120]   Yeah, I think I really if I had my one ridiculous, not going to be answered shouted question at
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:54.560]   Tim Cook today, I really wish that he would clarify Apple's position on individual privacy from
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:49:00.240]   companies that which seems to be very different from their policy regarding Apple's protecting
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:06.240]   user privacy against those persons own governments. And like we're joking around about how this is
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:12.400]   happening. He's making these statements in China. But I'm not worried about my life ending
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:18.880]   over a marketer scraping data from my Facebook account. If I were a Chinese citizen realizing
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:24.480]   that I've now got a social media score, that is that is following me around it might might mean
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:28.560]   that the next time I get pulled over for a broken headlight, no one's going to see me again because
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:34.400]   they figured out a way to make sure that he's someone we don't want on the loose. That's a bad
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:40.800]   thing. Yeah, we I've been I talked on iOS today about the fact that in I think it's in Shenzhen
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:47.760]   actually, China, they've had for a long time, been using face recognition on Jwalkers.
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:56.240]   And if you J walk in China, they will put they have 7K cameras on the corners. If you J walk,
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:50:03.600]   they'll put your picture up on a big digital screen with your name, your your government ID
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:11.840]   to shame you. And now they're planning to send you messages, text messages, to further shame you.
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:18.320]   I guess J walking is such a problem in China. And and and the worst is it will affect your social
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:25.200]   score. They now as we as you mentioned, they can have a FICO score for bad behavior. And if you're
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:30.640]   if you're a repeat J Walker, it can ding you on your social credit score, which means you
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:36.400]   may not be able to buy plane tickets, train tickets, or even get alone from a bank.
[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:43.520]   So this is this is what we're looking at. This is in China, not here, but this is the kind of thing
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:48.240]   we're looking at. No, then they're not using. I mean, and they don't need to give you that social
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:53.840]   score. They don't need social media to do that. I mean, they may use it. They may use it, but
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:58.480]   they can just do it from just cameras. Yeah. Yeah, there's there's a lot of information that they
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:03.760]   can gather or use as measures. And of course, I really think about what if you look a lot like
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:10.320]   some jerk and you get his socials credit because he's misbehaving, you're not, but face recognition
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:15.600]   can't tell the difference. That's not good. And I doubt there's any appeal process.
[01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:22.320]   Well, I'm more concerned about how much this can grow. If that becomes sort of embedded
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:29.440]   into the digital economy of China, where this is just something that is another piece of data,
[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:33.920]   just like your height, weight, and eye color. That's always there. I mean, it sounds like I'm
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:41.360]   making a joke, but we're talking about the self driving the Uber self driving car that hit a
[01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:45.360]   bicyclist, which leads to, of course, lots of conversations about how do you program an AI to
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:51.120]   save life when you know that when the AI knows that, okay, this is a situation where there's going
[01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:57.440]   to be an accident, I just get to choose what kind of accident happens either either either
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:52:02.880]   avoid this person's going to be heading into me and crash into coming lane, or I just simply
[01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:08.320]   plow into what's in front of me. And again, it sounds like I'm joking, but five or 10 years from
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:13.600]   now, I have absolute I can't say that I don't believe that China, if they have regulations about
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:17.600]   the kind of software that's a self driving car would say is that that would be a feature is this
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:22.640]   somebody who's a boon to society? Are they helping out society? And I'm not saying, okay,
[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:28.880]   he's got a low social score run him over. Oh, man, he picked, he picked, we got cameras of him
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:33.840]   picking his nose up while waiting for a bus. I mean, we can talk about about the low social
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:38.400]   score, but I mean, people social, how you interact with your social network is affecting you now.
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:42.320]   You know, like, it's not something that we can talk about being added to a government score,
[01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:46.240]   but but you, you are people are not getting jobs, they're getting fired, they're getting
[01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:51.360]   all kinds of things because of what they do in social or what they're even accused of doing.
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:55.680]   And so, so I think this is already, you know, we're already kind of waist deep in this,
[01:52:55.680 --> 01:52:59.920]   you know, and this is just an iteration of that process.
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:06.960]   Now, when it's a government that's doing that, the government that has not just not just
[01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:12.000]   controlling where, whether you can get where, whether you can get an apartment or not, but if
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:15.840]   you can get an apartment, if you can live somewhere, if you can get a job somewhere, and it doesn't
[01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:19.840]   matter if you go to a different company that's not using this credit score, there is a government
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:24.640]   that is following you around. And also a government that, again, I will, I've got my mental shot clock
[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:29.920]   on talking about China. But again, we hoses to remember that these, this is a government that
[01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:34.560]   will, if you have a dissonant, a poet, an artist that's speaking out against the government,
[01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:37.760]   that person tends to disappear, or they're not allowed to leave their house forever.
[01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:43.200]   They're journalists that tend to disappear. And you just don't anything groups,
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:49.520]   groups getting together for innocuous reasons in certain numbers suddenly get the attention of
[01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:54.720]   the government. Not just China, like not just China, right? Lots of countries right now.
[01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:58.560]   And he's even worse, but yeah, I'm saying that that's what I don't want to enter it. And I think
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:03.520]   with Facebook knows, you know, we just found out Facebook was tracking Android phones,
[01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:08.320]   not just your contact list, but when you give Facebook messenger access to your contact list,
[01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:12.080]   it also collected every call you made who you made it to and how long you were on the phone for
[01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:18.640]   that with for that. And just I mean, Facebook now has enough knowledge to know if you're having
[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:25.040]   a if you're on a booty call, because and who with whom for how long, I mean, and they have that
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:30.240]   information and it's not a hard thing. They do have access to the motion sensor, the cameras,
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:35.520]   they could probably figure out how fast you are. Yeah. And but I mean, if you're both on Facebook,
[01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:40.560]   they know, hey, they met up, they here's where they met up years for how long. I mean, it is terrifying.
[01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:44.320]   Well, I'm not I'm not saying that it's a good thing. I'm just saying that we're already need
[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:48.720]   dependent. It's happening everywhere. It is. It is. I mean, we're just lucky that we don't have a
[01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:53.520]   government that's got wants to use that. But now the government can get the information without a
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:58.560]   warrant. We shouldn't assume that that our government's not using it. No, but at some point,
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:03.040]   it could get worse. I could I'm just saying we should we should not assume that they're not
[01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:08.960]   taking full advantage of the access that they have the the but even if you look at your, you know,
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:13.440]   your payment schedule, I mean, you use your credit card at the Safeway. I mean, they are tracking
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:17.440]   absolutely when you get to coupons, those coupon based on what you just bought.
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:23.440]   This stuff's been going on forever. The difference is it's weaponized now because you have all
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:28.960]   these disparate databases combined and the computing power to really start to generate
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:33.520]   some very interesting inferences. And I think that's very powerful. Very dangerous.
[01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:38.400]   Yeah. And that's why, again, I really think that we practically need a constitutional
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:44.320]   amendment that defines our rights digitally. I mean, it's we it's the really scary stories
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:49.280]   are about a government government like China, but it even just gets me upset that there are
[01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:53.760]   companies that do nothing but drive cars and parking lots in the streets with with license plate
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:56:00.080]   scanners, just simply building databases of what cars were where and because that's a really valuable
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:04.880]   data point, you can tell sell to somebody who wants to use that as an ingredient in another
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:10.400]   little stew they're making about. We need to find this person or we need to figure out who's been
[01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:15.920]   who's been who's been in the same neighborhood where prostitution has been happening. It's like,
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:22.400]   no, you don't this I would I do buy a new car. I'm going to build like with a Raspberry Pi or
[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:26.640]   something. I'm thinking that will a motorized thing that will just drop a curtain in front of
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:30.640]   in front of the license plates while it's parked. We've been talking about this for years.
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:35.840]   Data's the data smog. That's the information that you're just trailing off of you.
[01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:40.480]   I mean, my Tesla knows every single and then does when I put my foot on my break and it sends
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:47.120]   it all back to Elon. You know, there he goes up in searches and he says he was Leo doing
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:54.160]   no, no, no, they'll punish you. No, seriously, Ian, they will punish you based on what they've
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:59.200]   learned from the log. They will. And I thought, Hey, it's really convenient to have a fast track
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:03.440]   in my window. So don't have to pay tolls, except that every time I cross the bridge now, they know
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:09.360]   here comes Leo. And they I mean, it just goes on and on and on. And if you think about what
[01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:18.240]   they know about you, you just better pray. They don't have prisons and nuclear weapons.
[01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:23.360]   By the way, that Uber story is turning now against Uber somewhat. The state of Arizona is
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:29.520]   band Uber's self driving vehicles from the state. The governor did that and Nvidia now is
[01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:34.960]   suspending its self driving tests on public roads, saying it needs to know more about what
[01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:41.120]   happened in the Uber accident in video course, very involved in this, trying to sell a platform
[01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:48.640]   to a lot of companies. What I thought initially was, you know, just kind of sensationalist reporting
[01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:54.640]   about self driving cars is now turning out to be a much larger and much more serious story.
[01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:57.920]   Let's take a little break. I want to get your I don't know, Tonya, if we warned you, I want to
[01:57:57.920 --> 01:58:05.040]   get your pick of the week could be anything could be, I think Adam picked tires or something the last
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:12.160]   time he was on. I got I got my pick. It's in the spreadsheet. Okay, good. Tires is fine. I'm not
[01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:17.280]   saying anything against tires. Anything you want. We'll take a break and have more interest with
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:24.240]   Tonya angst from tidbits.com Alex Lindsey from the pixel core Chicago. Oh, I mean,
[01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:31.200]   celestial ways to bandwidths. He's in Chicago right now. Andy and I go our show today brought to you

[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:30.160]   We thank Rocket mortgage by quick and loans for their support of Mac break weekly.
[02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:37.360]   Okay, Tanya, let's see it. What's your pick of the week? All right. My pick of the week is an ebook.
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:44.160]   It is take control of Apple home automation. We need this one badly.
[02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:54.480]   Why did I pick this book? Well, it's written by Josh Centers who writes an awful lot for tidbits.
[02:00:54.480 --> 02:01:01.760]   This is his third take control title. He's a pretty seasoned author at this point.
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:09.120]   It's edited by a fellow named Dan Frakes. I feel very strongly knowing who edited a book.
[02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:15.840]   Knowing who edited a book can tell you a lot about the quality of the book. Dan,
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:21.440]   absolutely top-notch guy worked for Mac World for years. I believe he's with the wire cutter now,
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:27.920]   but he's always done some freelancing for take control books. I've just utterly impressed with
[02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:35.600]   them as an editor. That's a huge plus for this book. It's a book, but it's kind of like a mega
[02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:42.160]   magazine or a fun to read guidebook in that it's not this boring book thing that you're just going
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:46.160]   to have to read from cover to cover and it's going to have a lot of long words in it.
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:53.360]   More a little bit more like a magazine in that regard. Unlike a lot of stuff that you read nowadays
[02:01:53.360 --> 02:02:00.800]   on the web, the thing has no advertisements, no videos flashing at you, just really well organized
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:08.080]   assemblage of information about home automation with Apple as the focus of all that.
[02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:19.760]   It's got a lot of nuggets. There's a list of home automation misconceptions. There are a lot of
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:25.520]   ideas, some quite funny for why you would or would not want to install a smart door lock.
[02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:31.120]   And it's even got 10 tips for preventing haunted house syndrome.
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:39.120]   That is a real syndrome. There's some fun stuff here. Stuff turns on in the middle of the night.
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:44.080]   My room book comes on at two in the morning and makes me insane.
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:50.880]   Talk to Josh about that. I've got to stop that. Stop the insanity. That's a funny haunted house.
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:56.000]   Anyway, the thing is written for people who want to just get started really need to get their
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:00.880]   head over on the whole thing. And it's also written for people who are already hobbyists,
[02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:07.280]   have a few items and want to go further with it, but kind of rationalize the system and avoid
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:15.520]   unintended consequences. Awesome. You can find it. Take control books.com.
[02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:21.520]   E book 1499 and we definitely need. And by the way, there's always a sample on the
[02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:24.480]   take control book site. So you can always read it before you buy it.
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:29.680]   I'm sorry. Thank you. Alex Lindsay, a pick from you, my friend.
[02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:35.200]   Yeah. So, so my pick and I think I have it. I can pull it up here. This is a stream deck.
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:42.000]   So, so what stream deck is, is it's got a, you know, this is a little controller, kind of like
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:48.560]   X keys. So you've got these little, these little controllers here and just USB out. And you can
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:53.200]   actually identify these. I mean, you can actually customize, you know, these controllers here. So,
[02:03:53.200 --> 02:04:01.760]   so if we, if we look at, if I jump over, I think to here, this is, this is the, the controller for
[02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:06.560]   it. And it works pretty instantaneously. So, so for instance, you know, all of these sections here
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:10.880]   are, are all these different things that they've already prebuilt for you. I am not using any of
[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:15.920]   them. So I'm using them for just key codes that you would normally use X keys. But, but it's a lot
[02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:21.680]   easier to use if you, if you actually, you know, look at this, you know, if I grab something and
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:27.920]   drag it in here, so I just popped it in to there. And then I jump back to, you know, back to my
[02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:34.080]   video, you'll see that that, that area, you know, is, that's the new one that I just added. So, you
[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:38.000]   know, so that is already, you know, kind of thrown in there and it's got those pieces. Now, I'm using
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:42.720]   it as a control deck for, you know, for another computer that can play quick times and so on and
[02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:47.120]   so forth. So, you know, these are just keystrokes and, but I designed these, I, these are just jpegs
[02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:50.320]   that I, you know, I made them so that they look, I mean, they're not very pretty. I mean, but it's,
[02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:54.560]   but it tells me what I'm going to do when I, you know, when I hit those things. And so it's a,
[02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:59.040]   you know, it's not much different than the next keys, except it's about the same. It's, you know,
[02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:06.640]   oddly enough about the same price as X keys, they're about $150. And the ability, what steps
[02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:11.600]   it over, we still use X keys, we use X keys for a lot of kind of industrial strength controls.
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:15.520]   But the, but what I like about stream deck is that it's super easy to set up it. I mean,
[02:05:15.520 --> 02:05:19.440]   you plug it in, you start dragging and dropping stuff into it, and now you can control your
[02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:23.680]   computer. And especially if you're doing broadcast like this, you know, being able to just have a
[02:05:23.680 --> 02:05:27.120]   bunch of things that you can kind of throw. It's very geared towards the Twitch player,
[02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:31.200]   the YouTube streamer, those types of things. There's a lot of integration with OBS with
[02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:36.800]   X split, not exactly the stuff we use all the time, but definitely things that if you're interested
[02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:41.200]   in that, or if you're just interested in kind of a very basic automation for your
[02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:46.000]   presentations or other things, it's a, it's a really easy, easy to use. I mean, just got it,
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:52.320]   started playing with it, it fixed a bunch of problems that I had. So, and, and I'm pretty happy with it.
[02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:59.040]   I think NAB this year, the National Association of Broadcasters Show is going to be all less
[02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:03.360]   about broadcasters, almost entirely about streamers. That's a huge record.
[02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:09.600]   It's a big market. I think that it's, it'll still be, I mean, I've been to NAB.
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:15.360]   I think it's going to be 23 years or 20, no, sorry, 24 years this year, straight.
[02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:25.280]   Yeah, and so it is, the money that's being spent on broadcast is still a giant number.
[02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:30.480]   When you're buying some of these devices and some of the cameras, people are spending
[02:06:30.480 --> 02:06:35.680]   just insane. They have helicopter, they're selling helicopters with camera balls on the front.
[02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:42.480]   It's all of that stuff. So there's still an enormous amount of heavy iron that is sold,
[02:06:42.480 --> 02:06:47.600]   but definitely something that's growing very quickly is a lot of these tools. And definitely,
[02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:53.040]   people are paying a lot of attention to it. I mean, the, the, the, the live streaming is becoming,
[02:06:53.040 --> 02:06:57.360]   you know, more and more of a, and, and podcasting and, and all those other things, all the other
[02:06:57.360 --> 02:07:03.200]   ancillary pieces, you'll definitely see whole sections in Canon, sections at Sony, you know,
[02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:07.280]   the real empowerment for, for this is, as a single company is probably Blackmagic.
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:12.720]   But, but the, but, you know, right across from Blackmagic is an equally large booth called
[02:07:12.720 --> 02:07:18.080]   Grass Valley. So they're not, Grass Valley is not making tools for, for podcasters.
[02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:23.600]   No, no, no, no. Those are the, those are the big, the big, big iron, you know, right across the
[02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:27.760]   street. So, so they're still, you know, it's still a pretty big business as far as broadcast goes,
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:31.840]   but it is changing quickly. There's not a, not as much. And these little tools make it even
[02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:38.880]   easier for people to build shows that look closer and closer and sometimes start to expand past
[02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:43.680]   broadcast. One of the things that you can do really easily is incorporate comments and tweets
[02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:47.920]   and everything else with this little box. Because of all the pre-built, you just like set up your
[02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:51.360]   Twitter account and it'll just tie it, you know, tie all the stuff in and go grab the things that
[02:07:51.360 --> 02:07:56.640]   you want. So it's doing a lot of things in the background for you. And so one of the things that,
[02:07:56.640 --> 02:08:02.480]   that this enables the broadcast is a little behind on is actually interactivity, you know,
[02:08:02.480 --> 02:08:06.640]   being able to pool your comments and being able to pool those bits and pieces in.
[02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:10.400]   And so that's part of the part of the advantage there.
[02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:15.360]   Oh, this is from Elgato. Yeah, it's so funny. When I see those guys, when I see those guys,
[02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:18.880]   I'm like, "Can you guys make like a little thing that digitized?" You know, like,
[02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:22.880]   I'm always confused because they used to make the thing where you take your cable TV and you put
[02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:27.840]   it into your, you know, you have your like your RCA connection. Yeah, no, the i- i TV. I had,
[02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:33.120]   I love my Elgato. Okay, so this is a weird coincidence because the take control book that Tanya was
[02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:39.600]   talking about is sponsored by Elgato because they have Eve, which is a home control device.
[02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:45.680]   Right. And a lot of that book is about Eve. And we were earlier on the new screen savers,
[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:50.400]   we were talking about whatever happened to Elgato. Now I've, I can't get away from Elgato. They're
[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:56.080]   back. Yeah, they're there. I want this. This looks awesome. How much is it? I mean, they just,
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:09:01.200]   it's 150 bucks. So you'll love it. I actually think you'd love that have that in your studio
[02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:04.320]   because that's just one little thing that you can add a whole bunch of little bits and pieces to
[02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:09.680]   what you, what you want to do. I'm thinking for my studio. It'd be great. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. The
[02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:15.760]   only thing I wish is that, that you could build more complex behaviors like you do with ex,
[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:21.680]   with X keys. So X keys, you can basically have it go, you know, go to the market and buy some eggs
[02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:27.200]   and bring them back. I mean, like you just build these, these very complex solutions based on one
[02:09:27.200 --> 02:09:32.400]   keystroke. And so, so X keys does that better. This is pretty much they built all the tools for you.
[02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:37.680]   And oh, yeah, you can do a key press, you know, and that can be automated. But, but you're not,
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:41.680]   you know, there's no easy way for you to build your own, you know, more complex work throws,
[02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:44.800]   which is why we would still keep on using X keys for some of the stuff that we do.
[02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:50.720]   But, but it, but as something, if you look at X keys and you download the demo and your eyes
[02:09:50.720 --> 02:09:54.720]   cross when you're trying to figure out how to make it work, then then this is the thing for you.
[02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:57.840]   If you look at X keys and you go, Oh my gosh, this is the best thing since sliced bread,
[02:09:57.840 --> 02:10:01.760]   then then that's the thing for you. We have a little need for both. So,
[02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:08.080]   this is very cool. I'm glad Elgato is still around doing very interesting stuff.
[02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:11.200]   Yeah. Andy and I co pick of the week.
[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:19.440]   Probably a quick one, but the new Pi day was a couple of weeks ago. And so the Raspberry Pi
[02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:24.480]   organization came out with an updated version of the Raspberry Pi three, that's not the Raspberry
[02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:30.240]   Pi three B plus. And that's the single board Linux computer, which has got Bluetooth, it's got
[02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:35.920]   Wi-Fi, it's got four USB ports, it's got HDMI, it's got everything, everything but a power supply.
[02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:43.840]   It's just a tiny little credit card sized board that you can use as a conventional desktop machine
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:51.920]   with a full screen with any HDMI screen keyboard and mouse, or you can build really cool robots
[02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:57.040]   and stuff out of it, or you can put into a case and use it as a portable media player,
[02:10:57.040 --> 02:11:03.600]   or as a set it up to emulate the Mac or emulate game systems. What I'm getting at is that
[02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:09.920]   there's a lot of joy that I miss from early computing that I don't get out of Windows,
[02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:15.200]   I don't get from the Mac or iOS. And that's the ability to say here is a ugly green board with
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:20.640]   pins sticking out of it that can do anything you want to learn how to make it do. And so this is
[02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:25.200]   the one computer that I still use that I feel as though I understand everything that makes it work.
[02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:29.840]   And if there's anything I want to do involving a computer, I can make it do this, including build
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:36.640]   a new computer or build a new robot or build this or that. I'm looking at another story about the
[02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:45.680]   move. I'm trying to make decisions about my window treatments. And I know I know who the hell am I?
[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:52.800]   And so I'm in bed looking at the windows and thinking that it wouldn't be really hard to get
[02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:58.400]   some stepper motors and just have motorized rollers bringing the thing up. And immediately I thought
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:02.640]   about all this great I could put like an Arduino or have a Raspberry Pi controlling all of it.
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:09.360]   And whereas in the pre Raspberry Pi and Arduino days, I would have probably given up on it because
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:15.360]   I would have to have done it using my analog understanding of electronics versus a really good
[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:20.080]   like networkable computer controlable thing. With Raspberry Pi, it's so easy to figure out how to
[02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:26.400]   attach switches and motors and other things to it. It really is and it's 35 bucks and I really
[02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:30.240]   recommend people buy one if you even if you don't know what you're going to do with it. Just have
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:35.200]   us sitting around. At some point, it's going to be raining and the day the way you're going to
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:38.800]   thought you're going to be spending your Saturday gets canceled. Then you remember the Raspberry Pi.
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:42.960]   You'll say, Gee, I wonder what it's like to set this up as a desktop computer. And then a half
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:48.000]   hour later, you've got you've got the Raspberry Pi version of Linux installed on it. You're like,
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:52.080]   Oh my God, it's running a Chrome based operating system. I can do YouTube. I can do what else can
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:57.680]   it do. It really leads to a lot of exploration and a lot of joy. Can't recommend it highly enough.
[02:12:57.680 --> 02:13:01.440]   35 bucks. I agree. Oh, there's so much fun. I really love them.
[02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:07.040]   Well, my pick of the week. I'm so glad none of you mentioned this Apple had another big hardware
[02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:14.400]   announcement today and somehow you seem to have all missed this. Shocking. You see this nice silver
[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:22.640]   keyboard I have here. Well, I can now press this button and turn it space gray space gray is here.
[02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:27.680]   And you don't even pay much more for it. Just an extra $20 for the black paint.
[02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:36.080]   They also have pretty pretty. I feel bad for all the people on eBay trying to get $1,000 for their
[02:13:36.080 --> 02:13:44.160]   space gray magic trackpad. Sorry. It's 149 dalies from Apple again. A mere $20 premium. How do they
[02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:50.240]   justify the premium? Is it more expensive to make it? I don't get it. It actually is more expensive
[02:13:50.240 --> 02:13:54.000]   to make it. I don't know if it's that much more expensive, but it actually is. You know, we pay
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:58.240]   for we pay for a lot of aluminum products for other things and and you know, expensive getting
[02:13:58.240 --> 02:14:02.560]   them for everybody. If you get it painted black, it's going to be more expensive than if you just
[02:14:02.560 --> 02:14:12.000]   get the aluminum. I see a magic mouse and I want to paint it space gray for an extra few bucks.
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:17.040]   The slogan for these two devices. You want to hear it? Yeah. You'll hate using them, but now you'll
[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:25.840]   like the color. That's good. That's good. Space gray is available in the Apple store for the trackpad,
[02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:30.800]   the mouse and the and the keyboard, not the not the keypad list keyboard oddly enough.
[02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:36.960]   This just the magic keyboard with numeric keypad. Because they couldn't they couldn't make the
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:44.320]   little one in black. We are out of time. Thank you everybody for joining us. Tanya, always a pleasure.
[02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:50.320]   Thank you for spending your afternoon with us. Tanya angst is at tidbits.com. She's on the
[02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:58.400]   Twitter at Tanya angst and watch her whizzing by you at a race in the upper New York State area soon.
[02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:02.400]   What's your next race? Oh, the scunk cabbage classic.
[02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:11.120]   Okay. Okay. We'll have fun in the skunk cabbage classic. How many?
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:15.440]   Absolutely. How many miles are you asking if you're measuring cabbages? How many cabbages is that?
[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:21.120]   Ah, 10 cabbages. Oh, it's a 10 cabbage. Thank you, Tanya. Great to see you.
[02:15:21.120 --> 02:15:30.400]   Andy, an echo, C W O B dot com. If you have need for the best damn writer in the biz.
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:35.680]   He's out there. A couple of the notes. If you're in Chicago, I'm going to I'm actually at the
[02:15:35.680 --> 02:15:42.480]   PBS studios right now, WTTW. So I'll be on that channel tonight at seven tomorrow in Boston.
[02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:49.200]   I will be at the Boston Public Library on WGBH Public Radio also talking about this from noon
[02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:53.680]   onward. And if you're looking for my coverage of today's event, it's going to be on fast companies
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:58.240]   website tomorrow. I'm running it tonight and should be up sometime tomorrow. Check my go to
[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:04.160]   go to my website and also check out my Twitter feed while be posting until until I find a regular

[02:16:08.880 --> 02:16:18.320]   places where I'm writing on Twitter and stuff. Awesome. Awesome. At I H N A T K O and that thanks
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:22.640]   to the radio station for the TV station for letting you use that booth. I didn't realize that.
[02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:31.520]   That was very nice. WTTW. It's a it's a palindrome. Same either way. Yes.
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:40.000]   And Alex Lindsey at A L E X L I N D S A Y on the Twitter. That's the best way to keep up with
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:45.840]   with him. He's at pixel core.com. You can also become a pixel core member. Yeah. At Patreon,
[02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:52.000]   pixel core is at patreon.com/pixelcore. Yeah, we're doing I think almost every week we're doing
[02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:56.480]   little ask, you know, like we had Fred in talking about LIDAR last week. We're just talking about
[02:16:56.480 --> 02:16:59.440]   live production. So we're just going to keep on having those conversations. So if you're interested
