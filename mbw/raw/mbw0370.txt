[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.540]   Why are we seeing so many Apple executives on covers of magazines?
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.800]   They're handsome, but are they really that handsome and also Bluetooth blue low energy really really cool

[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:32.000]   I'm Andy Nato of the Chicago Sun Times once again guest hosting for Leo LaPorte who has accepted a gentlemanly wager of 50 pounds
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.040]   They cannot go circumnavigate around the moon in a derigible. Good luck to him
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.560]   We've lost contact him around the sea of tranquility. He is on the dark side a the radio blackout area
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.320]   Those of you who've been a following but following Apollo know
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.840]   I'm sure things will work out just fine in the meantime. We do have two wonderful wonderful people joining
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.000]   So I'm sorry also Renee as also traveling
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.680]   The rumor that he was the person who actually challenged Leo to the wager and then he felt like he was being shown up
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.560]   That Leo was doing so well and he set off on his own derigible to try to beat him to it
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.960]   I don't want I'm no part of that. I love them both. They're both wonderful colleagues and we'll just hope that they settle it amongst themselves
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.960]   Well, let's hope that there's one or both of them still alive next week to host the show
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.800]   But if we got to two really great people here serenity Caldwell from Mac world serenity how you doing this week?
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.920]   I'm doing really well. Thanks for having me on Andy
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:33.620]   And with her in in Skype spirit is Dan Moran also from Mac world. This is a Mac world panel, isn't it?
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.600]   It's amazing. I'm just so delighted to be here with all of my lovely colleagues
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.240]   Exactly and we are we are colleagues too. So so now this is this is not technically a topic of news
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.440]   But you're both friends and so and we can we can use this as a launching off point
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.480]   I want to I want to vent a little bit because I
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:01.640]   Apple has done something magnificent this week we all of our lives we are experienced with
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.880]   Individual apps on individual computers like messing us over
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.320]   This is the first time I had seen both an iOS app and a Mac OS app the same edition
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:20.400]   Conspiring together to trip me up because so I sent off a bunch of emails on the Mac version of
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.200]   Mac Mac mail on on Thursday and a lot of these were real like people leaving the office at the end of the week
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.000]   They need an answer to this or they needs a piece of work for me or something
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.640]   And so some and some of a bunch of emails I thought it was kind of curious that I wasn't getting replies to those emails
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.040]   But oh well it wasn't until Friday afternoon that I realized that
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.680]   desktop mail had run encountered a problem contacting my outgoing mail server and
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.320]   Decided that I was stressed out enough as it is
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.640]   Please don't bother Andy by telling him that all of the dozens and dozens and dozens of emails
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.440]   He'd been sending over the past 36 hours none of them had gone out
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.080]   So I was not real pleased with with mail dot app, but still my my expectations have been low
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.840]   I think we're all we don't have great expectations of mail dot app
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:07.320]   Then I found out exactly why it couldn't contact my mail server and the reason why was because on
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:13.040]   Tuesday night I had sent an email from my iPad from the iPad version of mail
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.400]   Something had gone wrong and it decided to resend that exact same email like a hundred times
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.120]   Like within a five minute period and my ISP assumed that I was sending spam from the account. So it was really dear
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.720]   It was it was like in in basketball
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.520]   This would be like the in the Olympics Larry Bird passing a magic Johnson swish
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.680]   Perfect. You got it. You got it. We got to really appreciate that kind of tension to detail. So I mean it
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:46.080]   Has it have any has anybody here had that same sort of problem? Are we are we giving up on mail now or should I just realize that?
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.160]   These this is the this the mankind is born into trouble. Just as surely as the sparks fly upward
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.400]   anybody, please I I have definitely had some problems with mail recently in fact on my laptop
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.000]   Which is one of my my primary machines?
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.040]   I had a similar problem where it wouldn't actually send any email
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.120]   And and exactly what happened to you Andy was like man people have been really quiet and I would get me
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.360]   I got an email like hours later like hey, we really need to reply to this like I swear I wrote a reply look
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.120]   There it is in my mailbox, but for some reason it didn't like my outgoing mail server
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.400]   I have to issue sometimes where I you know I got multiple accounts in mail
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.080]   I'll try to send from one account and it'll try to use the outgoing mail server from another account
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.880]   And then it will actually send it as though it came from that other account and it just gets super confused
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.040]   So yeah, you're not alone in this and in fact on my on my Macbook Air
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.520]   I've switched to my web mail clients
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.920]   Which is awful because I have three tabs open in my browser now with each of my three web mail accounts
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.520]   And they're all on different systems and they're all
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:53.320]   Inconsistent and I forget to check my mail and it's a nightmare. So that's the other classic problem where
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:06:01.160]   You'll you'll have to like resend it from another account and then for some reason rather than mail saying well for this one occasion
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.520]   Yes, please send it from this other account
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:08.280]   It switches you over completely and now like all my emails being sent from from my my dot Mac account
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.680]   and an account that I only use to prevent other people from having a really really cool username and
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.560]   There's the then there's the next problem where wow now people have like updated their contact databases to send me mail there
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.560]   This address that I never ever used
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.000]   Mail is it has some problems I
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:35.760]   Keep on reflecting on our nice Gmail outage last week wherein our company current uses Gmail for everything
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:42.040]   Mail wise so for some reason, you know, we had an email gap of about three hours due
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.960]   to I think a server went offline or something crazy like that and
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:53.440]   All of a sudden at about 4 or 5 p.m. My time I start getting these emails that had been sent at about 9 or 10 in the morning
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:59.280]   My time was just like meeting in 10 minutes meeting changed to this location meeting changed to that location
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:05.440]   Why are you why are you not at the meeting? Why haven't you answered this really important question? It's
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.920]   I don't know email, you know email has been very useful for a very long time
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:18.680]   And I rely on it in some ways for for communicating and getting getting all my tasks in in a row
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.520]   but
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:27.320]   Honestly, sometimes I just prefer, you know, you know, you know human to human contact instant contact via like Twitter or via
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.000]   instant message or just
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.720]   Even messages has been performing lately better than my male client, which seems a little crazy
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.760]   Yeah, that's that's unfortunate. Well
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:44.320]   How much do you rely on mail anyway? Let's go back to telegram, Zandy. That'll be much better
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:52.520]   Well, we also have the problem where like if we were like potters, let's say we could say oh and someone say gee
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:57.200]   You're supposed to like send me this thing on deadline by yesterday at that at 4 30
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.360]   Why didn't you send it we could say I am but a simple and humble potter?
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.160]   Unfortunately the technology that I must I'm required to use to communicate with the outside
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:10.200]   Modern world has failed me and I lacked the skills and worthwhile to figure out what had what had gone wrong and also to repair it
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:18.400]   If we use that excuse even though it's a legitimate reason why we didn't communicate as promised if you're you you're studying yourself the follow-up question
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:25.400]   Don't you write about technology? Don't you actually have a focus specifically on this operating system Andy?
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.840]   That's what I say every time we try to use Google Hangout for one of our staff meetings
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.880]   And we have to jump through 18,000 hoops. I just point out it's a good thing none of us work in technology
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:40.800]   Otherwise, that would be embarrassing. Yes. Well, you can also get messed up on the other side of the fence
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.880]   I was working on a video project where with me and three other people who
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:51.200]   Excuse me me and three people who are famous for really knowing their stuff about diagnosing problems with max and stuff
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:58.560]   We were working together on this project suddenly in the office the Wi-Fi router like goes could put and everybody leaps into action
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:04.960]   It's it's it's like a superhero team where everybody has a separate specialty where I was looking for maybe a
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.080]   I was I was looking for maybe a fail an update that was necessary to apply to a driver
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:16.520]   I know the person was doing all kinds of like low-level networking who do looking at looking at packets
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:23.920]   Everyone had their own special thing and it took us 20 minutes collectively for someone to run the cable all the way back to the router and realize that
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.920]   Oh, the little tab that locks it in place had broken off
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.720]   And if we just jab a paperclip in there, it'll probably say oh there it is now that he's not working again
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.840]   My giver would have solved that for you in an instant and much much more handsomely, too
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.720]   But
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:44.400]   Not a whole lot of news this week, so let's talk about some broader topics though. We're all still
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:52.080]   Getting used to iOS 7 the new iPhones are now out long enough that we're now no longer quite dazzled by the gold color
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:59.240]   Now you guys are kind of in a different boat from most people and even a different boat for me because you guys have been working on
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.940]   iOS 7 coverage
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:05.240]   For Mac world and how long Dan how long have you been using iOS 7?
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.320]   I
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:11.160]   Rather foolishly installed it on my phone around
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.160]   WWBC
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.140]   Yeah, we had some ups and downs over that period, but that's a solid
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:24.240]   Like that what was it like not getting phone calls or having only 20 minutes of battery life?
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.720]   No, it's great. You know really saw it really simplified my life
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.920]   You know there were fewer things to deal with no emails no phone
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.840]   There was just you know, I felt I felt very much sympathy for Henry David throw
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:41.280]   It was nice you finally got to catch up on the wire which is a show that you totally missed by being productive with your
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.280]   technology looks
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.560]   Rending to you working
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:54.280]   Yeah, I've been using it pretty much since the same time Dan has I put the first beta on my phone
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:11:02.120]   pretty much as soon as they came out from dub dub DC because I'm crazy but also because Mac world does these things called ebooks and
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:10.400]   Generally we write comprehensive coverage on the I/O on iOS and we have to do that basically throughout the three months
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:16.160]   Categorizing figuring out what's changed figuring out what gets pulled from the betas at the very last second
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:21.400]   So I felt it best since I was going to be writing so much about it to sort of be immersed in it
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.920]   Although I kept it off of my iPad for a long time
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.960]   It was on my iPhone and I think not really on my iPad
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.600]   until the GM I
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.760]   because of yeah
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.800]   I only started really I I started using it about a month after
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:44.880]   BDC after I'd finished writing my previous stuff. I didn't actually I seriously did not put it on any
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.320]   Production device until GM came out until the cold master
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.160]   I still haven't put it on my main production iPad because there's one app
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:58.120]   screens my my VNC app that doesn't work quite well with iOS 7 yet
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.840]   I think that's gonna be my hold off until I put it on the iPad
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:07.480]   But it's on my phone now, but so a lot of people are still getting used to the new interface and the new look of pretty much everything
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.160]   so
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.160]   You guys can give us sort of a an
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:17.560]   Advanced look how much how you've been using it for a few months most people now I'm using it for a couple of weeks
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:24.800]   How long did it take you Dan before it stopped freaking you out that nothing all the shapes were different all the buttons were different
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.000]   Things were sliding and moving and it was making you feel very very funny in a very very weird place
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.320]   Well, you know like so many tech people. I just love things that are shiny
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:42.120]   So I think I was dazzled a little bit at first and distracted and it took probably a couple weeks before I was really feeling as comfortable
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.880]   I was I had with the earlier version
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:50.560]   It's still I left my iPad mini on iOS 6 as well because obviously the beta wasn't available for the iPad at the beginning
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:56.080]   And so I was jumping back and forth for a while which was odd because it was really an issue of
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.280]   Well, okay, I'm gonna you know use this new to this is yeah
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.160]   I'm kind of getting used to this is near and then I would jump back to iOS 6 and be like whoa
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:07.200]   What is going on? Oh, yeah, this iOS 6 I'm already used this and then you go back to iOS 7. Oh my god
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.040]   What happened so there was a lot of back and forth there
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:17.760]   But once I I switched over my larger iPad to iOS 7 just so I could have a comparison point and I think it really took
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.440]   You know I took a week or two
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:25.360]   I think it was probably a little bit longer than say in in lion when Apple switched the scrolling direction
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.600]   Which took I think three or four days for me to get okay fine
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.640]   I pretty much back to you know figuring out how this works, but
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.520]   Everything does look different
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:39.000]   But everything works more or less the same and I think that that's kind of the saving grace is it really does feel like although
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.360]   There's a lot of different, you know aesthetics and stuff like that the the general mechanics of the OS are pretty much the same
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.400]   So that that helps you feel a little bit more at home
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:52.640]   I kind of equated it to going to a a strange country where the signs might be in a different language
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.280]   But you can still sort of figure out like okay, that's a stop sign
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.080]   You know that's a sign telling me a direction someplace. That's the restroom
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.800]   You know I think I think that's sort of the closest analogy I could come up with
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:09.600]   Renwood did what was your transition like do you are you now in a sort of a place of peace with iOS 7 or?
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.800]   Do you are you accepting it as something that's better or does it still sort of just register or something that's different?
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.720]   You know I actually really enjoyed iOS 7 from day one
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.240]   I think I I was one of the few people who
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.600]   Immediately kind of glommed on to the new interface. It was just like wow. This is really awesome
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:33.120]   And I mean I've been wanting some of the features that were present in iOS 7 for many many years
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:40.880]   Including things like control centers. So having that available even in a very very buggy format in beta 1 was really fantastic
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.880]   There was a lot of interface
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.920]   Decisions that initially I was kind of a little
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:54.240]   Put off by I felt like the operating system for a while was very sparse and felt kind of you know halfway finished
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.840]   Everything didn't quite gel together
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:01.840]   And then you know one of the things I've never really seen Apple do over its beta processes
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:07.400]   It really did kind of iterate upon those upon those interface decisions
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:14.160]   Over the next couple of betas which made a huge difference it changed it from being beta 1 on my phone looking being like
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.800]   Well, I'm using it for the great features
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:20.840]   But the design isn't exactly where I want it to be to the GM release
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.120]   Which I still have some you know little quibbles here and there but by and large
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:33.040]   Like Dan said going from an iOS 7 device to iOS 6 is kind of horrifying to the point where I know that iOS 7 is not going to
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.040]   Run well on my 4s which is my testing device
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:41.760]   But I kind of want to put it on there anyway because I can't stand looking at iOS 6 anymore
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.160]   To see amorphic
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.040]   Yeah, I find myself I'm not quite there yet
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:55.920]   But I do find myself when I switch back to my iPad a lot of like the user interface elements that were so familiar to me
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:02.640]   Now they kind of look like that unnecessary rear spoiler on like a mid early 90s like budget sports car
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:08.520]   It's like that's not providing that that that highlight on that button. It's not providing any downs downforce
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:13.680]   It's not improving the aerodynamics or handling. It's just there because they decided it would look real boss
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:20.720]   But the spoiler over there so it's it's I think my difficulty with I don't really have a difficulty with iOS 7
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.720]   It's it's more like
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:29.000]   It is a very Spartan interface and it does remind me a lot of what I was designing the first time
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.280]   I got access to tables and HTML. It's all wow so now I can put this
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:40.360]   clickable thing in Helvetica on this side this corner of the screen and now this clickable thing in Helvetica on this corner of the
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:40.560]   screen
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:45.300]   Oh, you know what would be really look awesome if I made that those clickable things in Helvetica like red
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.400]   There you go now. They're red
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:54.600]   It just I wish there were a little bit more guidance as a user to try to there's there's that sort of visual
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:17:00.680]   Cue that there is here is one part of the screen this in a slightly different color than the rest part of the screen
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:05.960]   So if you're looking to tap an action button or find a way to get out of this to go someplace else in the app
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:11.440]   Here's where you look for that. Here's another place where once you have finished giving the app information that it needs
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.800]   Here's what you tap in order to get to the next step of whatever process you're in
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:20.120]   I know so I think that they've stripped away a lot of those cues out there. I'm also oddly enough
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:25.600]   I find myself still a little bit weirded out by the fact that the the hardware bar at the top
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.400]   You know that gives you the time your battery level and your salt
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:34.080]   salt strength is now the exact same color as whatever the top of the screen is because
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.200]   To me that was always a little bit of an extra cue that oh by the way
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.440]   This is special if you tap this that will zip you all the way to the top of a scrolling list again
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:51.240]   so there's there's certainly a lot of adaptation and I've I think that we're not really gonna be done with the iOS 7 transition until so until all these
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.360]   developers
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:58.920]   Get so much feedback from all of these other users and they also get all these opportunities to see how other developers had
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.720]   Been interpreting this new interface and this new visual guide
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.040]   And they can pick and choose and say oh wow that's such a great idea
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.120]   We should use that for the next version of our app and oh wow did they screw up on that?
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:13.320]   I've been were we thinking about doing that? Okay? We're definitely not gonna do that on our app now
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.720]   There's a really neat article in in the verge
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:24.920]   On a couple days ago that interviewed a couple of iOS 7 developers about the broader issues about
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.160]   bringing a new interface in and
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.800]   the creator of
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:37.760]   I think Michael Simmons. I'm sorry I was looking for the name the guy who used who created a fantastical which is that really great menu bar
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:42.760]   plugin that I use so much had a really good point in saying that I
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:46.520]   that there he was the question was if
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:52.120]   All of these really cool visual transitions all these camera moves zooming in zooming out
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:57.400]   Giving you a sense of spatial awareness of where you're going from one place to another if those are really great ideas
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:03.020]   How come you didn't put that in before iOS 7? Why did you wait until Apple did that and he said?
[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:09.400]   The answer if you go too far outside the norm of apples built-in apps the user isn't going to adapt as quickly
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.000]   And they may reject it for fear of difference
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Which is a really good point because if you're the one app that sticks out like a sore thumb
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.840]   Then you look like the oddball you look like the weirdo
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:26.920]   But if you are simply one of 80 kids in the freshman class who are wearing you know a propeller beanie
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.720]   You're not the weirdo. You're just one of these people who's oh, it's just another one of those guys worst
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.280]   Propeller beanies. Hey, Propeller beanies. Those are pretty cool. I should pair that with a spinning bow tie
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.280]   And I'll then I'll look like big man on campus
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.800]   what is is
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:42.800]   Is I think I think he's on to something there don't you don't you agree down?
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:49.960]   Well, there's there's an interesting issue of vocabulary. I think is what it comes down to is is Apple's sort of given out this new?
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.720]   Okay, this is how we're building apps now
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:57.800]   This is the vocabulary we're using in terms of like what a button looks like what a list looks like all these sort of building blocks
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:02.120]   And I think they're inviting you know developers to come up with interesting ways to combine those
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.200]   I'm very intrigued to see what some people do with it
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:10.440]   Because we've had the thing in iOS 6 was in some ways there was a very fragmented experience
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.440]   You end up with apps that were incredibly skeuomorphic
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:17.320]   You know mimicking real world items at the you know calendar on the iPad
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:23.920]   And you find my friends game center things that had all these textures and real world applications
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:29.040]   And then you had apps that were really very utilitarian things like mail and safari where it was like all right
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.800]   We have a very distinct style that we've been creating
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:38.080]   But it's not in something that mimics the real world. It's something that we've designed you know in a vocabulary that we believe to be
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.980]   The best way to do things on mobile devices
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.640]   So iOS 7 has changed that up a bit
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.920]   And I think they've tried to unify a bit more rather than having those disparate attempts
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:50.240]   They instead have said okay, this is kind of how all of our apps are going to look
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:54.640]   We're using these very thin lines. We're using words as buttons in a lot of places
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.880]   So this is kind of what we're putting out there to going forward
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:02.720]   And so what's interesting to me is looking at apps that have taken a really different stylistic approach under iOS 6
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.440]   And one thing that comes to mind is tweetbot, which is the Twitter client
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:11.920]   I use by the guys at tapbots and it's a really distinct look it has its own very
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.560]   particular UI and its own very particular
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:20.600]   set of design, you know for how we have a style buttons and things like that and
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:24.960]   It doesn't it was separate from what iOS 6 did though
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.680]   It clearly had callbacks to what you know iOS was doing at that point
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:34.120]   But it's very very different from what iOS 7 looks like and so I'm curious to see if they decide well
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.400]   You know our our app is so so different in some ways
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:43.080]   It can kind of live in its own little UI bubble or if they're really gonna feel like we need to adapt in order to
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:51.640]   You know address what Apple's doing with iOS 7 and I think it may be the latter because we're gonna as you're saying with Michael's quote there
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:59.200]   It's a little weird right if they exist in this little UI bubble are people gonna be put off when they switch between that and other apps
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.000]   That have more closely hewed to what Apple's trying to do there
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.160]   So it is we you know
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:09.320]   We've only had a few months with iOS 7 and certainly some people have done redesigns in that period
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:13.680]   But there's a lot of apps left that haven't yet adopted whatever Apple's doing in iOS 7
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.760]   So I'm curious to see as that rolls out
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:22.560]   Whether we'll see a wider spectrum of apps that have adopted this new design aesthetic
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.920]   Yeah
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.320]   Ren do you think that's essentially point do you think that it's in the
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:35.800]   iOS community's best interest that developers start really rallying behind a consistent design language or I mean there there I
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:40.640]   It's great that you have apps that are consistent from point to point
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:44.920]   But you know when you get the first app that comes up with how about pull to refresh
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.920]   How about that or how about we do away with you?
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.880]   You find yourself really liking a certain app and then you discover that
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:52.160]   Oh, well
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:56.480]   This was originally an Android app and they decided to simply make a consistent interface between the two of them
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.520]   And that's why it looks completely different for anything else
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:05.320]   It's I mean with the consistency is usually touted as a really fine thing, but is it holding Apple back at all I
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.720]   Don't think so, you know
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.120]   I actually think that
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:16.760]   Based on the apps that we've seen so far and the apps that have been released solely for iOS 7 the major developers that have jumped to iOS 7
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.800]   Pretty much right off the bat from launch day
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:24.480]   I think Apple is in a really good place in terms of unifying their design scheme without
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:28.200]   Necessarily taking away the individual characteristics from the apps
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:36.080]   I mean you look at apps on Mac OS 10 and you're able to do a sort of a wide spectrum of design on OS 10
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:41.680]   But you still have you know the top menu bar and you have the full screen button and you have the three
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.080]   You know colored buttons for closing or minimizing or enlarging a window
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.920]   that design you know is kind of is
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:55.600]   It goes across any app in OS 10 and I feel like the vast majority of
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.360]   iOS 7 UI guidelines are very similar
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:06.040]   Granted not everybody likes the idea of just tapping backwards to go on text and especially when you translate into different languages
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:12.320]   It gets to be quite a pain. I know I've seen quite a few reports from international designers who are
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:20.400]   Less than thrilled about that part, but I have faith that the community and Apple to a certain extent will figure that out and
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.960]   Work on it and get it to a place where it can be
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:30.200]   I mean we've already seen again in the debate a process that Apple's been willing to kind of tweak and change its design UI
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:34.920]   which is I think very different than how they've operated in previous years and I
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:41.200]   I really hope that the things that designers are having a lot of trouble with
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.400]   they're
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.520]   Basically, they're filing radars. They're putting in books. They're being like well
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.200]   This isn't working and the people you know and I still think that you can
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:56.640]   Hat tip to apples design guidelines without necessarily imitating them entirely
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.640]   I think there are a
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:06.120]   Wide variety of really interesting iOS 7 apps that don't necessarily feel like oh minimalist flat
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:09.920]   You know they still have a lot of character
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.480]   I'm gonna be really interested to see tweet bots iOS 7 design
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:19.480]   I know it's around the corner pretty soon and I've seen hints of the icon and I think that they will do an
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.880]   interesting job
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:25.840]   Again, at tipping to iOS 7's design guidelines without necessarily
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:31.080]   stripping away everything that made tweet bot energetic and fun in the first place
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:40.440]   And do you do you get the idea that maybe also part of this interface is kind of a forward look into hardware that they want to release soon
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:46.800]   enough, but they can't even hint at right now because one of things it kind of I did think I did think that the
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.320]   UI seemed a little bit I
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:54.440]   Has to take to say overstrip down. I'm but it's it really is a
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:59.720]   long drive in a specific direction, which means that they were they were really
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:04.760]   Everyone at Apple on the design team must have really believed in this and it made me think well
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:11.000]   What are the practical benefits of this sort of interface and one of the things that came to mind right away is that if you
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.480]   Want to really do device screen independent resolution user interfaces. This is one way to do it
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.480]   So you don't have you no longer have
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:23.040]   Button targets that are locked to a certain pixel count. You no longer have
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:29.640]   All these elements that are proportion for an iPhone screen or proportion for a specific iPad screen if it's just text
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:35.960]   You can zoom it up zoom it down put it wherever you want. I mean, absolutely. Yeah, I mean you can overthink it, but
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:42.640]   Yeah, no, I mean, I think it's actually really really interesting the way that apples chosen to go about that
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:47.240]   especially with the new accessibility features and the independent text size and being able to
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:51.400]   dynamically resize text and type kit in iOS 7
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:57.760]   While I don't necessarily think that they stripped it down specifically so that they could do different devices
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.360]   I think that it does aid them very much so in
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:07.600]   branching out iOS 7's basic design schema to other places
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:13.320]   I think again the beauty that I like about iOS 7 and something that
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:21.160]   Joni I was really trying to emphasize on stage was the layer the layered aspect of the operating system
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:29.080]   And I kind of I think about it in a way such as you know with iOS 7 on the iPhone you have this many layers with iOS 7 on say a
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:35.640]   Possible smartwatch you maybe only have like two or three layers with iOS 7's design schema
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:39.520]   Maybe coming to OS 10's next version maybe after Mavericks
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:45.360]   You might have a couple more layers because you're dealing with a more complex system. I think it's a it's a good
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.840]   building block for Apple to sort of base its
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:54.240]   Its next generation on and then add and take away features necessary
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.720]   Yeah, I'm not sure that I'm really getting the layering effect though
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.360]   I mean that was that was certainly a point they made very strongly
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:04.000]   WWDC, but it made me think that we're gonna see a more
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.760]   Obvious layering scheme
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:10.080]   In the in action the actual OS and actual apps it really doesn't seem
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:14.880]   It really doesn't seem to me as though I'm getting a sense of place
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:24.000]   via layers of interface the way that that's happening is with all these big camera movements that they put into the interface and that's kind of a
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:32.480]   Point that I realized early on that I find that I like the user interface when I'm looking at a static screen
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:38.680]   I love it when it's in motion because that really gives you these subtle cues as to you were here
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.440]   Now you're drilling deeper down over here
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:46.120]   And now we're moving you back up a little a few levels so that you can see all the apps you that you've got running at the same time
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:54.640]   There is of course the story in the Guardian about how the all those camera moves are making some people dizzy and nauseated
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:29:01.880]   And not simply on an aesthetic mode if they have vestibular disorders, which is affecting your balance and inner ear
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:06.360]   Apparently those are triggers for for for your condition
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:12.680]   It's I think that's one of the things we're gonna have to see earlier late a little bit later on in an update
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.680]   I'm accessibility right now
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:19.640]   It's if you see the accessibility options and I was seven do allow you to reduce motion a little bit
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:26.680]   But I think we're gonna have to have an option to sort of turn those things off or at least minimize them because you know
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.000]   or
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.440]   at the very least if they want to don't run afoul want to run afoul the Americans with the abilities act
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:38.160]   They're gonna have to have like two little dots inside the phone one is a simple moisture sensor
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:43.120]   The other one is like a vomit sensor and can see they're all clearly you're holding the phone up
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:47.680]   And it was the user interface that made you yak all over the phone. Why don't we give you a freebie on that basis?
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:56.360]   Great a great week though great launch week for for the new phones. They sold about nine million supposedly
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:59.600]   Businessweek is saying that if
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.680]   here if the
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:06.360]   9 million iPhone 5s and 5c sold the first weekend
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:12.800]   Businessweek saying if this single product were its own company in the standard and poor is 500 stock index iPhone Incorporated without sell
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:17.640]   474 of those companies ranking somewhere between Wells Fargo with a sale with a
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:25.480]   90.5 billion dollars and marathon petroleum beating a petroleum company 84.9 billion dollars
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:30.920]   At the iPhone representing 88.4 billion bucks in annualized revenue
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:37.360]   interesting thing though is that of course it also is outselling all other apple products combined and
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:41.840]   I'm you know, we've all been through like the dark times of Apple
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.360]   We knew that we know that apples fortunes can go up it can go down
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.120]   Should we be able to be a little bit worried that?
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:52.640]   Most of apples revenue now is come if this is I believe this is correct
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:59.480]   But if all this most of the revenue is now coming from this one product line and if somebody if the world's collectively decides that
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.760]   iPhones are nice, but geez other competing phones are pretty good too
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:08.880]   You know half your money off of one product is that something to worry about Danny think I
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:12.320]   Don't know that it's a situation that I would worry about
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:18.080]   Saying Apple is doomed. I'm saying that that's sort of that's sort of saying what you mean
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:23.840]   As a I'm also as a freelancer. I worry about you guys you work for one company Mac world
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.200]   Like if if back world goes under you have no income. How are you doing this?
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:32.080]   Are you freaking out? I mean we could be concerned about that since 1984
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:37.840]   Been through those times come on and the we lasted I
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.960]   It's certainly a big chunk of it. I you know, obviously
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:48.240]   Is this a different situation from the 90s when pretty much all of apples revenue came from the Mac and that was doing much worse than the iPhone is
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:54.720]   I I think they've diversified enough, you know, the Mac and the iPad for example do very well
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:00.320]   I don't think that you know, they Apple might not make as much money or the iPhone to suddenly tank
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:04.640]   But it's unlikely that they would just suddenly lose all the sales of the iPhone, right?
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:08.880]   So it is a lot of eggs to put in a in a very large basket
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:13.200]   But I think the the interesting question to look at from there is
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:19.920]   What comes past this point? You know, are there other products down the line that might start making up a bigger chunk
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:23.120]   of of the of apples bottom line
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:28.880]   the smartphone smartphones are still incredibly popular and incredibly, you know
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:36.320]   Attractive portion of the market. Um, we're still you know only six years into this whole smartphone revolution really
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.920]   And so I think that there's certainly a worry that at some point
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.280]   You might see the smartphone start to peter out a little bit
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:50.160]   But I think it's interesting to look at it in comparison to one of other app one of apples other sort of hot products, which is the ipod
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:54.240]   Um, the ipod held notoriously high market share in the digital music
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.320]   arena for
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.440]   many years
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:03.520]   Um, but when you look at its overall lifespan and it's certainly over the last few years started to decline more precipitously
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:09.120]   It really only had a solid, you know, 10 years there before it sort of went up and down again
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:15.120]   Whereas I think that's interesting to contrast against the mac which has now been around for almost 30 years
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.480]   Um and has certainly had its ups and downs
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:22.480]   But it's managed to hold on to a pretty significant niche in the market and this these days
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.360]   It's outselling pretty much everybody else in the pc market
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:30.000]   So I I think that you know while the smartphone might eventually
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.560]   succumb to the same sort of on we that has hit the uh, the ipod
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:38.240]   It's going to be a while coming and it's not necessarily going to be well
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:43.200]   That's because this other product, you know, this other smartphone is taking away from apple's bottom line
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.800]   It's going to be because we've moved past smartphones and onto something else
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:51.120]   And so it's a question for me really of whether apple is going to be uh good enough to
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:56.720]   Anticipate whatever that next product line is and figure out how to get in on the ground floor
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.760]   Of that the same way that they've managed to do with the the iphone
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.760]   Um, and obviously, you know, I think the ipad too is an interesting
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:10.480]   Uh, a case because you you're dealing with something that's very very similar to a smartphone and yet seems to have its own distinct portion of the market
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:16.960]   Um, and so I expect there to be probably an increase in how much of the bottom line is made up from the ipad
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:21.680]   Um as well, but it's they have a lot of products right now and they're diversified
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:25.120]   Enough that I wouldn't be too worried about about that situation
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:29.760]   The fact that you have one product that's making a bajillionized amount of money
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.640]   That's equal to the bajillion you're making off your entire other product line
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:36.800]   That is not a significant problem but from from a user or a stockholder perspective
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:41.520]   Um, but is it run as you think that maybe that there's a there could be a sort of perception problem
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:46.640]   I mean apple makes so many great products if they just became if if in three years time
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:48.960]   They're known as oh, they're the company that makes the iphone
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:53.280]   I understand they also do laptops, but they're primarily an iphone company could could that bite them in the butt
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:57.040]   Well, I think it could if tim cook decided tomorrow
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:01.920]   Oh, we're going to put all of our you know all of our talent and all of our work solely on the iphone
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:07.920]   But apple has never been one of those companies that's oh, we're only looking at this one project
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:10.320]   We're we're only putting our focus right here
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.840]   They skate to where the puck is going to be rather than the where the puck is
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:18.400]   They're putting a lot of effort and a lot of energy into the iphone for sure
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:23.280]   And their sales are a very good reason why but I think the the
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:30.800]   Majesty of the iphone as a product is that it allows them to play and toy in the same environment
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:35.200]   That I think they're using to create future products, you know, the iphone is not just
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:42.000]   Um, it's not just a dead end. It's not just a sprout that kind of peters off and goes nowhere the iphone, you know
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.520]   um
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:49.120]   Sprouts into the ipad could potentially be the basis, you know, the m7 co processor in the newest phone
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:51.760]   Uh, we may see that get used in a smartwatch
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:56.320]   Um, we may see some of the iCloud and iTunes
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:02.080]   Improvements that they've made in ios go to a future version of the apple tv
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:04.080]   like I I feel like
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:12.400]   Unless apple's leadership changes and unless they're focused on creating the best products for today tomorrow and the future changes
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:17.840]   I don't I don't necessarily worry that we're going to see apple sort of pigeonholeed and niched
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:23.440]   Yeah, I think it's cool that uh all the all the ginsiness of the a7 processor the new iphone
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.840]   Not only makes the iphone cooler, but I'll also
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:32.400]   Promise us to speculate if this is really are actually looking at the new processor for the next iteration of the backbook air
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:39.200]   They really do they they are one company that builds one product line and that is known as every product that apple makes
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:46.960]   We're gonna break for a minute and we're gonna come back and talk about how apple executives are now airport bookstore poster boy
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:53.360]   As all of the where you can see but first let's go to live the porch from in the recent past talking to us with a message from audible
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:57.120]   Hey, Andy, please if you don't mind. I'd like to jump in here and by the way

[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:22.960]   Thank you leo from the recent past
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:28.240]   Yeah, actually this is this is a book that i've recommended once before uh, it's niel gammons the ocean at the end of the lane
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:32.160]   But i'll tell you why oftentimes when i recommend a book for this these audible spots
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:37.040]   It's a book that i've actually read on kindle or in paper and have discovered oh great. It's an audible book
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.040]   I love that book i recommend this one
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:43.840]   This this time I actually had the opportunity to listen to the audible listen to the listen to it
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:48.880]   And it's niel gamers narration throughout and man alive if he's narrating anything
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:53.040]   That's something you should be spending money or using one of your free free audible slots on
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:40:00.240]   Because it's something when someone with a voice like that with performance chops like that is reading his own material
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:04.320]   Uh, the other great thing about it is that it's not a it's not a terribly long book
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.400]   It's something like six hours
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.000]   Uh, six to eight hours long
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.160]   And it means that you have the ability to it's it's a it's a great thing to be
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:18.880]   Yes five hours and 46 minutes, which is roughly how long it took me to do like a certain like saturday afternoon project
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:24.640]   Uh around the house because I kind of I kind of start is like one of those little projects that you kind of mean to get to
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:28.320]   But there are a lot of little steps and it's just a lot of like meticulous sort of things and he's be done
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:31.840]   And so just okay, let's let's just listen to an auto book audio book
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:37.520]   I'll see how far I get through it and the next thing I knew that project that had been standing idle for about two months got finished
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:43.600]   Because i'm just listening to this book and I don't want to leave this room with all my tools and the and the stuff from the project i'm working on
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.360]   Because that would mean like turning off the book. I want to find I want to hear more about this is great
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.200]   Uh, so that's it ocean at the end of their lane again anything that the that Neil Gaiman is narrating good pick for you
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:41:00.480]   Um, I was doing a bunch of travel over the past couple weeks and saw something absolutely amazing at an airport bookstore
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:06.560]   Which is a row of magazines containing cut with cover photos of johnny i've
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:10.000]   And tim cook and kraig federigee
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.800]   Uh, and I actually actually wound up taking a picture of him. I wish I i'm sorry i didn't share it to you
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:22.640]   So you can see it, but actually well here's here it is on my my vulgar device, but yeah, it's like I can't remember a time when
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:28.880]   You would see like high level apple executives giving so many interviews to so many
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:36.320]   So many magazines certainly not even surrounding a product launch which every other company when they're trying to get attention for a product
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:40.800]   That's how you do it. You give you you give your your superstar or well-known ceo
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.160]   Uh
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.960]   Get get in placement in time magazine or amazing that you know
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:51.120]   Any any magazine that's that's that's still being read and read and enjoyed by uh by a worldwide audience
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:56.000]   Uh, but apple has always seemed to be nope. We really really really recent iphone
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.800]   People will know it people will know love at the star is the iphone. We don't need to bring out steve jobs
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.880]   You don't need to bring out tim cook
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.040]   I don't know. I don't know that it means
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:10.480]   Anything specifically, but that's got to be a data point of some kind doesn't it dan
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:15.120]   I think you know, I was thinking about this before the show and I think that's what's interesting about it is
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:20.000]   Um the audience right it this is targeted to my mind and it's not targeted at
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.080]   Us company in bloomberg, which are two of course business oriented magazines
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:29.040]   Right and I think that's a big part of it. I believe uh, i've been fed already also talked to usa today
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:36.080]   Um, which is obvious a little bit more consumer focus or focus to people who stay at hotels. I guess because that's the only place i've ever read
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:38.080]   USA today
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:44.480]   And I think but I think the business angle of it is really important right we've had tim asked several times now about apple stock price
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:47.280]   Um, which of course took a beating earlier in the year
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:52.080]   For for a perception problem really I mean, it's not as though they stop making money
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:56.240]   It's not as though they were not you know producing new products and things like that
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:57.360]   It's just that
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:03.920]   People expect them to be at a certain bar and if they don't hit that level then they're considered to be doomed or failing or whatever
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:08.560]   Have so I think I think this is a perception play on the part of apple to try and
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:14.560]   Say to the you know investor types and wall street folks that look we know what we're doing
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:19.120]   Okay, we have a plan. This is not us flailing around trying to come up with something
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:24.800]   That's new and hip. We we have an idea and a vision and we're executing on that idea and vision
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:30.560]   Um, and yeah, you're right. This is this is not very common for them and and part of that
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:35.040]   I mean, that's that's one reason it works so well when they do do it is that it
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:41.520]   Garner's so much attention because you know, you can count on, you know, okay a hand or two the number of times Steve jobs gave
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:45.280]   You know live tv interviews over the course of his tenure at apple
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:49.360]   Um, but every time that he did you can be sure that people tuned in and watched
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:54.080]   Uh, and you know even tim cook being in a different sort of ceo
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:59.200]   But following a similar pattern whereas you know the times that he's actually going to give interviews is
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:01.520]   People are going to pay attention to that
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:05.840]   Um, and I think it's really interesting that they decided to promote these three guys
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:11.360]   You know federegii and cook as sort of this interesting triumvirate at the the head of apple
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:17.920]   Um because certainly, you know the jobs era you didn't see anybody but jobs as the face of apple
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:20.800]   And I think you know, we're definitely in the post jobs era
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:26.240]   And a lot's been made of that but I think it's important and they're trying to put out this idea like look we're not
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:30.400]   Yeah, we don't have that one charismatic visionary ceo anymore
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.560]   But we do have a really good team
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:36.240]   And then we have a lot of people with their own particular specialties and we have smart guys
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:41.840]   You know what they're doing who are inculcated in a culture of of the kind of company that jobs ran
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:45.280]   And it's not as though we're suddenly bereft of all innovation
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:48.560]   Here are the guys who are doing the grunt work and there they know what they're doing
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:49.840]   And so I think you know
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.560]   All of this is a really well calculated play
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:58.800]   To sort of put out there that apple is apples in good hands right apples still going to continue innovating
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.920]   It's still going to continue making great products and that's their goal
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:07.280]   I mean, I did I did read the interviews not necessarily expecting
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:11.200]   Anybody to get anything juicy out of any of these people
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:16.240]   I can only imagine that they had armed pr people in a circle around the table
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:20.480]   Well, if you're looking for the slightest twitch from the interviewer that they were about to go
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:24.960]   Seriously seriously off topic into an area that they're really not supposed to go to
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.280]   um that I mean what's what's
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:33.600]   A most of these pieces were all about here is how we feel at apple here's what we believe at apple
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:36.640]   here's what we're trying to go for at apple and
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:40.880]   I'm I I'm not a business reporter. I mean, did you
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:45.760]   Ren do you feel as though that's like a really important thing for them to communicate out there
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:46.240]   I mean
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:51.200]   On some on some level shouldn't the products really speak for themselves if you have to if you have to explain the joke
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:53.280]   Sometimes it's not really a joke
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:56.480]   Yeah, I mean I I agree with what dan said in that
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:04.160]   I think the business community is still obsessed with the fact that steve jobs is no longer the head of the company and therefore apple is doomed
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:08.240]   Uh, they they're not really connecting the idea that oh
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:12.160]   Just because apple's visionary leader isn't at the helm
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:17.200]   Uh, it doesn't mean that apple doesn't have scores of interesting products still ready to go
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:22.560]   And I think these interviews are very much a way to side of position these three as look
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:28.960]   As dan said the company is in good hands and if you don't believe us here is
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:32.800]   Everything we can possibly tell you which is admittedly not much
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:39.600]   But still everything we can possibly tell you about how our company runs and see how it's very similar to the steve jobs era
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:45.040]   See how we honor his policies and see how we have these bright young things
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:49.840]   Craig faderie and and jonie i've aren't they handsome
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:53.840]   Pretty much right
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:57.520]   With the wisdom of gray hair that makes you think that he's not a flake
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:00.080]   Yep, it's green hair by the way
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:03.920]   That's no crisp. I'm still you know
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.880]   That's that's that's a pretty good
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:13.120]   Give him a run for give chris a run for his money and believe me as someone with a little bit folicly challenged department i'm envious
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:19.600]   Uh the the other the the other element of that I suppose is that
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:23.200]   There is a lot of concern misplaced
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:29.280]   Of from uh from the market thinking that well once steve jobs goes well, that's gonna be it because he was the guy who he was the guy who
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:34.240]   He was the cobbler who would build every single set of shoes and he's the one who came up with every single idea
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:39.680]   And then he's the guy who's exacting standards guided apple to the excellence and that's the that's the
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:45.200]   Once once you once you lose that that salt from the steak you've got something very very tough dry and bland left over
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:49.920]   So maybe another part of it is to keep those faces out there to realize that look if something if jonie
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:53.920]   I've god forbid decides he wants to spend more time with his family. We're not going to be totally host here
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:56.400]   We've got two other guys. We're also handsome and smart
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:59.840]   Uh, and if you know that there's we got time to maneuver
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:04.000]   Um, the only the only thing it was it was good to see apple open up like this
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:09.440]   Uh, it was good to see them grant access even under these conditions to such uh high level folks
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:14.800]   Um, the I did have to sort of temper that my my enthusiasm by knowing that you know
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:18.240]   I've got i've got lots of old magazines that i've saved of historical interest
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:24.160]   From from the from the tech world and I can break out a copy of business week where john scully is also
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:29.360]   In the swin the sweater with the apple logo with the collar of this other shirt under navy talking about
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:36.640]   It's not just about features. It's about creating something that's important about changing the world one user at the at a time
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:39.920]   And we all kind of know how that worked out not terribly well
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:42.720]   um, but speaking but speaking of uh
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:48.640]   Steve jobs doubt harry mccracken writing in time and his really great column, uh was
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:55.520]   Addressing a lot of the commentary that's going over gone over the the past couple weeks about how
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:02.160]   A lot of people are excuse me a lot of commentators are speaking about how all the five s isn't innovative enough it isn't transformative
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:08.720]   It's not it's not pivoting the skinny end of the long tail of the hockey stick and a disruptive enough fashion
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:11.920]   Uh, and he makes a really good really good argument
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:18.160]   Uh, which is to say that apple has never really has not really historically been a company that
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:25.600]   blows away the entire world with a device that they've never made before and that no one has ever seen before
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:29.600]   And making it perfect the first time it really they really are an iterative company
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:32.880]   Where uh, it looks like the iphone is a brand new thing
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:38.640]   It is kind of a brand new thing, but it still has a legacy from previous hardware products that came before and every year
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:44.560]   They don't have to replace it with a brand new disruptive iphone. They just have to make the iphone a little bit better
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:46.480]   um
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:51.200]   I mean, I i'm trying when I was reading this I was trying to figure out if the ipad would be the exception to the rule
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:56.000]   Do you have you have any opinion on that dan is that is is apple really just doing an iterative
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:58.800]   Cycle and everything they do or is that just a general sort of thing?
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.800]   No, I I think the iterative
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:06.160]   Cycle is definitely the way that they're structured john group erode a great piece about this in that for us at mac world
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:11.440]   Several years ago that this is how apple rolls, you know, they go they make a thing and then they say how do we make this better?
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:16.640]   Um, and a lot of people have that whole thing with steeve jobs would never have introduced this iphone five s
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:19.040]   It's too. It's too state and you look back
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:24.240]   Well, steve job also introduced the iphone 3g and the iphone 3g s and the iphone 4 right like, you know
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:28.640]   There was a lot of iteration in there. It's not every time that the apple came out on a stage
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:32.400]   They said here's this totally new thing that you're gonna be blown away. I mean
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.680]   uh
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:40.320]   The the macalope our columnist mac world does a great job of pointing out that there is the space between apples innovations is much larger
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:44.960]   Our memory tends to compress those events, but you know, we had the mac in 1984
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:48.880]   I mean the next thing that you could really consider a huge revolution in
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:55.280]   And for apple entering a new product space was the ipod which was 2001. I mean, that's 17 years later
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:51:01.520]   Right and and certainly as time goes by it seems like those those interregnum periods have compressed a little bit
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:04.960]   I mean it was six years later after the ipod that they came out with the iphone
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:08.560]   But it was still then three years before the you know, the ipad came out too
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:14.480]   So it's not as though every single time, you know, maybe people are looking at that and plotting it on a graph and saying well
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:18.640]   Look, they're doubling their speed every 18 months apple releases a new innovative
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:26.720]   Um, you know, there there there's no curve necessarily there it happens to be whenever you know, this product is ready to go
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:29.200]   I think so it's it's a perception
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:36.480]   Issue as so many things we've discussed today are but I don't think that you know, I think harry did a great job of breaking down
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:42.640]   What people see versus what the truth of the matter is that apple really is a company that creates devices
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:47.840]   And then works on sort of smoothing down those edges and getting it to a perfect polished point
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:54.000]   I mean a great example of this to my mind is to look at something like the iMac first introduced in 1998
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:59.680]   Which in many ways is very very similar to the original Macintosh from 1984, right?
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:02.640]   It's the same sort of compact wall in one design
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:10.080]   As I recall it took us all a full day to realize that oh, like there's no floppy drive really should ask about that
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:16.560]   Right, so yeah, but like in some ways there it was about trade-offs and about packing
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:22.800]   You know sort of what is a what's the future of computing into a box in the same way that the Mac was in 1984
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:28.080]   Um, it just looked it looked different and it was updated with the current day's technology at that point
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:33.760]   But that's what apple does, you know, they they realized hey we worked so long on making these Macs and getting them better and better and better
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:38.240]   Let's you know iterate on that a little bit and take this idea of what does it mean to have
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:41.520]   A computing device and I think almost all of the you know
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:47.520]   The interesting thread that links the Mac to the iMac to the iphone to the iPad is this sort of idea of
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:52.560]   What does this device look like and you can almost put all of those on a single slope and say
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:59.280]   Yeah, this is just them sort of figuring out. What is the what is the computing device that you need? So yeah, yeah
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:07.040]   And also I think that both fans and pastors of apple don't understand that apple is not only iterative within its own company
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:15.200]   It's also iterative within the tech industry. I mean, I feel as though if you really want to find out what the next big new apple product is
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:20.640]   Going to be look outside of apple at another product that's kind of successful
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:27.440]   But hasn't really overrun the world quite yet and that's I think that that's what they did with the ipad where they took the net book
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:34.960]   Realize it. Okay, if people are buying these stupid crazy cheap horrible slow unusable computers
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:40.160]   There must be that that's a lesson we can learn about how people are using mobile computers now
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:42.880]   And now we can make one of those but better
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:48.960]   And that's why I think that all these talks about apple doing a watch or fitness device is right on the money
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:51.520]   not only because for instance, we there is a
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:57.360]   95 mac has a piece about uh, how apple has hired away another person from nikey
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:58.720]   uh
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:03.680]   The the former director of essentially their skunk works division nikeys innovation kitchen
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:08.400]   Where they develop new product designs. So yes, okay, more tangible things like that
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:13.280]   But even before that the fact that uh things like the fitbit and nikey fuel are
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:21.600]   Good and popular means that apple is now looking at what would certainly be looking at that and wondering how could we do that only do it in a better way
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:25.520]   So I mean there are companies that they're commentators who think that
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:28.400]   apple invents everything
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.960]   From the from the forehead of god
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:35.840]   And then there are other people who believe that they just are sitting on their own sitting in their own mire here
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:38.560]   But I don't think I really think that's a point that's being missed
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.400]   but what
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:45.280]   Is what it run where is the where are the new ideas coming from now from apple?
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:50.480]   Well, I think you hit the nail on the head in terms of uh in terms of fitness tracking
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:54.240]   I think is a huge market and I do believe that apple sees that I mean
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:58.800]   tim cook's been photographed what wearing a fuel band around his wrist multiple times and
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:05.280]   I'm honestly surprised that you don't see him pull up his sleeve and he has like one of each kind of tracker and they're like
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:08.320]   Obsessively studying how can we make this better?
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:12.800]   Uh, but the m I mean the m7 pro sauce uh co-processor is really really
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:19.760]   It's an interesting addition to the device that I don't think anyone saw coming despite fitness tracking being so popular
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:23.920]   Um, it and I think it shows that apple is really on the ball in that area
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:28.720]   And the different sensor in the iphone 5s is another thing that kind of you know
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:34.080]   People have been room-wearing about it for about a in the last two years ever since that patent application came out
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:39.920]   Um, but everybody kind of you know rolls their eyes at fingerprint sensors because oh, it's it's very, you know
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:45.760]   Very mid 90s spy technology and fingerprint sensors can be hacked by gummy bears, right?
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:51.280]   And no one really uses those and they're big and clunky and they just take pictures of your photo in your fingerprint
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:53.520]   uh and apple's
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:58.720]   Found a way to integrate it into their newest phone that doesn't feel clunky that doesn't feel
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:03.040]   Annoying it doesn't make you worried about your security at least not too much
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:04.320]   um
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:05.600]   and
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:08.720]   It also has the added side effect, you know, it's it's not
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:12.080]   Super seamless like there there are still efforts
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:15.280]   Like I have an iphone 5s and I got one on launch day
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:20.320]   And I found there are places in there that still definitely need to be iterated upon
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:27.440]   But it's so many leagues better than any fingerprint sensor. I've ever seen in terms of especially consumer level
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:29.920]   um just in terms of
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:33.520]   Simply easily recognizing your print having a good backup sensor
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:34.480]   um
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:40.400]   Incorporating it into the os for things like app purchasing because god knows most of us have crazy
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:47.360]   passwords now for our iCloud and having to tap that in just like multiple capital letters and you know
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:51.760]   Random symbols all to try and on the name of security
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:56.400]   To be able to do that just with your fingerprint to be able to unlock your phone is is
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:59.840]   Tremendous. It's it's a really cool innovation from them
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:04.160]   Um, and I wasn't really expecting them to to integrate it in quite that way
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:08.000]   So are you still are you still using it still relying on it?
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.680]   Yeah, actually, you know
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:13.760]   It took me about a day to really get into it and to be honest
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:19.200]   The thing that forced me like I was kind of like I have to not tap in my passcode because it's habit
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:24.800]   I've been I've had a passcode since the 3g, you know or yeah something like that where I'm just you know
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:28.080]   I'm like slide tap slide tap. Um
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:31.120]   So I set a
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:33.120]   25 character password
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:40.880]   To force myself to basically be like yes, this is a password that will be very hard for somebody to break in um
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.520]   But it also forces me to be like, oh, right. I can use my fingers
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:50.080]   And once I did that it was it became almost instant kind of like all right
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:56.240]   You just tap and hold and it's it's so seamless. It makes me it makes opening my phone
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:01.680]   So easy to do especially in the car if like if my navigation has you know
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:06.720]   My lock screen's gone to sleep and you can only see if you're using maps like the little tiny
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:12.800]   Square of where your GPS location currently is. I'll just thumb print it so that I can go
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:19.120]   Immediately to the overview and maps and I can just I thumbprint and then I make one tap and then I can see the entire map
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:26.400]   Um on my iPhone as my GPS rather than just that little tiny, you know, five by five square of information
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:33.200]   So there's there's there's a lot of really neat uses. Um, I this what I was going to say is um
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:41.040]   They still quite haven't got app purchases with the fingerprint down. I think or maybe they're doing it intentionally that
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:44.800]   You when you wake up you have to enter in your password
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:46.000]   um
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:52.400]   Your apple id naturally because if they if you're for some reason your phone goes to sleep and then get stolen
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:56.320]   You don't want to be able to try and hack through that. Um
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:59:02.080]   But in addition I seem to get like I'll get random password requests that can't be thumbprint
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:10.480]   Uh that can't be waived aside by the thumbprint and sometimes I'll ask I'll get a password request followed by a thumbprint request
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:15.520]   Which is really which is really odd. Um, I I wonder if that's somewhat
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:23.200]   In you know, that's somewhat intentional by apple that they actually want you to have a pseudo two-step authentication
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:26.560]   But they haven't really made it clear and that's the one thing that frustrates me
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:29.440]   It's like I wouldn't mind entering both a password and my fingerprint
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:33.840]   But I don't know when I'm supposed to and when it's just supposed to be fingerprint and it's a
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:37.520]   Still still some bugs to work out, but I'm I'm really liking it
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:43.920]   I think part of it is the importance of reminding people that this the the thumbprint is not the one level of security inside your phone
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:48.720]   You still have to have a good passcode. You still have to keep so you still have to keep rotating that in and out
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:53.440]   Uh, and I mean I had the I had the I had sort of a weird experience
[00:59:53.520 --> 01:00:00.800]   When the first time that I was started using iOS 7 full time on on the iPhone that I found that I could not remember
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:05.680]   My passcode because my my I I've been using it for about a month
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:11.680]   It was down to muscle memory and so without those square buttons on the iOS 7 passcode
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:16.240]   I could not remember it. I when you when you show me round buttons centered in the screens
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:20.240]   I suddenly had to sound out in my brain what the numbers actually were
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:26.960]   So it's it's the worst thing that could possibly happen is if you start authenticating byometrically so
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:33.520]   So so often that you forget the actual secure method of of locking up your phone
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:41.200]   Dan before we go off that third Dan are you are using a fingerprint authentication? I mean, but I'm curious
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.240]   I'm really curious to see
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:48.160]   I'm sure everybody's gonna enable it and try it. I'm curious to see how many people will have left it on after about a month
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:53.040]   I think it's good enough you could do that but I'm wondering if like like Ryan said sometimes you're wondering why
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:57.520]   Way, I just gave you fingerprint authentication. Why are you asking for my passcode again?
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:02.400]   Uh, it doesn't take too many bad situations for people to say okay
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:05.920]   They're they're a switch that says please never annoy me with my fingerprint ever again
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:11.520]   I I actually don't have a 5s so sadly no passcode for me
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:16.320]   I keep pressing my phone against my iPhone 5, but it doesn't doesn't do anything. This makes me sad
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:18.320]   So sad
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:24.320]   I have used yours and I and I used one at the demo area at the iPhone introduction last month
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:29.200]   Um, I think it's an interesting idea and I I think it's probably
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:35.680]   The biggest possible boon for this I think is the fact that if you have an iPhone with a fingerprint sensor
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:37.920]   You still have to send that passcode which means that
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:43.520]   All the people who don't use passcodes will have to enable one if they want to use this cool new wizzy feature
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:46.960]   Some might opt not to use it as you're as you're saying
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:50.240]   But I think that a lot of people the people who want to buy a 5s anyways
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:56.480]   That will be part of the impetus behind it is is using that fingerprint sensor because it's it's nifty and it's new
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:01.600]   Um, and I think you know, there've been some really great points about the fingerprint sensor
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:04.480]   Especially in regards to the people who hacked it. It's very easily hacked
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:09.440]   You just need like several hours and you're putting it to make fake fingerprints simple simple
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:13.040]   Um, but the point is and hopefully the person you're trying to hack will like
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:19.120]   Billingly like give you nice clear prints. Yeah, could you just press against this wine glass next time?
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:21.200]   You know, it's very very James Bondi
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:24.240]   Let's play fun print tic-tac-toe you start
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:29.680]   Could you just touch this glass pane I happen to have with me? That would be great. Thank you
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:35.920]   Um, I think that the the the great point lots of people made after that event, you know, it's a sort of calm people down was look
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:38.080]   It's not a question of whether
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:41.200]   This is you know the ultimate most secure way to secure your phone
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:46.640]   It's really a question of is it a good alternative to what most people doing and most people are doing nothing
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:48.400]   They don't have a passcode, right?
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:52.080]   And in that sense the fingerprint, you know securing your phone with the fingerprint is
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.880]   an immeasurable number of times better because
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:59.280]   It means that someone still can't just walk up to your phone and swipe to unlock it
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:06.480]   And honestly, you know, the idea of that being hacked is not as much a worry as even somebody seeing your passcode, right?
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:13.120]   Like it's it's roughly on par. It's it's easier for them to watch you watch you enter your passcode and see the numbers light up as you
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.600]   Tap them in because I always have it makes that really easy
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.880]   Then it is for them to figure out how to fake your fingerprint, right?
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:24.960]   And I think you know the overall goal is to keep your phone secure because you have so much data on your phone these days
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:30.000]   That could be used to do nasty things your emails your photos all of that
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   um, and I think it's it's valiant for apple to try and
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:39.120]   and impose a little bit of of revolution in this area in terms of getting people to
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:45.600]   Take you know actually work proactively for their security and and and my boss Jason Snell made a great argument
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:47.840]   That's very much like time machine was backups were
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:53.680]   Complicated and unsexy and all that stuff when you went when you wanted to back up your computer
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:59.600]   But so many people lost data because they didn't have a backup so apple, you know decided we're gonna make a system that makes it easy
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.320]   You can argue about whether or not time machine
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:05.440]   Accomplish that but it certainly made people a lot more cognizant of backups
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:11.600]   And I think the fingerprint sensor is is a great move in the same direction is it's making people more aware that okay
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:18.160]   I should be securing my phone in some way and a op passcode might be annoying, but maybe a fingerprint sensor is not so bad
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.560]   Um, so I I think it'll catch on especially
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:23.040]   Next year will be interesting to see how
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:29.360]   Whatever models of iphone apple introduces at that point how widespread the fingerprint sensor is if it makes it down to sort of a lower
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:32.160]   Cost model of phone. I think that'll be really really interesting
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:38.160]   Yeah, we do need things to be cool even when the thing we're being tricked into doing isn't our best interest
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:45.040]   Like I've said before that I didn't really get interested in energy efficient driving until I got this little gadget for my dashboard
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:50.960]   That now the high score the high score of my mpg is basically the the crux of the video game
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:57.760]   I'm playing every time I get behind it with the wheel and so yes now I am I am the loser doing like 64
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:02.880]   Miles per hour in the right lane of the highway not going above the speed limit
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:07.520]   Not because I'm not because I want to drive safely because I need to beat 32 miles ago
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:12.240]   And I did I did 31.5 four months ago on this run. I know I could do 32
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:15.600]   But speaking of cool technologies
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:21.520]   There is a couple of bits of news that remind us that probably the next really cool thing component
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:24.160]   We're going to be seeing over the next year is going to be bluetooth low energy
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:32.640]   It's in the fitbit device. It's that super super super critical low power bluetooth that lets you have this radio going on for just
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:38.880]   From today until roughly three days before the biblical apocalypse running on one button cell battery
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:46.480]   A couple of bits of news the latest update apparently to the apple tv now let's you configure it by
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:50.800]   Now the reports say by touching an ios 7 device to it
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:57.520]   Because it's you know how much fun it is to use that little like stick a gum remote to tap in your wi-fi passwords
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:00.160]   And your your ightunes accounts and stuff like that
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:04.480]   But if you actually look closely when you set up there is actually a little thing on the bottom the saying
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:10.160]   Oh, if you have an ios 7 device that's configured just tap it onto the on to the apple tv and it will configure itself automatically
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:14.560]   It's not actually the tap that does it. It's the fact that your your iphone is now within like
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:18.560]   10 inches of the apple tv that it will make that connection and
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:21.040]   Transmogrify all of your data
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:24.240]   Another neat bit of information that
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:29.520]   MLB major league baseball has a new uh, mlb at the ball park app
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:34.080]   Of they did a demonstration of what they could do with ibeacons
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:40.480]   Uh at major league ballparks. They set up a service like that at city field the home of the new york mex
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:45.280]   Uh, so that when you get off the sub the way it works that when you get off the subway if you launch this app
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:48.800]   It knows that okay, so you've got your your your head for the field
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:52.560]   So here's how you get here's the directions from the subway to the field once you are
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:58.560]   Passed by another beacon like at the entrance it sees that okay, you've got it'll activate passbook get your tickets out
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:05.520]   You'll be able to validate your tickets and then show you oh, here's your where your seat is within the ball park and because there are these little super low power
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:10.560]   Location beacons throughout the ball park it will guide you exactly to that right place
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:16.800]   When it thinks that you could use a couple beers it will just it'll it'll direct you to the beer card once you drunk 10 beers
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:22.960]   You'll get a coupon for four more beers because this is uh baseball and it's a slow game. You need some chemical chemical amusement
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:24.640]   um
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:28.400]   It looks really great. It's only a a demo they've done for one ball park
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:32.400]   The Mets apparently are thinking about doing it for the 2014 series season
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:38.320]   I I don't know what to think about it because I like it. I've always loved this idea of ibeacons
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:41.200]   Which is a feature supported by ios 7
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:46.640]   I wish apple would be a little bit more forthcoming about how open they intend to be with the technology
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:52.480]   Because it's one thing to make a ball park better for people who have iphones
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:57.600]   I would think that they would want to make it better for everybody and I'm worried about apple
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:02.480]   Continuing to promote these technologies that are exclusive just to uh just to apple
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:08.240]   Not only because it leads to a more insular, you know closed off sort of society
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:12.880]   But also that sometimes they don't work as well as something that's open. Um, I had an experience
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:18.480]   Just yesterday as a matter of fact where I need to move a file a photo off of the iphone 5
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:25.200]   5s onto another device and because again, man kind is born under trouble just as surely as the sparks fly upward
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:29.440]   uh tethering it to my desktop and uh blue and uh
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:35.280]   Synchronizing it over was not going to work well. Uh, and I tried to use i'm sorry. I'm sorry. This was be
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:42.000]   To I will not i've already shown i've already started off the show with one comedy of errors of things not going right
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.880]   I won't go into the second one of why it became important for me to transfer a photo from one phone to another phone
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:50.400]   Uh, but okay great airdrop that will work just that will work just fine
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:54.560]   Oh, wait. No, that's an apple only product and to get it off of the apple product onto this other device
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:09:00.800]   And I could easily move it between any multiples of these mold devices. I have via bluetooth good old fashion
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:06.880]   Low tech but reliable open, uh, excuse me open enough that's it's built into every device bluetooth
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:08.800]   And the fact that
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:14.640]   My iphone did not have that ability but every other device I had could i'm sorry
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:19.520]   I should i should i should kind of write these things out before I start talking that the problem was that
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:21.920]   I needed to get individual sample photos
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:28.080]   Testing the iphone five s camera and as and for doing so was taking comparison photos with like five different cameras including the
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:32.640]   Camera phones including the five s I didn't want to have to just tether each one of them and slur for me to i
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:38.480]   Adaputure. I just wanted to import each one individually and because uh, the my laptop supports
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:43.280]   My macbook supports bluetooth and all these other phones will support bluetooth easy pz no problem
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:46.320]   Air sharing however did not work
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:48.720]   Didn't work of between those two devices
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:53.200]   It also would not have worked under anything other than an iphone to another iphone at this point
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:57.760]   Not until mavericks comes out and even so I was I was in the airport last week
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:02.560]   Trying to move a move a picture from the five s to the five c that I was testing
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:07.280]   And the things are actually touching like one hand here one hand here
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:12.400]   It could not connect even though it could see each other and once again. This is not a problem I've ever had with bluetooth
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.160]   um
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:15.680]   I
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:22.960]   Apple can only improve things when they the apple feels as though they can improve things the best when they control the entire solution from one end to another
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:25.360]   but shouldn't they be a little bit more
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:32.160]   Shouldn't they join the pool where all the other kids are splashing about instead of having their own little walled off area where they feel
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:37.360]   So they can have total control of everything are are they limiting what they can do and what their users can do Ren?
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:41.840]   Well, I don't know um
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:44.720]   I think that
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:48.160]   Keeping uh keeping it limited and keeping it together
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:54.640]   Uh allows them to have more freedom and playing around with the ideas that they're interested in you know
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:59.600]   Like with iBekins iBekins is technically an open source techno or not necessarily open source
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:01.680]   but it's technically a bluetooth technology
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:02.880]   um
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:06.960]   That enables a lot of you know that that's been there's been around for uh
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:10.320]   The last year or so with bluetooth 4.0
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:15.440]   And apple is basically just taking advantage of it with a different sort of set of code
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:18.000]   Um when it comes to things like airdrop
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.360]   It would be really really nice to have airdrop say work between your mac and your phone, but I suspect
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:28.800]   I mean right now i'm still having problems getting my ipad and my iphone to connect with airdrop
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:34.880]   uh, I suspect that uh when they're playing with uh this combination of of
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:37.440]   uh bluetooth and wi-fi
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:41.920]   They're just they don't have it to where they need to be and as a result
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:46.080]   They don't want to necessarily open it up until they've got an ironclad
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:52.320]   Uh, we've heard you know similar sort of ventures of oh, we're going to make face time open source
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.960]   Uh, and that still hasn't happened and I have to wonder
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:12:03.040]   If part of that is we don't feel like face time is strong enough to exist outside of our platform and we don't want to
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:10.480]   Launch it broadly and then have it fail miserably because we've seen how that happens with say iCloud
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:17.200]   It says sometimes they can they can control things end to end and they still make a dog's dinner out of it
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:21.760]   Dan, I mean what are
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:25.840]   Should we be happy about the introduction of another technology that
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:31.120]   We can use within the family, but maybe not inviting people outside the family to use it
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:39.440]   It's it's always a tough proposition. I think because there is definitely something to that end to end philosophy of we can control all the variables
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:42.080]   Um, but at the same time it can be frustrating
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:46.960]   Uh, both when that doesn't work because you feel like oh it really should work if they can control everything
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:52.560]   And also when that that really got me honked off with with airdrop saying I
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:58.000]   You have your front. Unfortunately, I was in public if I was inside my office. I would be talking to these things here
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.400]   See each other. You are in proximity. You should be able to talk
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:06.000]   You have the same daddy who programmed you know talking
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.920]   Uh, but the the other half of that is the the idea that
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:14.160]   It is frustrating to have these increasing number of closed systems and into my mind
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:20.000]   A great example that is iMessage, um, which is is you know, it has its ups and downs
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:25.840]   But it works pretty well and I appreciate the idea that you know, I can I can text with my friends
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:29.680]   And you know, it doesn't cost me anything because the telco carriers are not you know
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:33.200]   Causing me to pay out through my nose for text messages
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:37.760]   Um, but at the same time if I want a text message somebody who's on an android phone or a windows phone
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:41.200]   And I I do have some friends left. I mean, I don't know if I can call them good friend
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:44.160]   No, I use some friends left who are used those those platforms
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:49.760]   Um, it's frustrating to be like, well, why doesn't why don't why isn't there a standard?
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:54.480]   Oh, there is a standard is tech messaging but then the cell phone carriers could take advantage of us
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:59.280]   So it is it is annoying to have this fragmentation issue of all these different
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:05.840]   Technologies that don't necessarily talk to each other, especially when they're based on ideas that seem simple enough that they should work
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:13.760]   Um, but I don't know the I'd be I'd be can specifically I haven't certainly seen enough of it yet to know how well that's going to play
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:15.760]   and whether it's an issue that
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:22.880]   Uh, not having the ability to do that on multiple platforms really runs into problems, but it is also a question of adoption to me
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.080]   I mean
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:29.120]   I think apple having a technology like this and promulgating it so heavily heavily means
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:34.480]   It's more attractive because it's one company that can go to major league baseball and say hey
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:38.880]   Here's this technology we're working on and we really think it'd be cool if we could roll it out and pile it in this way
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:41.920]   Whereas if you're dealing with an open source technology, I feel like in some ways
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:48.240]   It's harder to get the the critical mass you need in order to actually see it adopted
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:51.200]   You might see a cool technology and think oh, this is really nifty
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:58.000]   Um, but it doesn't catch on enough because of the the platforms that it might be on and apple obviously certainly has
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.800]   its own
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:05.360]   Problems adopting technologies that are open and available to many people
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:06.400]   Um
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:10.880]   So I I think that you know having a company like apple that's that's prominent enough to say look
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:16.320]   We're 100 behind this we're putting it into every product that we have makes a convincing argument when they want to go to
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:19.280]   You know major league baseball and say we want to try this out
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:23.600]   But it's a little a little bit harder if it's if it's maybe you know android
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:30.000]   Um if it's a platform that's or or it's a third party that comes up and says we want to make this available on all our platforms
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.240]   You have to really wait to see the buy-in
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:36.240]   It's never going to be a success for third party promotes it, but you you also think about
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:44.960]   The effects that uh how what a good job apple did to support wifi in the early days by when it's certainly it's a universal standard
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:46.400]   but
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:53.520]   Wireless was an interesting thing that they didn't that the makers that the world didn't really know what there's what's going to happen with
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:59.520]   When apple went all in and saying nope, we're gonna have here's our wireless browser. Here's our here's our wireless loan books
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:01.840]   Here's where here we are absolutely 100 percent behind this
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:08.160]   I think that sort of encouraged other companies to also buy into it and also make this into the standard that it is
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:10.000]   I mean wifi is no good
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:16.240]   Unless it is the same standard every coffee shop every library every office every private home that you go into
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:20.640]   at the other time. I mean it's it's it's such an interesting calculus because
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:22.400]   um
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:25.840]   Apple can get ibeacons into malls and into stores and into
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:30.560]   Into ballparks and stadiums partly because they can make the case that look
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:35.760]   We are like an aspirational brand the people who are coming with iPhones are people who have money
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:41.200]   And they are probably going to have money to spend at your place and they're going to be buying your eight dollar hotdog
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:43.920]   Your 14 dollar cup of a cup of cup of coffee
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:48.480]   If you wire up your if you basically make this into a friendly place for for iphone users
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:50.320]   uh, so
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:57.040]   It's it's again. I guess I just want us all to come together and sing and and and and dance around the mayfair pole and that sort of stuff
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:03.840]   Um, I will also dan. I mean, I I think that we're good friends, but I again be use I am an I also an android user
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:09.760]   But if I'm not when you're close friends, that's that's fine. Sorry when I'm too. I never get your eye messages. That's fine
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:11.680]   That's fine
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:13.680]   Haven't heard from you. Oh, that's right. You're saying that's sad
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:18.240]   How many this this this should be the next tom hanks sally field movie
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:20.240]   Like
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:26.000]   If only nor ephron were still here to say that oh unfortunately I changed I changed cell phone providers or I changed operating systems
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:31.840]   I thought that you had died or you were met you were mad at me. It was just because you were using a an insular
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:34.480]   operating system that doesn't support open standards
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:37.120]   Because your plastered by who went out of business
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:40.880]   Co-sponsored by the front your foundation. Oh, that's right
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:43.200]   Poor blackberry
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:45.360]   Oh, man. It's like it's it's it's
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:50.480]   I'm what we need we need to get to uh our next ad and then to our picks of the week, but let's just
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:54.080]   We we're not even gonna make fun of blackberry anymore
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:57.680]   Because it's a moment of silence. We could we could pour out the black
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:04.080]   I mean at least at least palm had the like it was taken out to the back of the shed the farmer had the shotgun
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:08.640]   Palm was told to look out into the field and imagine
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:15.120]   And that feeling that that cool cool grass between its paws and then it was all over with and like one fraction of a second
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:21.520]   Blackberry has just been the world has essentially taken out to that way let it loosen a field and then driven off
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:23.680]   It's not it's not a pleasant thing to look at
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:29.040]   Uh, we will be back with our picks of the week after leo has something to say about our friends at square space
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:37.120]   Okay, let me interrupt just a bit. Thank you, Andy. Uh going to talk a little bit about squarespace.com. What a great place

[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:54.320]   Super pro super gorgeous
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:19:00.480]   Photographers and artists love it because their portfolios look so good on squarespace, but you don't have to spend a lot of time

[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:57.200]   Content is completely separate from template. So you can switch around try it play with it
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:02.000]   You drag those sliders around if you're a code or if you know javascript and html or
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:10.800]   CSS they have a great developers platform, but you don't have to use that to get a unique gorgeous site import all your social media links

[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:21.040]   weekly
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:25.040]   Like you leo from September 6 2013
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:29.600]   We know that he was alive and well september 6 2013. I'm sorry
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:36.080]   If you're listening to he had a lcd like atomic clock in the background so you know exactly when he prerecorded that
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:42.400]   I could not help it as a fan of colombo. I really I see a squarespace great sponsor great product
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:44.720]   I've heard the I've heard the ad copy before so i'm looking at this
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:50.800]   I'm thinking I bet that that would be a good payoff for a colombo episode where the murderer uses that as his alibi saying
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:54.560]   Why couldn't have been in I couldn't have been in florida because I was in my studio recording this
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:22:01.840]   And he thought he was so clever because he like changed the date and the time to to cover himself then colombo's I couldn't help but notice
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:07.520]   You also have the phases that's one of those fancy clocks. Oh boy. What a wonderful clock
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:10.160]   But it also shows you the phases of the moon
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:17.360]   I don't know why you think that there was a quarter moon on that date because according to my friend. It was a half moon
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:19.920]   I think that's good evidence leo, don't you
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:28.800]   Thank you very much. I also do with my president nixon and also I do the full suite of 1979 friars club rooster
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:31.920]   impersonations great
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:35.440]   About that time for picks of the week or serenity. What is your pick of the week?
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:42.400]   Oh boy. Um, well my pick of the week is uh an app and a service called loom
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:50.400]   Um, it is really really awesome. I think I I talked about its wonders to you and the last time that we had dinner
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:55.600]   Um, I I really enjoy it. I'm yeah, that's great. That's fantastic
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:23:02.000]   Yeah, so loom for people who have never heard of it is basically a way for you to
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:10.160]   Uh store all of your photos whether they're on your iPhone your ipad your ipoto library random folders on your computer
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:16.400]   Have them all accessible at high resolution online. Um, and as well as uh
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:25.280]   Resolution on your iphone or ipad so I can browse my entire iPhoto library stored in the cloud and download
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:30.720]   A high resolution photo from my iphone, but I don't necessarily see the high resolution photos when i'm just
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:36.800]   Slipping through it. It just delivers the version of the photo. That's right for my device
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:41.440]   So if i'm viewing it on a non retina ipad mini it delivers
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:49.200]   Um, like a 2000 by something resolution photo and then if i'm viewing it on my iphone, it will deliver a slightly higher resolution
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:52.720]   Uh, which is really really awesome. The apps work really well
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:59.760]   Um, the plans are actually fairly reasonable for storing all of your photos. I think I pay something like 50 bucks a year
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:02.320]   Uh to store
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:04.560]   Uh, is it 50 or 100 gigabytes something like that?
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:08.640]   It's enough to store my entire library, which is fairly comprehensive of photos
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:17.840]   And it also supports organization, which is something that you know competing services like everpix has a limited amount of organization that you can do with it
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:21.040]   Um, and but everpix is also limited by you know
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:26.080]   Only being able to upload jpgs and loom will upload your videos loom will upload screenshots
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:30.880]   Uh, I really I really dig it and I think people should should give it a try
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:38.480]   Yeah, I mean, I I love it. I'm really grateful you uh, you brought my attention because it's it really is like photo stream only
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:42.080]   It's a much better articulation of that idea. It's uh, I
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:44.080]   It's
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:49.760]   If i've have a photo it's there in loom. I know that I can use it in a I can access it in a useful way on the device that I have
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:53.040]   Uh, and so it's it's it's just a great service
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:54.720]   Um
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:56.560]   Dan, what do you have for us?
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:57.920]   Got a game
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:01.520]   Uh, I I I am a big fan of board games
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:08.560]   I think everybody should be a big fan of board games and one of the great things I think about the ipad is that it's really well suited
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:12.800]   As a device for playing and adapting board games into a digital form
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:15.760]   And so my pick is a game called small world
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:20.560]   Um, which is made by days of wonder who are the same guys who make ticket to ride, which is another
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:25.760]   Excellent adaptation, but small world is really cool. It's basically a board game
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:29.840]   It's a little bit like a not quite like a risk, but it has like a territory control aspect to it
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:32.080]   But you play as all these different fantasy races
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:39.040]   So orcs or goblins or elves or wizards and you sort of go across the board and you try to claim little areas of territory
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:43.040]   Um and take on all these other different races
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:47.040]   Um, they just updated within the last I think it was last month
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:51.120]   Um, and they finally added asynchronous online play for multiple people
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:54.240]   So this is awesome for me. I've been playing against several of my friends
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:26:01.200]   Um, and so you can do turn by turn stuff. Um, you can have multiple players going you get a little push notification when it's your turn
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:03.520]   Um, they've done a great job of building in
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:11.280]   All the stuff that makes the the actual board game so much fun without all the little little cardboard tiles and pieces that you invariably lose
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:13.280]   Or have to organize in some way
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:18.400]   Um, and it's it's just a lot of fun and it has this really neat mechanic which I which I like
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:25.360]   Um in which basically you go through multiple races within the course of a game because you put one of your races in decline
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:30.160]   Which is sort of like that race has sort of died out, but then you come in as a blunt as a brand new race
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:36.800]   Um, and so there's a lot of different strategy. Um, you also have this really cool mix and match aspect where each race comes with a power
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:39.280]   And they're two independent
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:46.800]   Uh things so every game is slightly different because you end up with a different combination of race and power and so it changes the strategy so much that there's
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:51.680]   Uh, the games are almost all very very different and of course you can also play against the computer
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:55.200]   You can play locally with a pass and play or even on the same device
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:59.600]   Which is I really enjoy for if you happen to have a few minutes where you're sitting at the airport or something
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:05.440]   You can just pull out your your iPad and you know sit down for the person across from you and just play a game right there
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:11.040]   So it's a lot of fun. I enjoy the board game version as well, but this is a more cost-effective version
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:15.440]   How easy is it to jump into it like if you haven't played the game before
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:20.880]   I think it's pretty good. They I believe they have a built-in tutorial, which we might be seeing a little bit of on the screen right now
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:26.640]   Um, it's it's one of those games that it probably takes a little bit of time to figure out as you're first learning to play
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:31.120]   But it's actually not too bad and and I think once you've learned to play it
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:35.040]   You know, you can play a game online. I think in 10 minutes or so
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:41.200]   So it's it really is one of those games that especially if we're playing against the computer because the computer doesn't spend all that time thinking hmm
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:46.240]   Where should I go the computer just goes? So if you uh, you get pretty efficient at it as it goes along
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:48.320]   Excellent
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:52.160]   My pick of the week is an app that I've used all the time on the Mac
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:59.360]   And the version of it for iOS 7 on the iPad is a transformatively much better experience
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:03.600]   It's omni-outliner, which was which was an early release for the iPad
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:06.720]   But it was sort of kneecapped by apples
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:12.240]   Kind of casual and and casual lack of support for keyboards on the iPad
[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:16.160]   So you if you've used outliner apps before you know that
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:23.280]   You can really blow through taking notes and organizing your thoughts and information as you acquire it simply by tab commands
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:27.120]   Command commands hoisting things up, uh making things of
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:36.160]   Daughters of the previous subjects and you can really just as you go organize and and and create a really nicely formatted and present presented document
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:40.000]   But with the iPad it really didn't work for me because
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:46.960]   The iOS 6 and iOS 5 didn't allow you to really have a developers to access really the keyboard in any sort of significant way
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:54.080]   Uh, iOS 7 however has new support where now developers can add keyboard shortcuts for almost anything that they want to do
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:59.920]   So now the exact same keyboard commands that that's available on the desktop version of omni-outliner is also available
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:02.160]   on the iPad version of it
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:05.200]   And yes, if you're using it without a bluetooth keyboard, it's also
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:09.920]   Just as useful. It's it's a nice sort of understated interface
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:12.240]   Interpreterpreation of a iOS 7
[01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:14.480]   It's very very clean very very crisp
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:18.800]   But for me as someone who uses the iPad as a main computer when i'm outside the office
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:23.440]   I've been waiting for omni-outliner to get this update for just years and years and years
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:29.680]   Um, it is on for like many iOS 7 apps. It is a paid upgrade
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:34.080]   Uh because of limitations of the app store, but i use omni-outliners so
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:40.560]   So frequently that and i'm kind of almost happy to have an opportunity to give them extra another 20 30 bucks every two or three years
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:44.160]   So omni-outliner for the for ipad from the omni group
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:49.360]   And that is it for this week. Let's say goodbye and thanks to our guests this week
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:56.640]   Dan laurin you're at mac world what's cool hot happening with it and disco fight for mac world this week
[01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:58.400]   Uh, well, of course
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:04.720]   We still got all sorts of continuing coverage of iOS 7 and the brand new iphones will tell you everything about them
[01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:09.520]   The one no including the things that apple hasn't already told you and i imagine coming up
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:13.120]   We'll have some coverage of those new iMacs that got released last week
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:15.760]   Along with anything else apple cares to release
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:18.320]   this fall
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:21.600]   Yeah, you're with the dan freaks and you the upcoming stuff this week
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:27.280]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, different and i did it did a rundown of what you might still expect from apple before the year is out
[01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:32.800]   So yep, i'll read that yesterday did it come out. It was it was it was in it was in my feedley
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:36.480]   That is good. You must consume everything
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:43.120]   Exactly. Well, i'm a fan you may you may be an iphone user and i may be a lowly android user, but still i appreciate your work
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:53.680]   Renee, what are you up to? They would like to plug to the audience. Oh gosh. Well our iOS 7 upgrade guide is currently out on the iBook store for
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:57.600]   People who can access iBooks author, which right now is just the ipad
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:01.680]   But the mac will be coming soon when os 10 mavericks is released and we're gonna have that
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:07.840]   That book available for the iphone and kindle and your other major devices in the next couple weeks
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:14.880]   And we're also just about ready to release our iphone 5 starter or 5c and 5s
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:16.560]   Starter guide
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:23.280]   Which is packed full of some fun videos how to use information on how to use and get the most out of your new iphone
[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:27.280]   Which i've been working on for the last couple months and and so has dan
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:29.680]   So keep an eye out for that on the iphone store
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:35.280]   Cool. I really dig mac world's iBooks. It's like you see you see
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:40.160]   Other publishers do books where the content is there and it's perfectly fine
[01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:44.720]   But they're clearly not trying to solve problems. They're trying to work within limitations of iBooks author
[01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:49.200]   But you your books just have a really nice flair and polish that i really appreciate
[01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:57.760]   Aw, thank you, Andy. Oh, you're welcome. Thanks so much for joining us. Thank you for listening now get back to work because break time is over
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:02.960]   Come on just because the government is shut down doesn't mean that business cries to a halt
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:14.400]   *music*
