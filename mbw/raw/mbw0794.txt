[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, Andy, Renee, and Alex are here.
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.600]   Lots to talk about, the rumors about Apple's AR headset coming in a year.
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.000]   We can talk about that.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.720]   The NSL Group looks like they've compromised another iPhone user, at least according to
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.680]   Apple, a fine for Apple in Italy.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.880]   Does anybody care?
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.440]   And a new look at the Swift Playgrounds 4.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.680]   It looks pretty awesome.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.400]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.680]   It's time for MacBreak Weekly, the show where you cover the latest news from Apple, of which
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.920]   there is very little.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.920]   But there's some.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.920]   It's the year end.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.160]   Apple has things to say.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.280]   YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie brings us the Renee Ritchie show.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.280]   Hello Renee.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.840]   They're an A Ritchie show by Renee Ritchie, written and directed by Renee Ritchie, produced
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.800]   by Renee Ritchie, starring Renee Ritchie.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.800]   It's all about you.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.800]   It's all about you.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.720]   It's easy when you have no collaborators.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.440]   You must be at some getting close to the point where you'd hire some help.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.440]   Yeah?
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.840]   I was thinking of maybe starting a second series just based on Apple Facts where it would be
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.840]   much easier.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.320]   The thing is I know exactly in every keynote where the exact moment I need for the video
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.680]   is, and that's just so fast for me to do it that it's hard to hand that off, but I'm
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.680]   getting closer.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.680]   Yeah.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.680]   Yeah.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:45.760]   Also here, Andy, hear that, Ko, who has zero help even at making his Thanksgiving meal.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.920]   Many people have said I could use some help or get help is what they've been advising
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.920]   me.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.920]   So I don't know.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.520]   I mean, I can't imagine anybody else writing part of the Renee Ritchie show.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.760]   I mean, there's one star in Renee Ritchie production that's Renee Ritchie.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:06.440]   So it's the star of the Andy and Aiko show and also from Office Hours.Global, which
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.520]   is an ensemble piece.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.120]   So I can't say the star, but certainly the man, the major D, your host.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.800]   I like to call it Chief Troublemaker.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.640]   Chief Troublemaker Alex Lindsay.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.640]   Hello, Alex.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.480]   It's good to be here.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.200]   Everybody have a good, you didn't have a holiday.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.200]   I know, Renee.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.120]   So I'll leave you out, but you guys have a good Thanksgiving holiday.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.600]   Hi, Suvitz.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.600]   It's tricky.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.800]   Oh, yes.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.800]   The whole thing.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.800]   The Andy to two.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.800]   Yep.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.800]   Two Suvitz.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.920]   Now, now I remember you said you're going to cut it up, Andy.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.760]   Did you cut it up, Alex?
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.920]   Yeah, I cut mine up.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.480]   I cut mine up into, I fitted it into two Suvitz as well.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.160]   The last time last year I did it in three, but that was like a 20 pound turkey.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.200]   That was when I went to 17 pounds and I found that 17 pound turkey will fit into two Suvitz
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.480]   quite nicely.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.240]   And so I seasoned it, threw it in there and left it there for a couple hours.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.240]   It's quite good.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.240]   Very nice.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.240]   Very nice.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:07.640]   I just made one big mistake where, so I had like a, I had enough that I put aside some
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.200]   for Tisouvie later, so I bagged up two, like so I could bag up one for Thanksgiving, another
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.520]   one for like a second, like second breakfast, like second Thanksgiving on Saturday.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:23.720]   I made the terrible, terrible mistake though of googling for, well, what's the FDA say about
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.440]   actual like, how long can I store like raw turkey in the refrigerator?
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.760]   And I said, oh, well, no, no, one to two days, but two days max.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.160]   And I'm literally thinking, what time did I pick this up from the supermarket?
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.040]   Okay, I picked it up at three p.m. on Wednesday.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.560]   Technically, I'm like eight to 10 hours past two days now, even if I was doing the searching
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.560]   like a two a.m.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.360]   Like on Saturday morning before I go to bed, I thought, well, what if instead of going to
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.200]   bed, I just like drop that in the Suvie.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.160]   So I started cooking and I'm only expired by like eight hours.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.000]   It can't possibly be like a danger after that.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.400]   And then unfortunately, the, the idea of the normalization of deviance.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.040]   You ever heard of this concept?
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.040]   Yes.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.440]   The sociological concept that says that you do something, if someone does something that's
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.040]   wrong enough times in a row, they deviance from normality becomes normalized and they
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.880]   forget that there's a reason why this is just this is deemed wrong.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.080]   And that's the one thing that said, ah, damn it.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.440]   So am I am I going to be?
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.840]   Why did I bother to search?
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.280]   Is it safe to eat turkey that's been in the fridge for two and a half days?
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.520]   If I did not intend to follow the advice that I didn't want to get all those, but the worst
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.640]   part would have been if I got sick anyway, for those for that, like two and a half days,
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.080]   I would have been like really, really sick because there's nothing worse than like some
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.080]   salmonella.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.640]   I would have been thinking, well, anyway, we did a search.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.000]   We actually saw the advice.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.640]   We said that can't possibly true.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.240]   So you got it from two other sources that all consistently said one to two days.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.920]   You said, Nope, I guess I'm going to just make a judgment call and how did that judgment
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:57.920]   call work out?
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.920]   I, that's the worst.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.920]   Did you call the butterball hotline and you recorded?
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.920]   That's all I need to know.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.720]   My former college roommate was an epidemiologist and worked in the Oregon State Health Department.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.720]   Oh, wow.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.040]   Tracking down food related disease.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.720]   He's he had a, he's passed away now, Bill King.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.800]   He had a shelf behind him, a museum of all the food.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.800]   All prions.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.680]   Food-borne diseases that he had tracked down.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.120]   He co-liant the salad, things like that.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.360]   And I went to Thanksgiving with him once and only once and he handled the turkey even after
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.000]   cooking with rubber gloves.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.880]   I think you can be maybe too aware.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.880]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.880]   One is, one is broad.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.880]   It's a thing.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.880]   Not too, Andy, I went to the other one.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.280]   But he said when I was cooked and then this guy is an expert.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.400]   He used to tell t-shirts that said, How would you like your eggs?
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.400]   And it was a bunch of-
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.400]   You don't try your turkey?
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.600]   Parasite eggs on the front.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.960]   So this guy was an expert and he still would not handle a turkey, even fully cooked with
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.960]   his bare hands.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.520]   So I just, I feel like that Turkey's probably our side of life.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.040]   We're going to dance with death.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.800]   But anything that doesn't kill you-
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.800]   Well, they're descended from dinosaurs.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.800]   That's not a beating.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.560]   As our friend, Jen, Salimian says, Anything that doesn't try to kill you steps back and
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.560]   tries again, right?
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.320]   Mutates and tries again.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.320]   So anyway-
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.320]   I went the other way, which is-
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.680]   I'm glad everybody's fine.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.680]   I put it in there and I just left it.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.720]   So I just put all of it in on the first day and then I just let it keep cooking.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.840]   And all it does is get softer.
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.280]   So the next day, the only thing that happened the second day or the second evening when
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.960]   I took the rest of the turkey out was that you can't cut it anymore.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.920]   And you just take your fork and you push it down and it just cuts hard.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.360]   Yeah, I don't like to overdo poultry in the sous vide.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.360]   It gets mushy.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.360]   That was quite nice.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.360]   You liked it?
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.000]   I made some incredible gravy, which was from the cut of the turkey.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Out of the turkey.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Out of the turkey.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   It was liquefies.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.440]   And it was so good that you mixed that all up and it was-
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.760]   I cooked my poultry longer.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.280]   Sooviet longer.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.000]   I mean, shorter and higher temperatures these days because I want it to taste like it would
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.200]   taste if it came out of the oven instead of mushy bird.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.960]   But it's all what you're into.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.480]   I'm not going to no judgment.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.960]   We've gotten so used to 148 degrees that it's hard to go back now.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.520]   Like every time anything more- like now a regular chicken, you're like, "What happened?"
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.840]   I think you have to have a little bit of texture.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:22.240]   If you can like drink it through like a large boar like macchiatos bro, that's probably
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.240]   too far.
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.240]   But that takes you to the record.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.240]   I just want to say for the record, Suvi.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.560]   Kenji Altlopas has a very good discussion of this topic on his website.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.560]   Everything eats.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.560]   Everything.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.560]   Everything, yeah.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.800]   I just want to say that I've done extensive testing there.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.600]   Well, I've done it once and I can tell you it's two weeks.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.600]   It'll turn into liquid.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.600]   And by accident.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.600]   You go to Europe.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.600]   Two weeks?
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.600]   Have you put it in a tube?
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.600]   No, a steak.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.600]   Oh, lord.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.280]   So I took a steak and I put it in and I- it was the first Suvi.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.280]   Remember the Suvi Supreme?
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.840]   It doesn't make any noise at all.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.080]   And because it doesn't circulate the same way.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.080]   Right.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.480]   And then I went to Europe.
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.480]   I had a job.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.480]   I had a couple jobs in Europe.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.880]   I came back and I opened.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.160]   I looked at it and the light thrown.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.160]   I was like, oh, no.
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.160]   I opened it up.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.400]   It was just a bag of floating bits inside of liquid.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.800]   I was like, I tried to think.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.320]   I tried to think about what I could do with it.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.320]   And I was like, I think I'm just going to throw it away.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.320]   Throw it away.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.200]   That might not have been the Suvi.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.440]   That might just have been just like bacteria getting the upper hand and breaking down every
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.760]   protein in there.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.760]   We call that decomposition.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.760]   That may be the next thing.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.760]   Exactly.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.560]   We'll have a de-comp cooker that'll- no, I don't.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.560]   Exactly.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.680]   Here's Kenji's table.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.200]   Just for people who are interested, seriousheats.com.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.640]   Alex, you like it 148, which is tender and juicy for cold chicken salad between that
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.600]   very soft and juicy served hot.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.040]   But this is up to four hours.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.680]   I'm a more like a 160 guy.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.200]   I want traditional juicy firm and slightly stringy served hot.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.200]   That's a little hotter.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.200]   Okay.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.200]   I'm going to choose.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.200]   He gets the truth.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.200]   And he shows you pictures.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.200]   He shows you pictures.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.360]   He shows you everything and how much fat is left over.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:05.960]   He also has, and maybe Andy, you could have used this, the table, the temperature, pasteurization
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.560]   time for poultry.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.560]   God, no.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.160]   He only has minutes though, not days, so I don't know.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.040]   Just don't use the word pasteurization because you will get every single, you know, a tomato
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.560]   is not a flood vegetable.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.560]   It's a fruit.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.560]   Okay.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.440]   Technically, it would only be, you can only qualify as pasteurization if blah, blah, blah.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.440]   No, okay.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.440]   You caught me.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.840]   What I'm instead of saying pasteurization, five syllables and moving on and again, making
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:37.960]   the point, I should have said, well, the FDA has a table of temperatures and cooking and
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:43.320]   whole times for that temperature that will cause that will cause the delta of pathogens
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.360]   within that that substance to reduce to below what a level that would cause people to get
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.840]   sick and or die.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:53.520]   Of course, there is a level of beyond pasteurization of, it's like, please just, and this is why
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.680]   you should never invite a sous videre to Thanksgiving.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:01.080]   I'm just saying, just leave them out more an epidemiologist for that matter.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:06.840]   I'm just, all I'm saying is that a sous videre will definitely win like or be the top percentile
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.640]   for Instagram pics of their Thanksgiving turkey.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.640]   That's a good point.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.640]   That's a good point.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.640]   That's a good point.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.040]   Because what we're all, what we're always doing is like, it's not just like, it can't
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.240]   just be like the light on our phone.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.200]   We have to have the external light like on the side.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.040]   They have to see how glistening moist the beer is.
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.200]   That's not dry and stringy.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.120]   All right, enough, enough.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.120]   It's all we have.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.120]   It's all we have.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.120]   We're leaving for a Renee Ritz.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.640]   I just want to let you know, I just want to, I ordered rotisserie chicken from Code
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.200]   St. Blue Barbecue with put in just to celebrate with the rest.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.200]   Good man.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.200]   Perfect.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.200]   Exactly what you should be eating.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.200]   That's very good.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.360]   I'm glad we had this conversation.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.120]   That's used up 10 minutes.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.800]   We only have another hour to go.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.800]   We can make calls in there.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.800]   We can make calls in there.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.800]   Mac and cheese.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.720]   Before we get off, Renee, can I praise you and all of your countrymen for that amazing
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.920]   video that you guys made for Ryan Reynolds on giving him that national award?
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.920]   That is one of the best greatest things I have seen in 2021.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.840]   And it made me want to say, why can't we as Americans be half as cool as the brain trust
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.120]   that made that video?
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.120]   The Canadian.
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.120]   The Canadian Arts.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.120]   The very good ladies are a Canadian award.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.120]   They have all the advantages.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.120]   And it brought Ryan to tears as I remember.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.120]   Oh, well, I brought a shout.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.120]   Yes.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.400]   Didn't let him talk, but shows just how smart the Canadians are.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.880]   So shall we watch the video?
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.640]   I guess we now we're kind of compelled to.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:38.360]   Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not going to show all five minutes, but attribute.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.360]   Said, "Right out of moose was busy."
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.640]   Nickle back all had to work.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.200]   The mentor called Drake, but called me by mistakes.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.920]   So you're stuck with a song by this jerk.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.840]   Who is that, by the way?
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.840]   That's the lead.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.840]   Oh, one of the singers for "Baron and a Good Ladies."
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.840]   Very naked.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.840]   That's what I thought.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:01.840]   Yeah.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.840]   So I've recognized this voice.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.840]   Also Canadian.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.840]   We know we're a fan of the land.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.040]   We call cats.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.960]   Is he wearing his medal?
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.960]   Ryan is, yeah.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:17.960]   I'm going to do a general's award.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:25.440]   He's playing an axe.
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.440]   Barre goods are on the axe.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.720]   And he's wearing quality flannel.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.720]   Waterfall, forest.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.680]   Ryan's gonna love you back.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.120]   They got a horn section.
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.280]   He is, he's actually tearing up.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.400]   Oh, there's Shatner, another Canadian.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.160]   You're almost as juicy as Bruno, Jerusalem.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.560]   You've been a known and good back.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:55.480]   Oh, oh, all the Canadian and Ryan's.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.480]   You've got to be in our top three.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.680]   We'll drink American gin when you're too.
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.640]   Aviation is gin, of course.
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:11.160]   You want me off from BC?
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.560]   Some hockey players that are of course very well known in.
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.000]   It's Ryan Knight, Canada.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.200]   It's the 49th pair.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.040]   Canada's got you back.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.600]   Canada's own superhero.
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.080]   All the charities and sports.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.800]   Food Bank's Canada.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.840]   You know what?
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.240]   He deserves this.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.240]   That's great.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.240]   It's just a very sweet video.
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.240]   It's like it makes us very Canadian.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.240]   It's very Canadian.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:49.000]   When I saw Canada loves you back, I thought, oh, is this their new tourism video?
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   That works.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Oh, man.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.400]   It makes me want to go to Canada.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.400]   Yeah.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.600]   As soon as they let me in.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.600]   Oh, you can come in with me.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:03.240]   We're open now.
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.240]   Buller bear.
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.240]   No, no.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.240]   Grizzly bear.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.240]   White bear.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.240]   I don't know what kind it is.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.240]   Buller bear.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.240]   How about something metallic?
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.240]   Oh, something that's me.
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.240]   I don't sing.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.240]   He has no fruit and milk.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.240]   I'm so journeyed for it.
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.240]   Let no stretch, but I'll say it.
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.240]   Wow.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.240]   Wow.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.240]   Wow.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.240]   Wow.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.240]   Wow.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.240]   Wow.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.240]   That's a good idea.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.240]   Wow.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.240]   I love this.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.240]   Wow.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.240]   Gorgeous.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.840]   From all of the Canadians.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.080]   Canadian Provincial Working Association, Food Banks, Canada.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.040]   All of the, actually, these are all of the foundations he supports, right?
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.040]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.040]   Wow.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.320]   And he has a hospital and a Vin Diesel joke on the rock.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.800]   The man can do no wrong.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.800]   Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:47.800]   I like it.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:48.800]   He's splitting wood.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.800]   I like it.
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.800]   Not splitting wood, apparently, with his axe.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.800]   I like air guitar.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.800]   I like it.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.800]   I like it.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.800]   He's splitting wood.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.800]   Apparently, with his axe.
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.880]   He's playing the game of life pretty well.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:15:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.280]   Doing a pretty good job.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.280]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.280]   Anyone who can inspire this.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.280]   Cool money.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.280]   Wow.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.280]   Wow.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.840]   Okay, now we've used 14 minutes.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:10.840]   Thank you.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.840]   We're going.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.840]   We're doing a great job.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.840]   Thank you very much.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:14.840]   Very good 14 minutes.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.760]   It was a hell of a good 14 minutes.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.560]   He received the Canadian Arts Award, yes.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.560]   The Governor General's Award.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:24.560]   I know it was nothing.
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.360]   Do you know that the Great Gatsby went into the public domain in 2021?
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:34.880]   I can't remember what the first line is, but you know, let's just read the entire thing.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:39.280]   While we wait for the end of the year, the end of the year, the period where all these
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:45.560]   companies are like, yeah, the Great Gatsby is the reason I don't read fiction anymore.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.560]   I read that.
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:50.040]   I was like, I read this and I was like, this is so bad.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.040]   I'm never going to read it.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.040]   Like, I never did.
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.520]   I never read another fiction book again.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.760]   That is our Philistine, Alex Lindsey.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.560]   Now, let us cover some Apple news.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.560]   Okay.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.560]   Ta-da.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:07.280]   There was some very big music podcast awarding and music awarding to Deilio.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.280]   Yeah.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.280]   Yeah.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.280]   Apple gave away.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.160]   It's 2021, best of 2021 for music and for podcasts.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.640]   Apple celebrates his years best and most popular podcasts.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.320]   One is objective, one is subjective, but we'll go with that.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.320]   And Joe Rogan has nowhere to be found.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.320]   That's why I love Thailand.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:28.320]   Interesting, isn't it?
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.720]   Obviously only Apple only knows downloads on it.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:35.600]   Actually, it didn't even used to know downloads on its own platform.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:41.080]   I guess it would if you downloaded it with Apple Podcasts or iTunes, they might collect
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.880]   that data.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:48.960]   Apple Podcasts is pleased to recognize a slight change of plans with Maya Shankar from Pushkin
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.880]   Industries as the best show of the year.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.960]   I didn't even know what it was.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:18:02.840]   And anything for Selena with Maria Garcia from WBUR and Futura Studios as newcomer of the
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:03.840]   year.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:04.840]   Very, very good.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:05.840]   Congratulations.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.880]   Just to me, it's like one of the things is like podcasts were very tech oriented in the
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.880]   beginning because there was only techie people who knew what RSS was.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.240]   And now they're mainstream and their show is like about knitting.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.800]   It shows about like knitting specific yarns and a specific suburb of Boston.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:18.800]   Well, that's good.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.120]   We're never going to get that little tight bubble back.
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.120]   And I love that.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.120]   I love that.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.120]   Best show of the year.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.120]   They're not ours anymore.
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.600]   They're strong to everybody.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.760]   That's the ideal.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.520]   And that's why I really like it when the people who are given these awards.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:37.120]   I mean, it doesn't mean anything to somebody who already has a huge audience.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.120]   It means something.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.800]   It generates downloads for sure.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.200]   I'm sure all of these shows will be downloaded.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.040]   That's why I meant for like if let's say the big, most popular podcast in the world that
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:51.920]   everybody's heard of and the host has been like on the tonight show once or twice, what
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:56.680]   is gained by giving that person that kind of a spotlight?
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:01.640]   Whereas another podcast that is just as good in so many ways, help that person, help that
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.920]   group like lift them, lift them up by giving them recognition that way.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.960]   It's like we don't need that we don't need a way to say, well, I bet that we can get this
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.160]   person to do a video for us.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.560]   If we if we honor them and say that, wow, that podcast that's making you a point two
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:19.920]   million dollars per year in sponsorships alone, I'm not saying that this should all
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.840]   be about marketing and all be about promoting podcasts.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.280]   I'm getting a big enough audience, but it always makes you good when you when these
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:33.320]   sort of things direct your attention to a podcast or app of the year or any one of these categories
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.320]   where I had no idea this thing exists, but I sampled it.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.560]   And my God, this is one of the greatest things I've ever seen.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.280]   Thank you for calling this to my end.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.280]   That's good.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:46.080]   This I by the way, did not bother even to look at this list to see if anybody I know is on
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.080]   it.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.080]   So I mean, maybe somebody is let's see.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:53.520]   In addition to best show that you're a newcomer to your app or recognizes a curated collection
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.520]   of shows and episodes that define and reflected 2021.
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.280]   Well, I know I'm not on a list that defined it reflected 2021.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:04.440]   Let's see kids book about the podcast.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:09.200]   Oh, I see it's about other things, but it's a podcast.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.200]   Everything goes with them.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.680]   A chamberland good inside with Dr. Becky.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.720]   I can go on and on.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.840]   I don't think I will.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.560]   Let's see anything anything you guys recognize Jason free Jared freed.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.560]   Nope, somebody else.
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:22.560]   Okay.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.560]   Episodes of the year.
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.920]   Oh, they even break it down episodes.
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.720]   So make sure Logan Paul wasn't there and then that was fine.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.280]   I can't wait to listen to this.
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.960]   Gloria spastards about a chance encounter with Paul wrote at a movie theater that causes
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:42.280]   a formerly devout Jehovah's witness to rethink your future and embark on a new life.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.440]   Maybe I'm sorry.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.920]   I won't snark.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:46.920]   I won't snark.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:52.000]   We have so many minutes to kill you.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.040]   Apple also published new charts today highlighting the most popular new shows free channels and
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:02.280]   individual shows and channels with subscriptions that launched this year in the US.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.320]   This something I'd like to mention this once in a while because people always say, why
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.920]   you aren't you guys on the charts anymore?
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:11.440]   Because you have to be new charts are very much about their acceleration based.
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.320]   Yeah, it's like the billboard charts.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.760]   Same reason, you know, the Beatles aren't on the number one on the billboard charts.
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.360]   They may be, you know, somebody or whoever prints might be best selling, but it's not
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.360]   new.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.640]   So it doesn't count.
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:29.520]   Top new shows we could do hard things with Glennon Doyle top free channels, audio chuck,
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.760]   then the New York Times New York Times was really be pissed.
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:39.360]   My heart gets beat by New York Times and New York Times gets beat by audio chuck.
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.360]   Okay, then date line bars.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.360]   I don't know what audio chuck is.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.160]   See, I'm telling you, this is good for you.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.160]   Evidently.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.160]   See, this is good for that.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:52.920]   Top subscriptions, bad blood, the final chapter with John Kerry-Rue.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:53.920]   Number one, channels.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:54.920]   Fresh air.
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:55.920]   Hot channels.
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:56.920]   Fresh air.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:57.920]   I've heard of that.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:21:59.920]   There you go.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.840]   Number four on the top subscriptions individual shows.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.920]   And that isn't a new show.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.080]   So, you know, there you go.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.600]   That's new subscriptions this year.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.600]   Planet money also.
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.080]   Somebody's a big media shows.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.080]   Almost all is big media.
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.600]   Although some not.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:14.600]   Wondery, luminary, sword and scale.
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.720]   Is that like a sword and laser?
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.080]   Did they change their name or is this somebody copy them?
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:23.840]   Tenderfoot TV, Qcode, Pushkin, imperative, radio, topia, realm and the Atlantic.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.200]   So there you go.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:31.120]   Thank you, Apple, for really helping podcasts by promoting all the underdogs.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.880]   And then let's do music.
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.640]   Two, the third annual music awards.
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:38.560]   And this will give you, I think, some idea of how important these awards are.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.480]   I thought you were going to say how hip all of us are.
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.920]   How hip all of us are.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.720]   Let's see.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:50.200]   The winners are global artists of the year, the weekend.
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.040]   I'm just going to not say anything.
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:55.680]   Breakthrough artists of the year, album of the year, and song a year, all going to Olivia
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.880]   Rodrigo for her amazing song driver's license.
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.880]   Okay.
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.720]   She's a Disney product, isn't she?
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.840]   Actually, I'm pleased to see H.E.R.G. as songwriter of the year.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:06.840]   That's good.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:13.840]   I got to say, we've done a little work with her and wow, what a force of nature.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.840]   Like that is like, I'm a holy, holy smoke.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.640]   I don't know, but she's a kid.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.800]   Wow, is she talented?
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.000]   She's talented, disciplined, focused.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.320]   She's got that, every once in a while you see an artist go by.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.360]   I've worked with a lot of artists and every once in a while you see one go by that has
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.360]   everything.
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:36.800]   And all the pieces in one place and she's definitely one of those.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.320]   Oh, we should look at the award.
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:43.920]   You get a silicon wafer framed, framed silicon wafer.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.240]   Is that the biggest M1 Max chip that they have?
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.440]   I wonder what these are all obviously really fast.
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.440]   These are all like a super fast one.
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.440]   Look at all those processors.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.440]   The weekend is a look at them.
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:56.920]   I think they promised the weekend something better because he doesn't seem to.
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:01.200]   I think Qualcomm was going to offer each one of these people like $10 million for their
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:06.680]   wafer just in case there's something on there that an early development edition of like
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.560]   a modem chip or something they could check out.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.120]   Put them on that Hawaii junk at Andy.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.920]   They don't have to give them anything else.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.080]   What are the chances?
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.600]   This is a Photoshop image.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.600]   I don't know.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.600]   Okay.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:22.080]   They're holding like a blank and they'll figure out the award later.
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.400]   They're holding a piece of paper in their living room and it's turned into the.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.400]   I'd be surprised.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.400]   I think that's probably there.
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.400]   The background may not be.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.400]   Well, definitely the background.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.400]   They have a background.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.640]   These color coordinates are holding everything.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.880]   You think they're holding it or a piece of a piece of wood?
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.920]   Either that or they're still being held at this facility.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:46.520]   This is what happened to those anechoic chambers they built to for the home plant.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.320]   It's now a rendition site.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.320]   Black Ops.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.480]   Artists of the year Africa was kid.
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.280]   Artists of your France.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.280]   So they have oh my god.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.760]   I'm not going to go through all the countries.
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.760]   It's nice that they give credit to the customers.
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.240]   It's nice because a lot of times that gets kind of.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.240]   It's one for Canada.
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:05.880]   It did not fly all these people into the secret chambers underneath the campus to do
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:06.880]   these pictures.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.880]   Alia, you have to go.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.880]   I need to know what Brian Reynolds won for Canada.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.880]   He should win.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.040]   He should win for Canada.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.040]   Okay.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.040]   Here's what it is.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:18.360]   Each award features Apple's custom silicon wafer suspended between a polished sheet of
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:22.120]   glass and a machine and anodized aluminum body.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:27.360]   The result of this multi-month process before it is sliced into hundreds of individual
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.320]   chips is stunning and distinctive.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.320]   Please do not.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:34.960]   I bet you think there's in the contract that says and you may not slice them up to make
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:35.960]   your own M1 Macs.
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.960]   You may not give this to Intel.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.600]   I don't know but I think we know exactly what when Johnny I've left the company who
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.440]   mentioned that while we'll still be involved in certain specific projects on Apple, I think
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.080]   we just saw one of Johnny I's projects.
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.080]   It's actually beautiful.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.320]   I'm surprised this has been sold as the new MacBook like no screen, no keyboard, no
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.240]   connectors but oh my god the Aluminium.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.240]   Tell me more about the levels.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.960]   It has to be inevitable Andy.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.480]   It has to be just had to be.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.000]   And courageous, courageous too.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.960]   I know that the podcasters did not get these awards by the way.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.080]   No, they didn't get squat.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.640]   They're not pretty enough to get them.
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.640]   Yeah, they got the podcast.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:13.440]   They got the buffet table.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:18.520]   Remember when Drake got early on in the Apple music?
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:25.560]   They had to create an award for the first creator to get more than over one billion streams
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:26.560]   on Apple music.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.840]   So they basically created a piece of artwork, framed it, then showed up backstage at a Drake
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:31.840]   concert.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.120]   I mean Tim Cook, like the entire team to get a picture with them because that was the
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:40.760]   value of we have to have some sort of an eye grabbing number that's going to show people
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:46.480]   exactly how popular an artist is on our platform and that the fact that our platform is now
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.520]   big enough that you can actually have a billion views here.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.840]   There's a lot of that going on here.
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.200]   Okay.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.800]   We've made it through 25 minutes.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:55.800]   Thanks folks.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:00.400]   Now let me do an ad and then we'll come back with actual news.
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.880]   There is real news.
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.200]   Great to have you here, Mac Break Weekly.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.120]   Last episode of November.
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.120]   Can you believe that?
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.840]   December is to start tomorrow.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.240]   Where did it go?
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.960]   We're wrapping up 2021.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.000]   We hardly knew ye.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.280]   We will do a best of episode at the end of the year as we always do for Mac Break Weekly.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:25.160]   Then maybe the first episode of the new year we'll talk about what's ahead because I think
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.920]   it's going to be a very big 2023.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.160]   It's going to be a busy year.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.160]   They're 2022.
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.160]   What year is this?
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.160]   It's going to be a big 20 matter.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.160]   It's going to be a big 20 matter.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.320]   We need all the years we can get.
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.320]   Let's get one.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.320]   I don't know.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:41.360]   If it's anything like one and two, three could be really a bummer.
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.360]   All right.
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:46.000]   Let's talk about our sponsor, userway.org.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.040]   Now, this is somebody I can really get behind.
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:54.520]   They are a company that helps other companies make their websites accessible.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:28:01.160]   60 million Americans with disabilities have a right to look at your website, to use your
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.840]   website, to buy stuff from you.
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.000]   Why wouldn't you want to do that?
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.080]   Although it actually had to go to the Supreme Court.
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:12.480]   This is mandated by the ADA, the Americans with Disabilities Act.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.360]   Any public entity has to be accessible.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:19.040]   Supreme Court ruled that any website that's open to the public is a public entity.
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:25.360]   Fortunately, there are rules, WCAG, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, that tell
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.600]   you what you need to be to be accessible.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:31.920]   Every browser has this capability, by the way, it's an accessibility layer that is generated
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:37.080]   by invisible commands on the website.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:43.720]   Userway's incredible AI-powered solution tirelessly enforces these WCAG guidelines with one line
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.360]   of JavaScript.
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:50.320]   Userway can achieve more than an entire team of developers by making your website accessible.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:54.600]   I know that can be overwhelming, but it's nice to know there's an easy way to do it,
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.800]   easy and cost-effective, by the way, very affordable.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.960]   If you're just at all curious, are you compliant?
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.040]   Are you liable?
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:08.200]   Check out their free scanning tool to see if your website's ADA compliant.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.360]   That's what a million websites have done.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:15.400]   They've gone to Userway, and they've turned on their AI and machine learning solutions.
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:19.680]   Coca-Cola uses Userway, Disney, eBay, FedEx.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:24.000]   You can use it, too, at a very affordable price for small and medium businesses.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.040]   Operating a compliant, accessible website just makes business sense.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.480]   Millions of people need Userway to purchase your products.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.640]   When you scale, you need Userway.
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.320]   It scales right there with you.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.640]   Let me give you examples.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.360]   We all know, first of all, is when it's all tags on images.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:46.680]   You don't want an image to be a blank space for somebody using a screen reader.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.120]   You put in all tags.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.040]   That's a lot of work if you have a lot of images.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:54.200]   Userway's AI actually does image recognition on all the images, fills in all tags.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.880]   You can add to it, of course.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:01.000]   They give you a very easy way to interact with the change, but it gives you something
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.920]   which is better than nothing.
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.000]   It does even more.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.920]   One of the big problems, and I hear this all the time from blind listeners, is the nav
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.320]   menus on a lot of sites.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:10.680]   They're just not navigable.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.680]   It fixes that.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.600]   It ensures all the pop-ups are accessible.
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.560]   It makes your shopping cart accessible.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:19.040]   That's something you want, right?
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.320]   Form fillout, accessible.
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:24.000]   Fixes vague link violations, fixes broken links.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.840]   Make sure all your colors are accessible without changing your colors, but it can adjust
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:35.880]   the aluminance to get it easier to read for screen readers and people with vision problems.
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.480]   Userway's completely platform agnostic.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.680]   By the way, it works everywhere.
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.080]   WordPress, Shopify, Wix.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.480]   It's easy to add.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.600]   Userway, AEM site, core share point, even in the hand-coded site.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.440]   It's just a line of JavaScript.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.960]   Userway integrates seamlessly, no matter what you're using.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:54.880]   It lets your business meet its compliance goals, improves the experience for users, and potentially
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:58.520]   keeps you out of court, which, you know, I don't want to emphasize that because you're
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:02.200]   doing it for the right reasons, but it's something to be aware of.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.680]   Just listen to Susan Bennett, the voice of Siri, if she's going to tell you what she
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.680]   thinks of Userway.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:10.800]   Hi, I'm Susan Bennett, the original voice of Siri.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.680]   You won't hear me say something like this too often.
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.920]   I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're looking for.
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:23.960]   But every day, that's what the internet is like for millions of people with disabilities.
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:28.720]   Userway fixes all of that with just one line of code.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:33.760]   One line of code can make any website fully accessible and ADA compliant.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:37.640]   With Userway, everyone who visits your site can browse seamlessly, customize it to fit

[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.240]   The good thing to do.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:20.240]   Apple has alerted a Polish prosecutor that her iPhone has been hacked.
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:27.240]   At least this is the Polish tweet, but here's the text translated.
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.200]   State sponsored attackers may be targeting your iPhone.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:34.720]   Apple believes you're being, you do not want to get this from Apple ever.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.480]   It's from threat-notifications@apple.com.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:41.640]   Apple believes you're being targeted by state sponsored attackers who are trying to remotely
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:45.000]   compromise you with the iPhone associated with your Apple ID.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.120]   These attackers are likely targeting you individually because of who you are or what you do.
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:55.800]   If your device is compromised by a state sponsored attacker and it goes on to talk about the
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:59.200]   potential access they'll have, well it's possible this is a false alarm.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.000]   Please take this warning seriously.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.400]   We see this from Google as well.
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:09.320]   This could really become a Watergate situation for a lot of countries.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:13.960]   Apple is just what they're doing is that they're warning people but they're also publicly
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:18.240]   shaming the companies that they're publicly shaming somebody.
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:22.600]   I believe it's Pegasus, which means it's the NSO group.
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:26.480]   Everybody who's got NSO licenses who've been using it the way they shouldn't is kind of
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.800]   like someone going, "Hey, we're going to go through your research history now and publish
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.360]   it to Twitter."
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:36.400]   I think that Apple could get pretty ugly for a lot of countries.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.920]   It won't be for ours because we have our own tools to do that.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.160]   Well, it could be.
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.760]   I bet you anything.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:47.000]   I wouldn't be surprised at all if we buy exploits.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.600]   You might have tools but those exploits are pretty valuable, pretty highly held.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.600]   I don't know.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.600]   Maybe we have our own exploits.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.120]   How many exploits do you think there are?
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:57.120]   We do.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.120]   That's why we don't license NSO.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:01.440]   One of the reasons that they do business here is that a lot of the fly-by's countries
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.960]   have plenty of their own.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.040]   We don't need any planning.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:06.320]   We don't need your stick.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:13.640]   Anyway, this is part of course Apple's suing the NSO group as we talked about last week
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:17.080]   because this is the only, I guess, foothold they have.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:25.080]   The NSO group in order to infect these phones sends you a text message and the text message
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:29.200]   to do that is a violation of the terms of services of Apple's messages.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.200]   That's where Apple's getting them.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:35.200]   You had a responding of fake accounts that doesn't make these messages.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:41.200]   Again, the discovery for this is going to be ugly.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:44.680]   The thing is Apple's made it clear, especially with these little announcements, that I think
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:48.560]   that what they're really after is they want to know everybody who is involved and who they
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.360]   were connected to.
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:53.720]   There's going to be a whole lot of mud because that does so much damage to NSO.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:56.400]   It doesn't matter whether they win or lose the case.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.560]   Apple will win most likely, but it doesn't matter whether they win or lose.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.720]   No one's going to want to touch.
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:04.600]   Anybody with any brains is not going to want to touch NSO again because if all your dirty
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:10.160]   laundry of who you were following when you shouldn't all gets put out in public, it's
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:13.760]   going to be a lot of people that are upset.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.960]   It's going to be real problematic.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:19.760]   We don't know what the FBI used to heck that Sam Bernadino terrorist phone.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.080]   It's just as close.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.080]   They bought it from somebody.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.080]   It's from a really weird thing.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.920]   I guess NSA refused to help them.
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:27.920]   Okay.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:32.400]   So the NSA, so this is the other problem.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.600]   I mean, we may have tools, but not ever.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.920]   They're not equally distributed.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:36.920]   Is that it?
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.440]   Well, among the intelligence community.
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:42.800]   Also, some of the United States agencies don't have a legal authority to do it.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.520]   NSO can't do it against US citizens, right?
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:46.520]   Only the FBI.
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:50.440]   Which is why, as I'm sure Alex is about to point out, you ask your friends and your
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:55.160]   partners in the group say, "Hi, foreign state that we exchange intelligence with.
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:57.920]   Could you eavesdrop on our citizens on the specific..."
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:58.920]   And then tell us what you found out.
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.160]   The NSA could share the exploit, however.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.840]   If there's nothing against that, then the FBI would use it here.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:04.840]   But then they...
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:07.200]   And they're not going to burn it on it, right?
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.440]   The NSA probably knew a long, long ahead of time.
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.800]   There's nothing in San Bernadino that we need and there's no reason for us to give it to
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.800]   them.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:15.800]   Like, there's no...
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:22.000]   All we're going to do is give up our exploit and they're not going to use it on one person
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.880]   when they're using it on thousands effectively.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.880]   Like why do that?
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:31.120]   Also in principle, the reason why most government conspiracy theories, for example, are not
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:35.240]   the fall apart is that it presumes that the government is one entity that is all focused,
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:38.400]   can be focused on one goal as opposed to two different agencies.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.080]   Why on earth would we help this other agency out?
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.640]   We hate those people.
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:47.000]   Even if we're ordered to, we're going to try not to just on principle.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.240]   That is like the literal truth.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:54.640]   Nine to five maxes, at least five Thai activists and researchers have also received this notice
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:55.640]   from Apple.
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:56.640]   Yeah.
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.640]   Google does the same thing.
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:58.640]   I don't know.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.720]   I mean, that's as they should.
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:01.720]   As they should.
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:07.080]   It could be super disruptive though because this particular notice was that if you read
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:13.080]   through to the actual Polish coverage of this, there is reason to believe that it could be
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.920]   her own government that is trying to spy on her because she's a prosecutor that's been
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:22.600]   sort of nosing around in areas in which if the things that she's investigating turn out
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:28.480]   to be true, it would be very, very efficient for her to basically find out what she knows,
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:32.640]   make sure that they can head off anything that's going to happen within her prosecutorial
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.640]   purview.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:38.600]   And you think about how disruptive that can be when you basically are not just, it's
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:43.280]   one thing when you're saying that, oh, by the way, this one country is doing cyber attacks
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.840]   on your, on this other country.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:48.880]   It's another thing when it actually reveals, no, there is political infighting such that
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:53.080]   you are targeting people who are investigating an authority that's supposed to be policing
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.080]   itself.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.480]   I can't speak for the US, but I think in most cases, that's exactly how it happens.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:00.920]   It was the Thai government looking spying on Thai activists.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.840]   It's Bahrain spying on Bahrain activists.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:08.720]   It's almost always your own government because you are a threat, right?
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:12.800]   This is a little bit more interesting because it really is someone who already has political
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.800]   authority.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.160]   It's not someone outside of the political structure.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.000]   That is kind of interesting.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:25.040]   If let's say there were a sitting US president who didn't have any idea that he had any control
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:30.560]   of limits on his personal authority and uses authority to pursue lots and lots of grudges.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:36.280]   And there was proof that no, you actually had surveillance directed against your political
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:41.240]   enemies to find dirt against them that you could then use to basically negate their ability
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:45.880]   to challenge you on anything in a more enlightened society.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.640]   This would be a huge, huge problem.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.640]   Yeah.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:52.120]   Luckily, they alienated the intelligence community so we didn't get to see the whole thing playing.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:56.160]   And this is exactly why we talk about it, why Apple is upset about it, whether they're
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:02.680]   making, I don't know if Apple is really upset about it, but this really threatens all of
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.680]   us.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.960]   Yvonne's language did not sound happy.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:09.280]   A lot of the Apple executives, again, they're really plain spoken, what they sound like on
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:13.560]   the stage is exactly what they sound like when you meet them like a...
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:14.560]   I know.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.640]   It's just paranoid of me to assume there's some sort of government-backed channel with these
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.640]   companies.
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:22.280]   I've had a chance to talk to a lot of security people at Apple, Google, and Facebook.
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:25.920]   And one of the things that Apple does not like Google and Facebook, Google does not like
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:26.920]   Facebook and the NSA.
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:29.120]   They all have the favorites and at least favorites.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:32.600]   All of them hate the idea of these people getting into their systems with a seething
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.600]   loaded passion.
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:34.600]   They hate it.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:35.600]   Good.
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:36.600]   I hope that's true.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:40.000]   I mean, here's the paranoid in me.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.560]   They know it's a bad look to be doing it.
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:51.440]   But at the same time, I would imagine that they get approached all the time by government
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.440]   agents.
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:55.200]   So obviously, they're going to do whatever they can to look like they're going to be
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.200]   against it.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:00.200]   I think Apple's drawn a pretty strong line of where...
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:02.200]   Apple's drawn a pretty strong line of, "We'll let you into the cloud.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.680]   We just won't let you into the phone."
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:08.440]   And I think that their whole business model is around not allowing people into the phone.
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.840]   And so I don't think that they would ever knowingly give it up to the government.
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:12.840]   Don't be paranoid, Leo.
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.840]   Well, I'm just saying that...
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:15.840]   No, be paranoid.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:16.840]   It's hard.
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:17.840]   Just don't be alone.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:18.840]   Don't be alone.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:19.840]   Just be alone.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:20.840]   Just not anxious.
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.440]   Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not allowed to get you.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.840]   But Renee raises a really good point.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:30.800]   There is such a thing as a common enemy that goes from a fundamental dogmatic reaction
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:34.560]   to what this enemy does to essentially trust.
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:38.880]   If your job is to maintain security, it's not just the people that are trying to undermine
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:43.040]   the technical underpittings of the security of the device and the operating system.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:46.520]   It's also the people that are trying to destroy the trust in that security.
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:54.480]   And that is something that really gets people on a Clint Eastwood vigilante style attack
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.240]   against these people.
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.240]   Google...
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:01.720]   I would wager that one of the largest areas of collaboration between Google and Apple
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.000]   is insecurity.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.680]   Maybe not necessarily in an official sense, but these people talk to each other at conferences.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:12.400]   They talk to each other basically through whatever means that people in this business
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.400]   talk to each other.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:18.480]   And they are very, very, very eager in putting the hurt on people who are trying to destroy
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.560]   security and trust in these platforms.
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:25.360]   They spend a million lifetimes collectively trying to support.
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:28.800]   And one thing that I just want to make sure we separate is that we have a...
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:32.200]   There's a lot of rogue actors that are using NSO groups to do all these things.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:36.680]   And then there are some that are following actual terrorists and our own government while
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.880]   we want to be protective of our privacy and security.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:44.520]   We have to understand that the people that are trying to do this stuff are doing it under
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:51.160]   very valid reasons, for very valid reasons where they can, because there is true threats
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:55.240]   that they are sorting out from terrorist organizations.
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:59.920]   So we don't want to wipe everything over with the same brush because there are people who
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:02.400]   are using these tools to do horrible things.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.880]   We just have to remember that that's part of it.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.840]   We just give them the metadata and keep them off the phone too.
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.840]   That's the big deal that apparently Facebook and Google and Apple have all made.
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:11.480]   It's like, you can't have the data.
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.280]   You know, go crazy with the metadata.
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.040]   And that's all very true.
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.520]   Super valuable.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:17.520]   That's all very true.
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:22.560]   One of the difficulties is that no one who wants to roll back security protections on personal
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.600]   devices will ever say, "We just want the...
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:29.920]   We just want a great situation which nobody can possibly have a secret from the government."
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.560]   They will always say terrorism.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.760]   They will always say child abuse.
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.080]   They will always say human trafficking.
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:42.440]   And these are all valid things that are facilitated when law enforcement agency have proper legal
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.440]   court authorized access to a device.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:48.320]   However, we always have to make at the same time, in the same conversation, we have to
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:51.160]   say, "We are not going to put back doors into things.
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:54.760]   We are not going to essentially establish the right to access every device."
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:56.760]   I completely agree with you.
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.760]   You know, like, you know, completely agree that it's important.
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.760]   I'm just adding the conversation and correcting you.
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:02.920]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, because I completely agree with that.
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:06.920]   I just also want to say that we don't want to demonize the folks that are doing a pretty
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:07.920]   hard...
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:12.540]   We work pretty hard every day to make sure that we can have houses that don't have walls
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:15.080]   and people with AK-47s on every corner.
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.080]   Where I work in countries like that.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:22.160]   And so the thing is that we have it pretty good here and we have it pretty good partially
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:26.480]   because of those agencies that really went in for valid reasons.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:31.160]   But I still think that we should keep the phone as a kind of a sacred place in my opinion.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:35.360]   See, this is part of the conversations I have with myself in my head.
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:41.200]   Oftentimes, a lot of the most complicated things come down to just my belief and my personal
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.960]   opinion of what is fair play, what is not fair play.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:49.240]   To me, the idea that, well, if Apple has a bug in their system that can be exploited
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:54.760]   to give people wonderland access to the phone, it's Apple's responsibility to lock that stuff
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:56.200]   down and discover it.
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:03.240]   If governments who have an interest in finding those exploits find them, that's fair game.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:05.240]   That's okay.
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:08.640]   I might not necessarily prove how they're using it in every single instance.
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:15.560]   But we always have to make sure we make that line between a government insisting that devices
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:19.800]   remain weak and governments that are simply smart have to realize that there's probably
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.120]   a problem here somewhere.
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:26.680]   Something that's based on Linux is based somewhat on at least one piece of open source code
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:32.440]   that's being maintained by a single volunteer who wrote this code in 1998.
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:35.840]   That doesn't have enough time to really, really keep an eye on it.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:39.480]   And so we bet that if we jiggle enough doorknobs inside the system, we'll find a way to get
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.480]   in.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:47.800]   Google and Apple both find 10 million euros each by Italy's competition and market authority
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:53.720]   saying the companies don't provide their users with clear enough information on commercial
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:59.000]   uses of the data and that violates Italy's consumer code.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.640]   The regulator also accuses Apple and Google of deploying aggressive practices to put
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:10.080]   users, push users to accept this commercial processing.
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.960]   Both Apple and Google will appeal.
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:16.920]   It's not a lot of money.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:21.600]   But they want to demonstrate that they can't just, if there's a law they don't necessarily
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:25.720]   agree with that restricts their trade, they're going to, on principle, want to swap that down
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:29.600]   and demonstrate that this is not something that you can possibly enforce.
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:32.800]   Go back and fix it or just come back with more money.
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:38.280]   The Italy Competition Authority accuses Apple of failing to immediately provide users with
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:44.000]   clear information on how it uses their information commercially, I guess, for ad purposes.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.480]   When they create an Apple ID or access the digital stores such as the App Store, do you
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.480]   think that's fair?
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.920]   I don't know enough about it.
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:54.040]   I read through the article and I just couldn't quite.
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:57.440]   I mean, I was like, I don't understand what they're with.
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:58.440]   It's Italy.
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:45:59.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:00.440]   If you've worked in Italy, you're like, okay.
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:04.560]   Well, should there maybe be when you sign up with an Apple account, oh, and by the way,
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:12.480]   as a disclaimer, we use information you provide us to sell advertising on the App Store because
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:13.480]   they do, right?
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.640]   Probably it's probably buried in the Yula, isn't it?
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:21.120]   Buried in the Yula may not be exactly what Italian regulators want.
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:22.120]   Is that fair?
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:23.120]   I think it's not unfair.
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:28.280]   If they, is, hey, do we all agree Apple is using that information when they sell ads
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.760]   in the App Store?
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:30.760]   Yes.
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:31.760]   Yes.
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:32.760]   Okay.
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.840]   Are they using the information that you're putting in for Apple ID or are they using
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:37.080]   information from your interaction with the App Store?
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.600]   And I don't actually know that.
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.680]   But they're using information.
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.760]   They collect around your Apple ID from your activities.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:44.760]   Let's put it that way.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:50.120]   Once you create an Apple ID, you are in effect setting up an account that they can monitor
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:51.120]   for your activities.
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:52.120]   Yes.
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:53.120]   That's fair.
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.120]   Yeah.
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:56.160]   The reason why I just think like Apple just shouldn't, again, it's easier for me to say
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.600]   because I love spending Tim Cook's money is one of my favorite things, but they just,
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:01.920]   Apple should not be involved in advertising, especially like with the stances that they've
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:06.520]   taken in regards to how Google and Facebook operate in terms of privacy.
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:10.120]   Just everything that's being thrown back in their faces as a result of either people
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:14.320]   making mistakes about what is first party versus third party because it is legit confusing.
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:17.880]   But also because Apple is like, they're putting on these ads up in the App Store and they're
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:19.800]   putting ads up in other places like news.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:23.280]   It was a controversy this week because people are upset again that you pay for News Plus
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:26.320]   and they show you ads and the service that you pay for.
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.360]   It's so little money for Apple.
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.040]   And I know that's, again, I'm spending time with it.
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.040]   It's so little money.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:32.880]   That's another where the Apple sells ads, right?
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:33.880]   News Plus, right?
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:34.880]   Yeah.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.520]   And news plus the App Store, there's one other place, Docs app, I think is the third
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:43.920]   place and it's not worth it for like the parent hypocrisy of it all.
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:47.480]   I think the thing that bothers me the most about the News app is that I tell Apple I
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:52.240]   don't want to see somebody, like I don't want to see this news and then they keep on putting
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:56.880]   a hole in there that going, you could watch this if you weren't blocking it.
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.040]   No, because I am blocking it.
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:00.680]   I don't even want to know.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:02.240]   I don't want to know that it exists.
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:04.120]   You know, like I don't want this thing to work.
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:05.120]   At least it works.
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.120]   At least you can watch it.
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:11.000]   But I'm just like, here Paul Thorett's complaints about Microsoft News, which is constantly
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.640]   feeding him information.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.040]   He really doesn't want to know.
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.240]   He's trying to turn it off.
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.240]   He doesn't care.
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:19.640]   You know, all of a sudden, you know, there's celebrity interviews and bikini pictures and
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.640]   he says, I don't want that.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:26.040]   And Steve Jobs famously has to be a Apple operating system that was run off advertising.
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.280]   They've never productized it, but there's like a patent and everything that says like
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:30.680]   show an ad how annoying is it.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:32.680]   Turn off the ad for 13 seconds.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:36.360]   Like the whole, it's just, like I'm not going to say it's an Apple, but it's against, it
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:40.800]   feels like it runs afoul of the moral stance that they've taken with regards to privacy.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:43.280]   Feels like exactly like that.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.280]   Like maybe it is.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:46.800]   So it's an on four-stair.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:47.800]   It's an on four-stair.
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:48.800]   Unfour-stair.
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.520]   That's a great way of putting it on.
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:54.360]   Oftentimes, it's not so much that Apple's doing something that I think is unethical or
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:56.880]   that even the average person would think is unethical.
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:01.840]   It's that, yeah, but you don't get to say that we are pure as the white, white as snow
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:07.400]   in Antarctica and say that, oh, by the way, we don't actually publicize this, but we're
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:11.680]   actually doing some of what the things we're complaining other people about or we decide
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:15.600]   that we have established that this is an important principle that we will die on this
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:20.520]   ill for, but we will make an exception for this case, this case and this other case.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:24.720]   So it's not that they're being hypocrites, it's that they're being a large, large company
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:29.760]   and their messaging really has to be so in italics with that asterisk and at every time
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:32.360]   that they try to see us in Apple's security.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:36.680]   Given the benefit of the doubt and maybe they got this idea that they can provide, we can
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:39.640]   be the first ones to provide actual private advertising.
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:40.640]   It's still not worth it.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:44.800]   It's one of those things where it's like it can be a beautiful engineering solution that
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:47.840]   just comes off entirely the wrong way when exposed to humans.
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:52.640]   I always feel like when I see Apple do something like this, where it's normal for everybody
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.120]   else, but you wouldn't expect it from Apple.
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:57.120]   I always feel like that shot from Armageddon where he goes, "What's your backup plan?"
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.880]   We don't have a backup plan.
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.880]   He's like, "You're NASA, man.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:04.480]   You've got got people back there thinking things up and other people backing them up."
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.960]   He goes, "This is the best you can do."
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:09.480]   So that's the standard that we hold to.
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:13.760]   Well, look, pure and simple, it is hypocrisy.
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:18.520]   This is why when Apple says, "Oh, no, we protect our users in these other matters,"
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:20.760]   I'm slightly skeptical.
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:25.880]   This is why you don't want to be a hypocrite because then nobody trusts you in other areas.
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:31.400]   It's like, it's not right word for us because we're going to block all third party advertising.
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:32.680]   People say, "Well, you're doing this."
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:35.080]   They're like, "Ah-ha, but this is first party advertising."
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:36.080]   It's true.
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:38.000]   They don't block first party advertising on faith.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.480]   None of their policies, not after tracking transparency, not private relay.
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:45.400]   None of the stuff is ever targeted at first party advertising, but ask a person what
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:47.080]   the difference is in the real world.
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:48.080]   Advertising's advertising.
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:49.080]   They don't care.
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:51.680]   Everyone has perfect knowledge on their platform.
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:55.400]   Google's doing the same thing with that little shell game about third party.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.400]   We're at the first party.
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:51:00.080]   Here's Apple's, by the way, this is the second find in two weeks from Italy.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:05.160]   They also find them as you remember last week over colluding with Amazon.
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:10.320]   Apple said, "We believe the authorities view is wrong and will be appealing the decision."
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:17.080]   Apple, you see, I think this is a really good example of Apple not responding to the accusation.
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:21.400]   Apple has a long-standing commitment to the privacy of our users and we work incredibly
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:26.880]   hard to design products and features that protect customer data from third parties.
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:30.800]   We provide industry-leading transparency and control to all users so they can choose what
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:34.000]   information to share or not and how it is used.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.160]   Can you turn off data collection for Apple's advertising?
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:42.200]   Yeah, it's in the settings under privacy.
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:44.400]   There's an ad section.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:46.840]   You can say that's fair.
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:51.760]   They do provide control to users to choose what information they share or not.
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:52.760]   Is that right?
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:56.760]   Yeah, well, you can just choose not to share it and then you get the generic ads instead
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:52:00.800]   of the ads based on whatever targeted ad.
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.400]   Really does seem silly for Apple.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:06.800]   How much money could they make on those ads and how much do they need that money?
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:10.160]   It seems silly for Apple to do that.
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:14.560]   You think Apple's response is reasonable.
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:18.360]   A long-standing commitment to the privacy of our users, we work incredibly hard to decide
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:21.480]   products and features that protect customer data.
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:23.080]   That isn't really responsive.
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:25.520]   I do think that the second sentence is important.
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:29.440]   We provide industry-leading transparency and control.
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:33.080]   The Italians say you're not quite as transparent as we'd like you to be.
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:34.640]   We'd like you to say this when you sign up.
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:35.640]   I'd be curious.
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:39.320]   I'd be curious about what they started with Apple on Google, but it feels like everybody's
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:40.960]   breaking this rule.
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:44.520]   What if Apple did the same thing for their ads that they do for everybody else?
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:50.320]   When you know they do it but you have to go get it, what if they pushed you a little
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:54.840]   thing when you sign up for an Apple account or first use of phone, pushed it and says,
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:56.880]   "Do you want us to track you or not?"
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:58.160]   You know what the answer would be.
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:59.160]   No.
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:01.680]   Their argument is that that's first party that nobody does.
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:04.000]   That kind of response for first party stuff.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.160]   Again, this whole thing goes into what does it actually mean for the consumer.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.240]   Some of the EU stuff is borderline ridiculous.
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:16.400]   They have a bill passing to say that YouTube can't use privately available information
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:17.600]   to recommend videos to you.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:20.840]   You can only use publicly available information to recommend videos to you.
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:25.520]   Nobody wants their information made public, so going forward, you can't recommend a video
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:26.520]   to anybody.
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:28.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:30.880]   I think everybody is wrong on this one.
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:31.880]   No.
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:36.760]   Part of it is part of the problem with this Italian action is that they find it very, very
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:40.400]   easy to pass a law saying, "Well, you have to inform people, you have to be open and
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:41.400]   forthright."
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:45.520]   But they're not going to define examples of what is going to meet our legal definition
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.480]   of open and forthright.
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:49.280]   That's where these kind of problems happen.
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:51.360]   Also, I agree with you, Renee.
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:57.240]   When you want to control Google and you start saying that you have to explain exactly how
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:01.880]   the search algorithm works, you have to explain exactly how certain results get promoted and
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:03.040]   others will not get promoted.
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:04.040]   Say, "Well, great."
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:07.600]   You're basically saying you must make the search algorithm completely useless because it will
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:13.440]   be nothing but 81st pages of links to things that have nothing to do with what you searched
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:14.440]   for.
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:18.760]   It's like you have to have people who understand what is the goal and what is a reasonable
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.240]   attack towards that goal.
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:24.640]   I can understand if you're giving somebody Gmail or some sort of valuable service for
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:26.640]   free.
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:31.000]   Does Apple give us a valuable service for free when we sign up for an Apple account?
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   Does Apple account?
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.520]   You get five gig dollars in the origin.
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:39.960]   You get free email and free calendaring and you get all the basic tier to buy cloud.
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:41.480]   I mean, the Apple account.
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:43.920]   How much is the reason we have for your prices?
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:47.760]   We're giving you this free service, so you have to give us information for ads.
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:48.760]   Is that a reasonable?
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:50.640]   They do do it with Google for apps.
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:52.240]   They do make a privacy policy.
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:53.240]   I find it annoying.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:57.520]   This is the other problem is that there is dialogue fatigue that sets in really quickly.
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:01.920]   If you install an iPhone Fresh, like I do four or five times a year, you can't open apps.
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:04.440]   Sometimes when you update it, this is what's new in notes.
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:05.440]   This is that your privacy thing.
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:06.440]   Two people are shaking hands.
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:08.520]   To explain to you how we're shaking hands and why.
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:11.120]   No, I just want to use notes.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:16.440]   That's probably Apple's thinking is, well, we could pop that up, but people won't like
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:17.440]   it.
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:18.440]   Well, they do.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:20.480]   You just have to click into it and they probably mean that you should have the whole thing
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:21.480]   like right away.
[00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:22.480]   But it's so frustrating.
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:25.840]   Some apps do that and you've got to scroll through this whole thing only then is a check
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:29.240]   mark because that's done to prove that you've read the entire thing only then does a check
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:30.240]   mark pop up.
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:32.760]   Then you've got to press the button and then you press the second button to say that you
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:33.760]   read.
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:34.760]   Yeah.
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:42.440]   So if I go to privacy and tracking, it's all third party allow apps to request a track.
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:43.440]   It's all third parties.
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:44.440]   So there's a second.
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:47.120]   Yeah, if you go to I'll go with you.
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:49.600]   But that's where I would go as a user.
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:55.800]   I would go to settings, privacy, tracking and I would want that switch to turn off Apple's
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:56.800]   tracking.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:57.800]   It's not there.
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:01.920]   A lot of people want that Apple's argument in which I don't agree with is that it conflates
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:03.320]   first and third party tracking.
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.520]   They want to have separate screens for first party and third party.
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:10.400]   Yeah, but they very else's first party tracking is it down here analytics and improved.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:11.400]   Oh, here it is.
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:13.000]   Way at the bottom Apple advertising.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   Okay.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.360]   So I have turned that off.
[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:23.840]   And then you can also this is actually good view target ad targeting information.
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:25.000]   It's not available right now.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   Okay.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   Turn it off.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.440]   You turn it off for like 48 hours and then you can see it.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:32.360]   So that's a good feature.
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:34.520]   So there you go.
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:36.520]   It is at least it's in privacy.
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:40.960]   It's just at the very bottom under Apple advertising.
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:45.200]   So that's fair analytics and improvements.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:48.080]   Those are that's just the data you said, but you can turn all that off too, which is
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:49.080]   good.
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:52.480]   And it's nice because you can turn it off after the fact if you don't turn it off when
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:54.960]   you first install the phone.
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:55.960]   I think that's fair.
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:57.560]   I think that's adequate.
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:59.160]   I think it's adequate.
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:00.160]   Yeah.
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:01.160]   All right.
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:04.720]   Apple, I think we mentioned this last week.
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:08.720]   Don't expect any more Intel modems in the iPhone.
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:09.720]   Apple.
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:15.320]   They mean quant you mean Qualcomm Qualcomm or Intel's right.
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:17.840]   Well, they bought Intel's phone surface.
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:18.840]   Oh, okay.
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:20.640]   Yeah, you're not going to tell the radios.
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:23.360]   You're not going to get any more Qualcomm either because Apple says we're going to start
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:29.240]   building actually Ming Chi Quo says Apple will be doing a deal with TSMC to build those
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:30.240]   iPhone modems.
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:32.200]   It sounds like they're only going to make it.
[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:36.400]   So because part of the deal, the settlement was that they would license Qualcomm's patents.
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:40.600]   It's very, very as they learned when they decided to settle with Qualcomm, it is really
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:43.400]   hard to build a modem without Qualcomm patents.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:45.680]   So it sounds like they're going to do very similar to what they did with the arm chips
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:46.680]   to begin with.
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:50.600]   And that is they licensed to Cortex cores and then step by step, started replacing them with
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:54.480]   their own their own CPUs, their own GPUs, their own everything.
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:56.760]   This is going to be like they're using Qualcomm modems.
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:58:00.240]   Now they're going to build an Apple modem, but using all of Qualcomm's licenses.
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:02.240]   They have to get an RF antenna array.
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:04.320]   They have to get a whole bunch of other communication parts.
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:07.520]   A modem is more than just a like a single or a singular thing.
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:12.160]   We had a really interesting conversation on Sunday on Twitter.
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:14.760]   Samable Sam and our car guy was there.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:15.760]   So was Doc Rock.
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:16.760]   Doc Rock.
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:18.680]   We were talking about Apple's car initiative.
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:24.640]   Doc Rock said one of the goals of the car initiative may not be to sell a car, but merely
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:31.560]   to develop intellectual property patents that you will then license to other people.
[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:32.920]   I think they're going to make a car.
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:34.440]   Like they're doing a lot of work.
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:36.600]   Like that's a lot of work just to do just to do that IP.
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:41.480]   Well, it could be planned though is well, because yeah, I mean, yeah, it looks like they're
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:42.480]   hiring so many people.
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:43.480]   They're working pretty hard on playing.
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:45.240]   You can be car play plus Leo.
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:47.880]   Although Sam, Sam made the point.
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:50.680]   They're hiring all those people because so many people are leaving.
[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:54.400]   They're really just replacing the engineers they're losing.
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:59.760]   Like, you know, Doug going to where did Doug was Doug Jones?
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:00.760]   Where did he go?
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:04.240]   Well, there's just a handful of the people that are in the middle of this.
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:06.360]   So everyone just keeps passing each.
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:10.120]   Everyone just keeps finally offering more money than the last one.
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:13.440]   And then someone else and more money like the folks that are really in the middle of
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:17.080]   this are making insane salaries, you know, because they're the only ones in them how
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:20.080]   to do it every time they cross the street, their salary doubles.
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:21.080]   Exactly.
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.080]   It's a good deal.
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:24.640]   They hired Latin or right after he invented Swift, like the next year he left and went
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:26.160]   to Tesla for a year.
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:27.160]   Right.
[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:28.160]   Right.
[00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:31.400]   Apple lost its head of battery development to Volkswagen.
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:34.520]   But again, they'll hire somebody else and then there'll be a story.
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:37.440]   Look, Apple just got Tesla's battery guy.
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:41.400]   And it's like, they said they'll just finish his mission at Volkswagen and hire him back
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:44.040]   in two years with all the information that Volkswagen had.
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:46.040]   There you go.
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:48.040]   So you think they're really going to build a car?
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:49.320]   We talked about this last week.
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:52.760]   I just thought it was an interesting and maybe it's a secondary strategy.
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:53.760]   But it is true.
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:56.960]   He's Doc Rux said they're going to be like IBM or Qualcomm.
[00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:02.640]   They're just going to have all of this intellectual property over smart cars, full self-driving.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.920]   And then everybody will have to license it from Apple.
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:07.440]   Well, I'm sure it's going to be an intellectual property.
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:11.200]   They could be going for an angle like Nvidia is going for, which is saying we're going
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:14.680]   to build the chips that are specifically optimized for this task.
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:18.920]   They're putting so much R&D into self-driving technology because they don't want to build
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:19.920]   a car.
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:22.600]   They want to build the chips that all the other car makers are going to want to put into their
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:24.600]   stuff more than anything else.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:29.800]   One part of the race is at some point there is going to be a federal or federal or the
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:35.400]   minimum of federal advisory for state level certifications on what a car has to achieve
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:40.200]   or has to be able to demonstrate in order to be certified for use on public roads.
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:43.760]   And if Nvidia is the first company to say, we have the chips that you can put into whatever
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.280]   you want, these have already passed.
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:48.320]   You don't have to subject hardware to new testing.
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:49.960]   That would be a huge leap forward.
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:52.320]   Apple is also in a good position.
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:01:03.360]   If they really are leveraging their ability to create custom CPUs, custom tips for what
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:08.320]   they want to do, if they can really scale this up, maybe the end game for Apple Silicon
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:11.960]   is not necessarily the most powerful desktop on the planet.
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:16.840]   It's well, we can now make computers that are so immensely powerful that we can put them,
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:22.560]   we can manufacture them at scale, put them in cars and let the car do things that break
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:26.200]   through limitations that only existed because of lack of processing.
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:30.280]   Well, that was one of our conversations is is Apple making chips to sell to other car
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.280]   companies.
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.240]   Do you think Apple would ever sell its Apple Silicon?
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:36.400]   They're just not really OEM style company.
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.640]   That's going to sell the chips out.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.640]   I think that's what I thought.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:44.240]   They want to make sure people use their car play, which works fairly well.
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:48.080]   I think that gives them a lot of data and a lot of information that's super useful for
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.320]   them in the short term.
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:55.920]   I think that the Apple, I think Tim Cook was fairly binary about this at some point where
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:01.000]   he just said, "Apple looks at where we can uniquely add value to a market and then we
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   go after it."
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.040]   Like, look, it's not, they look at what these are the technology.
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.520]   This is the group of technologies we have.
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:09.040]   This is a market where we think we could make it better.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:15.080]   Most cars, I still feel like cars are where we were, for the most part, the average car
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:19.480]   is where we were before the iPhone, which is that I had a trio.
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:21.800]   If you ask me if I love my trio, no.
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:24.320]   I don't really like it.
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:28.640]   It's the best, in my opinion, the best of a bunch of bad choices.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:31.440]   The first one that was a good choice for me was the iPhone.
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:35.840]   The thing is, is that I was excited about and that I was being surprised and delighted
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:38.560]   every day, like, "Oh, I can't believe it does this thing."
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:43.200]   So, I think that that is, I think the Apple is looking for, they obviously think that
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:47.320]   there's something there at the end of that tunnel.
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.560]   I think that they're going to keep on going down that path.
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.160]   I think that, yeah.
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:52.680]   You raise an interesting point.
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:55.800]   There's no privacy sitting in car play, is there?
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.520]   They're just gathering it all up.
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:04.440]   If you're going to make a car, you're both Google and Apple.
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:10.840]   If you're doing a car, what you really want is people using every car as a data, you know,
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:12.600]   like to tell you to have you learn more.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:17.440]   That was, Tesla's Secret SUS was that they made everything, so they got all the data.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.800]   And that was a real advantage to them in developing full self-dirt.
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:23.160]   It's why Google Maps is so good, because it's got all those people.
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:27.320]   The reason I can tell you how long it's probably why there is an Apple Maps, right?
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.920]   Well, for the car.
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:34.280]   And also, you need the Maps for AR and a bunch of other things.
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:37.240]   The Maps are super useful if you're thinking a decade out.
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:38.240]   Yeah.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.600]   But you're thinking that way, because you want to collect all that data, right?
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:41.600]   And you want to make that--
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.600]   Oh, yeah, that's good enough.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:43.600]   Yeah.
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.120]   But that does bring up another issue, though.
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:49.560]   If Apple were to start to decide that we're going to be selling at least maybe not chips
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:55.080]   but a board, here's a board that takes all the inputs you want and will support all the
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:04:00.040]   self-driving stuff, are they going to be okay with selling the chips, selling the boards,
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:04.640]   selling the software, whatever, with the knowledge that, hey, GM is going to be putting this
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:09.040]   in a car that is also going to be collecting consumer data, selling it to-- selling access
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:12.560]   to it to whoever they want to to try to monetize this customer.
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:16.520]   Is Apple going to restrict them to a license to say that, by the way, all of the users'
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.720]   personal data is in a secure enclave.
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:23.040]   You don't have even the ability to get at it, even if you wanted to violate our trust
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.040]   on that.
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:29.960]   I just don't think that Apple-- I think that there's no-- the putting a-- their board
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:36.080]   into a traditional market car is not going to provide the margins that Apple is going
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.080]   to be interested in.
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:43.200]   It's a low margin business that they're putting a low margin card into as an OEM, and I don't
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:44.920]   know where Apple puts OEMs anywhere else.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:48.320]   And so I think that if they're interested in a car, they're interested in a car.
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:51.800]   Like I think that they're interested in doing a car.
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:52.800]   Maybe.
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:56.720]   As I keep saying, I have no idea what they're interested in.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:00.720]   I find the argument that they're making a car very logical, very truthful.
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:04.940]   I think it fits in very, very well with what we know about the character of Apple and what
[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:06.440]   seems to move them.
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:13.080]   However, I don't see why they would want to buy into such an immense pile of complications
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.080]   hurt.
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:17.080]   And we said the same thing over the smartphone.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.080]   Yeah.
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.080]   It's an exactly the same thing over phones.
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:24.080]   It's not quite the same thing, I think.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:30.000]   But here's my attitude towards this is Apple is desperate to find, and they should, and
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.200]   their business model requires them to find a successor to the amazing success of the
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.200]   iPhone.
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.720]   So they're going to try things and they have at least three areas they're trying.
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:39.720]   We've talked about this before.
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:41.360]   Car is one of them.
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.600]   Augmented reality, we're going to talk about that in a second is another one.
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.080]   And health is a third.
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:47.960]   And they're smart.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:48.960]   They're working on it.
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.840]   Why should you, they have enough money to work all three.
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:51.840]   And AI.
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:52.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:53.840]   A lot.
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:59.040]   I feel like Apple is inevitably because they don't gather as much information.
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.040]   Maybe they do.
[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:02.320]   Does Apple gather, I guess they do.
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.320]   They get it.
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:04.320]   No, I don't think they gather the same.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:07.160]   I don't think they gather as much information, but you can also build things that aren't yet
[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:10.000]   necessarily using information from the past.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.960]   If you look at a lot of what they're doing, even in stuff like Final Cut and Motion with
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:16.360]   the tracking stuff that they've added, you know, it's taking a whole different level
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:19.520]   of I can identify this and I can pull it out and I can track these things.
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.280]   Yeah, it's really important obviously.
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.800]   But Google and other companies have a kind of.
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:24.800]   Have a head start?
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:25.800]   No, you don't think so.
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:26.800]   That was Tim.
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.800]   No, I think they do have.
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:32.080]   The LA Apple store, we said the three things that they're working on are artificial intelligence
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:34.800]   and we are.
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:38.120]   He thinks and he makes it sound like they're not, again, these aren't products.
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:40.560]   It's like screens aren't products, but an iPhone is a screen.
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:43.280]   What does he mean by automation?
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.920]   Automation is like things like the car, but the car is not the only thing they're working
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:46.920]   on.
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:49.280]   He thinks that those are the core technologies, the way the connectivity and displays and
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:52.760]   things were again, like an Apple Watch and iPhone and a Mac all have radios.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:53.760]   They all have screens.
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.640]   They all have all these things, but they're separate products and he believes the products
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:00.800]   in the future will have various levels of AR and VR, various levels of AI, various levels
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:01.800]   about emotion automation.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:04.080]   And those are the key technologies I have to control.
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:09.520]   So his point of view, the most important thing of the car is not a vehicle.
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:10.600]   It's the autonomy.
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:11.600]   It's the.
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:14.320]   Well, I would say I would say prominent.
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:19.440]   It's just an expression of something that Apple is really what Apple's really making robots
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:20.440]   to like I'd be.
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.040]   Yeah, in fact, even said that autonomous car is a robot.
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.360]   He said that last spring.
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:25.360]   Yeah.
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:27.360]   I also think it's just a seamless experience.
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:32.580]   When they see this experience across many, many different things that I think that home
[01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:36.640]   kit is all part of that, although I don't think that they're doing it very well.
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.440]   I just think that Apple has to take it over and start making their own products.
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:44.000]   I think that getting other people to do it has not been successful.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.160]   So I think that but building this thing where I can seamlessly go from one place to another,
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:50.480]   I can go to one thing to another.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:54.200]   You're seeing this constantly with Apple is I can now have my iPad be another screen
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.200]   from my computer.
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:59.000]   I can have my phone play music movies on my Apple TV.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.160]   I have all these things that are that are all interconnected to each other.
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:08.000]   I can walk up and my car knows that it's me because I have a watch that says it was me.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.280]   I have a phone that is me and I get close to the car and it's probably me and I can
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:13.280]   just open the door.
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:15.440]   I mean, I know it's me more than the key.
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.440]   Yes.
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:22.400]   So I think that those kinds of, you know, all of that being seamless is I think Apple is
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:24.280]   going to constantly be building that ecosystem.
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:29.640]   So here's an interesting tidbit from Scooter X and our chat room.
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:35.920]   According to Porsche who has car planets cars, Apple doesn't collect a lot of information.
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:40.720]   They only collect information whether a car is accelerating while car plays in use.
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:45.680]   Android Auto collects pretty much everything you get from an OBD 2 port.
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:51.440]   Apple speed, oil and cooling temperature, throttle position, engine revs.
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:56.200]   So somebody who knows an auto manufacturer who implements both says that actually Apple
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:09:01.720]   is very parsimonious in what it collects, but Google collects it, everything.
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:02.720]   That makes sense.
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:04.560]   That is so true to form.
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:09.360]   From what Alex said, if you take Apple's analogy of you can have our device and it'll
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:14.040]   be a screen for other things, that version for Google is information that we will take
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:17.720]   for personal information and use it to power pretty much everything that you do that will
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.800]   get that happens within the Google universe.
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:24.200]   And also you're also helping Google to understand how people operate cars.
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:31.000]   We were speaking earlier about how one of Tesla's biggest advantages in its quasi path
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.480]   towards level five autonomy was the fact that each one of their cars, even though it's
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:40.760]   they even before self assistive technologies were really really hot in those things, it
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:43.600]   was still collecting data about what does the road look like?
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.680]   How do drivers respond to this, that, the other?
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:47.680]   What can it see?
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:48.680]   What can it not see?
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:49.680]   Where are the blind spots?
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:55.360]   That sort of stuff is where if we have a Google device in every single car, it can
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:58.200]   also figure out why did this person accelerate at this juncture?
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:00.040]   I know where this person is.
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:03.560]   I know that there's a curve coming up in the speed limit in the center section is do you
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:05.720]   drop down from 45 to 25?
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.920]   Why did they not slow down sooner?
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.480]   Why are they turning at this point?
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:15.960]   So there's so much in this gumbo that we have to pick apart that we really can't trust anybody.
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:18.320]   It's like the iGERS sanction.
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:23.400]   So this is what Tim Cook told that Cara Swisher back in the spring.
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:26.560]   And it actually is exactly what you were saying, Alex.
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:32.320]   We love to integrate hardware, software, and services and find the intersection points
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:35.480]   of those because we think that's where the magic occurs.
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:36.600]   And that's what we love to do.
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:40.640]   And we love to own the primary technology that's around that.
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:44.920]   The autonomy itself is a core technology in my view.
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:50.720]   If you take a step back, the car is in a lot of ways a robot, an autonomous car is a robot.
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:53.480]   And so there are lots of things you can do with autonomy.
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:54.640]   And we'll see what Apple does.
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:11:01.960]   So that really implies, and that confirms what he said yesterday in LA, that the three
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:11.080]   legs of the Apple tripod are not what I was saying, car, health, and AR, but really autonomy,
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:12.080]   AR.
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:15.720]   And what did he say the third one was Renee?
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:20.320]   AI, AR, VR and automation, automation.
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.320]   Automation.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.520]   I feel like AI and automation are related.
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.720]   But anyway, let's take a little break.
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:30.560]   I do want to talk about the AR rumor because Ming Chikwos added again, or as you would
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:36.760]   say, Renee, Guoming Chi, but a job.
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:40.120]   I showed it a brought to you by Melissa.
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:42.640]   Well, we just were talking about it.
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:45.480]   Having accurate customer data is very important for your business.
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:48.400]   Now this is data your customers are giving your business.
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.720]   The problem is it's changing all the time.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:56.680]   Did you know 36 million address changes were processed by the postal service last year?
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:58.240]   36 million.
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:02.160]   That means a huge chunk of customers you could have the wrong address for.
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:07.400]   30% of customer data goes bad each year, but Melissa makes sure that your customer
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:10.600]   data is accurate and current.
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:15.160]   They've been doing this for 35 years, which explains why over 10,000 businesses trust
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:18.880]   the address experts.
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:21.000]   It's a way, it's money maker for you.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:26.480]   Well, at least it keeps you from losing money, sending bills, brochures, catalogs to the
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:28.200]   wrong person.
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:34.560]   Melissa has a renewal rate of over 92% because the typical return on investment, realizable
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:38.560]   Melissa customers is 25%.
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:40.280]   What can you verify a lot?
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:46.480]   Melissa's global address verification service verifies address information for 240 plus countries
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:52.800]   and territories, addresses, but also emails, phone numbers, names, people change their names.
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.200]   They get married.
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:56.360]   They decide they want to be called pumpkin.
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:57.360]   Whatever.
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:00.240]   Now you'll know, hi pumpkin.
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:05.400]   You can even add to your customer profile with public demographic information like marital
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:08.520]   status, social media handles.
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:11.720]   Melissa's flexible deployment options mean you can use it the way you want to use it.
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.640]   They've got an amazing API.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:18.200]   A lot of companies just add it to their customer service software so that when a customer service
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:26.280]   rep is entering names, addresses, phone numbers, they fix the typos, the errors on demand,
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:28.600]   as you go at the point of entry.
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:34.520]   Same thing for shopping carts and other data-based entry for the customers often get their address
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:35.520]   wrong.
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:39.080]   I used to type the wrong street address all the time when we first moved.
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:44.920]   Melissa has new apps on iOS and Google, the Lookups app, lets you search addresses, names
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:47.080]   and more at your fingertips.
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:48.720]   You can have it on-prem.
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:51.480]   There's a web service SaaS.
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:57.920]   There's secure FTP processing so you can upload and download a cleaned up address list.
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:59.880]   And don't worry, your data is always safe.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:04.120]   Melissa continually undergoes independent security audits to reinforce their commitment
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:12.160]   to data security, privacy and compliance requirements, SOC2 HIPAA, GDPR compliant, and also the best
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:13.160]   support.
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:16.480]   If you sign up for a service level agreement, Melissa's Global Support Center gives you
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:20.960]   the best 24/7 world-famous support.
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:26.640]   And G2 Crowds 2021 Grid Report Melissa scored 89%.
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:33.080]   This is, by the way, Melissa users voting 89% for ease of use, 91% quality of support,
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:39.240]   96% ease of doing business with, as well as 93% meets requirements.
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:44.720]   People love Melissa and that matches Melissa's commitment to providing the best data quality
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:47.080]   and address verification software.
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:50.760]   Make sure your customer contact date is up to date.

[01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:07.480]   Get started today with 1000 records cleaned for free Melissa.com/twit-mulissa.com/twit.
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:10.440]   Thank you so much, Melissa, for supporting us.
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.120]   They've been with us for some time now.
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:16.280]   And thank you, Mac Break Weekly listeners and viewers for using that address so that
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:21.280]   they know you saw it here, Melissa.com/twit.
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:23.800]   All right.
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:26.760]   Ming Chi Quosei, I say his name, right?
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.120]   Guo Ming Chi.
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:33.800]   Guo Ming Chi says, and by the way, he's an analyst with a supply chain, his fingers deep
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:34.800]   in the supply chain.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.680]   So he's a supply chain exfiltrator.
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:41.440]   He pretty much knows what's being made, I guess, what's being manufactured.
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:50.240]   He says, and actually predicted in March that there would be AR/VR, probably a mixed reality
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:56.240]   headset released next year, now more technical information to processors, one with the same
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.960]   level of computing power as the M1.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.960]   That's a pretty broad range.
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:04.840]   And then a lower end chip that's going to just handle input from the sensors, headset,
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:08.440]   he says, has at least six to eight optical modules.
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:10.200]   And that makes sense because it's a seal.
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:15.080]   It looks like a VR, the drawings we've seen look like a VR helmet.
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:16.080]   It's not a see-through.
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:17.160]   And he says, that's right.
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:23.120]   You'll get cameras, six to eight optical modules, which will provide video see-through
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:25.080]   for augmented reality.
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:28.040]   The headset is also said to have two 4K OLED.
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:31.360]   Now, I don't know if it's a mistake.
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:33.200]   Micro OLED displays from Sony.
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:37.880]   I guess in that size, they could be pretty expensive, but they would certainly look very,
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:42.880]   very good those micro OLED displays.
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:44.880]   What do you think?
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:48.200]   First of all, Renee, he's trustworthy to some degree, yeah.
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:52.400]   Yeah, I mean, he does make guesses based on what he sees in the supply chain.
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.080]   And those always come down to just like his experience.
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:55.720]   So sometimes he guesses wrong.
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:58.800]   And there's also been a lot of movement like Mark Grimman had a very similar story a couple
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:16:59.800]   of weeks ago.
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:02.800]   And then just this week, he said that all the timelines are actually much further out
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:04.400]   than he thought that they were.
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:07.480]   So I would take all of this with a very large-sized grain of salt.
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:12.120]   And also, this used to be this weird conflation in a lot of media articles where they think
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:15.240]   the VR headset and the AR headset are the same things.
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:16.240]   It's two products, right?
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:17.240]   They're not.
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:18.240]   They're too very similar.
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:19.240]   Yeah.
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:20.240]   Once like the VR headset's like an Apple TV.
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:22.840]   It's meant for you to have like this big display in your face and you'll be doing like
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:25.560]   Fitness Plus and watching movies and playing games.
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:28.120]   And the AR headset is meant to be like this convenience thing.
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:31.800]   We don't even have to lift your wrist anymore to see like the basic information around you.
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:34.760]   But that's many more years out than the VR headset is.
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:42.920]   This latest report, analyst report, Goh says fall of next year for the, I'll say VR so
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:44.720]   it's clear.
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:48.400]   But he also says it'll be a standalone platform.
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:52.640]   And this may be a case of him confusing the two products because it makes sense the AR
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.400]   headset has to be standalone.
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:57.400]   But the VR could be tied to something.
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:59.720]   Well, and it could be a configuration thing as well.
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:03.160]   So you might use your phone to configure it and get it set up.
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:04.720]   And then it runs on its own like a quest.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:07.080]   For instance, I have to code a Facebook to get it to run.
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:09.480]   And then I never see it again because my kids use it.
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:14.280]   But they come over every once in a while and have to re-register or re-configure something.
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:19.800]   So I think that potentially it would be easier to configure the headset with an iPhone or
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:21.520]   iPad or your computer.
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:25.000]   But then once you're in it, my guess is it probably has the processing power to do a
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.360]   lot on its own.
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.360]   I agree.
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:30.400]   It would be quite something if they could find, if they could create a wireless connection
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:35.000]   to an iPhone that is fast enough that the latency wouldn't just drive you nauseous
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:39.200]   within 20 minutes with a VR headset.
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:41.720]   He also said in the same phone.
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:42.720]   Go ahead.
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:46.200]   I was going to say that a watch is independent and dependent at the same time.
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:49.200]   I think that the interaction between the watch is a good model for what will be probably
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.480]   going on with the device.
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:56.240]   It's conceivable that the first device next year might actually be hooked up to an Apple
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:59.480]   TV or a computer in some form or fashion.
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:01.120]   And then the following one would be...
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:02.120]   I don't think it'll be tethered.
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:04.120]   You don't think it'll be tethered at all?
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.000]   No, I think it's going to be the way around.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.000]   Yeah.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.680]   The first one is going to be independent because it has Mac level processing on it.
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:12.520]   The second one, like a pair of glasses are just non-trivial.
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:17.040]   But it wouldn't be tethered, it would be paired to make this distinction.
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:18.040]   It would be paired, yeah.
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:19.040]   Right.
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:24.000]   Yeah, the way the original Apple Watch was and then over frequent subsequent generations
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.400]   it'll get more and more independent the way the Apple Watch was.
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:29.800]   I would love a pair of Apple Spectacles.
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:32.040]   In fact, that's what the quote says.
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:41.320]   He says they have a 10-year timeline to replace at least one billion iPhones with these glasses
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:43.320]   in the next 10 years.
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.320]   Okay.
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:46.320]   Well, that's more him and that's him.
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:47.320]   That's ambitious.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:48.320]   Yeah.
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.320]   Yeah.
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:52.880]   That's, you know, whenever I've seen, we've seen a lot of dates like this.
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:57.600]   People by 2025, oh, in the next seven years, oh, and whatever.
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:02.840]   Whenever I see those numbers, I always imagine that they got hold of some sort of communication
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:06.720]   or secondhand, some communication that said, well, if we're going to have to have some
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:07.880]   sort of a target just a little.
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:09.600]   Well, I could tell you where this comes from.
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:10.760]   What even says?
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:13.320]   This is Apple's sole ABF.
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:15.040]   I don't know what that is.
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:18.280]   Supplier, uni-micron will be the leading beneficiary.
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:22.400]   So this is clearly coming from uni-micron saying, yeah.
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:25.080]   We have an order for one billion of these in the next 10 years.
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:26.080]   Well, there you go.
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:30.840]   And who benefits from that saying, hey, we're getting this huge contract from this amazing
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:33.280]   company for a transformative product.
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:38.320]   Boy, if I could legally buy more stock in my own company, I would do so too bad.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:40.280]   I don't know what I can do with this information.
[01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:47.040]   All I was going for is that there's a difference between a date circled on a board.
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:50.680]   Someone in Cupertino said, this is going to be our target launch date and saying, well,
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:55.160]   we couldn't possibly get this together in any sort of a shippable order any earlier
[01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:57.560]   than this.
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:59.520]   And I did like an earlier rumor.
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:04.600]   I think he also provided, which is that their first release of this is going to be a lot
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:09.640]   like other VR headsets, which is this is not the thing that you go into Walmart or Best Buy
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:12.520]   and buy to play lightsaber games on.
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:16.640]   This is a developer sort of oriented release that's going to cost a couple of thousand dollars
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:21.680]   is not expected to be ready for again, some kid who just wants to play games or just wants
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:23.280]   to have an immersive experience.
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:27.280]   This is for people who want to develop the software that's going to be on another release
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:30.160]   two or three years in the line that I can definitely believe.
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.160]   A.B.F.
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:34.800]   The two problems that we have with the reporting is like, well, there's two larger issues.
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:37.920]   One is both the media is really bad right now.
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:42.400]   It's separating between what is a report and what is like the opinion attached to the report.
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:46.400]   Like we'll get a Mark Grumman official Bloomberg story that's been vetted completely inel
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:47.400]   report on it.
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:50.000]   Then you'll make an offhand report on like a remark on Twitter is news that are getting
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.680]   yeah, I think Apple is going to be interested in one day in this one day and it gets blogged
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:57.440]   exactly the same way as the vetted report.
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:58.440]   That's an issue.
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:02.280]   And then the other part is that like the things that Quo says based on his well, not just
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:06.160]   quote in general, but there's a lot of stories that come up about LG and Samsung displays
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:11.080]   for these devices that are in industry rags who sole purpose is to advocate for the deals
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:12.080]   that these companies want.
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:16.200]   It's a public negotiation tactic well known in the industry, but people report on it as
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.560]   if it's news and that completes a lot of this information.
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:22.000]   So uni Micron is a manufacturer.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:28.320]   They're building up big time to make more a B F. This is something known as the engine
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:31.280]   no moto build up film.
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:37.040]   It's a substrate part of the packaging that protects chips needed to power your computer
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:42.640]   or car and allowing communication among them, which is clear as mud.
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:46.800]   But this substrate is what's made by uni Micron and this is what he's basing this on is that
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:50.160]   you know, Apple is.
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:55.560]   I imagine what he saw was just like you said, Andy, maybe uni Micron named Apple.
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:56.560]   Maybe they didn't.
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:00.560]   But we're building these factories because we've got a very big client that wants a lot
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.640]   of I mean, you're looking at ship dates.
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:05.800]   If you think that that's the substrate that they would use and suddenly you see that whether
[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:08.560]   they say anything or not, they've suddenly ramped up production.
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:09.560]   Which they have.
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:15.240]   And you know, like you're going, well, you know, I think that I think that it's it is
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:20.400]   probable that Apple would release some would announce something in June to prepare developers
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:22.040]   and sell something in the fall.
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:26.160]   I think that it is almost certain they'll do it in 2023 if they don't do it in 2022.
[01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:29.880]   I think that it's close enough to the surface that it's going to be a big deal.
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:37.040]   And again, if it comes out, I think what we've watched is one of the more masterful roll
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:41.280]   outs of technology because what they're solving that I don't think that Facebook has solved
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:45.520]   very well is the development of the content and the breadth of the content is all these
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:50.040]   tools that they're building for developers for, you know, when you look at again, most
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:54.600]   of the features added to motion and final cut have more to do and even logic have more
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:57.240]   to do with the AR than they have to do with video.
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:58.800]   You know, and so there.
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:02.920]   So a lot of those tools are really built for something that isn't there yet.
[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:08.600]   And so that's in that is going to, I think, is something that they're correcting from
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:12.080]   what they did with iBooks, which is we didn't have any tools to build it.
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:13.080]   You know, like it.
[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:16.200]   And so the thing is, is that I think that Apple is in a really interesting position
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:22.000]   where they've spent five years, you know, paving roads for a city that didn't exist.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.640]   And now they're about to put drop that city into place.
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:28.520]   So it's interesting because ABF, it turns out, is one of the components that's causing
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:29.960]   the chip shortage.
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:35.880]   And it's predicting the companies that make ABF, by the way, are suddenly soaring in value
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:42.440]   because supplies of ABF are likely to remain constrained until at least 2025.
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:43.640]   And so that's why they're built.
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:46.520]   That's why you need my credit on these other companies are building these factories as
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:48.640]   fast as they can.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:51.560]   This is a key component that is part of the chip shortage.
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:52.560]   It's interesting.
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:56.040]   I think that I think Apple will probably charge two or $3,000 for these headsets and
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.320]   they'll sell as many as they can make.
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:58.320]   Yeah.
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:24:59.320]   Like, I don't know how many that is.
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:01.880]   I don't know how many they'll make, but they'll be with them.
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:06.120]   Contributing to the wavy timeline too is, can we make them?
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:10.680]   I think even if they make hundreds of thousands or millions, it's worth doing because they're
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:13.280]   going to start to be able to gather like what's working and not working.
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:14.280]   Yeah.
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:15.280]   Great.
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:20.800]   But also it's, I like the idea of a company at that scale deciding that our plan is not
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:22.760]   to own the market with the first release.
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:25.440]   We can't own the market because we don't understand the market yet.
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:31.080]   We're going to create a platform that we can, that makes sense for us to sell only 50,000,
[01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:35.360]   100,000 of them because, because the people who buy them are going to be people who are
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:39.080]   going to be very, very well motivated to accept that, no, it's not perfect.
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:42.160]   Yes, we're putting this in your hands because we need your input.
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:45.480]   We need your information and you will also benefit by being a year ahead of everybody
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:46.480]   else.
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:50.440]   This also plugs into the car where the car makes a little bit more sense when you realize
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:54.800]   that a start, if you think of Apple making, let's say if we agree that they're making
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:59.800]   a car, a startup car company doesn't have to start up making as many cars as they've
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:02.480]   made, as they made iPhones the first year.
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:06.880]   They can actually build just 10 to 20,000 cars and say that this was a good startup.
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:11.120]   If they made a good startup release, if they learned a lot from it and they put some cars
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:15.320]   in the road that made people see them passing by and thinking, well, gee, I've got still
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:19.000]   a good five or six years left in the car that I own right now, or my lease isn't up for another
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000]   two or three years.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.360]   But gosh, when it's time for me to get a new car, maybe I will be buying an Apple car
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:24.440]   in three or four years.
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:25.920]   So that's the sort of stuff I love.
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:30.360]   This is why I keep defending Google Glass because I thought that they didn't want to
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:32.280]   put it into every single store.
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:36.880]   They said that, look, we're going to release these in dribs and dribs.
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:40.320]   If you buy when you're going to have to come to an office and we will fit you for it and
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:43.640]   walk you through how to use it because we need to figure out what people are going to
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:45.600]   be using this for.
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:47.480]   You learned such interesting stuff from that.
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:49.640]   I mean, I loved Google Glass.
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:54.280]   And I think the thing that made it the coolest was the thing that was it's down far, which
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:55.280]   is the camera.
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:58.520]   The camera made it weird, but it was so powerful.
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:02.120]   Being able to give you a perfect point of view.
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:08.240]   The key is you could see the viewfinder easily and be able to show someone something or be
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:10.480]   able to show this is what your...
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:12.360]   I have pictures of my...
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:17.080]   It's my mean daughter when she was two or three years old or whatever with Google Glass,
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:20.400]   where it's a picture that you couldn't shoot any other way.
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:24.800]   I'm swinging around saying, "Okay, take a picture."
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:32.120]   And so I think that there's an incredible value in getting ahead of that, as Andy said.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:37.920]   I think that Apple, when I was watching speaking to my daughter again, last night she was doing
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:42.000]   some climber thing on the quest.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.120]   And she was seated doing this thing, doing something.
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:50.120]   And I realized, "Oh, if you had a self-driving car and you put those goggles on, you could
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:52.920]   be doing all kinds of things while you're going from one place to another."
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:56.840]   Like the two of them could possibly fit together really nicely.
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:05.960]   A couple of quick stories, some leaks of the new Swift Playgrounds 4.
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:11.240]   Developers who have access to it are NDA, but I guess not everybody keeps their word.
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:15.600]   And so nine to five Mac and others have pictures.
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:21.960]   Swift Playgrounds is interesting because it lets you build and submit your apps all on
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:25.400]   the iPad to the App Store.
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:29.080]   Here's some screenshots from nine to five Mac.
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:35.040]   Among other things that shows you how you can create your own icon within Swift Playgrounds.
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:36.280]   Wow.
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:46.880]   It also lets you preview and see changes in real time as you type, live editing.
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:48.440]   That's pretty cool.
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:52.880]   You can even do it when you share the project with someone else via iCloud Drive so multiple
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:55.720]   people can work on the same project at the same time.
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:59.600]   Apple kind of showed that at the WWDC this year.
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:04.920]   Users can test the app in full screen, explore SwiftUI, control search across all files in
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:10.440]   the project, use quick inline code suggestions, and switch back and forth between Swift Playgrounds
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:11.440]   and Xcode.
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:14.680]   What's really interesting is Swift Playgrounds was developed and released really as a way
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:17.320]   to teach kids how to learn how to code.
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:18.360]   It was very basic.
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:20.560]   It's gotten more and more powerful.
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:23.720]   Now it looks like it's actually a development environment.
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:24.720]   Yeah.
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:30.200]   I think the kids who learn programming and Swift with Swift Playgrounds soon prove that no,
[01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:34.880]   you can actually become really great commercial programmers just with the skills that you
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:36.800]   learn through this platform.
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:40.080]   I think it's one of all of Apple's successes.
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:43.920]   I think Swift Playgrounds is Apple's strongest, quiet success.
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:47.760]   The one that you don't really talk about, the one that doesn't point it to as an influence,
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:53.560]   but my goodness, if the goal was to make sure that the next generation of important Mac OS
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:30:02.280]   and iOS programmers don't really care about any sort of evolution of C++ in order to get
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:05.400]   things live, drive, and survive, boy, was that a success.
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:10.440]   It does look like you can actually write some Swift code in it, which is interesting.
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:15.480]   Apple, when they announced Swift Playgrounds 4 at WWDC, did not give a timeline, but it's
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:28.080]   according to 9 to 5 requires some features of iPad OS 15.2, which is now available as
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:29.080]   a beta.
[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:33.160]   I think that means maybe this will come out with 15.2, Renee, does that sound right?
[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:34.160]   Be later this year.
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:35.160]   I hope so.
[01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:36.160]   I mean, that's always my hope.
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:38.320]   Sometimes it's a quick further, but I always hope for the next release.
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:39.920]   This will be something to watch for.
[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:44.600]   Very interesting.
[01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:48.000]   Now it's time for the Problems report.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.880]   I am experiencing none of these, but I've heard from people.
[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:55.680]   In fact, I heard somebody on the radio should call me saying, "IOS 15 broke my Bluetooth
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:57.720]   hands free."
[01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:02.960]   And according to 9 to 5 some iPhone 12 and 13 users are reporting that you see it on
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:05.520]   Reddit primarily.
[01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:10.520]   And on the Apple Support Forum, the issue appears to primarily affect the drivers of
[01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:14.080]   Toyota cars and trucks.
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:20.120]   And some Audi and Volvo cars, but not quite as widespread.
[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:21.960]   One user called Toyota.
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:24.880]   They said, "We don't have any fix.
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:28.480]   Even our app isn't working properly."
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:32.600]   So maybe this is going to require a fix from Apple.
[01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:40.280]   One user said the iPhone was unusable for calls in his car because of dropping Bluetooth.
[01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:44.880]   So just be aware of another problem I'm hearing about.
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:46.400]   And I haven't experienced either.
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:50.680]   If you have a 16-inch, oh, I don't have a 16-inch, maybe that's why.
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:55.600]   16-inch MacBook Pro, some people are reporting that the MagSafe charger stops working when
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:56.760]   you close the lid.
[01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:58.960]   When you close the lid.
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:00.720]   Why would you ever close the lid?
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:03.240]   It's mini LED.
[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:04.240]   It's HDR.
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:07.480]   I have to say, why would you even plug in MagSafe?
[01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:09.280]   You can go days without it.
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.280]   So I don't know.
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:11.280]   Have you had that part?
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:13.160]   You're the only one I know with a 16-inch MacBook Pro.
[01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:16.480]   So a lot of people on Twitter that I really respect, they're like, "I just use it in
[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:17.480]   a clamshell motor."
[01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:19.280]   I'm like, "But that's one of the best displays you could buy.
[01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:21.520]   It's better than any of those standalone monitors.
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:24.720]   You have to spend thousands of dollars to get a display and you're clamshelling it."
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:26.720]   They're like, "I like what I like."
[01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:28.280]   And you want to get dust on it.
[01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:31.120]   Oh, for shame, for shame.
[01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:32.680]   Just use the display.
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:33.680]   Use it.
[01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:34.680]   Love it.
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:35.680]   Live it.
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:36.680]   Get a suntan.
[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:37.680]   It's beautiful.
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:42.600]   Yeah, just if you notice when you have the MagSafe plugged in, normally when it's charging
[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:46.880]   it's green, if you close the lid and it turns amber, you have the problem.
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:53.120]   And Apple's not saying anything yet, although according to when you throw it out.
[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:54.600]   A lot of these are Maverick issues.
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:55.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:58.800]   They'll be fixed in software updates.
[01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:02.880]   Apple has introduced a new MacBook upgrade program for business partners where you can
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:05.200]   pay it off over time.
[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:09.760]   Apple business partners can distribute the 13-inch MacBook Pro, MacBook Air or 14-inch
[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:17.040]   MacBook Pro or 16-inch MacBook Pro to staff for 3% of their retail list prices as monthly
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:18.600]   installments.
[01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:25.000]   So if you do the math, you get a 14-inch for 60 bucks a month, 16-inch for 75 bucks a
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.960]   month.
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:29.360]   There is no desktop as part of this program.
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:30.680]   I can understand that.
[01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:35.240]   There are a lot of businesses that are replacing their Macs with these new computers because
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:36.240]   they're so fast.
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:37.240]   Yeah.
[01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:43.920]   I mean, if you look at the phone, the computers, the car, all of those build a really great
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:44.920]   subscription service.
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:48.640]   Why don't you just pay a certain amount of money for all of these things and you get
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:50.120]   a new one when we're done with it?
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:54.040]   You know, I think that's the model is giant subscription services.
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:34:02.760]   Yeah, Micah found a post on Reddit by a developer from Reddit who said, "We recently found that
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:08.520]   the new MacBook M1 MacBooks cut our Android build times in half to a little math for a
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:09.520]   team of nine.
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:12.760]   You buy $32,000 with the laptops.
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:17.000]   It'll save you $100,000 over a year in productivity.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.320]   The break even point happens in three months."
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:24.880]   Yeah, and like for me, it's not even, like we talked about, it's not even that the times
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:25.880]   are faster, though they are.
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:30.280]   They're like 10 times faster, but it's being offloaded to discrete processing units.
[01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:32.920]   So the main CPU and GPU are freedom for me to do something else.
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:34.760]   So it's like having two computers sometimes.
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:35.760]   It's great.
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:39.920]   We live in a beautiful age.
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:45.040]   Anything else we want to talk about here?
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:50.040]   It's not really in our portfolio.
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:52.040]   We'll be certainly talking about it tomorrow on Twig and on Twitch.
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:55.480]   Jack Dorsey, suddenly abandoning his CEO role at Twitter.
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:57.920]   He'll stay at Square.
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:00.080]   Para Gagawal is taking over.
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:01.080]   He's a long time.
[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:03.920]   Actually, Ben Thompson had a great piece on this.
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:04.920]   Long time.
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:06.080]   He tweeted, "I love you," and then left.
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:07.080]   It was remarkable.
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:10.080]   In case you haven't heard, the next tweet was the same.
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:13.080]   I'm out of here.
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:16.120]   I'm just going around the store for some cigarettes.
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:17.120]   I'll be right back.
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:18.120]   Where did Daddy go?
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:20.920]   Stock went up 10% when they heard the rumor.
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:26.760]   Then when they found out that Argoa was going to take over, it started going back down because
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:30.880]   he's really the stock market saying, "What are you going to do to make some money Twitter
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:33.160]   and having somebody from the inside take over?"
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:34.160]   They want to dig back.
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:36.960]   Actually, Ben Thompson said, "Just start charging for Twitter, period.
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:38.600]   Just make it a paid service."
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:44.640]   Maybe make Twitter blue every other YouTube premium where it actually gives you valuable
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:45.640]   stuff.
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:49.160]   I paid for Twitter blue partly because I just want to support the service.
[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:50.160]   I don't know.
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:51.160]   I said that.
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:52.160]   It's like 10 bucks, but there's no ads.
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:53.760]   I mean, that'd be amazing.
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:54.760]   Yeah.
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:59.440]   Well, I think you'd probably do it for three bucks and just make it worthwhile.
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:00.680]   That's how much Twitter blue is.
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:01.680]   Make it worthwhile.
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:03.680]   I don't think they're making it.
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:08.440]   I'll say Twitter is amazing when you use the filters.
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:13.920]   My Twitter experience is so great, but I have 150 terms that I don't want to see.
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:15.400]   I literally just keep...
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:20.040]   If I see a tweet that I don't like, I just go, "What word in there can I search for?"
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:21.680]   and say, "Don't show me that again."
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:23.480]   I just put it in the list of the video.
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:24.480]   It's not standard video blocked.
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:27.120]   I won't see that again.
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:28.120]   The ads are...
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:30.200]   I mean, I blocked most of the ads just as a...
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:32.280]   To be passive aggressive.
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:33.280]   I mean, I know it does.
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:34.280]   I'm not going to make any less of them.
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:35.280]   I just want to...
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:36.280]   Yeah, and it doesn't make much difference.
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:39.480]   Your ads are not making them a whole lot of money.
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:45.240]   The problem is with ads is that when Ford ran an ad, I hit block and says, "Did you
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:46.240]   want to block Ford?"
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:47.240]   I was like, "Sure."
[01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:50.000]   Now, Ford can't even tweet to me.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.000]   The thing is that that blocking function inside of Twitter is devastating for the advertiser
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.840]   because you're actually destroying your own...
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:36:59.400]   Well, it's not an enemy.
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:00.400]   I just don't know.
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:01.400]   I don't see anything from that.
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:02.400]   I'm not angry at that.
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:03.400]   I just don't see...
[01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:04.400]   But it's not an enemy.
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:05.400]   It's kind of like, "I just don't want to play anymore."
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:07.400]   Because you're putting out into my thing.
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:08.400]   Yeah.
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:10.200]   Here's his illustration, Ben Thompson's illustration.
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:12.440]   Instagram is a laid back, relaxed experience.
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:14.720]   Watch is why its advertisements work well.
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:20.160]   He said, "Twitter is intense and combative and far more likely to be tied to something
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:23.440]   happening in the physical world, whether that be watching sports or politics or doing
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:24.440]   work."
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:30.680]   And so you're very unlikely to click an ad on Twitter because you're busy or you're
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:32.160]   doing something.
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:33.680]   You're doing something.
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:37.560]   So he suggests, I think he's probably right, that maybe the best solution for Twitter would
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:40.000]   be to make it a paid social network.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.080]   He promoted the blockchain guy, right?
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:47.800]   He promoted the NFTs and I mint every tweet as an NFT.
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:49.200]   Yeah.
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:53.240]   I thought Paragroal was a CTO.
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:54.240]   Yeah, he was a CTO.
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:55.240]   Yeah, he was.
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:57.720]   But he was in charge of Twitter's blockchain projects of which...
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:58.720]   Yeah.
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:37:59.720]   I still would love to know what that's supposed to be.
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:02.720]   I don't even understand what that is.
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:04.720]   Anyway, it's not really our story.
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:06.000]   Every tweet is a bit to the blockchain, Leo.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.000]   But you guys are...
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000]   You know, you Twitter users, so you can...
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000]   It'll be interesting.
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:16.560]   Once the founder goes, that signals a C change for every policy, every bit of dogma that
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:18.920]   exists within that organization.
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:23.720]   Microsoft change as soon as the last of the old guard left.
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:28.320]   When the founders of Google left, it's a lot of the...
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:33.040]   It's reputation as a place where we just pursue ideas just like it's a college campus
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:37.880]   and we make money off of some of them immediately went away in terms of, "We'll pursue ideas
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:38.880]   at some point.
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:41.160]   You got to show me the do-rae-me or else you're canceled."
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:42.520]   A company after a cover-gift company.
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:47.000]   I think Apple's probably the only company that kind of bucked that trend and probably
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.760]   because every CEO had such personal relationships with the one that came...
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:52.760]   Excuse me.
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:56.880]   Probably because Tim Cook had such a personal relationship with Steve Jobs and Steve Jobs
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:02.760]   created a culture of everybody who is in a leadership position there is essentially
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:07.000]   on the same boat steering the sales towards the same direction.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:10.400]   But we'll see what happens with Twitter, whether it solves all the problems or whether
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:12.560]   all the problems become just more so.
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:13.560]   Only one of them...
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:14.560]   But you're not going to want to...
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:15.560]   But you're not going to want to decide.
[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:16.560]   But you're not going to just leave as a founder.
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:19.160]   He's like a huge swipe at founders as CEOs on his way out the door.
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:21.440]   He was like, "I think we need a pause from this."
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:24.800]   Which is odd coming from someone who came back as a founder's CEO.
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:28.240]   There's just so much drama to this that we haven't seen yet.
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:29.240]   Yeah.
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:31.400]   And everyone's going to be getting to be speculating.
[01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:35.520]   And it could be as simple as this is just so extra.
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:37.880]   I'm a really, really rich man.
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:40.320]   I could be doing anything I want.
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:44.360]   And this is not what I want to do as a man who is now in his...
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:52.360]   I often think with a lot of these folks that have just an inordinate amount of money and
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:53.880]   they're getting so much trouble.
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:58.760]   I often wonder ago, because I personally, I mean, I have a lot of good ideas.
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:03.000]   I have a lot of ideas that I think are good.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.200]   If I had a lot of trouble with it, I'd be like, "Oh, I think...
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:08.680]   If I had all that money, I would just go, "I'm going to go do one of the other ones."
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:11.680]   I'm going to stop doing this one and start over again somewhere else.
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:21.240]   I don't know if I would do that, but I would definitely go pursue other ideas.
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:23.240]   He's doing full-time money.
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:24.240]   We just keep on doing it.
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:29.240]   This square is where the trendy Web 3.0 people are hanging out.
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:31.760]   It's much better than the goofy Web 2.0 Twitter.
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:32.760]   Yeah.
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:39.800]   Apple has announced new limited edition Beats Studio Buds with the colors of the African
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:43.960]   flag, red, black, and green, the Panac, African flag.
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:50.280]   And they will be available at the clothing store union, which of course is in Los Angeles
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:51.280]   and Tokyo.
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:53.000]   It's a black run business.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.280]   And so this black owned business, so this makes sense.
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:57.280]   It's pretty.
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:58.280]   I kind of like it.
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:40:59.280]   Are they?
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:00.280]   You like it?
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:01.280]   The studio buds?
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:02.280]   Yeah.
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:03.280]   They're good.
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:07.560]   After the problems people have been having with Samsung's Galaxy Buds Pro, infecting their
[01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:10.120]   ear, I'm not sure I want to put things in my ear anymore.
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:11.680]   I'm going to stick with it.
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:13.400]   You can get the AirPods 3 then.
[01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:16.560]   They go over the on the ear, not the on the ear.
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:19.680]   AirPods 3 go over the on the ear instead of in the...
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:21.040]   Yeah, they don't go into the ear canal.
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:22.480]   They just sit on top of them.
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:23.480]   So they're all in.
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:24.480]   I have the AirPods.
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:28.800]   In here and somewhere on in Pro Max, $550 waste of money.
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:29.960]   You got to wear the on.
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:33.000]   You got to put the AirPods Pro in and then put the AirPods.
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.120]   Because that way you can edit while you're talking to us.
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:36.120]   I like paying for editing.
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:42.800]   I bought the pen and I like to wear them on conference calls to blow people's minds.
[01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:43.800]   They're good for conference calls.
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:44.800]   They sound great.
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:47.360]   Not so good for listening to music.
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:48.840]   All right.
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:51.440]   Herman says Apple's still working on an air power like charger.
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:53.040]   I don't buy that for one moment.
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:54.040]   He says he thinks.
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:56.840]   Like says again, we have to start parsing because that's not a Bloomberg story.
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:57.840]   That's not a newsletter.
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:00.840]   And he says, I think he doesn't say people familiar with a matter of total.
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:02.840]   No, he's just making it up basically, right?
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:04.600]   Well, I feel like everybody can think anything.
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:06.200]   We think Apple does all this stuff every show.
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:08.040]   I think you'll just don't blog it.
[01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:09.040]   I'm bet.
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:10.040]   I guess.
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:11.040]   All right.
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:18.760]   It must be really difficult when other people are generating content based on the content
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:21.520]   based on everything that you say.
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:25.120]   On this show, we can say we I think often nobody says.
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:27.120]   And do you not go things?
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:30.920]   Well, well, sometimes and that's what the police come.
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:35.560]   But what I mean is that we can talk about how our beliefs or what we're concluding on
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:40.440]   on an Apple car is based on here's what we're thinking and here's what and we'll have some
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:46.560]   discussion on what we think Apple does as opposed to no, no, breaking, breaking news
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:52.560]   on Dylan's super hyper tech blog channel on YouTube, like and subscribe, blockbuster
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:56.560]   announcement revealed on confirmed colon.
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:00.160]   Apple is going to be developing a car, but only in limited numbers to begin with say
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:01.160]   Apple analysts.
[01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:02.160]   Yeah.
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:08.560]   Well, thank you for calling me an analyst, but.
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:09.960]   Apple is selling.
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:15.160]   No, I'm not going to do this story.
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:19.200]   Let's take a break actually because I think we've got some good picks this week and I want
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:20.680]   to get to those just a little bit.
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:21.680]   How about that?
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:24.560]   Plus, we haven't even started the great cats be yet.
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:25.560]   Okay.
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:26.560]   Really long novel.
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:28.760]   You guys didn't walk out of here so fast.
[01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:31.360]   We got like 20 minutes to get through the entire case.
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:32.360]   I'm going to read that.
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:33.560]   You filled the time very well.
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:35.480]   Our show today brought to you.
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:37.240]   We get to our picks in just a second.
[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:40.760]   Renee and Alex, I showed they brought to you by Wealthfront.
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:47.120]   All right, I know you got stonk memes up the wazoo and diamond hands and you're right in
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:48.360]   your rocket ship to the moon.
[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:54.680]   But can I tell you as fun as day trading is or buying individual stocks is it is not the
[01:43:54.680 --> 01:44:00.120]   way I would recommend or anybody I know would recommend building long term wealth.
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:01.600]   Now, it's fine.
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:07.200]   Have that little stonk fund all for your own, but really you really should be opening in
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:10.040]   a Wealthfront investment account today.
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:11.120]   The odds are not in your favor.
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:14.080]   If you're doing it alone, you should team up with Wealthfront instead.
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:15.360]   Investing is complicated.
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:19.480]   Sure, it's fun, but it's also a little bit like casino gambling.
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:20.480]   Not with Wealthfront.
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:21.840]   Wealthfront makes it easy.
[01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:24.680]   They have the right tools for every portfolio.
[01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:29.840]   You just answer a few questions, things about your time frame, what you're saving for your
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:32.960]   adversion or love of risk.
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:39.480]   And then Wealthfront will create a portfolio of globally diversified low cost index funds,
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:41.280]   personalized for you in just minutes.
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:43.720]   And that's such an important phrase.
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:44.800]   I want to say it again.
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:46.960]   You're not buying individual stocks.
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:53.720]   Wealthfront is creating a portfolio of globally diversified low cost index funds, personalized
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:54.720]   for you.
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:56.200]   When I say personalized, they really can.
[01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:59.120]   They've got clean energy funds, crypto trusts.
[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:01.320]   Yeah, you can get into crypto this way.
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:06.560]   Tech, hundreds of other investments, they even offer a socially responsible portfolio,
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:11.120]   which is a mix of funds built around human rights, climate change, sustainability and
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:13.640]   diversity for those of us in Northern California.
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:14.640]   This is it.
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:18.800]   Actually, I really think Wealthfront is a great way to go because there's no manual trades,
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:22.080]   no picking stocks, no watching the stock market every day.
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:28.880]   Not really, not only is that a productivity killer, it can really kill your feelings.

[01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:07.840]   I'm going to start with Alex Lindsey today because Shutterbug wants to know where you
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:13.600]   got that great shirt you're wearing.
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:18.440]   I like 80% of my wardrobe is from Eddie Bauer.
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:19.440]   Eddie Bauer.
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:21.200]   He says he's been trying to find it.
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:22.880]   Oh, see, that's the problem.
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:24.200]   It's the outlet.
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:25.920]   So he's been trying to find out the outline.
[01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:30.320]   So Eddie Bauer, the outlet is different.
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:34.240]   So the outlet gets different clothes than the main stuff they don't sell anymore.
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:37.760]   The other thing is this shirt is probably like five years old.
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:38.760]   It's been all over the world.
[01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:40.320]   I've got eight of these shirts.
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:43.720]   So if it looks like I'm wearing the same one, I have a lot of them.
[01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:44.720]   Sorry Shutterbug.
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:45.720]   Sorry.
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:49.720]   I could have a special feature.
[01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:53.160]   I can wash them in a sink in a hotel and they'll be dry by morning.
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:54.360]   That's the real thing.
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:59.520]   So I bought a lot of them when I was in the before times when I was traveling all the
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:00.520]   time.
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:04.120]   These were like my uniform except for when I wore a tie.
[01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:09.400]   I had one nice thing and then I had these and some other Eddie Bauer pants.
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:13.800]   So anyway, so what was I talking about?
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:18.760]   You're talking about some very famous beats.
[01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:22.440]   So I ran into this over Thanksgiving weekend.
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:26.440]   I was on Thursday and I was taking a break.
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:29.080]   I kind of worked a lot of Thursday, but I was like, I didn't even move.
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:30.080]   I need a movie.
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:35.360]   So I sat down and I don't know where the search came up that it came up as 808.
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:36.360]   There is a documentary.
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:40.560]   I guess it came out in 2015 on the 808.
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:42.520]   Not just an area code, baby.
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:45.240]   It's a rolling drum machine, man.
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:52.400]   The rolling drum machine basically created a lot of what we heard in the 80s.
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:57.840]   And what was really fascinating, I just found the whole thing fascinating, like of how it
[01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:00.960]   came out and how it suddenly became this huge thing.
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:07.560]   And I will admit that I'm a kind of a fiend for all I watch is music documentaries.
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:11.680]   And the new world has gotten so much better because there's documentaries on synthesizers
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:15.880]   and documentaries on just the use of electricity and music and documentaries from the Beatles
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:19.760]   and documentaries from the, you know, you start watching the Beatles documentary.
[01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:24.240]   I did, I did, I have to admit that I kind of goes on and on, doesn't it?
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:27.360]   I got about halfway through the first one and I was like, okay, this is going too slow.
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:30.480]   Yeah, you really just feel like you're sitting just watching the lads.
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:36.640]   There's some great moments was what I was left with is is John has his moments.
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:39.040]   You know, George is a hot head.
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:40.960]   John and George are both hot heads.
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:43.520]   Paul McCartney does most of the work and Ringo's just happy to be there.
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:44.520]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:46.720]   That's really the bottom of the guy.
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:47.920]   He's happy to be there.
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:53.520]   You know, and so anyway, but the 808, it just shows this incredible like machine that you
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:56.800]   don't recognize until you see it.
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:01.480]   And I will ruin a little bit of the ending of it just because it's, you want to watch
[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:02.480]   the whole thing.
[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:07.680]   But the thing that just is fascinating about this machine is that they only made, I won't
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:13.160]   tell you why, they only made 3000, only made them over three years, 15,000 of these over
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:14.160]   three years.
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:15.880]   And that's all that was ever made.
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:20.200]   And there's a reason for it and you find out that you have to go watch it.
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:25.480]   And it's, and it's the most fascinating reason that you stopped making a device that was
[01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:27.400]   super successful that I've ever seen.
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:29.080]   And you just have to watch, I won't ruin it.
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:30.080]   I was going to ruin it.
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:31.080]   I'm not going to ruin it.
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:32.080]   It is fascinating.
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:33.080]   Was it was it is.
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:34.080]   It's free.
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:36.760]   I didn't pay for it.
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:41.280]   And, and I, but it's, it's worth it just to see this kind of this evolution of how music
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:44.880]   kind of came together and they've got, it's funny watching the Beastie Boys, you know,
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:48.280]   talking about it because they don't really, the two guys that are left don't really understand
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:49.280]   how it worked.
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:52.480]   You know, Adam was the one that actually did all the work in that area.
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:54.400]   And so they're like, didn't that we do this?
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:56.280]   And then we did this and he's like, no, we didn't do it that way.
[01:50:56.280 --> 01:50:58.680]   And all I don't remember, you know, like this is why we needed him.
[01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:04.920]   And so, so, and so it's a really fun, um, uh, it's a really fun, it's a really fun
[01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:07.800]   documentary and drum track on sexual healing.
[01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:11.280]   Well, and they talk about the revere Whitney Houston's.
[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:12.720]   I want to dance with somebody.
[01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:16.560]   Well, and they talk about the one with, with, uh, with Marvin Gaye.
[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:20.720]   They said there was a guy in Belgium and he said Marvin Gaye just came in.
[01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:25.000]   He programmed the whole, the whole song and then sang it and then left.
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.000]   And that was it.
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.000]   That was actual healing.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.800]   Like it was like, there's nothing else there except for him and that in that advice.
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:33.640]   And, and, and then they said someone else bought it and belged him and they were like,
[01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:38.640]   Oh, they hit the, one of the presets and it was, it was that it was a built in preset.
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:40.120]   No, no, it wasn't built in.
[01:51:40.120 --> 01:51:41.120]   No, it wasn't a built in.
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:42.600]   He had left it on the machine.
[01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:45.080]   Oh, he had left it on like what he had done on the machine.
[01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:46.080]   Oh, okay.
[01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:47.080]   And then when they bought it.
[01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:48.080]   Yeah.
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:51.080]   Someone told them that, Oh, this was the one Marvin Gaye probably used and they were like,
[01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:52.080]   Sure, whatever.
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:55.640]   And then when they hit the first preset that they had that was pre-programmed.
[01:51:55.640 --> 01:51:57.920]   It was not when that someone had programmed into it.
[01:51:57.920 --> 01:51:58.920]   It was that song.
[01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:02.960]   So anyway, it's just, it's a really, um, and people trade them around again because there's
[01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:06.200]   not, they don't make, I mean, now, Beringer makes a new version.
[01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:10.720]   And what's funny is, so there's a Beringer makes the RD8, which is the remake of that.
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:15.600]   But the RD8 Mark II, which is coming out this, at the end of the year, what Beringer is
[01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:21.680]   changing between the RD8 and the RD8 Mark II is the thing that made them stop making them,
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:24.720]   made Roland stop making them, you know, interesting.
[01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:27.960]   So, so anyway, there's, there's a lot of intrigue.
[01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:29.520]   It's worth watching.
[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:32.400]   And just this music is so much fun to watch.
[01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:37.760]   Like music documentaries are just, I've watched the whole Beatles thing and there's actually
[01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:41.040]   three more, two and a half hours of just the guy's noodling.
[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:42.280]   Oh, that was not fun.
[01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:44.680]   It was a long, but I, but there are moments that make it work.
[01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:46.080]   Kerber enthusiasm for music.
[01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:47.680]   Oh, you don't like that either.
[01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:48.920]   I don't like that.
[01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:52.800]   Uh, the, there are moments that are making the whole thing worthwhile.
[01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:56.320]   I mean, watching all noodle around writing, let it be.
[01:52:56.320 --> 01:52:57.320]   Yeah.
[01:52:57.320 --> 01:52:58.320]   Yeah.
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:52:59.320]   That's kind of amazing to watch.
[01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:00.320]   So I really enjoyed it.
[01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:01.320]   I just have these three colors.
[01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:03.800]   I think it says, plinky playing them over and over and over again.
[01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:06.000]   Like, oh my God, he's writing, let it go.
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:07.000]   Oh my God.
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.960]   He doesn't know what he has yet, but he's going to, oh my God.
[01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:16.240]   It's, it's, I mean, you could have made a version that was two hours long of all the footage
[01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:20.000]   and then made another version for people who really want to watch the, the grass grow.
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.920]   Well, it's not, there's plenty, there's the little bit movie.
[01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:28.480]   There's plenty of ways you can get your, a, a bridged version of the Beatles, but some,
[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:31.800]   some hardcore fans like Peter Jackson, the guy who did it.
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:32.800]   Right.
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:33.800]   And I'll include myself.
[01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:38.640]   I'm watching it like a hawk because there are these moments where you go, you have to,
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:43.960]   if you really know a lot of Beatles history too, there's a little bit of stuff in there.
[01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:50.440]   Like, you know, at one point, uh, uh, is it George Martin or maybe it's, it's the, um,
[01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:53.240]   it's the guy making the movie Michael Hogg.
[01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:54.240]   Oh God.
[01:53:54.240 --> 01:53:58.520]   Says you could always go back to the Philippines and they, and they go, oh, and they leave
[01:53:58.520 --> 01:53:59.520]   it at that.
[01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:03.760]   But if you know what happened to the Philippines, it's like, oh yeah, you could.
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:08.480]   So, and I did, I did, I did enjoy when they, when they rolled in the multi, the multi track
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:12.400]   and George Harrison's like, well, we got to be careful with it because it's 10,000,
[01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:16.120]   it's my, it's my, it's it's cost 10,000 quid, you know, it's fine.
[01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:20.240]   And I let you my eight track cause the, cause apparently EMI wasn't willing to give them
[01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:21.240]   an eight track.
[01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:24.160]   Well, and the funny thing is one of the guys, I guess one of their tech guys said he would
[01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:25.320]   build one from scratch.
[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:26.320]   Yes.
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:30.080]   And, and, and, and I think George Martin said, we'd like to have one that actually works.
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:31.080]   Yeah.
[01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:32.080]   Okay.
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:33.320]   So you got a little bit out of this.
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:35.480]   I did, I did, I did, I did get it.
[01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:37.120]   There was just some point where it started to slow down.
[01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:39.720]   Like there was all these things at the beginning and then started to slow down.
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:40.720]   I have to go back to it.
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:42.200]   I think maybe I was just in a, not in the mood for it.
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:43.800]   Maybe I had too much caffeine or something like that.
[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:45.200]   And I, I need to go back and watch it.
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:48.520]   Cause there was a lot, I will say at that pace, I remember a lot of it.
[01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:51.320]   Like I remember, like, it's like, I'm, like, there's Lisa.
[01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:57.560]   And you know, she wanted to watch it, but she couldn't really take it either.
[01:54:57.560 --> 01:54:59.360]   It's one of those things.
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:02.920]   Glenn Johnson, a guy you're talking about the engineer, he said, it's a bunch of garbage.
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:05.840]   Um, but that's the, that's the movie.
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:08.080]   I think he shows up in there and it's very interesting.
[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:11.760]   For instance, as Paul's writing, "Let it be," Glenn Johnson leans over and says, you
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:13.440]   know, you should make that word.
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:14.440]   He changes a word.
[01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:15.440]   John says, oh yeah, that's good.
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:20.320]   You know, it means little things like that that people, I'm to me, like a super fan are
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:21.320]   going.
[01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:26.240]   And the other thing I thought you'd be interested in is how they took 16 millimeter footage
[01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:27.680]   and up rested to 4K.
[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:29.400]   And it looks really good.
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:33.680]   What's really cool is what Peter Jackson's doing with the technology that he used for
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:35.160]   all these movies.
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:39.280]   The 19th, the World War II was unbelievable where they showed you.
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:40.280]   Oh, wasn't that good?
[01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:41.280]   I loved that.
[01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:43.640]   And rebuilt it and re-corrected it and put all that stuff back.
[01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:47.440]   I meant to put sound effects back into it and you really felt like you were just there.
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:51.240]   You know, and so, so I love what, I love what Peter Jackson's doing with the, you know,
[01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:53.400]   doing something more interesting than just movies.
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:55.920]   You know, like I think the movies are great.
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:57.720]   And I think that what's interesting also is remember that.
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:55:59.320]   You know, man, now he just sold Weddah.
[01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:00.880]   So he's doing all right.
[01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:04.480]   Well, and well, and, and I think that that technology is going to be really interesting
[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:06.920]   to see how that goes under the unity umbrella.
[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:07.920]   Yeah.
[01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:08.920]   Yeah.
[01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:10.160]   There's a lot of really interesting things can happen there.
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:14.680]   Yeah, it's good for us since we're stuck with unity.
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:18.040]   Mr. Andy Enaco, your pick of the week.
[01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:22.440]   I got two cultural things to talk about.
[01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:26.800]   First of all, I'm joking around about Great Gatsby and it's okay for you to not like
[01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:27.800]   it.
[01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:30.920]   However, it's a perfectly excuse for me to drop a YouTube link for you.
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:37.560]   A friend of mine, Bill Knack, he, he was one of the most cultured, most interesting people
[01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:39.800]   I ever met in my entire life.
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:44.160]   He was a sports writer for Sports Illustrated for decades specializing in horse racing.
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:46.000]   His book is incredible.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:47.000]   On Secretary.
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.560]   He was, he was there when Secretary it was born.
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:51.640]   He was there when Secretary it died.
[01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:58.440]   He carried in his wallet for years and years and years a feather from Secretary at Stahl.
[01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:02.240]   That Secretary just sort of like blew off of his nose and sort of landed on Bill and
[01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:03.400]   he kept in his wallet for years.
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:06.040]   And then of course he was at an event in Massasworth Garden.
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:09.480]   The wall got stolen and he was just heartbroken about it.
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:13.520]   But he was, again, he was just one of the most amazing, amazing fellows.
[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:15.480]   He died unfortunately in 2018.
[01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:19.400]   But one of his, if you went out with him and if there was any sort of a group around him
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:24.600]   at some point in the evening, he would recite from memory the last page of the Great Gatsby.
[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:25.600]   No.
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:30.880]   And because he loved it so much and his reading of it was a work of art in and of itself.
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:33.440]   And so there's a video of him giving one of these readings.
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:35.240]   And of course it's shot by Roger Rebert.
[01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:37.680]   So the cinematography is pretty okay.
[01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:40.920]   And it's perfectly okay for you to not like the Great Gatsby.
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:41.920]   I don't think it's a.
[01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:44.880]   And there were hardly any lights except the shadow removing glow, the ferry boat across
[01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:46.520]   the sound.
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:51.080]   And as the moon rose higher, the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually
[01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:56.280]   I became aware of the old island here that floured once for Dutch sailors' eyes, a fresh
[01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:59.040]   green breast of the New World.
[01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:03.680]   Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby's house, had once panned and
[01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:07.800]   whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams.
[01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:12.960]   For a transitory enchanted moment, man must have held his breath in the presence of this
[01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:13.960]   continent.
[01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:18.120]   And this is why Alex Lindsay does not read fiction right there.
[01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:20.120]   Not the end.
[01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:23.120]   I bet you didn't even get to the end.
[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:24.120]   I didn't get to that part.
[01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:26.600]   I really would have loved it if I'd seen that part.
[01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:28.080]   But I was gone.
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:31.920]   I got I got I got to the last like 30 pages and I was like they're not going to test anything
[01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:32.920]   more.
[01:58:32.920 --> 01:58:33.920]   I'm just going to read things.
[01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:34.920]   And I'm done with this.
[01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:35.920]   No, Alex, I'm reading.
[01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:38.120]   I did the exact same thing.
[01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:39.880]   It was it was one of those novels.
[01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:42.600]   It was the wrong time for me as a teenager.
[01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:47.080]   And as a particularly something that I was supposed to read, or I could go to the Brooklyn
[01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:52.160]   Booksmith and give them a dollar and a half and they'll sell me a little like yellow book.
[01:58:52.160 --> 01:58:54.160]   I will explain what the book is.
[01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:55.160]   I don't have to do it.
[01:58:55.160 --> 01:58:57.360]   And then I use that to get to before the cliff notes.
[01:58:57.360 --> 01:58:58.680]   I went for the Monarch notes.
[01:58:58.680 --> 01:58:59.840]   Monarch even better.
[01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:00.840]   Yes.
[01:59:00.840 --> 01:59:01.840]   What's the other pick?
[01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:07.040]   The other pick is my the my vote for the best single Christmas album that in existence.
[01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:09.240]   Ella Fitzgerald wishes you a swinging Christmas.
[01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:12.520]   To me to me it's a lot of great ones out there.
[01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:14.320]   This is my nomination for the greatest one.
[01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:18.400]   If you listen to this from start to finish, that will put you right in the December mood.
[01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:23.400]   No matter what holidays you observe or don't observe, this will put you in a pretty good
[01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:24.680]   swinging mood.
[01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:25.840]   I recommended it last year.
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:28.560]   I kept getting so many people like content.
[01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:29.560]   Oh my god.
[01:59:29.560 --> 01:59:31.000]   And that is the greatest album ever.
[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:32.720]   Thank you so much for recommending it.
[01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:38.840]   So I wanted to make sure that this on December, December Eve, we get that new people's queue
[01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:40.640]   as early as possible.
[01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:42.640]   That's obviously on all the streaming services.
[01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:43.800]   Apple Music Plus has it.
[01:59:43.800 --> 01:59:44.800]   Everyone has it.
[01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:46.440]   And but yeah, it's great.
[01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:49.320]   Renee Richie pick of the week.
[01:59:49.320 --> 01:59:50.480]   So this is weird.
[01:59:50.480 --> 01:59:52.880]   It's Disney Plus and I know a lot of people are super familiar.
[01:59:52.880 --> 01:59:54.720]   We were just talking about a lot of the properties.
[01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:55.720]   Apple Plus.
[01:59:55.720 --> 01:59:57.560]   What's Disney Plus?
[01:59:57.560 --> 02:00:01.240]   Disney Plus is Disney's streaming service available in an increasing amount of places.
[02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:05.680]   And unlike a lot of companies, Disney resisted the urge to sub license out everything they
[02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:06.840]   possibly good.
[02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:08.400]   So they have a rather unified library.
[02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:10.480]   I mean, like try to find Star Trek internationally.
[02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:14.280]   And it's a huge brew-ha-ha because they tried to extract every penny of sub license and they
[02:00:14.280 --> 02:00:15.280]   could from it.
[02:00:15.280 --> 02:00:19.160]   But chances are, if you go to Disney Plus, you'll find Marvel, you'll find Star Wars,
[02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:21.560]   you'll find them up bits, you'll find like everything you expect.
[02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:23.200]   You'll also find the Beatles, by the way.
[02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:25.640]   I don't know if they own the Beatles, but that's where Get Back is.
[02:00:25.640 --> 02:00:28.520]   Well, I mean, they had the money to give it to Peter Jackson to get some beat.
[02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:29.520]   Maybe that's it.
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:30.520]   These things are a virtuous cycle.
[02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:33.320]   But one of the things that I found really interesting, and I know some people, especially
[02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:36.880]   like, including some people who I usually respect, right on this panel, aren't the biggest
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:40.280]   fan of the way that a lot of this content is serialized.
[02:00:40.280 --> 02:00:43.360]   But I was watching some of the newer stuff, like they've just got out the trailer for
[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:47.600]   the Book of Boba, which is a new Boba Fett show with Timur Morrison coming out over the
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:48.600]   holidays.
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:53.640]   And the Hawkeye show has just started, which has a real Christmassy sort of die-hard vibe.
[02:00:53.640 --> 02:00:57.320]   And it's it occurred to me that we don't really get serialized content on the scale
[02:00:57.320 --> 02:00:59.080]   in North America anymore.
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:03.480]   We used to, I mean, famously Star Wars and Indiana Jones were based on those Saturday
[02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:07.600]   morning serials that you'd go to and there'd be the ongoing adventures of Superman and
[02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:09.560]   all sorts of things every week.
[02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:11.160]   And of course, in Asia, they're huge.
[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:14.440]   Like some people have real trouble with a lot of Asian narrative fiction because it
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:15.440]   doesn't end.
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:21.000]   It's just perpetual adventures like Journey to the West or, you know, the iron crane or
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:22.160]   the deer in the cauldron.
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:25.640]   It's just like things just keep on going and you pick up whenever you want.
[02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:27.160]   And I'm not going to say they're soap operas.
[02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:29.280]   I'm not going to not say they're telenevellas.
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:32.600]   But they do have this thing where the stories grow and get richer.
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:36.520]   When you do get lost, you do get found, you have some that you love, some that you hate.
[02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:40.280]   But they're doing something that sort of unprecedented is they're doing it at Hollywood
[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:41.280]   scale.
[02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:46.560]   So you have these shows and these movies and the more you watch of them, the richer the
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:47.840]   sort of experience becomes.
[02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:49.400]   And I'm not going to spoil anything.
[02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:55.720]   But if you got to the finale of the last series of the Mandalorian, like people of my generation
[02:01:55.720 --> 02:01:58.040]   are just like totally lose it.
[02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:01.400]   Like you can go and watch the YouTube videos of people reacting to that.
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:06.320]   And it's because they've chanced upon these directors, these producers, people like John
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:12.760]   Favreau and Dave Filoni and Kevin Fahy, who really love the source material, respected
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:13.920]   enough to treat it well.
[02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:18.760]   They don't just look at it as exploitable IP and they've woven these stories.
[02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:21.560]   And now the book of Boba Fett looks fantastic.
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:25.280]   I know some people are tired of tattooing, but I mean, like you hear a salacious crumb laugh
[02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:28.400]   and you're like right back in Return of the Jedi.
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:32.840]   And Hawkeye, the setup is this young girl who lost everything.
[02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:38.160]   Her last memory was seeing him save the city in the first Avengers movie and it ties into
[02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:41.240]   who she becomes in the beginning of these movies.
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:43.480]   And this sort of payoffs that you can get.
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:47.800]   I'm not going to go on much longer, but it was a scene in Batman Beyond years ago where
[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:53.240]   old Bruce Wayne thinks the new Batman is in trouble and puts on the armor one last time.
[02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:57.480]   And you can't get to that emotion if you didn't watch the original Batman, the animated way
[02:02:57.480 --> 02:02:58.720]   back in the day.
[02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:03.480]   So they've really found this again, some wins, some lose, but there's a reward to be had
[02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:06.600]   and there's no better time than the holidays because all of it is just there and just
[02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:07.600]   streaming.
[02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:08.720]   Shang-Chi just arrived.
[02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:12.920]   So you can watch all of this stuff now in IMAX experience, which is pretty good.
[02:03:12.920 --> 02:03:15.240]   I watched a bunch of them over the last week.
[02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:19.440]   So if you haven't yet, it's a good time to go and just watch your way through all the
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:21.480]   Star Wars and Marvel stuff that's up there.
[02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:25.560]   I guess I deserve this because I spent too much time talking about the Beatles.
[02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:27.680]   Sorry.
[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:29.880]   That's my punishment.
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:32.600]   I was always reading Wushow books, Leon, it occurred to me.
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:34.800]   Just because we don't have that in Western culture.
[02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:39.120]   And I love Wushow, like all those Chinese stories so much that I realized we do in fact
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:40.120]   have that.
[02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:41.120]   I will watch Shang-Chi.
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:42.120]   You're right.
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:43.120]   I should.
[02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:44.120]   It's really good.
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:45.120]   Yeah.
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:46.120]   It was a really good movie.
[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:47.120]   We really enjoyed Shang-Chi.
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:52.040]   And I will say that the series is probably what we're going to see as the future is we're
[02:03:52.040 --> 02:03:57.720]   going to see less and less feature releases.
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:04:00.560]   Don't just make more money though on a feature if it's a hit.
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:01.560]   Not if you're new.
[02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:03.600]   Holding onto subscribers is way more valuable.
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:08.440]   It's way more predictable and way more valuable than that's all the math.
[02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:15.760]   The math is holding subscribers to your service is way more predictable.
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:19.000]   Like you're looking at all these people on the rock, hitting the rocks with their boats,
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.240]   trying to release these films.
[02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:25.280]   I think everyone's pretty clear that the behavior is not going to go back to where it was before
[02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:26.280]   when we go back to it.
[02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:31.400]   And so the era of the Golden Age of the Future film is probably over.
[02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:34.440]   And I think that the it doesn't mean that there won't be any.
[02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:36.240]   Like radio is still here.
[02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:37.240]   We still have theaters.
[02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:39.840]   It's not, but it will be different.
[02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:44.160]   And it'll probably much fewer screens, much fewer releases.
[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:47.760]   And most of it, because when you put all money into the actors and you put all the money
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:51.720]   into all of the sets and everything else, stretching it out over six hours or eight
[02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:56.880]   hours and then putting it out slowly so that people can watch it over time is just the
[02:04:56.880 --> 02:05:02.480]   ROI is on a predictable ROI of 100 million people paying seven bucks a month or whatever
[02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:03.480]   is.
[02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:04.480]   It's really good.
[02:05:04.480 --> 02:05:06.000]   You know, it's a lot of money.
[02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.600]   I owe you Andy for this pick of the week.
[02:05:08.600 --> 02:05:15.280]   It was your pick of the week, but I finally got a Merry Christmas present from Kevin Noke.
[02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:16.280]   And I'm very excited.
[02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:18.560]   He actually sent me a bonus gift.
[02:05:18.560 --> 02:05:19.920]   So I'll show you both of these.
[02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:24.880]   You mentioned this a couple of weeks ago, and I immediately ran to Etsy and bought it.
[02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:28.960]   And he ran through his entire print run.
[02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:37.480]   This is the, they call it the Delta Pi, which is a Raspberry Pi case designed for the Raspberry
[02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:45.040]   Pi 4 that looks exactly like, well, something you might recognize.
[02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:46.240]   It's really Kevin you did.
[02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:49.400]   Yeah, there's his now I can't find design.
[02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:55.480]   My problem is I don't have a Raspberry Pi 4 and I can't get one because they're getting,
[02:05:55.480 --> 02:06:01.120]   you know, I got as soon as my came, I thought what turned out to be like must be the last
[02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:02.120]   Raspberry Pi anywhere.
[02:06:02.120 --> 02:06:03.120]   Yeah.
[02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:07.080]   And I'm waiting for like deadlines to like lose their hold of my.
[02:06:07.080 --> 02:06:08.960]   Which a beautiful project.
[02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:12.680]   And he even has a fan in it and wires it up so that you can have a light on the front
[02:06:12.680 --> 02:06:13.680]   when it turns on.
[02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:15.880]   And also so that the power switch will actually work.
[02:06:15.880 --> 02:06:18.680]   Raspberry Pi's don't have actual like power switch.
[02:06:18.680 --> 02:06:22.200]   You just unplug it unless you have a hardwired switch and software that does it.
[02:06:22.200 --> 02:06:23.200]   Yeah.
[02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:24.200]   So can't thank you Kevin.
[02:06:24.200 --> 02:06:25.200]   That's the right texture.
[02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:26.920]   There's there's no like 3D printing lines.
[02:06:26.920 --> 02:06:28.520]   It has that sort of sandy.
[02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:29.520]   It feels exactly right.
[02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:30.520]   Sort of like texture to it.
[02:06:30.520 --> 02:06:31.520]   Perfect.
[02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:34.280]   The logo is as close as he could make it without getting super super.
[02:06:34.280 --> 02:06:35.520]   It's got an acorn.
[02:06:35.520 --> 02:06:36.520]   I think.
[02:06:36.520 --> 02:06:38.520]   The nut shell pie.
[02:06:38.520 --> 02:06:39.520]   Yeah.
[02:06:39.520 --> 02:06:43.160]   But yeah it's also Raspberry Pi's are just plain fun.
[02:06:43.160 --> 02:06:45.640]   It's like it's great to have this thing on your desktop because you're an apple nut.
[02:06:45.640 --> 02:06:49.560]   And by the way you can easily put an emulator on it so it will run anything that a fraud.
[02:06:49.560 --> 02:06:50.560]   Oh yeah.
[02:06:50.560 --> 02:06:51.560]   It's great.
[02:06:51.560 --> 02:06:52.560]   It's probably right.
[02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:54.360]   Even as well as that Mac.
[02:06:54.360 --> 02:06:55.360]   God's probably.
[02:06:55.360 --> 02:06:58.520]   Is it a 2 FX or is it a 2 CI or what do you.
[02:06:58.520 --> 02:06:59.520]   What is it exactly?
[02:06:59.520 --> 02:07:01.400]   I would probably say 2 SI.
[02:07:01.400 --> 02:07:02.400]   2 SI.
[02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:07.520]   Because I actually have a 2 CI actually in the other room there.
[02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:11.120]   And the 2 SI is more of like a mini tower sort of design.
[02:07:11.120 --> 02:07:15.360]   This looks more like a like a kind of like a small version.
[02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:16.640]   Yeah but it's so perfect.
[02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:19.320]   It reminds me how much I really like frog designs.
[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:20.320]   Well look.
[02:07:20.320 --> 02:07:22.040]   And I didn't even order this.
[02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:23.480]   He sent me this.
[02:07:23.480 --> 02:07:25.600]   This might look a little familiar to you.
[02:07:25.600 --> 02:07:26.760]   Yes.
[02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:30.440]   This is the original Apple Mac mouse which I had.
[02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:31.440]   But it's a real mouse.
[02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:35.320]   It's an optical mouse built into a 3D case.
[02:07:35.320 --> 02:07:37.360]   I don't see that he's still selling these.
[02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:40.520]   Kevin I guess you've sold out of them.
[02:07:40.520 --> 02:07:42.280]   He's not even on the Etsy store.
[02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:43.280]   No.
[02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:46.560]   Oh these are the coolest things ever.
[02:07:46.560 --> 02:07:52.560]   It looks just like my Mac my 128K Mac mouse.
[02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:54.480]   It's an optical mouse right.
[02:07:54.480 --> 02:07:57.400]   When you have this thing I haven't built up this yet.
[02:07:57.400 --> 02:07:59.840]   He did send me like the mouse as well.
[02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:03.680]   I had that up and running and it's like oh my god.
[02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:06.760]   I'm in junior high or high school again.
[02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:10.760]   What noise I will never ever be able to afford this thing at this computer store.
[02:08:10.760 --> 02:08:15.800]   But I'm going to stay here as long as I can before they kick me out.
[02:08:15.800 --> 02:08:18.800]   It is now the official studio mouse.
[02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:20.400]   I'm plugging it in.
[02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:23.360]   We're throwing away this old wireless mouse.
[02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:26.280]   I will be using this mouse from now on.
[02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:27.280]   One button but I'll manage.
[02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:28.280]   I'll survive somehow.
[02:08:28.280 --> 02:08:29.280]   Exactly.
[02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:31.080]   Kevin thank you.
[02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:32.920]   He is still selling.
[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:38.720]   Actually this mouse is not on so let me turn it on so I can click things.
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:41.200]   He is not selling the mouse unfortunately.
[02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:45.880]   But I bet you if we talk nicely to him he'll sell.
[02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:51.280]   It's an Etsy product which means that he'll make a run and then he'll stop making run
[02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:52.280]   for a while.
[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:57.120]   But if you keep like coming back at some point you'll see oh I'm making eight more so please
[02:08:57.120 --> 02:08:58.120]   buy these immediately.
[02:08:58.120 --> 02:09:01.560]   I think he has these actually available in limited quantities.
[02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:02.560]   He does.
[02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:03.560]   Etsy.com.
[02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:04.560]   No key one.
[02:09:04.560 --> 02:09:05.560]   N-O-K-I-O-N-E.
[02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:09.120]   The price has gone up a little bit.
[02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:10.120]   I noticed.
[02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:14.400]   The price is up but again this is not hey I just downloaded this 3D file from Thingiverse
[02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:16.200]   and I printed it off my Amazon.
[02:09:16.200 --> 02:09:17.680]   No this is handcrafted.
[02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:21.960]   This is as good as you could possibly hope for this to be.
[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:23.640]   Worth every penny if you like this sort of stuff.
[02:09:23.640 --> 02:09:26.040]   It's just a beautiful thing.
[02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:27.280]   Thank you Kevin.
[02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:29.880]   Merry Christmas to you too sir.
[02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:35.120]   Christmas came early to the quit Eastside Studios.
[02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:38.320]   Thank you Andy and Naka what are you going to be on GBH next?
[02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:44.840]   A little late this week I'm on Friday at 1.20pm but you can stream me live or later at wgphnews.org.
[02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:46.280]   Very nice.
[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:50.440]   Alex Lindsey, office hours dot global.
[02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:52.280]   You guys just blowing me away.
[02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:54.920]   Where'd you cook this weekend or did you cook?
[02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:56.640]   We had a week off.
[02:09:56.640 --> 02:09:58.040]   Thanksgiving weekend.
[02:09:58.040 --> 02:10:05.080]   We're taking a this coming week we're moving to Sundays for our cooking so that I can go
[02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:08.840]   to the farmers market on Saturday with my daughter.
[02:10:08.840 --> 02:10:12.880]   So anyway but it's gotten to be so real.
[02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:18.960]   We've started to have people show up in our after hours that I can't say on the air but
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:23.480]   you just go I can't believe this person's hanging out with us on in after hours and so
[02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:25.560]   this really getting interesting.
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:30.280]   I'm designing on Mondays I'm designing my new studio I'm rebuilding the room here and
[02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:32.880]   so we're just having this big conversation about what we put in it.
[02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:33.880]   Everyone gives me advice.
[02:10:33.880 --> 02:10:34.880]   Office hours.
[02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:37.360]   It's like you should change this over here move this over there.
[02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:44.560]   Office hours dot global and of course you can hire Alex to build your studio at 090 dot
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:48.120]   onaomedia dot com.
[02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:52.800]   Renee Richie YouTube dot com slash Renee Richie what are you working on?
[02:10:52.800 --> 02:10:57.560]   I'm working on a review of the iPhone 13 series and then the Macbook Pro that should
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:10:58.560]   both be out this week.
[02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:01.080]   Has your opinion changed?
[02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:03.960]   No I mean there are there are things that I like and things that I don't like and things
[02:11:03.960 --> 02:11:07.320]   that I thought I wouldn't like like getting pro res off of an iPhone without having something
[02:11:07.320 --> 02:11:11.720]   faster than a USB 2.0 connection is proving really really painful.
[02:11:11.720 --> 02:11:14.800]   The battery life is astounding so that there's a lot of good and a lot of bad and I want
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:15.960]   to make sure I cover both of them.
[02:11:15.960 --> 02:11:20.040]   Did I make a mistake staying with my iPhone 12?
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:23.560]   I mean it depends on what's a priority for you if the battery life is good enough and
[02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:26.760]   it's fine if you really want longer battery life where you want 120 Hertz display.
[02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:28.560]   It depends what your pain points are Leo.
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:33.200]   Yeah my pain point is writing a thousand dollar check is my pain point.
[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:35.800]   Well you think it really says got that phone.
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:38.120]   You don't compare and see how she tells you.
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:39.120]   She deserves it.
[02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:40.120]   She's earned it.
[02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:41.120]   I am going to stick here with my Raspberry.
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:43.680]   Well I'm just saying like you can compare and see if it's compelling enough difference.
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:46.440]   Yeah I can and I have.
[02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:51.920]   And A Richie is at youtube.com/renarichiwe or Mac break weekly.
[02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:55.360]   The show is every Tuesday 11 am Pacific 2 p.m. eastern.
[02:11:55.360 --> 02:11:58.720]   8 1900 now 1900 UTC.
[02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:01.600]   You can tune in and watch us live at live.twit.tv.
[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:07.040]   People who are watch live often chat live in IRC and IRC.twit.tv.
[02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:12.880]   There's also a great discord channel for Mac break weekly viewers but you must be a club
[02:12:12.880 --> 02:12:13.880]   twit member.
[02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:15.560]   Have I mentioned club twit lately?
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:18.760]   Club twit is I think the best deal in podcasting.
[02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:20.280]   I don't care what Apple says.
[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:22.360]   Seven bucks a month gets you ad.
[02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:24.800]   A little Gatsby actually.
[02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:29.120]   Ad free versions of all of our shows plus access to the discord which is more than just
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:30.120]   a show chat.
[02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:32.920]   It's chat about every topic Stacey does her book club there.
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:36.760]   We have a untitled Linux show in there and those shows by the way also make it to the
[02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:38.160]   twit plus feed.
[02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:43.800]   That's bonus content from things you wouldn't hear necessarily on the podcasts.
[02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:48.440]   If you're interested and we sure appreciate our wonderful members all you have to do is
[02:12:48.440 --> 02:12:50.560]   go to twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:54.680]   Some very exciting stuff coming up in the next couple of weeks and months on the club
[02:12:54.680 --> 02:12:57.760]   twit discord and the feed.
[02:12:57.760 --> 02:12:58.760]   Join now.
[02:12:58.760 --> 02:13:00.800]   Be a good Christmas gift for somebody.
[02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:03.320]   If you just want one show ad free I should mention this.
[02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:11.640]   Apple does offer $2.99 per month per show subscription so if you're using Apple podcasts
[02:13:11.640 --> 02:13:16.520]   you can pay for one show and get ad free versions of this show or any show you like.
[02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:22.160]   After the fact everybody can download ad supported versions of our shows from the website twit.tv
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:25.560]   in this case twit.tv/mbw.
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:30.040]   If you like ads you can get even more if you go to youtube.com/makbreakweekly.
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:33.680]   We put the shows video up there as well.
[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:36.240]   You can also subscribe of course in your favorite podcast player.
[02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:41.040]   In fact that's probably the best way to get it so you get it automatically.
[02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:48.280]   If you do do that please by the way please leave us a 5 star review and that way we'll
[02:13:48.280 --> 02:13:50.280]   all benefit.
[02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:55.160]   More people can learn and maybe someday apple will even acknowledge us as a podcast.
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:58.000]   It's only been 15 years.
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:01.840]   Thank you everybody for joining us we'll see you next time now get back to work cuz break
[02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:04.240]   time is over.
[02:14:04.240 --> 02:14:05.240]   Bye bye.
