[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   It's basically me and Andy.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Welcome to MacBreak Weekly, Leo Laporte here.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Andy Anaka from the Chicago Sun Times is there in beautiful Baston area.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Actually, at this point, I think it'd be funny if I just signed off now
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   and just saw how well you did all by yourself.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Let's do a monologue.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Let's not do this halfway.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Let's just go all the way and make this as big a disaster as it possibly could be.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   I was telling it.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   We had a show lined up, but I had a last minute cancellation.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Scott Born is somewhere in the, like, is he a bricy,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   somewhere out in the canyon country?
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Yeah, he said an email.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Again, one of those emails that fills you with one of those instant senses of envy
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   describing this beautiful, wonderful place that is spectacular for photography,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   but not so good for having actual Wi-Fi.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   No Wi-Fi there, yeah.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   So we'll get some great pictures back.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Alex Lindsey is on a plane to Japan.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   We were supposed to have Will Shipley of Delicious Monster filling in,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   but he doesn't seem to be online or answering his email.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Rich Segal, good news from Bearbone Software.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Will join us in about 15 minutes.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Meanwhile, and you know what?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   You and me, babe.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   That's all we need.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   We need to break out that sunny and share material and start doing some delats.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   I got you, babe.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   There's plenty of stories to talk about.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   We'll just launch into those and when Rich gets on the line,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   there are actually a lot of stories that have to do with developers.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And so I think it actually will be good to have somebody like Rich on the line.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   And plus, this can be like one of those, like, role-playing gaming sessions
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   where if one of the players decides to, like, bag it for one week,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   we get to play his character.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   I'll be Scott Born.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Exactly.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   We'll be setting Scott Born ahead, like, to test out for traps.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Scott will be veering the line and it's Dan.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Well, I stand far behind watching.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   So I thought you might like this TypePad journalist bailout program.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Do you see their offering?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Yes.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   As soon as I saw that, I thought...
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I think it was a double whammy week of benefits for print journalists
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   because first Dr. Pepper offers a free Dr. Pepper to the entire world
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   because the Chinese Democracy album shipped in 2008
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   and Dr. Pepper bet that basically promised that if this album ships any time this year,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   it won't get the free Dr. Pepper.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   So that's another food item, which is a semi-perishable food item,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   always appreciated in this times of a constructing market.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   But also, any out-of-work journalist can get a free,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   by pro account on TypePad and start his own blog and get promotion.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Great.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I feel a little bit like that downed RAF fighter,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   who, like, offered preferential treatment,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   like, in exchange for going in front of the microphone and saying,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   "Capitalism is dead."
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   We'll call you Tokyo Andy.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   It'll be great.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Yeah, Tokyo Andy.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Ah, that press.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   There's no future.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Well, PC Magazine did actually say we're going to stop doing a print edition.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   We talked about that on Twitter a little bit on Sunday.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Man, you know, it's tough times for computer magazines,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   but you write for the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   I mean, this is a very well-established newspaper.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   It's been around for 150 years.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I think you're all right.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I'm okay, particularly -- well,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   there's within the sphere of the Sun Times, I'm okay,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   because, I mean, good heavens, who -- I would never have guessed 10 years ago that I turned
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   down a staff position at a newspaper for all the right reasons.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   I mean, the money was going to be better.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   The benefits were going to be better.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   It certainly would have been a more prestigious position than being a freelancer,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   but I found the work that I had in front of me more interesting than the staff position.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   But who would have -- I'd never would have guessed 10 years ago that that would have been
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   the sensible, safe decision to make if I wanted a continuing career as a journalist.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   As a freelancer, as someone that they only have to pay X dollars per column to with no
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   benefits, with no other overhead like that, you know, I just keep surviving.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   As a matter of fact, I've been picking up clients left and right as it becomes more important to
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   have people with an online presence who have bring their own audience.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And also, I mean, I've been doing more things with the Sun Times now that they want to make their
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   website, their web experience a lot better.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   I'm doing web videos for them.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   I'm sort of trying to encourage them to say, "Look, here are the things that I got for
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   free as soon as I moved my blog to WordPress.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   How come you're not making this just as easy on SunTimes.com?"
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   And that's been turning around over the past year.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   I suspect that people with these digital skill sets are not the ones getting laid off.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   The ones are getting laid off of the ones who need these free type pad accounts so they
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   can understand what a blog is.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   You know, they're the non-technically literate guys.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   And well, I think that -- well, I think that print journalists get a really bad rap that's
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   undeserved for not getting digital publishing.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Most of the journalists that I know and that I worked with have their own blog presences,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   that they've never really felt a need to really invest in.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Ah, I see.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Because they're paid a lot of money to write for print and their audiences are already in
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   print.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   So it's not that they're unfamiliar with it.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   But I mean, you forgot to say, because you talk about Roger Ebert's blog.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   He started blogging this year and his blog has turned into a monster hit where you just
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   know that every time he has ideas for articles and columns that may not necessarily fit into
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   the format of a newspaper column, it turns into a blog post.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   And because he is justifiably so, one of the most beloved personalities in journalism,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   he for some reason has attracted the most erudite and knowledgeable and entertaining commenters
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   in the blogosphere.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   I mean, you see, there'll be 100 comments and of -- 100 comments and of them, only 10 are
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   roughly translated as, "Hi, I would like to be able to tell my friends that a conversation
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   with Roger Ebert."
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   No, most of them are actually very thoughtful, very interesting.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   But he's always been a little bit of a counterculture figure because of beyond the valley of the
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   dolls and that kind of thing too, right?
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   I mean, talent always wins through no matter what the --
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Yes, there you go.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   That's the tagline.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   That's the bottom line.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   And I agree with you on that one.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Anyway, thank you, Typehead.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Exactly.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Again, every bit helps.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   You're using clothing in good condition, canned goods.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Those are pretty good too.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   We'll take it.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   It doesn't matter.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   We can't -- we can't eBay this free Typehead account, but, you know, anything happen.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Every little bit helps.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   If we can raise just one dollar more for laid off New York Times colonists than we did in
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   last year's telethon, it will -- staying up for 24 hours in a tuxedo will have all been worth
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   it.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Am I right, Leo?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   I agree.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   It's for the kids.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   It's for the kids, Andy.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   It's for the kids.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   It's for the kids.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   It's for the kids.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   It's for the love.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   It's for the love.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Do and the thing.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Hey, Snow Leopard.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Hey, I'm Andy Jordan Hubbard, a little leak from Apple's Director of Engineering of UNIX
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Technologies.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   They brought him over, of course, from the BSD group.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Jordan was doing a presentation to the Lisa Conference.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Get this.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   I've got to go to this conference next year.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   The Large Installation System Administration Conference, Lisa Conference.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   He said, "I don't even know what that is."
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Large Installation System Administration.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   It's like mainframe administrators.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Really?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   I don't know.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   I haven't heard of it myself, and I got that from people who have just have to manage hundreds
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   and hundreds of systems.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Maybe that's just it.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Okay, just a lot of seats.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   You've got a really big seats.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Yes.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   He says, "It looks like Snow Leopard."
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   According to this slide, I'm looking at on Infinite Loop, the Infinite Loop blog on R's
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Technica, that Leopard will be superseded by Snow Leopard first quarter 2009.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   14 months, 14 plus months after Leopard was released.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Actually, this is an interesting slide because it shows the amount of time between major
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   OS releases.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Public Beta was September 2010.0.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Cheetah was March 2001.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Puma was eight months later.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Jaguar, nine months later.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Panther, 14 months later.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Tiger, 19 months later.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Then we went a long wait.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   More than two years, 29 months between Tiger and Leopard.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   We're back to that 14 month cycle it looks like for Snow Leopard.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Yes, I don't know what to make about that.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.500]   You would think of this just sort of underscores a lot of the Scuttlebutt, which is that this
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.000]   is not a major release.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   This isn't something that's going to be revolutionary for anybody.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   This is just everything that all the un-pop kernels at the bottom of the bag that never
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   made it into previous releases.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Maybe you can explain this line then to me.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   A big part of Snow Leopard's plumbing.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   This is from ours Technica again.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   We'll deal with Grand Central and OpenCL.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Basically, what this comes out to is the ability to multi-pro-obviously, the ability to multi-process.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Now we're talking about multi-processing across a network.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Largely, I don't know how that's going to be articulated.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   In one way, this could mean the ability to say, "You're doing a final cut render.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   I see four machines on the network that have given approval to this that aren't being used.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Why don't we just steal some bandwidth from these three unused machines?"
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   I think mostly what we're talking about though is the ability to more efficiently use multiple cores
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   in the same desktop.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Right.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   That's good.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   You want to make sure that that ability is there so that people...
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   First of all, so that when multi-core machines, for instance, like the NaHalaM,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   which I imagine the next Mac Pro will be NaHalaM-based, i7-based,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   come out that the operating system can take advantage of it.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   People throw more cores at a problem that it gets faster that it actually can handle that.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   That's the kind of under the hood stuff that nobody notices, but is very important infrastructure for our control.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Exactly.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   That should be a really big leap in performance.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   We're talking about really simple, below-the-line features.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   They've just upped the amount of system memory you can throw into one desktop.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   I think it's got to like 16 terabytes or something like that.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   That's going to be another feature, Snow Leopard, where it's not going to help you find a good deal in a car online.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   However, it's a reason why you're not going to need to have another special system extension in three years time
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   when suddenly you can buy a four terabyte memory module for $80 on Amazon.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   SAP-DN is saying in our stick M chat that OpenCL was created by Apple.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   It stands for Open Computing Language.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   It's a language for programming, heterogeneous data and task, parallel computing across GPUs and CPUs.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   It's a control language for multi-processing, essentially.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   I admit that when I see OpenCL, OpenGL, when I see IWSLM, I have to say, "Okay, is this what I'm remembering it as?"
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Or is this what it actually is?
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   And this is going to be, again, I'm sure that the most profoundly and luxuriously neck-bearded product managers
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   are going to get their day in the sun with Snow Leopard because this is the day that's going to be all about infrastructure.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   It's going to be about repairing roads and bridges.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Those aren't the sexy, wonderful, really cool projects that you like to run a campaign on,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   but you need it in order to make the city run, so to speak.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Here was a surprise.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Did you see this that the iPod Touch has a faster processor than the iPhone 3G?
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   This is according to Touch Arcade that the iPhone Touch ARM processor is running at 532 megahertz
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   while the 3G is running at 412, about 20% slower.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   And they noticed it when they were developing, they do games.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   3G rendering speed was significantly faster on the iPod Touch.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   So if you want the gaming platform.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   And then the speculation is, well, maybe, well, there's two reasons why that would be one battery life, of course.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   You might underclock it on the 3G, just to save battery life.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   But the other might be, perhaps we'll see a push, although I think we would have seen it for the holiday season
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   for the iPod Touch as a gaming platform as a PSP killer.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Yeah, but that's, yeah.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Which could be...
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Which could be incredibly big.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   I mean, it's a really great...
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Well, I hold this truth to be self-evident.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   I mean, that's the first mobile gaming...
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   The first phone gaming platform that I thought was really worthwhile of the moniker.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   When you see apps on the iPod Touch and the iPhone, you really see that it's like having a pocket version of the Wii in your hands.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   I mean, I've said that I have much more fun crashing X-plane because the controls for controlling the yoke of your virtual plane
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   are so cool and so responsive that I have successfully flying any other flight simulator
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   anywhere else.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   But I'm not sure what Apple would do if they were able to say, "Hey, our processor on this gaming machine is much better than
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   the processor on our 3G phone.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   The one that you're paying 60 bucks a month just to operate."
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Yeah, I'm sure they didn't want this known.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   And of course, they never did publish the specs on the processor publicly.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   So this is just something somebody has deduced.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   I didn't... I had no idea that there was a difference between the two and now...
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   I mean, this report really spurs me on to get my iPod Touch out and just do some side-by-side stuff with them.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Yeah, I haven't noticed any difference.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   But I have to say, I love... I mean, I'm buying so many more iPhone games.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Yeah, and I probably will put it now.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   I'm going to see... I'm going to put them on the iPod Touch and see how they work.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   It's just so much more credible, though, as a gaming platform because the iPhone really has staked out its territory
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   as that device that you take with you that has every other device inside it.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   Where the BlackBerry might still be better as strictly a gaming platform...
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Excuse me, strictly as an email platform.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Other ones might be better at media capture.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   They have certainly better cameras.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   But if you want that one device that does the best at being the one device for everything,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   I certainly wouldn't want to carry around a PSP with me.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   I have a PSP and I've even only taken on trips like two or three times when I'm at a certain stage in a game
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   where I just don't want to forget.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   I don't want to lose that muscle memory.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   So I'll take it with me on that week.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   That's pathetic.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   It's not about me, Leo.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   It's about my squad.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   We're not going to take out that German pill block and send the signal that the rest of the two
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   performance can cut.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   If we don't make some sacrifices...
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Got to keep that four finger tapping.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   If it means that I have to hand over my boarding pass with my left hand while I continue to strife villages
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   with my right hand, that's what's going to happen.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   That's what's going to happen.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   I think, you know, let's face it, I think that for the teenage gamer, the iPhone is not going to be,
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   you know, it's not going to kill the DS or the PSP.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   But for the adult casual gamer who...
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   I mean, this is a good use for a phone.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   I mean, I think you've even alluded to this in the past.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   The time that I play games the most is when I'm standing in line or I'm at DMV as you were last week.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   And I got to kill a few minutes.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   It's really nice to have some fun games, although I'm sad to say I ignored my virtual villagers
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   and I logged in last night and they were all dead.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   I killed them all.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Maybe it was plague.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   It was damn French.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   It's the French.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   I blame the French.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   They started dragging cowcork horses into the house of walls.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   This is what happened.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   It's what happens.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   So I've got a bunch of skeletons in my virtual village.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   And now I just don't have the heart to start over on that one.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   I just think that, you know, I would spend money for that game if you live...
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   You know, I just think that if people die, the villagers should dig the graves for them.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   Or maybe they do.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   No, they do.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   If you have any left, the problem is they're all dead.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   So they're just going to have to lie there because there's nobody to bury them.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   If I had even one villager left, I could bury them all, but I would still die out.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   You have to have one male and one female if you want to have any hope of.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   I've heard.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   I've been told.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   Oh, you never had a little speech?
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   I believe it's my understanding that the game design is such that you need a boy and a kid.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   You need a boy and a girl to continue on.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   If I just logged in three days earlier, I feel so bad.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   This is a good point because this shows off the deficiencies of the iPhone's application
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   architecture that you cannot have.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Two applications running side by side and talking to each other.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   If I also...
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   If I had this virtual village game, I also had like my virtual pets.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   They could have worn it.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   I think...
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   No, no, I think the whole thing should happen is that like the dog should smell all these decaying bodies
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   and be able to run over and start feasting.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Oh, God, that's awful.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   I was thinking the nice, happy thing.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   There's trouble at the mill, Leo.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Your virtual villagers go help them.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Read the New York Post sometimes.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Okay.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   This thing happens.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   It's just part of nature.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   It's nature's place.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Your toys and the circle of life, the circle of life for you.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   You know, maybe this is a co-inkeating, but there was an odd odor of decay out our back door
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   about two days ago.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Maybe they were trying to tell me something.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   No, that was just Windows Mobile 7 coming in.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   [laughter]
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   You didn't ship the Windows plant, you know?
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   All the locals know closed their windows.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   I do want to thank all the folks.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Last week, we were talking about a desktop tower defense and Alex Lindsay said, "Just
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   thank God there's no desktop tower defense for the iPhone."
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   And of course, about eight people sent us field runners.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   And I literally, I must have killed 20 hours trying to get my little guys, you know.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Actually, I'm not trying to get them across.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   I'm trying to keep them from getting across the field.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   It is really fun.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   It's a great...
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   It is.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   If you like desktop tower defense, it's a very good implementation.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Very hard to play.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   The best thing I can say about gaming on the iPhone is that I try not to game on the iPhone
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   because they're so good that I wasted so many times trying to clear up stages on my motorcycle.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   I spent so much time trying to do...
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   To fly and land that plane.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   That's like, "Oh, wow.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   It sure got dark.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   Got dark.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   No, it's five o'clock in a hour.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Standing in your hands.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   That's no good."
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   It's bad when my son says, "Are you playing with your phone again?"
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   Yes, I am.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Don't you have homework, Dad?
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   He's really...
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   He gets angry.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   He gets actually visibly angry.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Well, he knows what the economy is like.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Dad shouldn't you be getting a job?
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   You know, UPS hiring.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   They always need extra truck loaders during the holiday season.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   This time of year, you're absolutely right.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Apple has given, as you may remember, a Microsoft really hard time on Vista advertising and,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   you know, a little bit for Vista.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Vista a lot for advertising.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   Well, it turns out from some folks who put a Bnet, Leslie, Lindsey Bakley, who's Blakely,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   a Bnet as a former business 2.0 reporter, actually kind of did the data mining and the SEC filings
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   from Apple.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   In 2008, the fiscal year ending last September, Apple spent, remember Microsoft said $300 million
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   to support Vista.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   In 2008, Apple spent $486 million, nearly half a billion dollars on advertising.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   The year before $467 million a year, before that $338 million.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   I think that's very telling.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   You know, no wonder Apple's eaten Microsoft's lunch in the perception game.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Yeah, I just didn't know what to do with this story.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   I mean, is the big blockbuster that Apple actually has an advertising budget?
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   No, no, no, I guess not.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   And really, Microsoft, if you add up all of their advertising budgets well over a billion
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   dollars each of those years.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   But it's not normal.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   I don't know.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   I guess it's kind of staggering to think of spending half a billion dollars on advertising.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   And I just would like to get 1% of that.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   That's all I had.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Exactly.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   Well, well, online that now I don't know whether I should make fun of this or.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   No, no, no, you go ahead and make fun of it.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Oh, I could never take.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   We could not believe it or not.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   I would not take Apple advertising or Microsoft advertising just because of the fear of what
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   would, you know, the perception.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   Hey, let's let's bring Rich Segal and he's available now.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Hey, Rich.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Hi, Leo.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   How are you?
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   I am great.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Let me add you into the conference with Andy Inaco.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Rich Segal is the man behind bare bones software, the developer of BB Edit, which is, you know, kind
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   of the definitive Mac editor.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   And by the way, the new is it version nine is really fantastic.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Well, thank you for saying.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Yeah, it is version nine at the end of August.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   So though, it seems like eons ago now.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   I just loved it.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   You know, and I had kind of I confess I'm a post state.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   I had moved over to text, mate.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Chiefly because of its integration with things like Ruby on Rails, but boy, when I tried
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   nine, I just I immediately moved back over to it and upgraded because it's just fantastic.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   Right.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   That's and you know, it's always nice to hear when when when people are happy with the work
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   we've done a lot of hard work went into nine point out.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   So we're pretty thrilled about it.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:34.160]   Just Andy and I were just talking about Apple's ad budget, which we found out thanks to a reporter
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:40.000]   at Bnet that it was half almost half a billion dollars last year.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   And as Andy said, you know, well, are you surprised?
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   I guess I guess it just seems like such a lot of money.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.400]   I just just just a finish I was going to say it was I this is the sort of story that always
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:57.280]   just gets me a little bit itchy because you see this in political blogs all the time where
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:01.680]   it's not so much the piece of information that that's important to get out.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.520]   It seems like it's important for people to use this information to underscore the reasons
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:09.600]   why they're they're defensive, why their opinions are absolutely true already think
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.600]   it's on this.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.480]   Oh, well, no wonder why so many people like Apple products look how much money they spend
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:17.760]   on advertising that you know, that I keep telling you that iPhones are terrible and that
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:21.400]   the Mac and Toches are made out of compressed bits of cheese, but no one will believe me
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.400]   called out.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.400]   I've been vindicated advertising.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:28.680]   I knew there was a reason why they're the number one maker of no more makers of portable music
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.680]   players.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.680]   Right.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.680]   It's funny.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:36.480]   I was sort of wondering why my Mac Pro got so soft during the summer, but now I understand
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.480]   it is made out of compressed cheese.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.000]   It's a little bit of cheese.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.680]   I guess the real question is when I when I hear that that you know, Apple spent half
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:50.120]   a billion dollars on advertising, my initial reaction is, wow, that's a whole lot of TV
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.120]   time.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:57.440]   And of course, there's more to it than just TV time, but my other reaction is, you know,
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.400]   what is the significance of that of that number?
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.960]   Why?
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:03.960]   Why is it?
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.520]   Why is a big deal made of that number?
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.200]   I don't have an answer for that.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.080]   It's certainly a big number.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.080]   I wish I had that kind of money, but I don't.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.160]   Well, that's what that's what I said, Richard.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:20.280]   If I can only get a little bit of that for for to it, I'd be happy, happy, but it is,
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.400]   you know, when you're seeing numbers that big, it's because, you know, a Super Bowl
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.760]   adds a million dollars.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:29.080]   It adds up pretty quickly when you buy TV time, a national TV time.
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.520]   And you know, there's a reason why everybody knows the I'm a PC.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:33.520]   I'm a Mac ads.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.040]   I mean, because they play all the time.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.040]   Yep.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.040]   Yep.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.520]   And that costs money.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:40.520]   So you're right.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.320]   And I agree with you, Andy.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.640]   I think some people will probably say about this.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:49.800]   Oh, this, that's why everybody likes Apple, but it's not why everybody likes Apple obviously.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:56.280]   And yet let's remind everybody that advertising in a downtime and advertising is just as important.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.920]   Rich, do you advertise it all for bare bones?
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:05.160]   We do, we do some web banner placements and we do a couple of other sponsorships here
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.160]   and there.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.240]   We've sponsored tidbits on and off for a number of years.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:14.240]   And we recently sponsored John Gruber's during fireball RSS feed.
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.240]   Well, that's neat.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.840]   Do you do that more as an altruistic thing?
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.720]   I mean, word of mouth is so good, especially on BB edit.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.400]   Word of mouth is very important.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:31.880]   My opinion is that if somebody you know and trust says something good about the product,
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.920]   it's going to mean more to you than if the person who sells you the product says something
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.160]   good to you about the product.
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.080]   So word of mouth, you can't pay for it.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.080]   You can't buy it.
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.840]   You just love it when you've got it.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:51.240]   Advertising is important because it sort of helps keep the visibility out there.
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.480]   It helps keep the notion in people's head.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:59.280]   They trip over an ad for your product and the neurons that were starting to go stale
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.280]   get refreshed.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.280]   Right.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.280]   Oh, that's still around.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.280]   Oh, there's a new version.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.280]   Exactly.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.280]   Yeah.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.280]   Exactly.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:12.480]   So in fact, I probably I don't remember how I noticed there was a new version.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.960]   And see, this is this is what I'm the kind of guy you need to reach because I'm not using
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:16.960]   BB edit.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:21.760]   So I don't see the hey, there's a new version announcement in BB that's right.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.760]   That's right.
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:27.480]   So you need to reach me and I must have it probably was on tidbits and and I or I saw
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:31.760]   review, which was probably also equally important to you.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.440]   Yes, definitely.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:38.160]   We had a we had a very nice review and in a recent issue of Mac world and whenever review
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:44.240]   whenever anybody reviews your product or or blogs about it, there's again, it's it's
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.040]   that word of mouth kind of thing.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.040]   Just works really well.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.040]   It's very effective.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.040]   Well, yeah.
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.880]   And and of course, there is the power of cheese.
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:27:00.200]   Now, if I see bolt using a BB editor, then I'm going to say I've got to have that.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.920]   He was you did I didn't see the movie yet.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:02.920]   Has anybody seen bolt yet?
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:09.400]   Apparently, bolt, which is a cartoon dog voiced by John Pravolta uses an iPhone.
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.040]   I hadn't noticed that.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.040]   Did you didn't see that?
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.240]   And I haven't seen that movie.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.920]   Now, that's got to be part of the advertising budget.
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.760]   You know, they're paying.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:22.880]   Of course, it's Disney and jobs is on the board.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:23.880]   It's true.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:30.800]   But that and and that's another angle of advertising and you sort of have to wonder beyond TV time
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.200]   how much Apple pays for placement.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:37.520]   Yeah, because of course, advertising isn't just about ads anymore.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:44.360]   It's about placement in or visibility in media or venues where you'd otherwise not be visible.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.040]   They pay good money to see somebody's MacBook appear on screen.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:49.040]   Right.
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.040]   I mean, that's significant.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:55.680]   And you know, things like in 24, the good guys all used max and the bad the terrorists
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.880]   all used PCs.
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.880]   Right.
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.880]   That's priceless.
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.880]   That's it.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.800]   And I don't know if that's subliminal or it's pretty close to it.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.600]   I mean, that's programming people.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:10.240]   We're talking about the Big Bang Theory, you know, just before the show that's like there's
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:14.880]   it's it's wonderfully ecumenical where the scientists they everyone seems to have their
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.800]   own choices and desktop.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.240]   And you know, like Sheldon uses a Dell.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.240]   You can see the space to see the brand names.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:26.840]   However, I did have to point out that, you know, Rajish uses a Mac book.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:31.600]   And that's the I think the reason why he does that is because there's only one machine
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.360]   over the course of two seasons that's actually been shown in operation.
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:40.600]   The producers know that look, we need to have an actual eye shadow session going works.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.600]   We better go with the Mac, right?
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.600]   Oh, no.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.600]   Come on.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:48.440]   I think it has something something to do with the fact that Hollywood is very mackish.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.440]   Yes.
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:53.360]   And but the thing is you notice that there's a little sticker covering part of the Apple
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.560]   logo.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.640]   So you know that that's not a placement.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.800]   That's something that every time you see like a little bit of an obscurement on top of an
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.360]   Apple logo or any other product logo part of it.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:08.800]   There's someone actually explains to me who works in intellectual property in Hollywood
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:14.760]   that part of it is because they like to have as clean quote unquote, a scene as possible.
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:18.200]   So that if you know, if they want to use something as a murder weapon, you know, Budweiser
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:21.560]   can't say, you know what, we really didn't appreciate it when you used a Budweiser bottle
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.040]   to slash that hookers throat.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.720]   It really wasn't good for us.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.480]   You know, that'll come up when it comes to kind of issue it on DVD.
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:31.520]   But mostly it's because they want to have the opportunity to sell that placement if they
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.760]   so choose.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:37.680]   And so whereas the producers are absolutely free to use whatever they want, if they obscure
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:42.920]   the logo, then that it that that underscores the value of Apple giving you a certain amount
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.000]   of money to actually have that product placed on there.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   That's a good point.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.440]   And now that and I did not understand how much it costs and how the money works on producing
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.240]   these movies and these TV shows.
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:58.880]   So many of these shows are actually relying on or not the not the networks but the production
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:03.120]   companies are relying on that placement money to make their weekly budgets because season
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.200]   two, you know, everyone gets to renegotiate their contracts.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.200]   Maybe the cost always go up.
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:12.880]   There is a reason why a certain character gets to stay on the cast and doesn't, you
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:17.360]   know, it doesn't have this wonderful opportunity to promote it to the federal government version
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.960]   of law enforcement.
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:24.320]   That's because he won an extra $40,000 episode and they were able to say, well, tell you
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:28.480]   what, what if every time what if they start drinking Snapple instead of just generic bottles
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:32.200]   of juice with that help just go right.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.880]   What if they start drinking Coke instead of black and white call?
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:41.920]   Well it goes it goes the other way too because there's a bolt application for the iPhone,
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:42.920]   which is interesting.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:43.920]   They got that on.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:44.920]   They were able to get that on the iPhone store.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.640]   Although, you know, I see I see an article about it, but I'm actually looking on the
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.640]   iPhone store.
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:50.640]   I don't see it.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.640]   Maybe bolt got banned.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:52.640]   I don't know.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.640]   It's it's it is interesting.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:59.080]   I mean, I I have seen only one movie in the actual year.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:06.080]   I finally got to see Wally like this week and for a Pixar Pixar Pixar Pixar movie, there's
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.600]   almost no apple presence in there.
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:12.160]   You see, you hear you're thrilled to hear like apples class.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.240]   You hear the bong.
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.760]   That's the best ad ever.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.120]   But exactly.
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:20.240]   It's like but but you know how many people associate that bond with a Mac 5.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.440]   Also, if they associate that they're gonna say, you know what?
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.640]   I really want to go out and buy a Mac S.E.
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.640]   Where do I go?
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.440]   Well, no, you go to the landfill.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.920]   You can get you get one right there.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:34.920]   But even when there is the appearance of an iPod, it's not a modern iPod.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:40.280]   It's not I it's something that I identify initially identified as a knockoff iPod.
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:41.640]   It really wasn't very present.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:46.040]   So I was very I was a little bit surprised to find that the overt iPhone placement was
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:51.480]   in was in bold and not, you know, a more intensely apple associated movie.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:55.040]   Although I've read a New York Times review that says that part a great part of this movie
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:32:00.880]   is sort of like to make fun of the Hollywood culture and you know, attitude and of course
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:04.520]   and then you got either you got your crackberry or you got your iPhone and if you're being
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.440]   photographed, you want to be seen with an iPhone.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.120]   Yeah, not the not the blackberry.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:14.160]   The Rhino Ball is the name of the bolt application on the iTunes iPhone store and it is rated
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.620]   four plus it has good ratings.
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.540]   It looks and it's free.
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.160]   This is a great way to market a movie.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.160]   What a great way.
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.760]   See, in the next in the next time you can complain about product placement, you know, this is
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:24.840]   the exact same thing.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:29.480]   I'm willing to I'm willing to have this product placement and react in exchange for having
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.120]   a really cool fun game.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.120]   Right.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.120]   Free.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.120]   Free free free free free free free free free free free free free free free free free free free.
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.120]   I guess there was a casino rail.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.120]   Somebody told me there was a casino rail.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.120]   No, that can't be right.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.320]   I'm going to be the bottom of solace game.
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:44.560]   Yeah, it's it's mostly named a day of day of day, day of day based, you know, parading
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.320]   and parading and past.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:47.520]   You're terrible.
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.520]   Get out of it.
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.920]   Well, I was going to say, could you imagine?
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:57.240]   Could you imagine sort of the combination of the iPhone, James Judy and the talking
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.240]   moose?
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:02.320]   Yes, you could have him on your desktop.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.320]   That's the talking.
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:08.080]   Place phone call, but promise me you won't kill anybody this time bond.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:13.160]   Is him is em dialed out for pizza and three people are dead.
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.320]   Just don't let this happen again.
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.880]   She's she's going to be a one trick pony.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:17.880]   She did the same thing.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:18.880]   It's in a rail.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.280]   I mean, it's come on, you know, you're lighting up on the guy.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.080]   Come on.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:27.120]   Maybe maybe well, maybe she's just loved with him and just doesn't know how to show it.
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:31.040]   We didn't we didn't we did see her that super sexy bathrobe.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:36.240]   Hey, is talking moose gone is or is there still a talking moose?
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.560]   No, I'm pretty sure the talking moose is long gone.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:44.040]   Oh, oh, how about tiny Elvis tiny Elvis gone to?
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.760]   There's probably something around though.
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.760]   Let's have a look.
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:53.160]   That's that brands you as a Mac old timer when you say talking moose.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.960]   That's like saying hypercard.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.880]   It's just brands you.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:02.040]   I just remember the talking moose as something that used to crash my machine.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.040]   There you go.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.840]   That's what I was going to say.
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:11.000]   There's I we should make this like a contest to finish this snarky comment that it's an
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.440]   application that crashes your machine before annoying you for about a half an hour.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.440]   In this way, it is much like blank blank.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:17.600]   Charles, there you go.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.600]   There you go.
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.600]   In rubber.
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:23.960]   What is anything but bare bone software?
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.040]   Apparently the Beatles the Beatles.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:32.240]   This is the Merlin man memorial story that just never dies.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:37.920]   And I, you know, I could say the iTunes Beatles collection held hostage day four hundred and
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:41.000]   seventy four, I guess.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.320]   Now it turns out Sir Sir Paul said on Monday the negotiations between the Beatles holding
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:54.760]   company and EMI, which is the record label over digital downloads have stalled.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.360]   So I don't know who's blockading.
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:00.960]   Sir Paul says it'd be a good thing.
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:06.000]   He says he suggests that EMI, the record label is unwilling to meet Apple's terms cracking.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.120]   What else is new?
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.960]   Sir Paul left EMI last year.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.520]   He has he's on an independent label.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.520]   So maybe he doesn't.
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.760]   Maybe there's not a lot of love lost there.
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:19.480]   Can't can't he just afford to buy them?
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.520]   You think so.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.840]   You think so.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:24.840]   It's kind of sad.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:29.440]   I mean, it's it's I think are there any other big bands like that in the Rolling Stones went
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:34.000]   Metallica went any other big bands left that are holding out on the digital front?
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.640]   I think this is the last one.
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:36.880]   AC DC is the only one.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:37.880]   Oh, AC DC.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:38.880]   Yeah, that was smart.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:39.880]   Oh, God, exactly.
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:46.720]   I, you know, I'm they're they're using they're using of let there be rock in the in the in
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.640]   the ads for the new rock band.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.640]   And of course, it immediately made me think, you know what?
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.600]   I've heard that song like, you know, a million times.
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.440]   I think I actually want to go buy it.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.760]   But no, I can't buy it.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.440]   And they're and they're thinking is, well, of course he wants the song.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.840]   He'll buy the entire CD.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:00.840]   Right.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.840]   No, I really won't.
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:02.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.520]   I'm interested in investing 99 cents in your short little pants in your little school boy
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.520]   cap.
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.280]   I'm not willing to invest $13.
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.080]   It's that's right.
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:14.080]   That assumption is very clearly 2002 era thinking.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:20.440]   In fact, I'm looking back through the old news because, you know, they only are selling
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.000]   it in Walmart.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.840]   And shortly after they made the announcement, no downloads, somebody pointed out they had
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:33.440]   down far more downloads than they had sales, you know, like four times the number of illegal
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.120]   downloads.
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:39.800]   And you got to think that some of that they could have converted, you know, just stupid.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.880]   It's just, it's there's a.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:47.040]   The old argument comes by that, you know, when you're trying to defend your choice to protect
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:52.360]   your content, you try to convert every piece of piracy into into a sale.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:56.000]   I'm not realizing that, well, it's really the availability that people are going for
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   because the iTunes store just demonstrated that a lot of people have 99 cents in their
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   pocket.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.400]   And those who don't have 99 cents, you know what?
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:06.520]   Amazon will sell this same track for 89 cents, probably, you know, and that, you know, this
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.400]   is how people enjoy their music.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:12.880]   And when you not only make it more difficult by not be making available for download, but
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:18.280]   also locking it up in a DRM format that severely constricts what they can do with it, you are
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.760]   just legitimizing peer to peer.
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:24.960]   Now, I should say I'm looking at other articles that it is, of course it was the number one
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:31.680]   album for some time just got knocked off the charts by a Twilight, the teen vampire movie,
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:35.760]   but they have their back catalog probably thanks to Guitar Hero, which was a smart move.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:42.440]   So 5.1 million copies this year, more than any other band, although the Beatles are going
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.480]   to do rock band next year, apparently.
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.800]   See, I'd run out and get Beatles on rock band.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.800]   That'd be awesome.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.280]   So I actually have rock band for the Xbox 360.
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.680]   It's a big hit in our household.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:54.680]   So yeah.
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:58.000]   Oh man, playing the Beatles, that brings families together.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.920]   Yeah, but we'll say it gets the families to get stoned and drop acid together.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:07.240]   I'm not sure if you're going to make it through the wide album, like completely straight
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.240]   edge.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:11.160]   Let's pause it on that note.
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:14.920]   Let's, let's, I'll have to produce like the, you boot it up.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.680]   You have to ask, are you high or you not high?
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.520]   And if you're not high, you get to the Lawrence well version of.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.520]   Which setting?
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.520]   Helter, scalter.
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:23.520]   Helter, scalter.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.520]   Helter, scalter.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:30.960]   I've got blisters on my fingers.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:34.360]   Hey, we got a deal on Drobo.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.160]   Let me mention Drobo before we go on.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.440]   We're going to have pics coming up too.
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.440]   And Rich Segal is with us.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:42.080]   It's great to have you rich from bare bones software, Andy and Akka from the Chicago Sun
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.280]   Times.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.280]   And we will continue.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.280]   There are more Mac stories as well.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:50.800]   But I do want to mention a special deal, a $50 deal on Drobo.
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.720]   This is a new Drobo discount through December.
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:54.720]   Let's see.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:55.720]   When is it?
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.720]   Oh, only through December 21.
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:03.040]   This would be a good time to run out and get the new Firewire 800 version of Drobo.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.680]   Twice as fast as the first generation Drobo.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.520]   Quieter, cooler operation.
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:09.840]   We've told you before about Drobo.
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:14.960]   Drobo is the amazing data robot that instantly expands up to 16 terabytes.
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:18.280]   It won't be 16 terabytes until they get four terabyte drives out.
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:21.360]   So I think we're a little ways off from that.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.360]   Let's say you bought the one and a half terabyte drives, which you can't get now.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:27.000]   That'll give you six terabytes in this unit.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.880]   The beauty of it is roughly a third of it was reserved for redundancy.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.600]   So you never risk any data loss.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.520]   What I do is I just throw whatever I've got in there.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:39.920]   That's how we that's how I started with the Drobo.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:40.920]   I had leftover drives.
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:45.200]   I had a 160 in there and a 400 up just variety of different sizes.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:48.200]   Unlike RAID 5, you add up the totals.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.120]   That's how much drive space you're going to get.
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:55.920]   And then when you run out of room, as I did pretty quickly with that kind of mishmosh,
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:00.840]   I pulled the smallest drive, the 160 put in a bigger drive, instantly get more space,
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:01.840]   no data loss.
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.120]   It rebuilds itself.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:05.040]   It's amazing.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:11.080]   Drobo expandable, easy to use, Firewire 800 400 USB 2.0 now.
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:19.320]   And if you go to Drobo.com/Macbreak, DROBO.com/Macbreak, $50 off instantly.
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.320]   You don't have to send in a coupon or anything.

[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:28.520]   Drobo.com/Macbreak, we thank them for their support.
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:31.280]   A Macbreak Weekly.
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.480]   Put all of your stuff on a Drobo.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:39.000]   I just thought it's just wipe it off afterwards.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.560]   Please, if you're going to put your stuff on a Drobo, we don't want to know.
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:44.560]   We don't need to know.
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.560]   Just leave the office way left.
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:47.560]   You might want to hear.
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:52.720]   The nice thing about the Drobo is I have one here that a friend loaned to me to try out.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:57.880]   I don't know about you guys, but the kind of storage you can get started with in a Drobo
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:00.320]   is the sort of thing I can find under myself.
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.320]   Exactly.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.840]   Exactly right.
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:08.680]   The other day I pulled out a, I think it was like a 250, maybe it was a 300 gig drive
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.760]   to put in a terabyte drive in a machine.
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.560]   I said, "What am I going to do with this?"
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:15.800]   It's like nowadays a 300 gig drive is like, "Mmm."
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:19.720]   So, do you keep them under your sofa cushions?
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:20.720]   They end up there.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.720]   I don't actually keep them.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:22.720]   Just fall out of your pocket.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:23.720]   They just drift around.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:28.320]   We've become so, say, modern technology.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.560]   Isn't it funny?
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:30.560]   It's amazing.
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.760]   So, frequently people have a number of older drives.
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.920]   They just pop them in the Drobo and now you can use them.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:36.920]   It is.
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.600]   It's kind of like a way to kind of take your old drives and reuse them.
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:40.600]   It's a really great thing.
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:44.800]   I used, just the other day I used a 160 gig drive to chip the ice off my windshield.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:48.040]   That's about all it's worth.
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:49.040]   Exactly.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:53.560]   I think I can cover with peanut butter rolled around and bread crumbs hanging out for the
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:54.560]   birds.
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:55.560]   You know what?
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.560]   It's reduced, reused, recycled.
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.000]   It's all about protecting mother.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.680]   That's exactly right.
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:04.840]   Think about all the hard drives though that probably would be entering the landfill if
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.800]   it weren't for a forensic program.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:07.800]   Exactly.
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.800]   It's a green solution.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.800]   It's a green solution.
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:10.800]   Excellent.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:11.800]   It's a clever realist.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:16.680]   Anything you can do to justify any expense for something cool and useful in your office,
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.520]   definitely go for that.
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:22.600]   Now let's talk about applications because, well, we've got Rich Segal, which, one of
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:27.400]   the premier Macintosh developers in the world on the phone or Skype and it's great to have
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:28.400]   you Rich.
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.400]   Thank you.
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:35.320]   Have you considered doing any, you don't have to tell us if you don't want it but anything
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.640]   for the iPhone?
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:42.480]   We've chewed on the idea on and off and sort of we have some ideas that we're thinking
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:45.880]   about but we don't really have anything concrete yet.
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:49.960]   I think a Yojimbo client, for instance, would be a really great thing.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:50.960]   It might be.
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:55.200]   There are some technologies that we're sort of waiting to fall into place and we don't
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.680]   have a firm answer yet on whether or not we're going to do one.
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:01.280]   So the answer isn't yes and the answer isn't no.
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:04.360]   If that sounds like a waffle, I apologize that it is.
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:07.880]   Have you looked at what development I don't want to don't want to back myself in any corners
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:08.880]   on this one?
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:09.880]   Well, I don't blame you either.
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:12.720]   Have you looked at what developing for the iPhone would take?
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:16.200]   I mean, have you done a little playing with it anyway?
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:23.520]   Just a tiny bit and what the phone and the desktop have in common is they have a common
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:31.160]   implementation language and that is Objective C and, you know, cocoa for the Mac OS X desktop
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:41.080]   is very well known and there is a lot of that available on the phone and yet not.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:46.680]   So very early on, there was a certain amount of perception that you could basically click
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:51.040]   a checkbox and all of a sudden your desktop app was available on the phone and it just
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:54.640]   doesn't work that way.
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:44:00.880]   And more than that, I lack the expertise to talk about somebody I know and I would
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:08.440]   actually encourage you to look him up is Craig Hockenberry who is the behind Twitter effect.
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:09.440]   Yeah, Jockenberry.
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:10.920]   Yeah, I follow him on Twitter.
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:11.920]   Exactly.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:15.280]   He of the giant, he of the chalk lock and the fleshy palm.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:21.680]   Just wipe it off when you're done.
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.720]   There's a machine with like four people.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:25.720]   Exactly.
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:32.840]   Key and James Thompson from TLA Systems and Phraser Spears from Connected Flow.
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:36.640]   Those are three guys that I can think of right off hand who are intimately familiar
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:42.360]   with developing products for the phone and for the Mac OS X desktop.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.360]   Right.
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:47.640]   Well, the reason I thought of this is David Chardier writing in an infinite loop on
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:54.640]   ours, Technica noted that actually came from TechCrunch that Evernote, which was originally
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:45:03.240]   an application designed for Windows only really for tablet windows mostly simply by making
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:08.680]   an iPhone application has kind of opened up a whole new world for themselves.
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:15.960]   It now is the number one, 57% of Evernote users use it through the iPhone.
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:16.960]   57%.
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.280]   It's Windows is only 32%.
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:22.560]   They have a new Windows mobile client.
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:25.640]   It's turned out to be a very smart move for them.
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:28.160]   Now, of course, it's a free application.
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:32.760]   The way they make their money is up selling you to the pro version, which has more storage
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:34.160]   and so forth.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.160]   But it is kind of an ideal.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:40.680]   I use it all the time on the iPhone because you can record, you take pictures and save
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:43.520]   it as a photo note and then it will do OCR on it.
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:49.160]   There's some really cool stuff with it.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:56.360]   The notion of giving away the razor and selling the blades as it were or giving the software
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:01.320]   away and then up selling to service is an interesting one, especially as it relates to
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:02.920]   the economics of iPhone development.
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:09.680]   I know there have been some recent conversations going on in the Mac and iPhone developer community
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:16.960]   about those economics of how can you make money developing an iPhone app, especially
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:25.040]   when you look at the outright price depression that's in the store.
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:34.480]   Most applications are very inexpensive for $5 at most, often 99 cents.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:44.200]   Exactly, and you really have to sell a metric truckload of products to recoup your costs.
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:49.960]   Yeah, I imagine it is better to think of it as a lost leader as Evernote is than it is
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:52.800]   to try to make money off of it.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:59.160]   John Grouper, a friend at Daring Fireball, did some interesting investigation into the
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:03.680]   new Google mobile app, which is very slick.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:04.960]   The voice stuff is so slick.
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:11.360]   It's the first time I've been able to search by a voice with Google and it's just so cool.
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:15.680]   There's some concern that it might be linking to unpublished APIs that Apple's somehow
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:24.640]   giving them a leg up by giving them access to some unpublished APIs.
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:26.440]   Does Apple...
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:31.240]   This is a tender subject, so again, if you don't want to answer, you don't...
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:32.840]   Is Apple known to do that kind of thing?
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:39.880]   Say to one developer, "Hey, let me show you some tricks."
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:44.800]   Apple has, and I don't think I'm breaking any rules or giving away any secrets here.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:51.640]   Apple has something they're called SPI's or System Programming Interfaces, and they're
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:48:01.320]   basically APIs that are reserved for exclusive use of the OS and the people working on it.
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:07.360]   There have been occasions where a developer might get told, "Well, we have an SPI that
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:11.240]   does this and you could call it."
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:17.480]   The only situation I know of in which that happens is when they're actually planning
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:20.280]   to expose it in the future.
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:24.640]   In other words, to make it private now, but we're going to make it public, so go ahead
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.560]   and use it and you'll be okay.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:29.720]   What would be the bad thing was the opposite.
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:34.400]   We have this private API and we're not going to deprecate it or we're going to stop using
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.680]   it because that's going to break stuff.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:39.640]   We're going to stop using it or we're going to change the way it works or we're going
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:42.360]   to change the interface to it.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:49.000]   Because once somebody outside of the firewall as it starts using an SPI, you can't touch
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.960]   it and that's a real problem from an engineering and compatibility standpoint.
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:49:00.320]   It's got a huge problem for Microsoft and Windows.
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:08.440]   I certainly can't speak with authority on how Google did what they did on whether they
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:12.560]   did it with internal assistance from Apple or not.
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:16.720]   Looks like they used both private frameworks and unpublished APIs.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.400]   What is a private framework?
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:29.480]   A private framework is one that is, as its name suggests, private to the operation of
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:32.160]   the system.
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:38.360]   The contrast is that of a public framework which is made available to developers.
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:44.800]   Again, a risky thing to do because the interface might change without running.
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:50.200]   The visible difference is that a public framework you can look on your machine and in system
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:55.640]   library frameworks or developer, the SDKs, and you'll see that all of the public frameworks
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:57.400]   have header files in them.
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:59.400]   A private framework does not.
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:01.680]   It is just an open resource.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:07.840]   There's no way to call it short of picking it apart and figuring out.
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:11.160]   Presumably Apple has a header file that it uses.
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:12.160]   Yes, they do.
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:17.080]   Part of the Xcode build process is that you can build private frameworks and it strips
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:21.160]   the headers out of them for release.
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:26.200]   You build off a standard set of stuff as it were.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:31.040]   Then your frameworks are private simply by removing the headers and possibly any public
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:32.040]   symbols.
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:37.720]   What do you think of Apple's iPhone application acceptance review process?
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:38.720]   I'm seeing.
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:40.720]   We continue to see stories.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:45.920]   There was another story this week about a soft porn desktop thing, like semi-naked women
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:51.360]   that was approved and then abruptly rejected like 12 hours later.
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:54.800]   Yes, I saw that.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:58.280]   I have a whole bunch of mixed reactions on that whole subject.
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:07.960]   I understand that they need to offer some sort of content review to serve their own goals
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:13.120]   of experience and stability and so on and so forth.
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:15.880]   You can make arguments about that all day long.
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:23.800]   On the other hand, as soon as you start talking about incompletely specified criteria and human
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:28.240]   factors, I mean, these are reviewed by human beings after all.
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:33.520]   Anything can happen and as we've seen on occasion, anything does happen.
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:41.160]   Applications get approved that are questionable or no value.
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:45.040]   Matters of taste aside, you've got to wonder how many flashlight applications you really
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:46.640]   be in.
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:53.240]   Or that infamous example of I am rich, I think it was called.
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:57.680]   Which I don't know for sure, but could very easily have been an experience to demonstrate
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:07.600]   and experiment to demonstrate just how fraught with failure the whole process is.
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:11.680]   You see things like that and you realize, yes, there's plenty of opportunity for the
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:15.320]   process to get messed up.
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:21.360]   There's not a lot of recourse and of course on the flip side, there are developers who
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:28.760]   have had their applications rejected for reasons which seem arbitrary from the outside or reasons
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:32.680]   which are arguably wrong from the outside.
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:35.000]   All sorts of things going on.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.760]   I look at that part of the process and I think I forget who it was that made the argument
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:48.160]   and that is what sane person would invest in what it would invest venture funding in
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:53.320]   an iPhone product that had to go through a process like this and could be arbitrarily
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:55.920]   rejected at the last step.
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:57.920]   Or accepted and then rejected.
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:01.000]   It must be more frustrating.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.640]   And again, you can argue that one around all day long.
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:09.680]   You can argue that anything of great significance in that respect could be presented to Apple
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:11.480]   upfront.
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.480]   Right.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:14.480]   And sort of pre-approved.
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:19.960]   Well, Apple is pretty clear in their terms of service or their end, or their developers
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:22.440]   agreement that you shouldn't be publishing softcore porn stuff.
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:26.760]   I mean, these guys must have known, maybe they were just figuring out where the edge
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:27.760]   of the envelope was.
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:30.640]   I mean, there was no nudity, I don't think.
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:35.560]   I forget the name of the application too, but it was something that didn't reveal it's
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:36.560]   like desktops.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:38.560]   Right.
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:39.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:43.080]   And so they could have been simply trying to game the system and hoping that nobody was
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:46.440]   actually going to do anything beyond liquidate link.
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:53.480]   Liquidate links against and see if it starts.
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:54:03.840]   And you sent me a link to a program I would love to get called Mazzo from emptyfactory.com.
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:09.200]   It was an Amazon application, but it wasn't rejected by Apple.
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.520]   It was rejected by Amazon.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:18.160]   Yeah, it was sort of a custom browser just for Amazon that was just, I happen to think
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:22.440]   that that Amazon's mobile iPhone interface is very, very, very good.
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:26.160]   But as we've seen in the past six or seven months, when you totally rewrite something
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:30.240]   using native elements of the iPhone interface, you get something really great.
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:35.440]   And when you have a company that seems to absolutely understand how an iPhone, how an
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:41.480]   iPhone user expects an app to work, you start to see a movie, a screen capture of an app
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:42.480]   like this.
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:44.320]   And you think download, download, download, where's the download button?
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.560]   I need to download it.
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:50.600]   It had a lot of really cool interface functions, a function that I, that would have sold seal
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:56.320]   the deal for me would have been just the ability to create wish lists on your iPhone.
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:58.680]   Just the ability to say, you know, I just wanted to look this up.
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:00.600]   I wanted to see what the specs were on this.
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:02.040]   I don't really want to buy it.
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:03.120]   I don't want to put it in my basket.
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:06.400]   I just want to sort of bookmark that particular product.
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:09.720]   And boy, within two weeks, I would certainly have had 30 or 40 or 50 different things
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:10.720]   bookmarked here.
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:13.200]   And it was going to be a free app on top of everything else.
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:22.800]   But Amazon has a little tweak in its API guidelines where if you want to create a mobile application,
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:26.760]   you need their authorization in order to release your app.
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:30.400]   And Amazon itself declined that app from being released.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.880]   I wonder if they're planning something on their own.
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:36.560]   I mean, yeah, there are a couple of different theories.
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:42.920]   One theory is that I have not seen this app and I have not spoken to the developers directly.
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:46.800]   Unfortunately, I got an email from them just about an hour and a half before we did the
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:47.800]   show.
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:49.280]   So I didn't have a chance to really talk to them about it.
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:54.080]   So maybe it's possible that they'd be fools if they were giving away this free application
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:58.400]   and it didn't tag all online purchases with their own Amazon.
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.400]   Yeah, that's where you make the money.
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:01.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:02.400]   That's absolutely above board.
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.400]   That's absolutely fair.
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:09.320]   When I Twitter things that are non-tech, Amazon purchases that are non-tech related like popcorn,
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:13.560]   pop or a piece of music, I tag with my Amazon associates just yesterday.
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:17.320]   I was able to buy a Christmas present for somebody using some of the money that I made
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:22.840]   or the kickbacks I got from all the emerging music recommendations.
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:24.280]   So I don't think that's the reason why.
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:29.560]   I do think that it's because the fact that Amazon specifically has put a limitation on
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:33.960]   mobile applications and not desktop apps means that they really want to control the
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:35.360]   mobile experience.
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:39.720]   I really think they want to create one consistent experience that every single mobile user can
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:41.280]   rely on.
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:47.000]   This looks pretty good, but I have to say the web, as you say, the Amazon Web-based Safari
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.880]   iPhone is not bad at all.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:50.200]   A lot of sites do that.
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.600]   I mean, even I even do that in my blog.
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:56.320]   It's not a trivial detection iPhone and make it be formatted beautifully for an iPhone.
[00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:59.480]   I think Holo, H-A-H-L-O is the best Twitter app out there.
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:00.480]   It's an iPhone.
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:01.480]   It's a Safari page.
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:02.480]   Absolutely.
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:04.280]   I mean, I love Twitter riff.
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:09.360]   I think it's a very iPhone-ish interface, but it just doesn't have certain features that
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:10.920]   I take for granted on Halo.
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:11.920]   Halo is incredible.
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:13.920]   Halo, or whatever.
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:14.920]   Halo.
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:19.640]   Well, it's interesting to watch.
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:22.640]   I think probably interesting partly because of the success of the App Store.
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:23.640]   It's so successful.
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:28.360]   It works so well that these little blips you really notice you pay attention to.
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:29.360]   Exactly.
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:34.480]   It can function because of the visibility of the phone and the visibility of the platform
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:37.200]   and the visibility of the company.
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:39.720]   Sometimes it can function as a lightning rod.
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:40.720]   Right.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:43.520]   Well, that's the story of Apple.
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:49.080]   Sometimes it can be their biography.
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:51.360]   Sometimes we're a lightning rod.
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:52.920]   Deflections.
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:53.920]   They're like Madonna.
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:55.360]   They like to shock us.
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:58:03.080]   It's those pointy conical APIs that you know, you're shocked at first, but then you say,
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:05.560]   you know what, this makes sense in a very natural way.
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:10.800]   We didn't trade and every once in a while you flash a private symbol.
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:11.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:12.960]   It was an API malfunction.
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:15.200]   I didn't know.
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:20.640]   Sometimes the iPhone 2.2 software came out Thursday just after, of course, the show comes
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:21.640]   out.
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:23.800]   So as often as the case, we missed talking about that.
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:26.000]   And now by the time we're talking about it, everybody's old hat.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.080]   But any thoughts on that, Andy?
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:30.240]   I like the street view.
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:32.720]   Works pretty nicely.
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:34.640]   I think I mean, I think it's a step forward.
[00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:36.680]   I don't think it's revolutionary.
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:38.200]   Believe it or not.
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:41.920]   And this is another case, an opportunity for us to complain about the way that iPhone
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:42.920]   does backups.
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:47.320]   I don't want to, obviously, I haven't done it yet because I don't want to apply it until
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:49.480]   I've done a complete backup.
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:51.560]   And I want a backup that I can control.
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:54.880]   I also need to actually sort of restore an old iPhone.
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:58.280]   But each one of these steps is seven freaking hours.
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:02.560]   Why you wait for just the backup got so much faster with 2.1.
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:04.440]   It's still an overnight process for me.
[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:05.440]   Really?
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:10.960]   Maybe I do need to just, maybe I need to reflash my iPhone and do a backup just that this
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:13.400]   phone goes all the way back to 2.0.
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:16.000]   So maybe it's just that there's still some bad mojo linging around.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.440]   I need to, I don't know, burn some incense or some sage or something around it.
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:23.480]   Maybe you told me that there is a fix and it didn't make a big difference for me in
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:29.000]   2.1, but it might be why I'm getting almost lickety split backups in 2.2.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.880]   And it had to do with the checkbox.
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:38.920]   The first time you use it that says send Apple the diagnostic information.
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:44.840]   And apparently some applications generate massive logs that are related to the long
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:46.720]   backup process.
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:50.040]   So it's all up my Uncle Saul.
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:52.040]   On my doing.
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:53.040]   Let's take a look at this leg.
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:54.840]   It's like a straight leg to you.
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:55.840]   I can't walk.
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:56.840]   I can't talk.
[00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:57.840]   It's the weather.
[00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:58.840]   I'm talking about the weather.
[00:59:58.840 --> 00:59:59.840]   Exactly.
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:00.840]   He's just, you're beautiful.
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:04.720]   So it might be, yeah, you know, and I think the fellow who told me about this was one
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:11.840]   of our listeners gave me a process which I've forgotten to get that checkbox back and
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.600]   then uncheck it.
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:16.800]   Because you know, but what you normally do is say, yeah, yeah, send Apple the information
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:19.280]   and don't bug me again about it.
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:22.480]   And that may be why because now I get very, very, very quick backup.
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.520]   So it might be worth it for you.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:28.520]   My goodness, Leo, just another testimony to the wonderful instructional and skill power
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.360]   of regular listeners of Macbreak.
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:31.360]   They're very smart.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:32.360]   They're very smart.
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:33.360]   Part of the cast and I have learned something today.
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:34.360]   Every day we learn something.
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:38.600]   You know, I'm going to go out and buy products advertised on this show because this show is
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:39.600]   that it?
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:40.600]   I'm going to give them something available.
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.400]   This is a weird thing.
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:47.920]   If you use, if you have one of the new Macbooks or the MacBook Pros and use it on power, don't
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:51.680]   take out the battery while you're using it on power.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:54.480]   It slows it down.
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:01:01.320]   This is a very strange kind of unexpected result, but it has to do with the power saving.
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:09.960]   If there is not a battery in the MacBook or MacBook Pro, it's like 30 or 40% slower.
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.600]   I'm trying to remember why they did this.
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:15.320]   I have the article here somewhere if I can find it.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:16.320]   That's bizarre.
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:17.320]   Yeah.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:21.720]   It's this comes from Gearlog.
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:26.800]   Apparently Apple says so in its support document, it's done to prevent the computer from shutting
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:27.800]   down.
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:31.840]   If it, oh, I know why because the AC adapter that they shipped now with the MacBook Pro
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:34.400]   is small, won't keep it running.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:39.320]   So they're saying if it's if if this prevents the computer from shutting down, if it demands
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:44.080]   more power than the AC adapter alone can provide.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:52.600]   So this is so if you go and you look in tech support, this is a article, ht2332 on the Apple
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:53.960]   knowledge base.
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.920]   It is strongly recommended you do not use your MacBook or MacBook Pro while the battery
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:00.440]   is removed.
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:02.680]   I'm checking, Leo, if you're lying, you're busted.
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:05.080]   I'm not lying.
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:11.760]   And then according to Gearlog, it actually runs considerably 36% slower on the processor
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:12.760]   benchmarks.
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.000]   Well, I'll be here it is.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   Is that wild?
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.720]   It is strongly it.
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:18.720]   This is great.
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:22.160]   It is strongly recommended that you do not use your MacBook or MacBook Pro while the battery
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:24.080]   is removed accidentally.
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:29.280]   They spelled it wrong, but accidentally bumping the AC adapter could disconnect power and
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.400]   shut down the computer.
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:33.640]   They don't say that it slows the system down, but they actually do.
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:39.180]   It says if the battery is removed from a MacBook or MacBook Pro, the computer will automatically
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:40.880]   reduce the processor speed.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.800]   This prevents the computer from shutting down.
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:49.280]   If it demands more power than the AC adapter, that's astonishing.
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:55.320]   I really want to monitor blog response traffic to this story because if people are thinking
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:59.640]   that this is an issue, then we can say that we've officially run out of things to complain
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:00.640]   about.
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.560]   Oh, come on.
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:05.840]   You're telling me that if I put a grateful dead sticker across half the screen, I won't
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.720]   be able to see the whole screen.
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:11.480]   So you knew about this and you didn't tell me, Andy?
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:15.720]   The idea that how many people are running their MacBooks without a battery?
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:16.720]   Oh, I would.
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:19.080]   And I'll tell you why because I don't want to, you know, that you get a certain number
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.960]   of charge discharge cycles.
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:24.400]   So if I'm going to run on the effect, I've told people to do this in the past, I want
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.400]   anymore.
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:29.120]   If I'm going to run on AC power for a long time, I just take the battery out so they don't
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:31.560]   damage it or, you know, wear it out prematurely.
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:37.160]   Do you have conspiracy theory music because I have a conspiracy theory?
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:38.160]   Oh, good.
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.160]   Wait a minute.
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:40.160]   I'll find some.
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:41.360]   You talk, I'll find conspiracy theory.
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:42.360]   What's the conspiracy?
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:47.680]   And I'm saying, are you playing a tuba, Andy?
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:49.920]   I don't think a tuba qualifies.
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:53.640]   I'm saying this strictly ingest and do not seriously mean this.
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:54.640]   That's my disclaimer.
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:55.640]   Okay.
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:58.880]   Apple doesn't want you to take the battery out of your computer because it uses it up
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:01.160]   and you got to buy a new one when it wears out.
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:03.720]   Oh, maybe they want you to buy a new one.
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.560]   It's a profit deal.
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.160]   I get it now.
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:09.160]   No, they would.
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:13.960]   I have a bit of non-strictly Mac news, which I thought I'd throw into the pile.
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:14.960]   Please do.
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:16.480]   You guys don't love it, Rich.
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:19.960]   The CEO of a company called Values of M.
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.960]   Oh, Rail Dornfest.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:22.960]   Rail Dornfest.
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:30.760]   Very nice guy who they run Stick It and Sandy.
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:31.760]   I want Sandy.
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:34.360]   I love, we've interviewed Rail.
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:35.760]   Rail's a guy, I would consider him a good friend.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:39.000]   I love Rail and I have mixed feelings about this story.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.160]   Go ahead and tell the story.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.160]   Okay.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:46.920]   So the story is that, let me see if I can find that particular so they don't speak completely
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:52.880]   out of school on this, Rail is going to work for Twitter.
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:53.880]   Yes.
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:05:01.880]   And the intellectual property behind Stick It and Sandy is also being acquired by Twitter,
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:06.920]   but unfortunately in my strict opinion, because I use Sandy.
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:12.560]   My wife uses Sandy even more and she's really kind of upset about this, but they'll be turning
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:16.080]   off Stick It and Sandy on December 8th.
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.600]   I'm so bummed about this.
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:18.600]   Yeah.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.960]   So Sandy didn't even give us two weeks notice, man.
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:23.360]   Oh, she's hurt her career so over.
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:26.360]   I could see Twitter incorporating Sandy.
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.520]   That's not such a hard thing to do.
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:28.600]   Stick It, no.
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.600]   And I can only think that just, you know, we interviewed Rail when Stick It came out.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:35.040]   I love Stick It, I used it for a long time and it has all sorts of interesting, it's just
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.400]   an interesting application.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:42.040]   It's basically like a little wiki or sticky note wiki that is smart about what you put
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.200]   in it.
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:47.200]   I have, you know, I have a quick silver keystroke for it and stuff.
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:48.200]   And it was just really cool.
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:52.000]   And I guess the same technology went into I want Sandy because you will Twitter her,
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.600]   you know, I'm going to have lunch with Rich three o'clock on Tuesday and it would, you
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:01.320]   know, Sandy would process it and remind you, which is very cool.
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.800]   And then I think does she add it to the calendar too?
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:04.800]   Yeah.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:08.720]   It was a lot like a text based version of the Newton message pad.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:13.880]   I thought we say lunch next to next lunch Tuesday night with Rich and that would simply
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:18.720]   understand and while I'm talking with Rich via email about this, I would simply CC the
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:24.080]   note to Sandy and she would correctly parse what's in that statement and add to the
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.080]   calendar.
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:30.600]   And then so many times it was, it was the catch all location for any piece of information
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:33.520]   that I might need to just have my hands on at any time.
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:39.240]   You know, I would, I'd be waiting outside, waiting outside a hotel because I think I
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:42.600]   have a briefing here, but someone is supposedly 20 minutes late and I would just simply send
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:50.320]   an email or text to Sandy saying, Sandy, Sandy, look up, you know, Dell computer and we'll
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:54.720]   come up with every single note I'd ever saved about Dell computer or Dell computer appointment.
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.240]   And so nope, it's supposed to be here.
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:57.240]   I'm right.
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:58.240]   They're wrong.
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.240]   Thank you, Sandy.
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:01.120]   Yeah, I really am sad.
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:03.000]   On the other hand, I'm happy for rail.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:09.400]   I think it's great for him and, and you know, it's always, it's always nice to hear when,
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:14.880]   when somebody, you know, has put a lot of work into something and it ends up sort of advancing
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.000]   them along and good things happen to them.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:24.920]   I was just very, very surprised to see that, you know, lots of times the companies behind
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:29.240]   various online services get acquired and there's usually an effort to keep the service
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:32.360]   going or, or arrange some kind of transition.
[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:33.360]   Yeah.
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:39.000]   And, and so I was, you know, very surprised and very surprised to see that, you know, no,
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.320]   we're just going to turn this off.
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:46.640]   I have to think that reading between the lines, it, there weren't a lot of users to the service
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:51.520]   and it wasn't maybe it was, I don't know how he was planning to monetize it.
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:54.920]   And that when somebody comes along and says, look, we, you know, we want to incorporate
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:55.920]   it.
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:56.920]   You're right.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:57.920]   It's very abrupt.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:01.960]   I mean, although in a way it's better than what Google does, which just let it die slowly.
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:02.960]   Yeah.
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.640]   You know, it's something to think about.
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:08.880]   Think about all the commercial and non-commercial services that we now run our businesses and
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:10.240]   our lives on.
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:14.280]   It's, I mean, I realized that any piece of software can suddenly be pulled.
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:20.000]   But if I'm trusting all my content information and my personal information to a desktop application,
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:26.000]   you know, I'm still using, I'm still using visual hub, even though basically the developer
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.040]   killed it about a month ago, because I have the application.
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:33.040]   I want Sandy means that I now have to back off everything that I have stored in there
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.400]   and find a new place for it.
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:37.920]   Because if I somehow missed this announcement or if I just like went on vacation for a
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.960]   couple weeks and wasn't really using the service, suddenly everything's gone.
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:43.320]   I mean, I trust, I need, I need my Flickr.
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:44.320]   I need my Gmail.
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:48.120]   I need all this stuff that's ostensibly free and they, they, and there's being used just
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:49.120]   on a handshake agreement.
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:52.160]   And a lot of these are going to go away in the next year, I'm sure.
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:53.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:57.280]   Well, how long can you, how long can you run a service like Twitter without finding a way
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:58.880]   to make money off of it?
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:01.480]   In a way, Rails jumped from the frying pan out of the fire.
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:05.720]   I was going to say, I think it's kind of, it's kind of a step down.
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:08.520]   It used to be he's the head of the company that has no revenue stream.
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:11.800]   Now she's just an employee of the company with no revenue.
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:15.080]   And I was going to say, when you, when you talk about, you know, you don't really know
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:17.520]   how you're going to make money with I want Sandy.
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:20.640]   Well, I don't really know how Twitter is going to make money with Twitter.
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:21.640]   Right.
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:22.640]   Right.
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:26.920]   And I don't know, it's, it's a little tough to tell from the outside.
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:36.200]   But I have absolutely no visibility into how values of N ran, you know, if, if it apart
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:43.160]   from engineering, and this is by no means minimizing the significance of engineering,
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:48.640]   but a service that's up and running tends to follow Newton's first law.
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:51.480]   It will stay up and running.
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:56.720]   And yes, they frequently require engineering to add features or fix bugs.
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:03.800]   You know, this is, this is the way software is both on the desktop and everywhere else.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:10.680]   But given a service like I want Sandy, which appeared to be stable, you sort of do have
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:17.400]   to wonder, well, why not just leave the server switched on until some, some further out period?
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:18.560]   Or I don't know.
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:26.340]   And as I said, this is, this is not having just said that, this is not the second guess.
[01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:27.340]   What has happened?
[01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:28.960]   As I said, I was simply surprised by it.
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:29.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:30.960]   And rails good people.
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:31.960]   I trust him.
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:36.560]   And I'm sure he's got the interest of his user at heart, they're going to rail in Aisheg are
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:37.560]   going to stay in Portland.
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:40.360]   I'm sorry to say it would be fun to have him back down here again.
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:42.040]   He was a, he was a CTO at O'Reilly.
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:44.480]   Did they edited the hacks books?
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:45.480]   Uh huh.
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:51.600]   So that's when I met rail is, is he put together the first O'Reilly, MacOS 10 conference that
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:52.600]   I went to.
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:53.600]   Right.
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:54.600]   Right.
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:55.600]   Great.
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:56.600]   Yeah.
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:57.600]   He did a lot of conferences for them.
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:58.600]   Great guy.
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:00.920]   And his wife, Asha, does a mommy hacks, which is, or parrot hacks, which is a great blog.
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:02.520]   So they're going to stay in Portland.
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:05.480]   And I'm sure this is going to be a good move for them.
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:06.480]   And you're right.
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:08.560]   It's a little odd that they didn't keep those services up.
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:09.560]   Maybe they're going to open source them.
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:11.840]   Maybe we're going to hear something, but I think it's December 8th.
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:12.840]   They're pulling the plug.
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:13.840]   I mean, it's not.
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:14.840]   Yep.
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.520]   It's time to find a replacement for I want Sandy.
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:22.280]   Maybe it was running on like his personal Mac to CI, you know, back and back at home.
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.920]   Maybe that's the reason why you joke.
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:25.480]   You know, the thing to think died.
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:29.800]   The thing died and he couldn't find SCSI drives forward anymore.
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:31.840]   You joke, but I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:37.440]   You know, he wrote Blossom, which is a blog, a really cool blog engine that basically you'd
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:38.800]   write, you'd blog locally.
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:42.040]   And then every once in a while, the folders would propagate magically to the web.
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.480]   It was very, it was very cool.
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:45.400]   I could totally see him doing that.
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:46.400]   So I don't know.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.400]   Anyway, well, you know what?
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:51.800]   I'll try to get rail on one of our shows, maybe a net at night and find out what's going
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:52.800]   on.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:55.080]   But Rich, I'm glad you brought that up because I think there are probably a lot of listeners
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:59.160]   who use, I would bet you there are some listeners anyway who use, I want Sandy.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.160]   I do.
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:01.160]   I love it.
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:04.120]   All you have to do is friend Sandy on Twitter.
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.280]   Yeah, it would work.
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.920]   We're going to take a break, come back with our picks of the week.
[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:10.320]   I didn't warn you about this, Rich.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:15.240]   But I will allow you to, to demure if you choose not to, but we usually do a software
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:17.840]   hardware pick on the show every week.
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:20.360]   And if you've got one, I'll give you some time to think about it.
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:22.680]   As I mentioned, our friends at Audible.
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:24.160]   Audible.com.
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:25.760]   We've got a URL for you with that too.
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:27.880]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:31.440]   That's the place to go to get your audio book for free.
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:32.880]   It's a credit toward a free book.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:38.640]   Any of the books that Audible publishes, Andy and I, as you know, are big Audible fans.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:41.080]   We just love Audible.
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:44.360]   Andy, I don't know if you have ever seen, I'm going to let you do a pick if you want,
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:49.760]   but I just got an email from Stephen Smickhead Audible that they are doing.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.040]   Have you ever seen these books?
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:54.600]   They're called 33 and a third.
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:13:05.560]   The book series covers a specific album and just is all about that album, each book.
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:08.880]   And they've started to record these Audible's doing them in house.
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:10.520]   They've started to record them for Audible.
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:11.520]   Wow.
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:13.000]   I mean, just really cool.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.320]   If you're a fan of a particular album to really hear each track talked about the history
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:22.520]   of the recording sessions, how it worked, all of that is just fascinating.
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:24.480]   And those are new on Audible.
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:25.480]   They just added those.
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:27.200]   They're always adding new stuff.
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:29.640]   Do you have a pick for us today?
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:30.640]   I have a pick.
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.040]   It can go this week or next week.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.720]   It's long to see one of those too.
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:36.440]   Well, I'll tell you what, I'll let you off the hook.
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:37.440]   Yeah.
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:38.440]   And we'll save it.
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:39.440]   And we'll save it.
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:40.440]   Yeah.
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:43.440]   And we'll save it because I do want to mention these 33 and a third books.
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:44.440]   They sound interesting.
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:45.440]   I've never heard one before.
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:46.440]   So that sounds interesting.
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:47.440]   Yeah.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:48.440]   Yeah.
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:49.440]   I've just downloaded a couple.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:51.480]   I haven't had a chance to listen to them yet.
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:54.720]   But if you search, I mean, look, it's the music.
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:55.720]   It's a series.
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:56.720]   I'll play, you know what?
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:58.560]   Let me play a little bit of one of them for you.
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.440]   That's probably the best way to do it.
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.440]   Audible.com/Macbreak.
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:06.280]   One of these could be your free book or, you know, many of the other books, you get a credit
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:07.280]   toward a free book.
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:11.800]   And of course, a free credit toward a book, some of the books, not all, most of the books
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:15.440]   are one credit, but some are more than one credit if they're really long.
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:17.440]   So if you go to audible.com/Macbreak.
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:24.160]   So Neil Young's Harvest, Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited, Paul's Boutique from the Beastie
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:31.400]   Boys, the Kinks, the Village Green Preservation Society, David Bowie's Low.
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:32.400]   Nick Drake's Pink Moon.
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:35.920]   I mean, just really interesting albums.
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:39.400]   And let me play the highways, a little bit of the Highway 61 Revisited.
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:40.760]   And you can hear...
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:44.640]   We tried out various locations and stopped at a clothes store and bought outfits for
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:48.160]   Bob, but the ones he wears on the cover are his own.
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:51.880]   I put Newworth behind him in the picture to give it extra color.
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:53.240]   End quote.
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:57.520]   The image has since become one of the defining portraits of Dylan from this period.
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:02.040]   Imagine four and a half hours on a 40 minute album.
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:05.080]   You'll get an idea of the depth that these go to.
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:08.440]   I mean, just fascinating, fascinating stuff.
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:09.440]   These are brand new.
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.240]   Audibles started recording them all.
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.720]   I'm really thrilled that they have.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:19.000]   If you search for 33 and a third or a highway 61 Revisited, you'll find it on audible.com.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.360]   And they're fairly affordable too.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:26.100]   So you actually, you may just want to buy them less than the album itself and then save
[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:27.440]   your free credit for another book.
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:28.440]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.480]   Such some great stuff.
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:36.640]   Audible is just a wonderful resource for audio entertainment of all kinds.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:40.600]   Books, lectures, spoken word of all kinds.
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:42.160]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:45.760]   We thank you so much for their support of MacBreak weekly.
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:47.560]   Ever listen to any audio books?
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:48.560]   Rich?
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:51.720]   I am embarrassed to admit that I do not.
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:55.280]   I still do my reading on paper.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:56.280]   Yeah.
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:01.280]   Do you read it all?
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:02.280]   I do.
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:05.720]   I do my reading on actual bound books.
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:06.720]   Hardbacks.
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:07.720]   Hardbacks.
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:08.720]   Holy cow.
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:10.720]   Oh, they're great.
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:13.800]   He actually has his own book binary in-house.
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:15.560]   It's really quite wonderful.
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:18.640]   Andy, you think Andy's joking, but he's not.
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:22.800]   No, he, I'm going to say it.
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:27.360]   So I'm reading a couple of new ones this week, Ender in Exile, which is a-
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:28.360]   Yes.
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:29.360]   Yes.
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:37.480]   And also a book called Alex and Me, which is by Irene Pepperberg, a psychologist and
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:43.080]   animal behaviorist about the 30 years she spent with an African gray parrot named Alex.
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.480]   And I haven't actually cracked that one yet.
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:49.880]   Well, you are an African gray parrot fancier, I understand.
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:54.800]   I have two grays looking rather fiercely at me at the moment because I-
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:02.160]   That's going to be the name of my bio, Alex and me, but it won't be about a parrot.
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:04.920]   And the birds have, I have to say, behaved themselves remarkably well this afternoon.
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:05.920]   We haven't heard one.
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:08.080]   Do they talk or they just squeak?
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:11.000]   Well, it sort of depends.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.120]   In the morning and in the afternoons, they will go each through their entire repertoire
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:20.200]   of noises, which is every word they've ever learned, every noise they know how to make
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.200]   and yes, they're-
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:24.200]   So this is their startup sequence.
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:25.200]   Each icon loads in.
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:26.200]   I love it.
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:27.200]   That's right.
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:31.800]   Let me see if I can't really reach over there, can I?
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:32.800]   Oh, maybe.
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:33.800]   Hi, buddy.
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.760]   That new Ender in Exile is also an audible.
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:39.400]   All of us, all of us got card stuff is, and I, yeah, that was our audible pick a couple
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:41.400]   of weeks- Well, we could go, I think, on one of the-
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:42.400]   You want a treat?
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:43.600]   You want a treat?
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:44.600]   Yes.
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:47.520]   Oh, wow, it sounds just like Andy.
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:49.680]   He's not going to tell me anything right now.
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:52.240]   He's like, "What is this thing on your head?
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:53.880]   I don't like it."
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:55.040]   Why are you wearing that?
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.520]   Yeah, why are you wearing that?
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:57.520]   What is that?
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:03.520]   Hey, let's get to our picks of the week, your favorite software, hardware, anything-
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:07.480]   You know, it could even be a website, anything that's been catching your eye, your fancy
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:09.520]   lately.
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:12.120]   And I'll start with Andy to give you a little more time, Rich, if you want.
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:14.440]   Andrew Naka, what's your pick of the week?
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:18.600]   Well, I have a piece of software that I've been using for months and months and years.
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:23.280]   Now, there'll be some scarlous rumors that I only first heard about this about 43 minutes
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:27.400]   ago when someone's listening to the show live, Twittered about this, but that's a lot.
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:28.760]   Damn, damn, why?
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:32.080]   Well, you've been doing this show for some years, and you've had to do a pick a week
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:33.760]   every day, for years.
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:36.280]   Pretty soon, you're glad to see those Twitters.
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:41.120]   I can sort of tease, this is going to be, I'm tapping against the microphone what is
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:43.200]   going to be next week's pick of the week.
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.840]   I had that all right.
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:50.960]   But it was just so cool that, hang on a sec, just let me just-
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:55.640]   You really prefer Firefox over me?
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:57.040]   It's that talking safari.
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:58.840]   There's still mine.
[01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:00.800]   No, you're kidding.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:04.560]   You'll have to get used to that, Rich.
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:06.560]   I should have had Rich start.
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:09.120]   Well, Rich, why don't you start that?
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:10.120]   No, no, no.
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:12.800]   You can have that one because I have two.
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:13.800]   What is it, though?
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:14.800]   I want to know.
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:16.800]   This is Yulee's moose.
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:20.880]   It is a modern OS X version of the Talking Moose.
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:23.720]   The Talking Moose is back!
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:24.720]   And it is free.
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:28.400]   You can PayPal a donation, but it has all the-
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:32.880]   I want you to know, if you're the sort of person who listens to Mac break weekly, maybe
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:37.080]   twice, I want you to, when you listen to it again, I want you to try to think of all
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:41.120]   the times when I've been talking and the Talking Moose has come in through my headphones
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:44.360]   because you'll hear me say, "Well, the thing is with Apple Strat-"
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:50.120]   The thing is with Apple's strategy is that because for the past 45 minutes, the moose
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:54.640]   has been coming up as I look something up on Wikipedia, then just double check something
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:55.960]   and then come back on.
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:59.760]   And every time you're switching an application, he has a- he has a lot of wise- wise arsed
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:01.240]   comments about Skype.
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:02.720]   Every time you go into Skype, it's like-
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:04.960]   This is like the original Talking Moose, isn't it?
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:06.920]   I mean, it's the same one.
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:07.920]   It is, yeah.
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:10.360]   It is exactly the same artwork.
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:14.520]   It has different art animations that you can load in, different conversational files you
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:15.520]   can load in.
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:16.760]   You can change this behavior.
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:19.440]   You can tell it to shut up, although I haven't found that control yet.
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:20.440]   How do you do?
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:21.440]   Oh, dear.
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:22.440]   Oh, dear.
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:24.440]   The moose panel.
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:25.440]   Oh, dear.
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:29.320]   The moose is loose.
[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:32.480]   Since 1986, this thing has been on the Mac.
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:33.480]   Yes.
[01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:36.800]   It's a lot like the strains of influenza.
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:39.640]   First the German flu takes out 20 million people worldwide.
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:41.560]   Then you don't hear from it for about 12 years.
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:44.600]   Then another strain comes out and kills another 6 million people.
[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:45.600]   And then nothing.
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:49.240]   And now we have the new, you know, shifting antigen version that is immune to all known
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:51.800]   antibiotics and antiviral treatments.
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:56.840]   Now what's nice is it uses Alex, the new voice on leopard.
[01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:58.640]   So that's why it sounds so good.
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:20:59.640]   Yeah.
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:01.440]   And actually, I was playing with a couple different voices.
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:06.120]   My usual standard system voices, you know, Mac and talk pro-victoria.
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:09.720]   But it just seemed wrong to have the talking moose talk with that with talk to me like
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:10.720]   Victoria does.
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:12.720]   So Victoria is always nice to me.
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:14.640]   Well, you could have it used.
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:15.920]   What's the what's like the worst?
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:17.640]   Is there still a crappy like Fred?
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:19.160]   You could use Fred, I guess.
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.560]   Or like being inside this fancy computer.
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:26.160]   Yeah, that sounds more like the original 1986 talking moose.
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.920]   That was really something though when that came out.
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:31.880]   I can't believe it's still around you Lee, you L.I.
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:34.040]   You Lee's moose.
[01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:36.440]   It seems like there wants to be a new melod underneath there.
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:39.240]   Oh, Lee, you Lee's moose.
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:40.240]   Lee's moose.
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:43.320]   Hey, Remeck should have been.
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:48.520]   But now when you hear Lee's moose in all of the next Twitter podcasts for the next week,
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:49.520]   you'll know why.
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:52.920]   Because I can't figure out how to stop it.
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:54.480]   Oh dear.
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:55.560]   Do you want to read?
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:57.960]   You want to read that site off handy?
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:00.760]   It is Zothross.D.
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:03.560]   I really think I did shut up this change.
[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:06.920]   I'm trying to give a URL shut up.
[01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:07.920]   You know what?
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:08.920]   I can do it.
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:09.920]   I don't have the moose running for this frame.
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:12.720]   If you do Google for you, Lee's moose, you L.I.
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:13.720]   Possory S moose.
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:14.720]   That's the way to do it.
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:17.360]   I actually Google Talking Moose and it came up pretty quick too.
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:19.360]   So it's like the number four.
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:21.800]   No, it was the number one result.
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:26.720]   If you press search Talking Moose and press I feel lucky you'll find Uli.
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:28.200]   He's a moose.
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:29.200]   He's German.
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:31.000]   So maybe it is a moose out.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000]   Uli.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000]   All right.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.600]   Well, I'm sorry Rich, they have done that too.
[01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:36.600]   Next time.
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:39.280]   No apology required.
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:43.680]   First of all, Andy did it to me, but he'll get his payback because I'm giving it a ride
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:44.680]   to dinner tonight.
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:45.680]   Ah-ha.
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:46.680]   Ah-ha.
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:48.920]   You thought he was in Chicago.
[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:49.920]   Oh, no.
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:54.240]   You're going to embarrass me by making my new iPhone book, which is just shipping right
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:55.240]   now the...
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:56.240]   Oh, you bastard.
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:59.480]   I don't want to step on two of your pics.
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:00.640]   I want you to show right ahead.
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:02.640]   Why didn't you have to switch now?
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:05.560]   Mail and I almost got digits from twins.
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:06.560]   Oh, no.
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:07.560]   I've got to stop.
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:08.560]   You want to stop.
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:11.600]   Oh, I've got to stop, Oli.
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:12.600]   Go ahead.
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:16.040]   What is your pick of the week, Mr. Rich Segal of Bearbone Software?
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:17.040]   Okay.
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:22.160]   So I've been messing around with this stuff and it's called Cyber Clean and the cyber clean.
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:24.160]   Cyber clean.
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:25.160]   It is...
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:26.680]   Well, let me just cut to the chase.
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:27.840]   I've been describing it.
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:28.840]   It has keyboard.
[01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:29.840]   It's not.
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:30.840]   Okay.
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:33.880]   So in other words, wipe it off when you're done.
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:36.240]   Right.
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:37.240]   It's this...
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:38.240]   I think we have a battle state plug.
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:40.840]   I think we know it today's show is going to be called.
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:41.840]   That's right.
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:42.840]   Wipe it off when you're done.
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:46.840]   Now, if you go to cyberclean.com, you're going to get janitorial supplies for less.
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:47.840]   Right.
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:50.840]   So you want to go to www.cyberclean.ch.
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:51.840]   That's C-O-S-V-S.
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:52.840]   So it's even cleaner.
[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:53.840]   It's Swiss-made.
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:55.880]   It's even cleaner.
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:59.760]   And I haven't figured out how to get it in the U.S. yet, but I had a friend from overseas
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:00.760]   send me some.
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:02.040]   And it's interesting.
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:09.640]   It's this sort of gelatinous aromatic, pleasantly aromatic, bright green goop.
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:14.400]   And you spread it out on your keyboard and you press it in and it sort of attaches to
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:21.200]   all the crust that builds up on your keyboard, the dust and the breadcrumbs and the flakes
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:26.760]   of crisp rice from your most recent Nestle crunch bar.
[01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:29.200]   And it just picks it all up.
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:30.200]   Wow.
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:32.840]   And how can you reuse it?
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:34.720]   It is reusable.
[01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:39.160]   And I believe it's actually, is it recyclable?
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:42.800]   Cyberclean is the benefit of sensitive electronic equipment.
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:47.840]   It gets into those titan-knowing spaces where conventional cleaners fail, catching dirt
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:48.840]   and killing germs.
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:51.720]   Leaving a fresh, lemon scent.
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:56.840]   Cyberclean can be used over and over again and it's not just for electronics either.
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:25:01.200]   Press Cyberclean firmly into the surface you want to clean and then peel it free.
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:03.000]   It's that easy.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.240]   Cyberclean, the brand new high-tech cleaner compound that catches dirt and kills germs.
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:09.840]   To pick up all the cat hair.
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:14.000]   Cyberclean is the perfect cleaner for sensitive electronic equipment.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.320]   It gets into those titan-knowing spaces where conventional cleaners fail.
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:19.920]   And the dust and the dirt and killing germs.
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:22.480]   Squeezing a fresh, lemon scent.
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:27.760]   Cyberclean can be used over and over again and it's not just for electronics either.
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:32.200]   Press Cyberclean firmly into the surface you want to clean and then peel it free.
[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:33.680]   It's that easy.
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:38.920]   Cyberclean, the brand new high-tech cleaning compound that catches dirt and kills germs.
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:39.920]   You're going to laugh.
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:41.080]   I've got one.
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:42.080]   Yay!
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:47.160]   So I think we're going to have--we got a theme here.
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.160]   We got a theme going here.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:51.880]   That's the trifecta but when it comes in it comes in baby.
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:59.480]   The website, while you're looking I'll give it is synim.de.
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:02.880]   So we've got two de's and a ch.
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:09.200]   This is a program called Screenium which just got upgraded to 1.0.
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:10.280]   It came out on 1.0.
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:11.280]   It came out in October 1.0.
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:13.760]   It first just got upgraded significantly.
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:17.440]   Now we've talked about screenshot software before.
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:22.040]   In fact I use the fairly expensive screen flow from Verisoft.
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:26.080]   This is 20 bucks screenium and free to try and does many of the same things.
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:31.440]   This might be a very good choice for people who are doing what to do with screen casts.
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:37.120]   It allows you to capture from multiple cameras including your eyesight but any camera the
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:41.920]   quick time can see it will capture the video from and use it as a picture in picture.
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:46.280]   I like that in a screen cast to have a face occasionally.
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:47.280]   It'll do that.
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:49.280]   It records audio as well.
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:55.080]   It does lower third kind of CGs.
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:59.680]   The kind that you'd have on a professional video production.
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:01.640]   You can add text to it.
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:07.280]   It is very cool and it is only $20 which I think is remarkable given the cost of other
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:09.640]   screen capture software.
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:12.320]   Some is the company.
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:14.560]   Screenium is the product.
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:19.560]   It just got a major update to use multicams and other features.
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:24.560]   1.06 just came out a couple of days ago which is pretty impressive since 1.0 only came
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:26.840]   out a month ago.
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:29.480]   They also do other software.
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:31.880]   Clean app, Mac family tree.
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:34.120]   You might know them from that.
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:40.480]   Just to keep it in the Benalux region.
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:43.840]   Did you find a local distributor for?
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:45.000]   I'm looking.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000]   I haven't yet.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.240]   I haven't yet.
[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:56.560]   There's a company that sells it online and they say it's not available in the US but
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:59.240]   if you go to our UK page you can order from there.
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:06.240]   It violates many FDA regulations.
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:34.000]   We're going to take it back home because we're going to recommend of course bare bones
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:40.040]   software.
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:46.120]   Get it for the amazing command line worksheets.
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:53.760]   I was a big MPW fan and if you ever use the MPW editor and you compiled from the editor,
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:59.160]   you'll know what I mean when you see these command line worksheet is so cool.
[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:01.680]   Just fantastic and many other great reasons.
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:07.640]   This is clearly the power tool for text on the Mac.
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:13.560]   I thought we'd declare this week retro software because between MPW and the talking moves.
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:15.400]   We've gone way back.
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:16.920]   Andy brought up the two CI.
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:18.920]   I think we've got a complete system.
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:23.600]   I think the worksheets must have been influenced by MPW.
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:29.040]   They were inspired by MPW back when MPW was still available.
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:33.840]   Maybe it actually had a worksheet that communicated with the MPW back.
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:34.840]   I remember that.
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:36.880]   I used it that way.
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:44.520]   For BB-Ed at 6.5, basically I reincarnated that same concept to talk to the Unix shell.
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:50.320]   Of course, your Jimbo, which I also use as my default notebook, syncs with mobile me
[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:52.280]   and it's just fantastic.
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:54.040]   I have your Jimbo on every machine.
[01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:56.560]   That's where all my passwords and serial numbers are.
[01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:59.240]   All of that from barebonessoftwarebearbones.com.
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:04.040]   As long as we're plugging the hosts, let's plug Andy's new book, which just came out.
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:05.040]   Yes.
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:09.920]   I just got my case of books just yesterday and people are emailing me saying that, "Dude,
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:11.280]   what the hell happened?"
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:13.960]   Well, I'm glad it chipped.
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:16.640]   No, iPhone fully loaded.
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:21.000]   Second edition contains all kinds of stuff about new apps.
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:28.720]   As I've been handed to the final drop-dead draft a little over five weeks ago, so almost
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:32.040]   everything is completely fresh.
[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:38.240]   I wore out the plastic on the Magic 8-Ball saying, "Okay, I am not going to write about
[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:44.000]   downloading podcasts directly because I really think this is going to be coming in a software
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000]   update."
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.680]   I accidentally deleted the section on I want Sandy because it didn't really fit into the
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:53.720]   chapter and that turned out to be pretty good.
[01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:54.720]   You're a prescient Andy.
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:55.720]   Yeah, I'm kidding.
[01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:56.720]   I'm kidding.
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:59.200]   It doesn't work in the stock market.
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:00.200]   It doesn't work with...
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:01.200]   It's just over there.
[01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:05.680]   The only way I can make money off of my prescientlessness is putting into the books.
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:08.880]   So ironically enough, only one that benefits you the reader.
[01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:09.880]   The reader.
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:11.720]   I phone unload it by...
[01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:12.720]   Unloaded by...
[01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:13.720]   Fully published.
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:14.720]   Fully published.
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:15.720]   ...quietly publishing.
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:16.720]   By widely...
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:17.720]   Available at...
[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:19.560]   ...regalable terms on both Barnes and Noble and Amazon.com.
[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:21.320]   And of course, Andy's at the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:25.720]   His website is the Celestial Waste of Ban with the C-W-O-B dot com.
[01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:31.000]   Rich Segal is the head and owner of Barebone Software, the greatest max software company
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:32.280]   of all time.
[01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:34.920]   They suck less.
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:35.920]   You were so kind.
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:36.920]   Thank you for saying that.
[01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:37.920]   They suck less.
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:38.920]   It's great to have you on.
[01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:39.920]   Thank you, Rich.
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:42.920]   I really appreciate your dropping everything, including your African parrots, to be with
[01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:43.920]   us.
[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:45.280]   Well Leo, thanks for having me.
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:47.240]   Unfortunately, the parrots have wings.
[01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:49.960]   So you can drop them and they fly away.
[01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:50.960]   No problem.
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:53.360]   Dude, they flap.
[01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:57.600]   And Andy, we'll look forward to hearing from your bird again sometime soon.
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:59.440]   I'll leave the windows open.
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:00.440]   It's 20 degrees outside.
[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:01.520]   They're probably dead by now.
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:03.440]   But you can sort of...
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:07.160]   Again, keeping of the Scandinavian theme, we can look upon the barren, lifeless land
[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:10.920]   and wonder about the bird song that once was there, but we'll never be there again.
[01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:11.920]   Oh my God.
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:12.920]   That's like a problem.
[01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:15.520]   So uplifting, I make cry.
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:18.120]   It's better with subtitles.
[01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:21.960]   All right, another Mac break is broke.
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:23.920]   Make sure you wipe it off when you're dead, okay?
[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:25.640]   (laughs)
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:27.800]   (music)
[01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:34.800]   (music)
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:39.800]   (music)
[01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:43.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
