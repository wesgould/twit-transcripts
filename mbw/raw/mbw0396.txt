[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.720]   Bigger? Is it better?

[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.720]   - This is actually very exciting.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.320]   We have launched the Twitch internet,
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.440]   what is it, International Friendship Satellite.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.160]   And now, Twitch can be seen in places without the internet,
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.800]   all around the world, a places where the internet is blocked.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.040]   And I think our video engineer, Alex Gumpel,
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.360]   is prepared to make-- - Are you gonna flip the switch?
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.920]   - Well, we actually have a live shot of the satellite.
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.760]   - Let's see it.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.480]   Wow, that's exciting.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.480]   It looks like Sandra Bullock is out there fixing it.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.680]   - It's not as much as I want from it.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.920]   (laughing)
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.080]   (laughing)
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.920]   - Pro.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.840]   - What do I do?
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.720]   What do I do?
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.480]   - Now in space.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.080]   So whenever you're ready, we can go--
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.560]   - We do the-- - We do the additional friendship.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.400]   - Satellite.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.080]   - You're a producer is getting your food.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.360]   (laughing)
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.160]   - And now let's flip the switch.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.440]   Are we ready to use the satellite?
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.280]   - Let us begin our broadcast day,
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.800]   coming to you live from the Twitch friendship,
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.240]   International Friendship Satellite.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.520]   - Okay, you can launch it.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.080]   - Flip the switch, here we go.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.320]   - There, look at that picture.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.080]   Okay.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.480]   (laughing)
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.720]   - That's coming to you from space, my friends.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.560]   - All right, let's--
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.440]   - So now, yeah, now all of our broadcast day
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.360]   will be coming to you from the satellite.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.560]   Look at that quality, huh?
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.400]   - I love it.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.240]   - Even you can't do that.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.720]   Take that, internets.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.100]   (laughing)
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.120]   Welcome to MacFrake Weekly, coming to you live from space.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.640]   This is really a red light.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.080]   - It's going to space.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.520]   - It's going to space.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.720]   - We wanna say hello to all our friends in North Korea
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.840]   in Turkey, in Russia.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.160]   It is, it is, it was really the launch
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.560]   of the International Friendship Satellite.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.960]   It's such a really significant, I think, advance for us here.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.040]   - I really see, I think the lower thirds
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.120]   have really improved as long as I am.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.680]   - You like those? - Yeah.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.920]   - We had a little issue with the Tricaster lower thirds.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.920]   We can't really use, so we have to have our own--
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.160]   - Right.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.920]   - A character, J-O-Kyron there.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.760]   - Yeah, it's Kyron.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.080]   - circa 1982.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.920]   - Yeah, back on.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.760]   - I like that.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.880]   - There's Andy.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.840]   It's got the wrong URL for his--
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.280]   (laughing)
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.160]   We can't fix it now because the guy who actually set those
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.400]   lower thirds up is dead.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.240]   - It's okay, it's a pun though.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.640]   (laughing)
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.640]   - But you, that's him up there hanging space.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.880]   Fixing the satellite.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.600]   Wow.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.080]   Renee Ritchie from Montreal.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.600]   Good to have you from iMore.com.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.440]   - Thank you, Leo.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.280]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.560]   - Renee, are you opening a store?
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.280]   It looks like you're opening a store.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.200]   Renee's got some serious Lego action.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.840]   And you have the, did you put the Arkham Asylum away in it?
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.840]   - I did, right over here.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.680]   I don't know if you can see it.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.160]   I need to get better lighting for it,
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.240]   but it's right behind me.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.560]   - This looks like an episode of Amnation.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.200]   (laughing)
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.800]   Hey, we got a special Amnation tonight,
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.680]   by the way, Joe Walsh is gonna be on the show.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.920]   I'm Twar Knight with the E from the Eagles.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.520]   And he's a ham, I didn't know this.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.440]   And he did the Ham Nation theme song.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.920]   So I'm hoping we'll put that episode of Ham Nation
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.240]   on the International Friendship Satellite as well.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.160]   I think that's fairly important.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.720]   Why did you go, I'm a little concerned
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.840]   'cause video engineer Alex Gumple
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.480]   went running across the studio.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.080]   Is there something I should?
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.400]   (laughing)
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.120]   He's just checking things.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.240]   The flux capacitor seems to be on the Fritz right now.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.160]   Do we have a shot of the signal processor
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.880]   that we're sending this stuff through?
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.880]   You would like this.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.720]   Did you see this?
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.360]   I haven't seen this before until today.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.040]   I didn't realize we had this all.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.840]   - Oh, we're entering the 20th century now.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.100]   (laughing)
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.120]   This is not a joke.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.120]   And actually, if you look at the wiring, it spells something.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.320]   - That is awesome.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.400]   - Geek TV.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.720]   So with that with the (laughing)
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.760]   the signal is going through that coiled wire.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.760]   They've run a 60 Hertz power cord across it.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.960]   What else can you do?
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.960]   They're fan, the fan's good.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.320]   It generates a little bit of...
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.200]   (laughing)
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.720]   - Oh my gosh.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.720]   This is awesome.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.560]   (laughing)
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.240]   There's a serious case of why didn't I think of that?
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.760]   (laughing)
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.400]   And I said they're in spend a lot of time doing effects
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.360]   and after effects and in other things.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.280]   And I could have just made a coil of wires
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.040]   and shaped them so good.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.480]   So good.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.120]   Thank you, Alex, for a...
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.320]   I charged him, I said,
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.680]   what would this show look like in 1968?
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.960]   - For transcript of the Phil Donahue show,
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.000]   send a self-addressed envelope to Mac Break Weekly,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.920]   396 episode Boulevard.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.160]   (laughing)
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.280]   - Even Alex looks the part.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.360]   Thank you, Alex Gumple.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.200]   You rocked.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.000]   And Happy April Fool's Day, everybody.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.160]   I'm not good at April Fool's jokes because I get bit.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.280]   I believe these things.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.760]   And it's very hard to go around the internet
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.240]   this time of year and try to figure out,
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.000]   is this true, is this not true?
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.320]   It's particularly a problem in the Mac news industry.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.000]   Since so much stuff is rumor and bizarre anyway.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.120]   - Is my mother's favorite holiday?
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.120]   - Shh.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.960]   - Oh my gosh.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.000]   - Is she the kind of person who puts salt in the sugar bowl
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.720]   so that when you get up for breakfast and you have your--
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.240]   - That was one of her many, many mornings.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.920]   - Is she short-shaped the beds?
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.120]   - Her favorite one was changing all of our clocks
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.360]   to two hours earlier for school.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.720]   - Oh, so mean.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.760]   - And then rushing us around and then us finding out
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.640]   that we were two hours earlier.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.800]   I mean, she would do, she would, yeah.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.800]   - She would, my dad actually wrecked his car on April one
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.800]   many years ago and he called and she wouldn't believe him.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.680]   He's like, he's like, I need you to send someone
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.600]   I'm hanging upside down.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.960]   - She just laughed at him.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.400]   - No, we can go clean now.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.240]   - Okay.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.080]   - I don't want to hear it too.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.800]   - Let's see the right company is sponsoring us today, Leo.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.840]   (laughing)
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.160]   - Tarleton.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.000]   - Well then we got--
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.440]   - What was the one where people had black eyes
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.280]   from--
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.120]   - I'd rather fight than switch.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:53.960]   - I'd rather fight than switch.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.800]   Was that Tarleton?
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.800]   All right, let's--
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.380]   (somber music)
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.960]   (somber music)
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:10.900]   - Okay, here we go.
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.100]   - No, no, no, it's so--
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.660]   (laughing)
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.100]   - I have, I have, I have, I have, I have,
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.980]   but, but, close your helmet, babe.
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.220]   (laughing)
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:26.740]   - You know, if you're wondering how he eats and greens
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.860]   and other science facts, just repeat to yourself,
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.300]   it's just a show that I should really just relax.
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.460]   (laughing)
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.380]   Or a back break weekly, or nine six.
[00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.540]   - Is that live?
[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.900]   - Yeah, it's live, we didn't record this.
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.660]   - Space, the final one to you.
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.060]   - That's a real can with a real beat on the front of it.
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.820]   - That's a beat, I don't know.
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.660]   - Brought to you by Emerson TV,
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.780]   the clearest, sharpest 12 inch picture in America.
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:58.500]   - RCA.
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:04.180]   - Hey, Burke, Burke, are you there, Burke?
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:08.740]   - Thank you, thanks, with which to kill people that aren't us.
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.860]   - They have to zoom in and then see him, like, hanging.
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.540]   - At Aloma, we have a problem.
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.700]   - I wonder if they'll figure out
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.780]   what my little joke is for today.
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.180]   - Oh, that's what I hate about April Fool's life.
[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.140]   - Oh, I can't keep it in, it's supposed to be Sir Galahad,
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.260]   but it's actually Sir Gawain, because Gawain wasn't taking,
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.140]   the empty table at the round table.
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.380]   (laughing)
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:31.980]   - This is good for the show, I'm sorry.
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:32.820]   - He's such a jokester.
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.020]   - I just sit on that one day, all right?
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.020]   I knew I'd blow it.
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.860]   'Cause everyone's probably like,
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.140]   "Oh my God, that looks like the round table."
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.940]   But that doesn't look like, oh.
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.220]   - That's what I was thinking.
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.500]   - I'm so excited. - He's such a wag.
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.340]   Alex Lindsey's also here from the Pixel Core,
[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:49.260]   nice to see you.
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.180]   - Good to be here.
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.140]   - And all the way to the right, Mr. Renee Ritchie
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.340]   of iMore.com, hi Renee.
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.180]   - Hi Leo, how are you doing?
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.580]   - Arkham Asylum over your left shoulder there.
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.180]   - Right there, I hope they don't take over
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.580]   the entire Asylum.
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:02.780]   - This is good, he really does look like
[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:03.900]   he's opening a store though.
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.980]   (laughing)
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.260]   - I see you have an Apple TV.
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:10.900]   I'd like to buy that.
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.140]   - The original one running Tiger,
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.260]   if you wanna go back to the Stone Age.
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.380]   - Wow.
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.260]   - It's the Renee Home Shopping Network.
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.100]   (laughing)
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:17.940]   Everything must go.
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.100]   - Did you hack that to run Tiger, or did it run Tiger?
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.580]   - Oh yeah, it shipped with a version of OS 10 Tiger,
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.580]   was the original operating system.
[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.140]   - You're kidding, I didn't know that.
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.340]   Or I guess I knew it and I forgot it.
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.740]   When Linda the Apple TV came out, come out.
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.300]   - 2007, it was 2006 that was showing off.
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.180]   And then 2007 it shared the stage
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.380]   with the original iPhone demo at Macworld.
[00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.460]   - Wow.
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.500]   Hey, speaking of Macworld,
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.140]   a lot of people in studio who were here,
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.460]   I presume you were here for Macworld Expo.
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.300]   Did you have fun?
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.460]   Was it a good week in San Francisco?
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.580]   Yeah, anybody here go to Macworld?
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.940]   Renee Ritchie.
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.500]   Thank you, the guy who came the farthest.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.140]   (laughing)
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.140]   How was Macworld Expo this year?
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.220]   - It was great, there were a lot of Macbreak Weekly fans,
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.620]   a lot of Twitch fans, they all came up,
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.260]   they all extended you their best wishes.
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.860]   And it was a fun show, I mean, it's a fan event now,
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.380]   because like we discussed last week,
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.980]   there's no Apple and there's CES and other shows.
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.420]   But this is the only place you can go
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:13.980]   and actually yell at the people who make your apps
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:14.820]   and your accessories.
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.420]   And a lot of people had a lot of fun doing that.
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.820]   - That's neat, yeah, it's a good time.
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.500]   You all glad you came, you're coming back next year?
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.300]   - Oh, that was not a resounding yes,
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.460]   but we'll work on them, we'll work.
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.220]   Anyway, we're glad you made the trip up to the Brickhouse
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.780]   'cause we're a little bit about an hour north of San Francisco.
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.740]   And you had to stick around a little extra.
[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.380]   We had a little rain, I think we're gonna have
[00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:38.700]   thunderstorms later today.
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:44.340]   So in the week this week, something happened on Thursday,
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.340]   that was a pretty big deal, Microsoft released
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.860]   Office for the iPad.
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.820]   And I actually think it's not bad,
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.540]   but I'd love to hear what you guys think.
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.820]   I doubt Alex Lindsey played with it at all.
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.660]   - And I'll use Office anymore.
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.980]   - That's the problem, it's a little late.
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.220]   - I just, I don't know, I'm not willing to commit.
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.860]   From a company perspective, I wasn't willing to commit
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.300]   the amount of money that I've spent on Office
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.660]   when I could just have pages and numbers.
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.020]   - Well, we have Excel for the heavy lifting,
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.940]   so we do still use that, so the really, really heavy lifting.
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.940]   But I haven't liked words since 5.1.
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:22.060]   - I think Macintosh users have always had a difficult
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.940]   relationship with Word, because it came out first
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.260]   on the Mac, right?
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:30.060]   And, but it was always a little bit odd.
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.020]   The memory management was Microsoft's brand,
[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.260]   memory management was a little strange.
[00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.020]   It didn't operate quite like a Mac program,
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.940]   and yet it was Mac, you know, it was one of the first
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.300]   Mac power tools and sold very well.
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.500]   In fact, I know that Microsoft considered Word
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.100]   or Office, I should say, on the Mac
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.900]   to be one of their cash cows.
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.460]   - One, and I think that, I think that Word's fine.
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.580]   I think that really my complaints are really Excel
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:58.060]   and especially PowerPoint are just, you know, rustic.
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.620]   You know, when it comes to like design,
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:00.460]   I mean, I think Excel does--
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.220]   - Pages is prettier, although the new pages,
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.260]   to me, like pages, doesn't look very good compared
[00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.100]   to even the Word.
[00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.020]   - I have to admit, it's not so much, I think pages
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.100]   looks fine, I think the problem is it's just really heavy.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.020]   You always feel like you're like moving through molasses.
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.180]   And so we tend to use Google Docs for a lot of that stuff,
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.700]   but when it comes to, like if you're organizing something,
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:17.820]   you want to spread sheet.
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.020]   You know, there's nothing like numbers.
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.460]   Not if you want to run giant sheets of financials,
[00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:23.700]   but if you just want to organize stuff
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.220]   that you would use Excel for,
[00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.580]   numbers just leaves it in the dust.
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:28.900]   And nothing's--
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:29.740]   - If you want nothing to do--
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.060]   - No, at least it does deep financial analysis.
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.620]   - No, no, no, the front office stuff.
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:35.460]   You can make use Excel.
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.460]   - No, that's Excel, but I think that if you're looking,
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.820]   90% of the people who use Excel do not do that.
[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.660]   - Right.
[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.500]   - You know, they're organizing stuff.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.340]   - They do, yeah.
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.180]   - They seem to spread sheet.
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.380]   And numbers is just so much faster.
[00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.060]   And then in addition to that keynote,
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.380]   I mean, we work in the presentation world
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.420]   and nobody who is serious about presentations uses.
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.980]   I mean, lots of little business people use PowerPoint,
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:58.660]   but no one who's serious about presentations
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:13:59.900]   use anything but keynote.
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.940]   If they're going to use a presentation tool,
[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.180]   you know, I mean, it's so much, so much more.
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.540]   So you look at this, it's fine.
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:06.580]   I mean, you gotta have,
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.620]   there's definitely a lot of people
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.460]   that are going to use it.
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.300]   - And do you, for a while anyway,
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.860]   we're writing and doing everything on an iPad, right?
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.940]   - Yeah, and it's still pretty much my primary
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.020]   outside of the office computer.
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:25.020]   And I gotta say that I really prefer word to pages,
[00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.580]   at least in the week that I've been using it.
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.820]   Only because I don't think,
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.020]   I'm not sure if I'd say the same thing
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.740]   about the iOS six version of pages
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.220]   because my complaint about pages now is that
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.020]   I think that with the iOS 7 makeover,
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.860]   they went so hard with the bleach
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:44.500]   and the scouring pad that I often can't really orient myself
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.020]   on the features that I'm using right now,
[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.820]   where I am in the page and stuff like that.
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:48.940]   I mean, it's not confusing,
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.540]   but I kinda like the reassuring more,
[00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:55.340]   you know, the louder voice of the interface in Word.
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:59.620]   Also, there is, as someone who's written a bunch of books,
[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:02.180]   knowing how important it is to round trip a chapter
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.380]   of a Word document with notes, edit tracks,
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.300]   all that sort of stuff and make sure those are intact.
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.100]   That's another big win for Word.
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:14.140]   I think that it's hard to think about how it's gonna compete
[00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.740]   in a world in which the iWork apps are free,
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.340]   but when you think of it as a free app for people
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.540]   who are already subscribed to Office 365,
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:26.180]   and therefore people who are already invested in those tools,
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.860]   boy, is that a big win.
[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.260]   They work great, they're very, very native,
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.380]   they're easy to use.
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.860]   In the case of Word, where they deleted features,
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.340]   they didn't really trim it down,
[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:38.380]   they'd simply remove the stuff that almost nobody would
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.100]   even consider using on a tablet.
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:45.100]   And if anything, it makes an iPad mini that much more impressive
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.740]   and that much more useful than it even was a couple months ago,
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.380]   because putting this on an iPad mini is now,
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:51.980]   gee, why am I traveling with a notebook?
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.180]   Why am I even traveling with a larger sized iPad?
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:58.180]   Because again, when you, I have not been using an iPad mini
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.780]   for iWork stuff, because again, when you make that really,
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.540]   really minimalistic interface and scrunch it down,
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:08.100]   for me, it's a hard place to live for four, five, or six hours
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.660]   to do like a whole day's worth of work on when I'm traveling.
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:14.260]   But office on the iPad, easy, comfortable,
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.340]   and the screen isn't necessarily that much smaller
[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:17.180]   than it needed to be.
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:25.620]   I have to say, I do pay for office because I just, well,
[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.300]   I could say I use it on a variety of platforms.
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.420]   And it's a fairly good deal.
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:30.420]   I pay $99 a year.
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.540]   Somebody just said you can get it for as little as $67
[00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.060]   for a year on Amazon.
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.660]   And I have to say, when I looked at the last version of office
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:40.020]   and I had to go to a store and buy a box for like 400 bucks,
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.580]   that was a real stopper.
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.260]   It was hard for me to justify that.
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.220]   But to say, hey, you're going to pay eight bucks a month.
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.900]   And not only that, at Microsoft, it's saying every time
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.220]   we enhance the office world, you get that for free.
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.860]   You don't have to buy the iPad product.
[00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.940]   You're not going to have to buy the Windows phone product.
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.140]   It's just going to come up for free.
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:57.940]   Well, that was the deal.
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:01.300]   So for that price, I got five installed desktop versions.
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:02.660]   And that means I have one on Windows,
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:06.580]   but I also have two on Macintosh, even though it's Office 2011.
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.020]   They do promise they'll update it when the new office comes out.
[00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:12.740]   And then now they're saying, and you can have five tablet installs.
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:16.100]   Although, as CNET pointed out, nobody's paying any attention to that.
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:20.180]   So Microsoft's saying, yeah, we're not really counting your tablet installs.
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.020]   Not as Apple.
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:25.700]   Which means, right, but it does mean that there's a loophole that means
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.540]   that I could, for instance, give you my--
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:31.180]   I would never do this, but I could give you my Office 365 login.
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.100]   And you could install it on your iPad and play with it.
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.340]   It is-- correct me if I'm wrong, Renee.
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:40.220]   If you install Word, Excel, and PowerPoint,
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.380]   you can open and view documents without anything.
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:44.220]   Yeah, you can open them.
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:44.820]   You can view them.
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:48.180]   And you can even present them if you want to show them off to your team,
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.540]   or use them around the office.
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:54.100]   In order to edit them, you need the Office 365 subscription.
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:54.740]   I'm OK with that.
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.940]   I have an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription.
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:00.260]   I like that way better than the old model of having to decide every two years
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.180]   whether this was the update I get and this was the update I skip.
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.340]   It's like having a slow leak instead of a blowout.
[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:07.380]   Are you that features faster?
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.740]   Because none of us are saving all year.
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.220]   You know, it's like--
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:14.260]   This is my money's dribbling out of my wallet instead of flying out of my wallet.
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.020]   It ends up being somewhat the same probably.
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.340]   And they did a much better job with the iPad apps
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.020]   than they did with their dismal iPhone apps.
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:22.220]   I was really happy.
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.340]   You never know, when you're waiting a long time for something
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.460]   and there's a huge pent up demand, it might be Episode 1,
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:31.100]   or it might be Indiana Jones 4, where you're so excited to get it
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.100]   and then you spend a lot of time with it and you're like,
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.100]   it's not exactly what I wanted.
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.980]   But this is a really great program.
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.180]   The only problem I think they have is they waited so long to get it to market.
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.940]   They seem to want people, especially in business, to not use an iPad
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.260]   because they couldn't get office on it.
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:50.860]   And it turned out they stopped using office if they wanted to use an iPad.
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.740]   And it gave iWork a ton of time to catch up.
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.540]   It gave Google Docs a fair amount of time to catch up.
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:59.620]   So the casual needs sort of evaporated, but still for those people in Enterprise
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:03.700]   who have the subscription, now they can use the iPad with want and abandon.
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.660]   Yeah.
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.860]   And that is the big deal.
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:09.340]   People tend to forget that think of office as a set of apps.
[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:14.540]   When it's actually it's a platform just as big as Windows, just as big as Mac OS,
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.500]   just as big as iOS, where people-- this is where they live.
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.780]   This is where all their documents are.
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.540]   This is where all their collaborative tools are.
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:25.100]   And so if your office is standardized on Microsoft Office,
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.540]   and it's almost a certainty that it is, the ability to simply magically say
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:34.340]   that this $500 iPad now will essentially be an extension of your entire workspace
[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:38.740]   on your office or on your $2,000 laptop, that's a big win.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.380]   It would be nice if they came out with this a couple of years ago,
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:45.060]   but if they came out with it a couple of years ago and it's stank,
[00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:50.260]   then I don't think people would be complaining about Microsoft's fall.
[00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.180]   I think they'll do just fine with it as is right now.
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:55.700]   The new CEO of Microsoft Satya Nadella introduced it on Thursday.
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.300]   And people at reporters asked him after the event, why did it take so long?
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.060]   You know, there's two schools of thought for this.
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:05.220]   One is that under Steve Bomber and Bill Gates,
[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.860]   they were never going to release this for the iPad
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:12.940]   before they released it for Surface, for their own hardware.
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:17.060]   They felt that that was a selling point for Surface if you had to use Office.
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:20.300]   Well, you'd get a Microsoft tablet.
[00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.260]   Right.
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.020]   And then the other school of thought was,
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.860]   kind of more like what you just said, Andy, they had to get it right.
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:28.220]   Nadella said it was the latter.
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.460]   He says, "We've obviously been working on this for a while.
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.940]   The thing we wanted to get most right was the combin—"
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.380]   and this is very Microsoft, what I'm about to tell you—
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:41.340]   "was the combination of the app, the enterprise architecture,
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:45.020]   the developer APIs, and then marry it with the device
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.380]   and what you'd expect from the device."
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.220]   It's not just a trivial thing.
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.740]   Let's port Word for Windows to a particular device.
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:51.820]   I think they succeeded here.
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.260]   It is really a touch-first version of Word.
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.820]   The touch targets are a trifle small,
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.780]   which is always a problem on Windows as well in touch.
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.100]   But it's usable.
[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.220]   It's touch native.
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.060]   And the interesting thing to me is that—
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:07.060]   The interesting thing to me is that I think the bomber story
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:09.140]   has a lot of credit because Bill Gates and Steve Bomber
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:12.260]   were very platform first, but their platform was the PC.
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.100]   And Nadella is a cloud services guy.
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:17.780]   His platform is things like SharePoint and things like OneDrive.
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:21.140]   And while you can store your documents from Office for iPad,
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:24.380]   locally on your iPad, it's much more powerful with SharePoint links
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.940]   and with a OneDrive account.
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:28.300]   And I think he's sort of giving up that notion
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.740]   that you have to have that PC on every desktop.
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.180]   And he's going in where he wants Microsoft services
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.180]   on every device.
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.340]   And it's a different strategy, but it could be a really good one.
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:40.380]   Well, and it could be a nod to the fact that they're giving up on the OS,
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.660]   but I think that really they have a lot of great services
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.580]   that are not Microsoft Windows.
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:47.940]   It's a perfect example.
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:51.020]   Azure, which is their cloud service, was Windows Azure.
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:53.340]   It has been renamed to Microsoft Azure.
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.740]   I think it might be reading too much into it,
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:59.380]   but I think there are a lot of little signs that this is a new Microsoft
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:04.220]   and that he is, Nasecha is going to take it in that direction of enterprise first,
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:05.820]   cloud platform first.
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.820]   It's no longer Windows first.
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.260]   And I think that's a very good thing.
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:09.780]   It's smart.
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.060]   It's what they need to do.
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:15.260]   I don't know that's necessarily because of the arrival of a new CEO a few months ago.
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:16.900]   I think that's why the new CEO is there.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:21.620]   Well, I think it's the reason why they brought up their CEO from cloud services
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.700]   instead of anything else.
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:28.980]   I really think that the missing link that stalled this project was Office 365.
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:32.020]   I think they had a long range strategy of moving Office,
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:35.540]   decentralizing it and basically saying it is irrelevant to us what device,
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:38.060]   where you physically are when you're running this service,
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.300]   we're going to make sure that everything works so closely together
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.700]   that you will want to continue to use this service.
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.220]   Once that strategy crystallized itself,
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:49.220]   I think that's the only, that was the moment of inspiration that allowed the rest of these
[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:53.580]   teams to say, okay, so now we know how we're going to make Office for mobile.
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:58.100]   And also, let's also not overlook that Apple threw a massive grenade
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:02.460]   into everybody's development schedule last year, last summer when they showed off iOS 7,
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:07.340]   where we all know so many developers who essentially had to go to the whiteboard calmly
[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:10.940]   with a glass of whiskey in one hand, a dry erase eraser in the other hand and say,
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:14.460]   okay, we have to totally redesign our app from the ground up
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.900]   because this is so totally different from what we've been developing for the past year
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.860]   that none of them would have been doing to make sense.
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.660]   So I don't know how much earlier they could have released this
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.900]   if they had, if not for iOS 7.
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:29.060]   No, and we know a lot of app developers had that pain point as well when iOS 7 came out.
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:30.460]   I believe Microsoft did as well.
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.380]   I mean, I've heard that Microsoft did as well.
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.020]   But the only thing to me that sort of,
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:40.100]   so I can't see a world where Apple would have put the OS 10 version of
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.420]   iWork on the iPad.
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:45.300]   And I think it was telling that Microsoft didn't have a touch version of Office
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:49.900]   ready to go with the surface, that it's mobile has been hard for many companies.
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.260]   It's been really hard for Facebook.
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.820]   It's been really hard for Microsoft.
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:56.620]   But I think the Office for iPad shows that they're going to finally getting all their
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.820]   ducks in their own, not just with their own operating system,
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.580]   but with all their software and services as well.
[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:02.260]   I thought it was interesting too.
[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.020]   And maybe I'm reading way too much into this.
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:08.700]   But when Nadella wanted to show it off, he said, give me my iPad.
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:12.220]   And the only reason I make a big point of that my iPad is that,
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:16.100]   remember Bill Gates forbade his children to have iPods?
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.500]   He would not let his kids have Apple products in the house.
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:23.540]   This is a company, I mean, remember Steve Ballmer, somebody was in the front row
[00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:27.100]   with an iPhone, he took it at a company all hands meeting,
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.420]   he took it from the guy and pretended a stamp on it.
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.420]   This is a company that didn't welcome Apple products.
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:36.500]   And so for Satya Nadella to say, give me my, I don't think that's a mistake.
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:37.300]   I don't think that's an accident.
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.500]   I think that's sweet.
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.700]   The iTunes link.
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.860]   Yeah, they want to sell the service.
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.980]   They don't care so much about the platform stretch anymore.
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:50.340]   And also, it makes perfect sense that they were released this for iOS
[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:53.580]   before even their Windows platforms, Windows tablets.
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:58.340]   Because if you think about it, it's already very, very easy to get Microsoft Office
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:02.060]   and a $500 tablet that runs a Microsoft offering system.
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:05.180]   Because you can buy a $500 Windows 8 tablet legit.
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.540]   So maybe that wasn't quite so much pressure.
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:11.420]   But yeah, and if they had been able to simply make an emphatic statement
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:15.820]   about how important the Windows Metro interface is,
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:17.820]   that here is how we're going to redesign all of our apps
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.180]   so that they make more sense on mobile.
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:24.140]   God, that would have been such a welcome shot of credibility
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:29.900]   for a platform that's now being allowed to grow and sort of take its time.
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.620]   It's a hobby for them right now.
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:32.420]   They're very proud of it.
[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.300]   They're pleased with the sales numbers.
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.820]   But they're going to have a patient attitude.
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.460]   We don't want to release this until it's perfectly right.
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:40.100]   No, no.
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.380]   We had a guy on Sunday at Twit who was in town
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:48.540]   because he was installing Windows 7 machines in a bank because they had XP.
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:54.260]   And hundreds of seats of Windows 7, he says he's been doing this all over the country.
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.260]   I said, any Windows 8?
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.100]   He said nobody even says the word 8.
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.900]   It just doesn't come on.
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:03.540]   And I think that this is the scene, this movement is the first thing I've seen Microsoft do
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:06.020]   where I think they're going the right direction.
[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:10.060]   Because I think the Windows, I mean obviously it has a fair amount
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.660]   of historical momentum that's going to keep it going for another decade.
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.940]   Wow, users, a billion users.
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:14.940]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.540]   There's historical momentum.
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:21.020]   But I think that they've got to be someone in the background saying,
[00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.700]   are days of operating systems or...?
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:23.780]   No, I think they know that.
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:26.340]   And I think Satya Nadella was specifically brought in.
[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:28.100]   In fact, I think even Ballmer said that.
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:32.220]   He says, I'm not the guy who's going to make the transition to devices and services.
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:34.660]   We need somebody who can make that transition and that's who they brought in.
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:36.860]   That's really makes perfect sense.
[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.060]   My only question is, is it like Windows Phone?
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:42.180]   You know, Microsoft, I think Windows Phone is great.
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:43.340]   It's a beautiful operating system.
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:44.340]   It's nicely done.
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.940]   It was so late to the party.
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:49.220]   It's probably dead on arrival just because nobody's going to develop apps for it.
[00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:53.780]   I'm wondering if the same problem here with touch first operating systems,
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.740]   touch first applications, they're late to the game.
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:01.820]   I mean, Office for the iPad is so late at this point that I would guess most people
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:05.340]   have a workaround or a solution and they're not even going to look at it.
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:09.340]   But I think the market they're playing to is Microsoft's strongest market historically,
[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:11.140]   which is the I don't care market.
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.460]   I've talked about this before that.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:16.220]   I think that it sounds like I'm insulting people who have Microsoft products,
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.540]   but they're people who just want something functional.
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:22.580]   This is a computer and software is a practical functional piece of equipment
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.140]   that they use to get their work done.
[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:28.260]   And so if you simply say, if they were in the market for any sort of a tablet at this point,
[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:33.220]   and you tell them that, oh, by the way, we now have a product so that you don't necessarily,
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:40.460]   so that the apps and the data and the SharePoint and cloud storage that is native to your
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:43.900]   office solutions in your office are now working on this tablet.
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:44.900]   Fine.
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:45.900]   Oh, but I was going to use I work.
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:50.340]   Yeah, I work uses iCloud and you can export it to something else and then maybe email
[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:55.700]   it to yourself and then import it into this other or you can just use this office product
[00:27:55.700 --> 00:28:00.060]   that will simply open the file where it is, edit it where it is, save it where it is.
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:03.620]   So it's not so much being late to the game so much as having something valuable to the
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:06.180]   people who just want something to work.
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.260]   I think I feel the same way about Windows Phone 2.
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:14.380]   It's not even necessary that Microsoft have a 20% market share by X date.
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:17.740]   So long as they have a credible product, that a certain amount of people are going to find
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:23.180]   it easy to use, at least it'll be there so that when they do need an emphatically mobile
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:26.940]   operating system to do something that no other operating system can do, it's there.
[00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:32.180]   And these phones that Nokia is making are definitely serving the score there.
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.180]   All right.
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.420]   Well, there you go, Office for the iPad.
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:39.820]   It's free to download, free to use as a reader only.
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:45.420]   And if you have a friend with an Outlook login or Microsoft Office 365 login, you can borrow
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:47.420]   theirs and use it.
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:48.420]   Don't share your login.
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:49.420]   It's not.
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:50.420]   Don't share your login.
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.220]   I don't mind seeing their Mythbusters fan fiction.
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.220]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:56.180]   And I think that's why Microsoft isn't really too worried about this loophole.
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:29:00.020]   So yeah, it's reporting is if I gave you my login, you'd have all my documents.
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.060]   You'd have access to my OneDrive.
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:04.860]   And that seems like a pretty dumb thing to do.
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:06.700]   Well, and I think that's a great thing.
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:13.180]   It's a great policy too of having people naturally figure out how far they want to share.
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:14.180]   Yeah.
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:15.180]   Rather than having all those phrases.
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:16.180]   They don't have to waste this.
[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.180]   That's new Microsoft too, by the way.
[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:23.220]   Bill Gates put three, not one, not two, but three different DRM copy protections on Windows.
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:26.660]   He was so, he was famously paranoid.
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:27.660]   So the fact that-
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:28.660]   It's telling my software.
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:29.660]   Yeah.
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:30.660]   All the way from all the way from all Tera Basic.
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.140]   That was this first big splash.
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:35.620]   Writing a letter saying, "Hey, I know that you're copying our L-Tera Basic on paper tape.
[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:37.540]   We're telling you that we need to get paid for this."
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:38.540]   Yeah.
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.060]   So this is also new.
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:41.940]   That there is a, "You know what?
[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:42.940]   You can install it."
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:43.940]   It's all right.
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.260]   We're not going to do anything about it.
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.940]   That's a very different Microsoft.
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.740]   Incidentally, also very different Microsoft.
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:54.820]   And perhaps one of the sticking points, Apple's 30% VIG turns out, according to Ena Free,
[00:29:54.820 --> 00:30:01.620]   that recode Apple does get 30% if you subscribe to Office 365 within the app, which you can
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:02.620]   do.
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.020]   Apple will get its 30%.
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:06.020]   Choo-ching.
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:07.020]   Choo-ching.
[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:11.100]   It's still a different than Walmart getting 50% of the profits of everything sold in their
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:12.100]   store.
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.740]   It's Apple Store, but digital goods are different.
[00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:17.940]   And sometimes the 30% is all the margin that a service like Netflix or Amazon gets.
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:19.820]   It needs to be sorted out.
[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:21.780]   Does it feel like the momentum?
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:25.860]   I mean, I have to admit that now, I mean, there's definitely high-end graphics apps that
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.020]   I still buy and install and everything else.
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:33.780]   But if it's something that unless it can't work without being inside the sandbox or it's
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:38.860]   really a big application, I kind of look sideways at almost everything that isn't in
[00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:39.860]   the App Store.
[00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.380]   Because it's just, when you get a new computer and you want to install everything and you
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:45.500]   install 100, you know, I have 100 apps that get installed automatically, I don't have
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:49.020]   to go through the gauntlet of upgrading.
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.380]   I think that had to be part of their calculation.
[00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:52.380]   Yeah.
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:56.820]   And also, I think they've figured out that very few people are going to be buying their
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:00.140]   first office 365 subscription through this iPad app.
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:02.620]   I think they're mostly going to be getting people who have already bought it and this
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:03.980]   is going to be a value add.
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:04.980]   Right.
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:05.980]   Yeah, it's not a lot of loss.
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:09.780]   One thing I do like about this strategy, and I know this isn't the Microsoft show, but
[00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:11.700]   I'll just throw this in and we'll stop.
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:20.260]   But with one note free now for the Macintosh with Office 365 with iPad, they're truly
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.260]   cross-platform.
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:27.780]   I mean, I can open my OneDrive on virtually any mobile or desktop operating system.
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:33.540]   I can open my Word documents, edit them, round trip 100% from Android, from iOS.
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:38.060]   I think there's some way that they're now ahead of Apple as far as iWork goes in that
[00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.060]   area.
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.300]   We expect Google Docs to do that.
[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.300]   Right.
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.100]   But it's better than Google Docs.
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:47.220]   Although, today when I had to write something, what did I open up?
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.660]   I opened up a Google Doc document.
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:55.700]   Google Docs is not as good as it is when you run it on an iPad, you realize how much
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:59.460]   you get by having a native app with a native user interface.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:05.780]   As good as HTML5 apps get, it'll never be that responsive.
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:08.620]   Speaking of which, by the way, the app...
[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:13.780]   The first HTML app that most of us used came out this day 10 years ago.
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:15.660]   Can you think of what that is?
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:16.660]   It's Gmail.
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:17.660]   It's Gmail.
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:18.660]   10 years old.
[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:27.020]   Harry McCracken with a fabulous article on how Gmail got written, some kind of behind-the-scenes
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:30.340]   stuff on his time site, TechLanit.time.com.
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.300]   Where did I scroll, please?
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:33.300]   There it is.
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.980]   The inside story of Gmail's launch 10 years ago today.
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:41.700]   What I didn't really think about, but it's really true, is that Paul Bucheit and his team
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:45.380]   wrote really the first web app that many of us had used.
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.380]   Even Yahoo!
[00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.860]   Mail and Hotmail at the time were really just web interfaces.
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.660]   They weren't web apps.
[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:51.660]   This was an app.
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:52.660]   Web 2.0, Ajax.
[00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:53.660]   Yeah.
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:57.260]   Ajax was created essentially for Gmail.
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:59.260]   So I just...
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:03.420]   Google Maps sticks out for me as the first experience that I ever had with web apps.
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:05.260]   Pretty amazing.
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:13.500]   Gmail was the first, in fact, Harry confesses that I think he bought a Gmail invite on eBay
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:16.740]   because everybody wanted it and you couldn't get it.
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:20.620]   One of the things that he reveals is that when Gmail first launched, it was running on
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:26.620]   a bunch of Pentium 2s in a closet at Google because Google wouldn't give them the resources.
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:31.420]   They didn't think Gmail was a big deal or was going to go anywhere.
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:36.620]   It was just a bunch of Pentium 2s they had lying around.
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:41.300]   300 old Pentium 2 computers, nobody else at Google wanted.
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:43.300]   That's why it was such a limited beta rollout.
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:47.940]   I remember getting an invite very early on and I still use Gmail.
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:51.220]   It still is the default email client for most people.
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:55.580]   Very much like when Google came out, you could tell if somebody was hip when you asked
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:59.140]   them what search engine you use and they said, "Alta Vista," you thought, "Nah."
[00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:00.740]   But if they said, "Google," you're with it.
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:03.060]   What's your email address?
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:04.060]   Hotmail.com?
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:05.060]   Yeah.
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:06.060]   Google Gmail.com?
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.060]   Oh.
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.060]   One of my favorite.
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:15.340]   One of my editor at the SunTimes, original editor who retired, he told me that by far,
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:18.220]   his favorite line that I'd ever written in any tech piece was when I said that if you
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:21.820]   have an AOL.com email address, it's like showing up to a job interview with a clip
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:22.820]   on bow tie.
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:26.540]   That's a very good line.
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:29.500]   Speaking of nerds and we're going to take a break, but when we come back, Will Wheaton's
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:36.060]   beautiful response at Comic Con in Denver to a little girl, a 12-year-old girl who asked
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:39.420]   him, "How did you handle being called a nerd as a kid?"
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:40.420]   And it's such a beautiful response.
[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:43.020]   I just want to play it in its entirety since we are all nerds.
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.020]   Are we not?
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:45.020]   Yes.
[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.020]   Yes, we are.
[00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:48.180]   Our show today brought to you by Lynda.com.
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:50.460]   I'll play the video in just a second.
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:56.540]   Lynda.com is a great place if you are a nerd or want to be nerd to learn software, business
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:02.460]   skills, creative skills for personal or professional goals with a Lynda.com subscription, you get
[00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:10.900]   unlimited access to over 2,400 courses in every aspect of technology.
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:15.580]   I almost want to say life because it's not just technology, how to negotiate a deal that
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:18.140]   is there to how to create a resume.
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:20.700]   You can see any of the videos, they're high quality.
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:23.740]   We're not talking to YouTube stuff.
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:28.660]   These are well done videos and everything from photography and web design, app development,
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:30.940]   business strategies.
[00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:36.860]   If you want to record music, and I know Jason Howell who does this in his free time has
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.460]   said these are great videos.
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.660]   Logic Pro X, they'll show you how to use it.
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:41.660]   Logic Pro X.
[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:48.540]   How to use Final Cut Pro X to edit videos, pages, keynote, numbers.
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.180]   And the thing is there's always new videos.
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:55.380]   So they'll be an iOS office, new videos any minute now.
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.740]   I've had Lynda.com I think almost from day one.
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:35:58.740]   Every business should.
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.260]   It's 25 bucks a month.
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:04.500]   It's like this is just I have it just so that when I'm trying to figure something out,
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:09.100]   I can go up there and because what's great about it also is it's not just that you have
[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.180]   all this training because it'll be nine hours of training Photoshop.
[00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:13.740]   I don't want to watch nine hours of training, but they break it all up.
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:17.420]   So what I'll do is I'll look up there and go, oh, I got to figure out this new tool
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:21.500]   in Photoshop and I'll find the five or eight minute clip inside of that.
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:22.500]   Watch it.
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:23.500]   You know, that's going to be well produced.
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:24.500]   It's going to be well thought out.
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:25.500]   Well, it's my friends.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:29.340]   I mean, Chris Breen does some great stuff there.
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:33.860]   Bert Monroy, our Photoshop guru has a weekly show that's free by the way on Lynda.com.
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:39.620]   In fact, if you go to Lynda, L-Y-N-D-A.com/MacBreak, you can see some of the shows Chris
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:43.420]   and Bert do all levels, beginner, intermediate, advanced.
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:46.700]   You can watch on your computer, your tablet, your mobile device.
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.540]   You know, in other nice features, they have written transcripts that you can search for
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:52.540]   the stuff you want to learn and jump right to that part of the video, which is very,
[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:53.540]   very handy.
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:54.540]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.460]   And now they have this kind of nice thing.
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:59.060]   You get the certificate of completion when you finish a course.
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.540]   You can put it on your LinkedIn profile.
[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:02.100]   It's great for working professionals.
[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.780]   And I think people know that, yeah, oh, yeah, you now know how to use Photoshop or
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:10.100]   you know how to edit in the Lightroom, that kind of thing.
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:13.300]   It's only $25 a month for access to the entire library.
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.340]   They have other plans for $37.50 a month.
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:18.100]   You get the premium plan that includes the exercise files.
[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:22.100]   So you can get all of the layers of a Photoshop project, for instance, and work along with
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:23.400]   the instructor.

[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:50.420]   Will Wheaton.
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:52.820]   I'll just play the girls question.
[00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.180]   This is on YouTube.
[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:57.420]   And Will Wheaton's response from the Denver Comic Con.
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:02.580]   When you were a kid, were you called a nerd?
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:05.380]   And it's so, how did you do it then?
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:12.340]   Well, I was a little boy, I was called nerd all this morning because in my sports, I
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:14.740]   loved to read.
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.940]   I liked math and science.
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:21.740]   I thought school was really cool.
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:24.940]   And it hurt a lot.
[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:30.860]   Because it's never okay when a person makes fun of you for something like you didn't
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:31.860]   choose.
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.580]   You know, we don't choose to be nerds.
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:35.580]   We can't help it that we like these things.
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:40.580]   And we should not apologize for like these things.
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:45.460]   Now we're done.
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:49.620]   I wish that I could tell you that there's a really easy way to just not care.
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:51.620]   But the truth is it hurts.
[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:54.620]   But here's the thing that you might be able to understand.
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:59.420]   And as a matter of fact, I'm confident we'll be able to understand this because you asked
[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:00.420]   this question.
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:06.180]   When a person makes fun of you, when a person is cruel to you, it has nothing to do with
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:07.180]   you.
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:08.780]   It's not about what you said.
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:10.340]   It's not about what you did.
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.100]   It's not about what you loved.
[00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.820]   It's about them feeling bad about themselves.
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:16.780]   They feel sad.
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:20.180]   They don't get positive attention from their parents.
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.460]   They don't feel smartness.
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:25.860]   They don't understand the things that you understand.
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:30.820]   Maybe one of their parents is really pushing you into being assured that you're a poor,
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:35.300]   a small player or an engineer or something that they just don't want to do.
[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:41.100]   So they take that out of you because they can't know what you mean in the person who's
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:42.100]   actually very rude.
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:46.500]   So when a person is cruel to you like that, I know that this is hard.
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:57.380]   But honestly, the kind and best reaction is to pick them and don't let them make you
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:59.740]   feel bad because you love them.
[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:02.820]   Maybe find out what they love.
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:05.020]   And talk about how they love them.
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:10.060]   I bet you find out that a person who loves Ted or all loves Ted or all of them.
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:12.260]   Is that the same way that you love Dr. Edward?
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:17.060]   But you just love different things and I will talk to this.
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:19.260]   It absolutely gets better as you go.
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:31.100]   And I know it's really hard when you're in school and you're surrounded by the same
[00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:36.140]   400 people a day that they can't even make you feel bad about yourself.
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:43.140]   But there's 50,000 people here in Sweden who went through the exact same thing.
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:48.180]   You were all doing what you wanted.
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.900]   That's a really nice statement.
[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:54.420]   Let's just put that on the wall and frame it so kids growing up can...
[00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:55.580]   I was there in fact.
[00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:56.580]   Were you there?
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:59.300]   Oh man, I didn't know that.
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:03.820]   I was there to interview and/or introduce William Shatter.
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:04.820]   What?
[00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:07.060]   Wait a minute.
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:09.980]   How did that go?
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:11.460]   It's a long story.
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:12.460]   It went great.
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:17.180]   I have a Shatterner story that is highly positive and highly wonderful.
[00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:21.140]   Basically they were flying me out to what was going to be an hour long interview of Stan
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:24.420]   Lee and then he dropped out and they got Shatter instead and so I had to figure out,
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:28.540]   "Okay, I don't know whether Mr. Shatter will want an interview or just meet to introduce
[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:31.020]   him and get the hell off the stage."
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:38.500]   It was the first time I'd actually seen Will in a convention sort of environment because
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:44.220]   you and I both met him at a geek ruses and places like that.
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:48.620]   He said exactly the right thing to a person who needed to hear it at exactly the right
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:53.020]   time and there's very little that I could possibly add to that.
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:55.380]   I was really impressed because that's the kind of...
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:42:00.220]   You're in a situation where probably the quick-lib answer would be the first thing I would do
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:01.660]   and a lot of people would do.
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:06.860]   The fact that he sat back and he actually answered it from his heart, I think was really
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:07.860]   great.
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:08.860]   Really great.
[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:10.780]   I just wanted to go ahead.
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:16.020]   The best part is the value of empathy that he talked about.
[00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:21.900]   I've seen people do these, it gets better videos and a lot of them are not very good
[00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:25.460]   because they say, "When you're being bullied, think about how 10 years from now because
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.460]   you're curious and you're smart.
[00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:31.020]   That person's going to be dumb and he's not going to have a good job and you can think
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:32.220]   about how much better you're doing."
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:34.580]   No, that's really not it.
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:38.900]   It's basically the core message is that you're, unfortunately, you're 10 or 11 years old.
[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:43.180]   You have very little experience in talking to people and so it's very hard for you to
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:49.540]   understand where people's thoughts and their hurtful statements come from and doesn't mean
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:54.020]   that you necessarily have to say, "Yes, please abuse me and shout harmful things at me and
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:57.380]   make me want to throw up every morning before I leave the house to go to school."
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:02.500]   At least you understand that it really does have nothing to do with you and perhaps in
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:06.580]   10 years time you'll be able to appreciate what they're talking about from a different
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:11.100]   perspective with new information about how the humans work.
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:14.180]   Yeah, it was quite a deep thing.
[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:17.180]   He said, "I thought it was quite good and I'll totally write on."
[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:20.660]   All of us who are geeks, I like the word geek better than nerd, but all of us who are
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:21.660]   geeks.
[00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:22.660]   How's both?
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:23.660]   You're a geek-antern?
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:24.660]   I was a geek-antern.
[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:27.340]   But you also had guns and you played football.
[00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:30.300]   It was like a different kind of thing.
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:32.420]   But here's the thing, I doubt you were bullied in school.
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:35.580]   No, I was actually the...
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:36.580]   What Dexter is to...
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:40.300]   You were the serial killer who took out the bully.
[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:41.300]   I was the bullies bully.
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:42.300]   Yeah.
[00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:45.540]   And so if I saw a bully, the only thing I knew is my dad would not be upset if I bullied
[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:47.140]   a bully.
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:49.780]   So the thing is, I was an angry little kid.
[00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:51.300]   I was an angry nerd and everything else.
[00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:54.700]   And so if you bullied some other kid, you were a fair game.
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:56.420]   And I was pretty good.
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:57.420]   Wow.
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:59.420]   Alex, the Terminator, Lindsey.
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:03.220]   I find like if you take a bully and you pick him up by his neck and you shake him really
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:06.420]   hard and bang him against the wall, it clarifies his mind.
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:08.420]   Alex, I'm sick of you.
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.420]   This is not a guy who feels empathy and pity.
[00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:11.420]   Is this a guy?
[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:12.420]   No, no, I'm a...
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:18.020]   I will understand if you don't want to answer this, but do you have a collection of leather
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:21.420]   ties in your closet that you don't know your children to see?
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:23.420]   No, no, no leather ties.
[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.420]   But I do have some thin ones.
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:26.420]   Yeah.
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:27.420]   Oh, okay.
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:35.420]   Is your ear book custom-bound with a type of eye that the book writer was not into.
[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:37.420]   But I'm so much nicer now.
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:38.420]   Yeah, okay.
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:39.420]   But you don't want to cross, Alex.
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:40.420]   No, no, no, I'm fine now.
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:43.420]   I've heard you yelling through three walls and a couple of doors.
[00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:47.420]   I can be a little high-strung at times.
[00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:49.420]   It's all I can say.
[00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:52.420]   No, but when you're yelling and I do...
[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:56.420]   Hey, I'm not a shrinking violet either.
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:58.420]   But when you're angry, it's for good reason.
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:00.420]   It's not for a random reason.
[00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:03.420]   So, Apple is an...
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:04.420]   I don't know.
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:08.420]   According to Japanese newspaper reports, which is always a great...
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:09.420]   I find that's good.
[00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:10.420]   I find that information.
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:19.420]   Apple is definitely, definitely going to release a two-screen sizes in September of the iPhone 6.
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:25.420]   Now, I always use Renee Richie as the rumor validator or invalidator, because I'm more
[00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:26.420]   .com.
[00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:27.420]   You guys really get all the scoops.
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:29.420]   What is the status of this idea?
[00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:33.420]   I have only heard about one large screen iPhone this year.
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.420]   I have no doubt that Apple is working on a...
[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:38.420]   Or at least testing a variety of sizes because they really...
[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:39.420]   They test everything.
[00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:42.420]   Any time you hear someone say, "Why didn't Apple do this?"
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:47.420]   The most common answer is they spent a year with that in the lab and didn't like it for XYZ reason.
[00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:50.420]   So, I have no doubt that they are testing a wide variety of sizes.
[00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:53.420]   Might even be prototyping a wide variety of sizes.
[00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:57.420]   But I've still only heard of one regular size and one large size.
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:01.420]   Mingu Chiquo, who has been very consistent as a source.
[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:07.420]   He's an analyst for KGI Security, says Apple will not go bigger than five inches because
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:14.420]   of their, quote, "unwavering," end quote, "dedication of the idea of having it be a one-handed phone."
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:16.420]   They're also a very good step-by-step company.
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:18.420]   If you look, they had the same screen size for a while.
[00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.420]   Then they went retina.
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:22.420]   Then they went 16 by 9.
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:26.420]   Then, you know, if they go bigger now, they're probably not going to just go bigger, bigger, bigger all in one year.
[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:30.420]   They might introduce a larger size iPhone with a much higher resolution,
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:35.420]   which will then enable them to do a variety of larger screen devices the years down the road.
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:37.420]   But I don't think they'll do all of it in one year.
[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:38.420]   Yeah.
[00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:43.420]   You'll have to remember that Samsung can get away with doing like a humongous-sized note phone
[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:46.420]   because they're one, they basically make every phone there is,
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:49.420]   and they're one maker of Android phones among many.
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:56.420]   If Apple decides to make a humongous six-inch phone, that is going to be one 50% of all the iPhone models
[00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:58.420]   available worldwide for an entire year.
[00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:01.420]   So I don't think they'd do something quite that.
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:04.420]   I don't want to say ridiculous because I've used larger phones.
[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:09.420]   They're kind of nice, but I don't think they'd do something that wouldn't appeal to just about everybody.
[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:16.420]   They are just as concerned about smaller female hands as big male hands like this one.
[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:19.420]   I actually kind of buy that because I've been using the Moto X,
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:23.420]   which ergonomically as far as I'm concerned is perfect-sized.
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:26.420]   And you and I both have been playing with this HTC One.
[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:30.420]   It's taller, it's bigger, it's also heavier, and it doesn't...
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:32.420]   I can hold it, obviously.
[00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:33.420]   It's not as convenient.
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:35.420]   It doesn't quite feel as good in the hand.
[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:36.420]   No, it's...
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:38.420]   So there is something to be said for that.
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:39.420]   I mean, as...
[00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:44.420]   And when I use a Note 3, which is too big for their face, let alone your hand, but...
[00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:45.420]   Dead sized.
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:47.420]   There is... I can tell the difference.
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:51.420]   I think fundamentally, one of the things I've been really thinking about with Apple is that I think that part of what they...
[00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:56.420]   When they're developing stuff, I always feel like they're not developing technology because it's important.
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:48:00.420]   I think they're developing technology because they don't think it's not important.
[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:01.420]   It shouldn't be the middle of your life.
[00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:02.420]   It shouldn't be...
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:04.420]   It shouldn't be, "Oh, cool, this is really..."
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:07.420]   It's like, "How do I get this other stuff out of it?"
[00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:10.420]   "How do I have it be easy and I don't have to think about it and I have to..."
[00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:12.420]   It's all in one hand.
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:14.420]   And I think that there's a fundamental approach to it.
[00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:19.420]   It should be in technology in the background, not in the foreground, of what you're doing.
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:21.420]   And of course, what you put in the foreground.
[00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:23.420]   There's a couple interesting things too.
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:26.420]   One is that the physical size of the iPhone will eventually limit...
[00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:27.420]   I mean, the 1960 by...
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:32.420]   Sorry, 640 by 1136 will eventually limit the quality of software that can be made for it.
[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:35.420]   And there's people in the third world who can only afford one device.
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:39.420]   There's people in North America or Europe who only want to carry one device.
[00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:43.420]   So there is value in a primary computing platform that is a bigger phone.
[00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:48.420]   But one of my favorite moments at Macworld was the keynote when Ben Bajaren was there.
[00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:52.420]   And someone asked, "All these big phones are all selling so well."
[00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:54.420]   And he said, "No, no, they really aren't.
[00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:57.420]   In Asian countries, they're selling really well in North America."
[00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:01.420]   And I think as journalists, we kind of feel this instinctively, but it's nice to have someone put real numbers to it.
[00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:03.420]   They're selling dismally well.
[00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:04.420]   They're not doing well.
[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:06.420]   The iPhone still...
[00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:12.420]   I don't know if the same will be true this year, but up until last year, it was outselling not just a big phone, but all big phones.
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:14.420]   Even the Galaxy S4, which is a big-ish phone.
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:16.420]   Yeah, it was outselling.
[00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:20.420]   People were choosing iOS on a smaller screen over something else on a bigger screen.
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:24.420]   It's the same thing when people chose an iPhone on AT&T over something else on Verizon.
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:30.420]   Apple can grow their addressable market by offering two screen sizes like they do with every other device they make.
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:32.420]   But there's no market pressure in North America.
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:36.420]   People in North America are still happy with relatively small phones.
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:39.420]   And things like the note do really well in Asia, but don't do really well here yet.
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:41.420]   So Apple doesn't want to be ahead of that curve.
[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:43.420]   They're not ahead of the curve company.
[00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:45.420]   They are a late adopter company.
[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:47.420]   I don't know if there's an equivalency, though.
[00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:54.420]   You have to also, again, factor in that if you want to buy an iPhone, there's only one company that makes it.
[00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:58.420]   If you want to buy a phone that runs iOS, you have to buy an iPhone brand phone.
[00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:07.420]   I haven't looked at the distribution of the numbers, but does that factor in all availability of all Android handsets everywhere?
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:09.420]   I think that's absolutely valid.
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:16.420]   And that's why I drew the AT&T and Verizon analogy is that there will be people for whom they either they can't or they don't want a small phone.
[00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:18.420]   And Apple isn't serving their needs right now.
[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:21.420]   So the bigger A bigger phone option will let them be more inclusive of that.
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:24.420]   And then when people choose, we'll see what the real numbers are.
[00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:29.420]   Like how many people actually went to Verizon when the iPhone was available on more carriers?
[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:30.420]   I think that's absolutely valid.
[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:31.420]   It is.
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:50.420]   And it is very significant that if you name the one, two, three most influential and popular Android phones, Sony Xperia, the Samsung and the HTC One, all three of those companies, their flagship version is a 4.8 inch or 5 inch phone, but they also make a mini version of it that's more of the size of an iPhone.
[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:52.420]   iPhone is four inches.
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:59.420]   The rumors are the six will be 4.7 inches or 5.5 inches.
[00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:01.420]   I think you can eliminate 5.5 inches.
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:02.420]   That's too big.
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:03.420]   That's gigantic.
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:07.420]   I think that's, but 4.7 is, I think that's the size of the Moto X.
[00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:10.420]   That's not outrageously big.
[00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:20.420]   Are there issues also with resolution, not merely that they don't have enough resolution, but also that you have too many resolutions?
[00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:21.420]   Does that make a problem?
[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:26.420]   I think it might depend on the pixel density as well because you could definitely get things that might match some of the other.
[00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:37.420]   You'll definitely have at least retina, but I think that what your question is, is are you trying to match what resolution of possibly the iPads that you're trying to match and so forth or to get something that's...
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:39.420]   You could go down from the iPad.
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:44.420]   You could have something slightly bigger with that's denser, even denser than the iPad and still have it be roughly the same.
[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:49.420]   The problem is that the aspect ratio is of course different.
[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:51.420]   That's one of the challenges.
[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:59.420]   If they wanted to, they could take an iPhone as it is right now, move it to 5 inches and it would have the exact same pixel density as the iPad Air.
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:03.420]   They would keep them with the iPad Mini and the iPhone right now have the same pixel density.
[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:08.420]   The iPad Air is lower, it's, sorry, 246 instead of 320.
[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:12.420]   Same pixel density, but not the same resolution.
[00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:17.420]   No, they have more pixels, but when you're cutting screens, it's just nice to be able to cut screens.
[00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:19.420]   It's efficient to be able to cut screens from the same density.
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:22.420]   The icons will be the same aspect ratio.
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:27.420]   It will all just be bigger, but the problem is that that's below 300 pixels and you hold phones closer.
[00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:32.420]   My hope also, I mean, that still isn't more pixels and I really want more pixels at this point.
[00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:41.420]   If they went to something like 1080p, it would go up to 400 dpi or something like that, but it would give them a lot more future proofing if they ever did want to play with the size more.
[00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:46.420]   And yes, that does cause pain to developers, but Apple did that to them with retina, did that to them with 16 by nine.
[00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:49.420]   I don't think they would be afraid to do that again.
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:56.420]   Historically, developers, Apple is not afraid to give developers right in the neck if they think there's a benefit to consumers.
[00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:58.420]   They feel as though they have apps.
[00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:10.420]   They almost feel as though, well, geez, geez, developers, you're lucky that we're allowing you to play in this really, really nice valuable market space and making our product more valuable so you can create the next generation of a man.
[00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:13.420]   It's a generation of amazing applications.
[00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:23.420]   So just cancel your, let your wife and your kids or your husband and your kids go to Disney World without you for two weeks because I think you're going to figure out how to make this display work and around configuration.
[00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:29.420]   I just wanted to look up sales numbers to get some sense of whether Behren was right or not.
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:31.420]   I don't want him to go unchallenged on this.
[00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:42.420]   So in the numbers we have for 2013, 120 million, and this is in the US, 120 million smartphones sold, Apple, 45%.
[00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:46.420]   And it is the biggest share, Samsung 26%.
[00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:52.420]   Now, some Samsung phones are smaller than the iPhone, but most, almost all are bigger, some much bigger.
[00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:56.420]   LG, bigger, 8%, HTC 6%.
[00:53:56.420 --> 00:54:04.420]   I mean, when you look at the top one, in total, in total, 4% for Motorola, in total, Apple, 45%, everybody else, 44%.
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:11.420]   If you look at 2013, you add those all up of the next four combined, that is 24%.
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:17.420]   They're less than, yeah, roughly equal, but it's not dwarfing the bigger phone sales.
[00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:18.420]   Right.
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:24.420]   But it's when it's just Apple against everybody else that gives you an idea that the pressure isn't as high as some people kept saying Apple has to do.
[00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:29.420]   Yeah, yeah, I mean, they still have the, they have the plurality, the lion's share of the market by a long.
[00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:37.420]   The interesting thing to me is whether they can keep the case smaller because if the phone gets bigger without the case, if the display gets bigger without the case getting bigger, that's a huge win.
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:41.420]   The trouble with that now is they have the home button, which takes up a lot of space.
[00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:50.420]   And some phone company like Samsung has made a small rectangular home button instead to save more space on the bottom, but Apple's got touch ID bundled in now.
[00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:52.420]   So it's not easy to do that kind of thing.
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:57.420]   So it's one of those things where decisions they make in the past now influence where they can go in the future.
[00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:58.420]   Yeah.
[00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:03.420]   I don't know if Apple, as far as, as I say, Apple has to do anything.
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:13.420]   But at this point, if in September, they don't release a large screen phone, I think they're making a very, very clear statement about where their priorities are.
[00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:20.420]   Because I don't, I think that now like 4.7, 4.8 is actually a normal sized phone now.
[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:22.420]   And then we talk about big phones.
[00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:23.420]   Now we have to talk about the note three.
[00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:31.420]   Now we've talked about that big Nokia Lumia 1070 or something, the pop tart sized phone.
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:42.420]   It's, I think this is something that's going to catch up with them if they don't really get on this because there's so many people who, and I don't get this either, who really live their lives through their phones now, where I can't tell you how many times I can get there.
[00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:54.420]   And I can't tell you how many times I've talked to, I've spoken to somebody who said that I really, I'm still limping along on a, on a really, really old laptop because I just don't use my laptop nearly as much as I did a couple years ago because I can do all my banking on my phone.
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:56.420]   I do all my Facebooking on my phone.
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:56:00.420]   Everything I really need a computer for at least 80% of it is now done through my phone.
[00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:06.420]   And these are the sort of people who will really appreciate having a larger screen to deal with so long as it doesn't become stupid or ungainly.
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:17.420]   And I actually mean, I would like to see a marginally larger phone. I mean, my issue is that again, like just like what you were saying is I do 90% of what I do on my phone, you know, and it does feel a little small at times.
[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:24.420]   So I think it, I think it really, you're really thinking about taking them on the HGC1 aren't you?
[00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:26.420]   I'm going to see you carrying it around.
[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:30.420]   There is a big incentive to do it. I mean, Apple went, Apple doesn't.
[00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:32.420]   I did it long ago, so don't feel bad.
[00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:33.420]   Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:40.420]   Apple has zero percent market share in under $400 phones and they have no interest in it, but they have a huge market share in over $400 phones.
[00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:46.420]   And that went from, I think, 65% to 85% share, but that's, there's not much growth left there.
[00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:53.420]   And what growth there is would probably require a bigger screen because that's where the premium Android handsets are selling.
[00:56:53.420 --> 00:57:02.420]   So if Apple wants to increase their share of the premium market and sort of put a little bit of pains to companies like Samsung, who's owning that market successfully now, then going big makes a lot of sense.
[00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:05.420]   It's the only low hanging growth that they have left in phones.
[00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:06.420]   That's a good point.
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:13.420]   Well, that's the rumor and I think we've pretty much debunked it.
[00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:18.420]   There are April Fool stories, which I will ignore, things like Apple buying, I fix it. That's not true.
[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:23.420]   We mentioned last week that I fix it, went belly up basically.
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:25.420]   Would be nice if Apple bought, I fix it.
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:31.420]   But you know, Apple remembers the company that deletes negative forum posts from the support forum.
[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:35.420]   I don't think they're going to have anything to do with I fix it.
[00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:38.420]   If you click the back button on the bottom of that.
[00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:40.420]   We'll call that an April Fool's joke.
[00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:44.420]   No, it is. If you look in the doc, I put a little thing.
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:50.420]   Now there's a story from Mac rumors that has a whole bunch of different stories.
[00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:53.420]   But if you scroll down, it's kind of funny what I fix it did here.
[00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:55.420]   Oh, scroll down on that one.
[00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:56.420]   Yeah, scroll down on that one.
[00:57:56.420 --> 00:58:00.420]   It says, because if you go to I fix it.com, working together, it's finally here.
[00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:04.420]   We're thrilled to announce. We're joining forces with Apple starting this summer.
[00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:07.420]   Apple, the only tool you'll need.
[00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:11.420]   Why fix it yourself when you can upgrade? Yeah, that's no.
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:14.420]   The most replaceable devices yet.
[00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:18.420]   Apple's not making devices last long enough for repair to become irrelevant.
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:23.420]   So instead, Apple has, I fixed this published list of Apple's most replaceable devices.
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:29.420]   Yeah, I feel like April Fool's jokes have really, they don't get how to do these things.
[00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:30.420]   Yeah.
[00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:39.420]   Where now the point is to try to trick people into believing something that isn't true as opposed to putting something silly and ridiculous out there that when you look back and you realize this was all a prank.
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:41.420]   Oh, I can't believe I fell for that.
[00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:44.420]   Now you look at some of these things like, no, there's a professionally done site.
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:46.420]   There's no sarcasm, no humor or anything in this.
[00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:49.420]   This is just a straightforward announcement.
[00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:55.420]   And then there's the April Fool's joke that is basically just an ad for the products involved.
[00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:59.420]   Have you seen the, you were involved with Virgin America, weren't you?
[00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:02.420]   Long ago, yeah, we did the original let the A-flying.
[00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:04.420]   Campaign to get them.
[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:05.420]   Here's Richard Branson.
[00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:11.420]   But I really do believe that Virgin America has reinvented every aspect of flying.
[00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:18.420]   Every day, the airline is looking for new ways to give travelers much more control over their experience whilst they're in the air.
[00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:30.420]   And today I'm excited to help announce our newest breakthrough, a partnership with the wonderful company Nest that allows guests to control their own personal climates at 35,000 feet.
[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:33.420]   At Nest, we focus on creating simple...
[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:36.420]   So basically, this is an ad for Nest in Virgin America.
[00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:39.420]   But I gotta admit, they put a little, you know what, we'll skip ahead.
[00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:48.420]   The new interface called "20-
[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:51.420]   We can get together and do such a great partnership between Nest and Virgin."
[00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:53.420]   Tony Fadelen, the Richard Branson.
[00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:59.420]   Let's say you'd like to feel like you're sitting in a tropical paradise while flying to Newark.
[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:03.420]   We'll simply select "Can Coon Afternoon."
[01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:05.420]   That's so cool.
[01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:12.420]   Or if you run a little hot, like me, and desire a cooler ride, well that's no problem.
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:15.420]   Just select Chicago Polar Vortex.
[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:18.420]   [laughter]
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:23.420]   Total temperature control, a partnership between Virgin America and Nest.
[01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:26.420]   So this is a new trend I think in April Fool's jokes.
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:29.420]   I mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, it really is just an ad, right?
[01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:31.420]   It's a good answer to two products.
[01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:35.420]   But there's humor in it too. So I'm not sure. I don't know if I dislike it.
[01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:38.420]   I think we're going to see a lot more of that kind of thing.
[01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:42.420]   I think the best April Fool's ever was the...
[01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:47.420]   I remember the sports illustrated one about the pitcher who won, wasn't a boot.
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:50.420]   And he meditated and didn't own anything.
[01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:51.420]   That was a classic.
[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:53.420]   And you just read through the whole thing.
[01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:55.420]   I mean you were just like, "Oh my gosh, I can't believe this!"
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:58.420]   And then you couldn't believe you were so stupid.
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:03.420]   How about the book book IMac cover? I think that'd be good. I'd buy that.
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:05.420]   [laughter]
[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:07.420]   They have them for the iPad and the iPhone. They're quite nice.
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:11.420]   But I don't know if I really need one for my IMac.
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:16.420]   I still remember the time I wrote an April Fool's article for the Boston Pierce Society User Group magazine
[01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:20.420]   that explained that Apple was recalling, at the time of the MACSC,
[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:25.420]   they were recalling the original 128K Macs because a long story about their gasoline soaked rags
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:29.420]   and that they left inside each and every one of them that would ignite by the electron gun
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:32.420]   firing backwards and trying to erase all the names of people who've been fired from Apple
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:34.420]   since the first one had been made.
[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:37.420]   And even then there were hundreds of people who believed it
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:40.420]   and were calling Apple about recall instructions.
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:45.420]   Yeah, it's hard to... I think you have to go ridiculous now.
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:49.420]   I wouldn't mind this. This is called the "Selfie Bot."
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:52.420]   It's a camera-equipped drone that hovers around you.
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:54.420]   There's plenty of sunshine through today with seasonal...
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:56.420]   Capturing the best selfie moments.
[01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:59.420]   [laughter]
[01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:01.420]   People would buy this.
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:02.420]   I swear to God.
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:04.420]   Is that a selfie or an autograph?
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:05.420]   Or a selfie bot?
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:06.420]   Selfie bot.
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:15.420]   [laughter]
[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:20.420]   What's nice about this parody is they get everybody in their classic selfie pose.
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:23.420]   The pose you've all seen 100 times.
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:28.420]   Oh, Lord. The guy doing the heart symbol.
[01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:29.420]   Yeah.
[01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:30.420]   A cat.
[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:31.420]   A selfie.
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:32.420]   With a cat.
[01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:35.420]   What a novel thought.
[01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:37.420]   [music]
[01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:39.420]   All right, enough of the selfie bot.
[01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:43.420]   You know what we didn't see is a ton of Google.
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:46.420]   Every year Google does a ton of those, right?
[01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:48.420]   Well, that last one was from Google.
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:50.420]   They shot the whole wad on the off.
[01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:51.420]   The off, really.
[01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:52.420]   Google Chrome Short--
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:53.420]   Oh, it's a title!
[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:54.420]   They shot the bottom.
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:57.420]   Google Chrome for iOS.
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:59.420]   This is actually kind of nice. Emoji translation.
[01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:01.420]   I actually thought this was real.
[01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:04.420]   [music]
[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:05.420]   It's a real for mobile.
[01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:07.420]   The way we communicate is changing.
[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:11.420]   It's getting faster, and we're optimizing for the smaller screen.
[01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.420]   And the written word just can't keep up.
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:14.420]   Can a word smile?
[01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:18.420]   Can it roll its eyes or say, sorry, not sorry?
[01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:21.420]   People use emoji because it provides context.
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:24.420]   If somebody were able to just explicitly say,
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:27.420]   "Hey, I'm flirting with you," or, "Hey, I'm mocking you,"
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:29.420]   that would just make my life a lot more efficient.
[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:31.420]   And that's exactly what it's easy for.
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:32.420]   [laughter]
[01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:33.420]   That's why you're on the Chrome team.
[01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:37.420]   We're excited to announce Google Translate Support for Emoji.
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:39.420]   With the click of a button, our translation algorithm
[01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:42.420]   interprets the context and tone of words,
[01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:45.420]   and distills them down into clear, articulate, meaningful,
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:46.420]   [laughter]
[01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:48.420]   Fancy gentlemen.
[01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:49.420]   Cut a rug.
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:51.420]   Shyce no man.
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:52.420]   When we--
[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:53.420]   I don't want this.
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:54.420]   We need to understand how people are--
[01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:56.420]   It turns every message into a rebus.
[01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:58.420]   Emoji on Chrome for mobile.
[01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:01.420]   We looked at lots of users and how they express different things
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:02.420]   using emoji.
[01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:04.420]   I would-- I totally-- if somebody doesn't do this,
[01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:05.420]   they're missing the bow.
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:06.420]   [laughter]
[01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:09.420]   It's the same part of our brain that processes facial recognition.
[01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:13.420]   So basically, emoji is a language that everyone already knows.
[01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:16.420]   This is the next phase of linguistic evolution,
[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:19.420]   and we want to provide this to all of our users.
[01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:21.420]   Our expert team is a popular language.
[01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:26.420]   We're already teaching our kids not to learn how to write long hands.
[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:28.420]   Now we can basically keep them not how to type,
[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:30.420]   either by just clicking on icons.
[01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:31.420]   Stickers.
[01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:36.420]   The Chrome team is really excited about being able to translate the entire internet into emoji.
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:37.420]   I know, I want that chair.
[01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:38.420]   Emojified.
[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:39.420]   E-commerce.
[01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:40.420]   Emojified.
[01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:41.420]   Medical journals.
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:42.420]   Emojified.
[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:43.420]   [laughter]
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:44.420]   Emojified.
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:45.420]   Subtitles.
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:46.420]   Emojified.
[01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:47.420]   [laughter]
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:49.420]   Some engineers have even started to code.
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:51.420]   Okay, this isn't pretty good.
[01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:52.420]   [laughter]
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:53.420]   Programming in emojis.
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:55.420]   Source equals Google.jpg.
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:58.420]   These little cells we call letters.
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:00.420]   Here at Google, we're giving--
[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:01.420]   We're giving it an E-
[01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:01.420]   We're giving it an E-
[01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:02.420]   We're giving it an E-
[01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:04.420]   We're sending it back to the user.
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:06.420]   Emojified the internet.
[01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:08.420]   Available today on Android iPhone and iPad.
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:10.420]   I want that.
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:14.420]   This is probably how the Chinese written language started.
[01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:16.420]   They're like, you know, we can just use pictures.
[01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:19.420]   And then they started using pictures and they somehow on the back in text.
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:20.420]   Look at this keyboard.
[01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:24.420]   This is not an April Fool's joke, and I wanted to get your opinion because it comes from our very own news director,
[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:27.420]   Mike Elgin writing in Cult of Mac this week.
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:30.420]   Apple needs a social network.
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:35.420]   When Google announces something new, they can send people to Google+ to talk about it.
[01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:39.420]   When Facebook announces something new, there's a place its users can talk about it.
[01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:42.420]   Apple has to send people to Twitter or Facebook or Google+,
[01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:46.420]   Apple should buy, says Mike, Yahoo.
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:50.420]   Yahoo's market cap is $37 billion.
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:52.420]   Chicken feed for Apple.
[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:53.420]   Apple might get Marissa Meyer.
[01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:56.420]   We talked about this on Sunday and everybody said there's no way Marissa would stick around.
[01:05:56.420 --> 01:06:01.420]   But what if you could give, what if, you know, here's, okay, here's this.
[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:03.420]   This would be the crazy talk.
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:05.420]   Put Tim Cookback in operations.
[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:06.420]   Very good at that.
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:09.420]   Let Marissa become CEO of Apple.
[01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:11.420]   She can redesign the icon.
[01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:13.420]   She can read it.
[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:21.420]   Anyway, I mean Yahoo bought Tumblr so that they would have a social network, right?
[01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:27.420]   Yeah, I think that, I definitely see that the pluses of doing that.
[01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:31.420]   But I think the problem, culturally, I think the reason Apple doesn't buy big companies
[01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:35.420]   is because there's just a culture clash and they don't want to, you know, they like to bring people in small bits
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:37.420]   so they can be assimilated properly.
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:38.420]   Right.
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:45.420]   Also, almost the last time they bought something that had such a legacy of user interface that they didn't grow themselves.
[01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:50.420]   So how long would it take them to totally refit all Yahoo services so that it looked like it was designed
[01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:52.420]   in Apple's house style?
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:55.420]   Yeah, so we're going to reject this out of hand, right?
[01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:57.420]   It's an interesting idea.
[01:06:57.420 --> 01:07:01.420]   I mean, it's, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's, he makes an interesting comment that Apple doesn't have an outlet
[01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:03.420]   for this sort of social conversation.
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:08.420]   He also makes a point that I've been sort of thinking about, if not worrying about that,
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:13.420]   there's going to be a time when selling hardware at a premium prices is no longer work,
[01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:15.420]   going to work out for them.
[01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:19.420]   And so they should have some ideas for what they're going to be doing in five or ten years.
[01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:24.420]   If they don't have plans to simply create new classes of hardware over and over and over again.
[01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:32.420]   But I just don't see them even, I don't see them wanting to create a platform by which people can simply
[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:35.420]   publish anything they want to the entire world.
[01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:41.420]   I see them creating a platform that lets them take things, things that they're feeling and thinking and looking at
[01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:44.420]   and creating and sharing it with people they directly know.
[01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:50.420]   Apparently, apparently this is not a joke.
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:52.420]   So, no, it's not.
[01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:58.420]   If you have the latest, the emoji, emoji thing that you wanted so bad, go to any website.
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:00.420]   Yeah, I have, I'm on, I'm on a Chrome right now.
[01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:03.420]   Oh, I don't want to sign in.
[01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:04.420]   Where should I go? I should go.
[01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:06.420]   Just go to your, your, your account.
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:07.420]   Right. Slashly or the port.
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:08.420]   Yeah, I'll just go to Google plus.
[01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:10.420]   I think I'd be signed in.
[01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:11.420]   Go, go to CNN.
[01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:12.420]   Go to CNN.
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:13.420]   What about a Twitter?
[01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:14.420]   Let's go to it.
[01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:16.420]   To it doesn't have a lot of text.
[01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:17.420]   Text.
[01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:18.420]   It's a lot of text.
[01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:20.420]   Go to Celestial Waste of bandwidth.
[01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:22.420]   C-W-O-B.
[01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:24.420]   It's going to take me to a knock-o.com.
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:25.420]   That's all right.
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:27.420]   We can, we can go through all of that here.
[01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:28.420]   Where is it?
[01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:29.420]   It's, oh, there it is.
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:31.420]   Now I click that.
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:32.420]   Yeah.
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:33.420]   Now I'm on a knock-o.com, right?
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:34.420]   Cool.
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:35.420]   So, wait a minute.
[01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:36.420]   Where is it?
[01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:37.420]   Where do I go, Andy?
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:38.420]   This isn't just typing.
[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:39.420]   Go to imore.com.
[01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:41.420]   Essentially, there we go.
[01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:46.420]   Knock-o.com.
[01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:49.420]   Go ahead and get, swap down a little bit so you can go to hamburger menu and translate to emoji.
[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:50.420]   Oh my gosh.
[01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:51.420]   Translate to emoji.
[01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:54.420]   And then, in a few seconds.
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:56.420]   It translates everything to emoji.
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:57.420]   Ah!
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:58.420]   It works.
[01:08:58.420 --> 01:08:59.420]   OMG!
[01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:02.420]   Hey, take your photo.
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:05.420]   What the mojo.
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:08.420]   Andy can write an emoji.
[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:12.420]   There was a time when the people in Germany...
[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:13.420]   Germany?
[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:17.420]   No, credit cards of roads and bridges were...
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:18.420]   Charge and charge.
[01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:20.420]   Charge, oh I get it.
[01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:22.420]   This is great!
[01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:23.420]   Okay.
[01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:25.420]   I hope they leave that in.
[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:27.420]   You gotta shoot some screenshots.
[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:29.420]   Translate to emoji.
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:30.420]   Oh, okay.
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:32.420]   You want a screenshot of that?
[01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:33.420]   Well played.
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:34.420]   Well played.
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:35.420]   Well played.
[01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:36.420]   I don't know how to do screenshots on the one.
[01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:38.420]   I don't know yet.
[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:39.420]   Either.
[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:40.420]   At home?
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:41.420]   No, no, no.
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:42.420]   I think I have volume and lock.
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:44.420]   No, no, I'll get it.
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:45.420]   That's okay.
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:46.420]   He'll do it.
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:49.420]   I haven't learned that yet.
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:54.420]   Here's something that was not, I think this is sweet, not an April Fool's joke.
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:10:00.420]   Comes from the Buster Dog Boy YouTube account.
[01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:05.420]   This was taken a few years ago of our good friend, Mr. Steve Wozniak,
[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:11.420]   making a special delivery a few years ago.
[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:20.420]   Janet and Steve, Janet's wife, came to our house to play a prank on our kid Emma.
[01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:22.420]   This is just, this is a warmup.
[01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:24.420]   Here they come.
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:29.420]   Wozniak came to hand off a new Mac in a lot of ways.
[01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:37.420]   It was like, holy cow, this is long.
[01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:39.420]   Thomas Edison delivering you light bulbs.
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:40.420]   Here we go.
[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:43.420]   Finally, the video.
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:45.420]   This is typical of Woz.
[01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:47.420]   I can see Woz do this.
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:48.420]   I don't want to.
[01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:49.420]   I don't want you to.
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:50.420]   Is it okay?
[01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:51.420]   Yeah, it's fine.
[01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:52.420]   Yeah.
[01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:53.420]   I'll have to be carrying it from the car anyway.
[01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:55.420]   I'll get a little pre-fitted here.
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:57.420]   You have to name Steve.
[01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:02.420]   Woz actually gave on the screen savers when we had Kevin Mitnick come on the screen savers
[01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:06.420]   after his probation had expired and he was able to use the internet for the first time.
[01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:10.420]   Woz came on and gave him a Mac book and said, "Here, this is yours.
[01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:12.420]   Kevin, get on the internet for the first time."
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:15.420]   So Woz has a history of doing this kind of thing.
[01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:16.420]   I'm not sure.
[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:21.420]   Let's skip ahead.
[01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:24.420]   He's got the box with the Mac in it.
[01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:26.420]   He's coming up the, the stoop.
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:28.420]   I should have queued this up.
[01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:31.420]   I'm sorry before we start showing him.
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:36.420]   How much do you tip Steve Woz now?
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:41.420]   Do you think, do you think Emma knows who Steve Woz now is?
[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:44.420]   How I make your mother finale over again.
[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:49.420]   Well, I didn't see that, but I heard a lot of talk about it.
[01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:52.420]   I think Emma knows who Woz now is.
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:12:00.420]   I think that delivery from the Apple store, I just do this now and this is a computer for someone here to suppress me.
[01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:01.420]   Emma?
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:02.420]   Oh, okay.
[01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:05.420]   She's a little, uh, taken aback.
[01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:07.420]   All her friends are gathering.
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:09.420]   You've seen it.
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:12.420]   I guess she knows who Woz is. That's pretty cool.
[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:14.420]   So, what is it?
[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:17.420]   I don't know, the graduation gift.
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:19.420]   [Laughter]
[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:22.420]   She's speechless.
[01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:27.420]   Okay, Woz, if you want to deliver a Mac to my door, you can.
[01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:29.420]   I will. I wonder if he comes with that.
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:30.420]   Do you think with the stars?
[01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:31.420]   What? Yes, I should not.
[01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:33.420]   Oh, that's how she knows him.
[01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:34.420]   Oh, right.
[01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:39.420]   She was on dancing with the stars. In fact, that was, okay, now we know how funny it was.
[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:43.420]   You're on dancing with the stars. I know you.
[01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:44.420]   Nice.
[01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:46.420]   That's kind of sad.
[01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:49.420]   You're almost as big as a Kardashian.
[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:50.420]   [Laughter]
[01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:53.420]   All right, we're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:55.420]   Really? It is.
[01:12:55.420 --> 01:13:00.420]   Do you remember him doing the fish on dancing with the stars or the worm or whatever that is
[01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:01.420]   where you go on the floor?
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:02.420]   Okay.
[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:03.420]   All right.
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:07.420]   We're going to take a break. Come back with your picks of the week in just a second on
[01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:11.420]   Mac Break Weekly. No April Fool's Picks, right?
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:12.420]   Nope.
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:15.420]   All right. All real stuff. You can buy in stores.
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:22.420]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.com, the best place to create your new website.
[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:28.420]   The Better Web Starts with your website. Squarespace is two things that you want. It's web hosting.
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:33.420]   The best hosting ever. We try all the time to bring down Squarespace sites. We cannot.
[01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:39.420]   We're very good at bringing sites to their knees to crumbling sites. In fact, what we now do
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:45.420]   when we go to a site, and I mentioned a site on one of the shows, and it just crashes hard.
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:49.420]   TVFool.com, good example. Every time I'm recommended on the radio show, "Bam, what I do now is I send
[01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:54.420]   them an email saying, "You know, you should be on Squarespace." You wouldn't have this problem.
[01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:58.420]   But that's one. But the other thing you get is also this great software on top of it, which is
[01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:03.420]   always kept up to date, always kept secure, and you always get new features all the time,
[01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:06.420]   like new templates, 25 wonderful templates at Squarespace.com.
[01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:11.420]   Click the Get Started button, and you can see the different templates you can choose from.
[01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:18.420]   These are designed by the best designers on working on the web today using the best technology.
[01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:21.420]   So they're all, for instance, mobile responsive. That means let's click on one.
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:28.420]   This is the peak style, and they show you, by the way, some examples, actual sites using peak.
[01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:33.420]   And trying to figure out how you're going to get your website to work on everything at one time is not trivial.
[01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:37.420]   They do it for you. So no matter what, this will work.
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:43.420]   All sites at Squarespace.com will work on any size screen from an iPhone, a foreign screen,
[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:47.420]   all the way up to an iMac, a 37 inch screen. And they look great.
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:52.420]   They also all have e-commerce built in. And even if you go with the $8 a month plan,
[01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:56.420]   which is their lowest cost plan, actually a very affordable plan, you get e-commerce.
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:15:01.420]   So if you're a school with a fundraiser or you have a one-do a cash wedding registry
[01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:06.420]   or you're a nonprofit, you could take donations on any Squarespace site because e-commerce is integrated.
[01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:13.420]   It's all part of Squarespace. Now, if you want to sell, if you want to have a real store for $24 a month,
[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:19.420]   unlimited products, physical, digital or service, real-time shipping built into the website,
[01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:25.420]   label printing via ship station, you get integrated, accounting is built in, inventory management.
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:30.420]   There's an incredible developer platform. If you are a CSS whiz, but you don't have to be,
[01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:34.420]   you can do everything with point and click. Squarespace does it so you don't have to become a web expert.

[01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:05.420]   A better web starts with your website and squarespace.com. Please use the offer code MACBreak when you decide to buy it.
[01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:09.420]   Time for our picks of the week. Renee Richie. What do you got for us?
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:17.420]   I got something, it wasn't officially at Macworld, but I did find Brian Holmes from Paddin Quill wandering the floor.
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:24.420]   And he had just announced this brand new, I believe it's called the Traveler case, where the iPhone 5 and 5S.
[01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:29.420]   So Paddin Quill does a lot of the original, he did all those sort of moleskin covers.
[01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:33.420]   Yeah, I bought one because of you. And I gave a couple for Christmas too because of you.
[01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:38.420]   I love mine. And now they've been working with leather workers, artisanal leather workers in Mexico.
[01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:44.420]   And they've done this hand stitch. So if Indiana Jones had an iPhone case, this is what it is.
[01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:50.420]   It's got parachute style stitching, it is handcrafted leather. It's got room for a couple of cards in the bottom.
[01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:54.420]   And then you can put them in the front of the table and then you can put them in the top.
[01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:58.420]   So you can put them in the front of the table and you can put them in the top.
[01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:06.420]   And then you can put them in the top. And then you can put them in the bottom of the table and then you can put them in the top.
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:10.420]   So you can put them in the top. And then you can put them in the top.
[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:14.420]   And then you can put them in the top. And then you can put them in the top.
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:17.420]   And then you can put them in the top. And then you can put them in the top.
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:22.420]   And it's just a very nice case. They wanted something that was easier to use. Some people didn't like the fact that you had to open it,
[01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:26.420]   turn it around, put the strap over it to use it when you wanted to use it as a phone.
[01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:29.420]   So this one is faceless, but it still got that sort of old.
[01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:34.420]   I just love the idea of pearl world products swab thing the newest latest technology.
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:39.420]   So you have aluminum and glass on the phone, but they have this leather and stitching on the back.
[01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:41.420]   That's a skeuomorphism I can live with.
[01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:43.420]   It's the right kind of skeuomorphism.
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:45.420]   Yeah. Beautiful. How much is that?
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:48.420]   It's on sale today. I don't have the price in front of me.
[01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:56.420]   70 bucks, $69.99. It's pad and quill.com. Normally $80 they're offering a deal, but it is a preorder.
[01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:59.420]   So shipping varies.
[01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:02.420]   And again, if Indiana Jones had a case, this would be it.
[01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:06.420]   Oh, if you like that look. Yeah, that really looks beautiful. I like leather.
[01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:09.420]   Yeah, me too. Tell them to make one for the...
[01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:11.420]   It's humanizing. I shouldn't say that.
[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:15.420]   HTC One.
[01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:20.420]   You know what's neat is he talks about his dad who was a World War II vet who carried a leather coin pouch.
[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:22.420]   They show it in the video.
[01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:26.420]   And now it was the inspiration for this, which I think is really neat.
[01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:30.420]   He does great stuff. Pat and quill.com.
[01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:33.420]   And they have black or tan.
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:35.420]   I love how that wears.
[01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:36.420]   Yeah.
[01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:40.420]   It does. It looks great. I have one of the bags that they made earlier.
[01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:45.420]   It wears beautifully. He and his wife carry are very specific about the people that they find to make their products.
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:49.420]   And so far, they've lasted really long and they've worn really well.
[01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:51.420]   I smell my bill get a bag.
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:54.420]   You know, this is a very expensive pick for...
[01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:55.420]   You're going to be buying a lot of stuff.
[01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:59.420]   Alex Lindsey. Oh, I see in the sense that you're going to buy it.
[01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:02.420]   Because you are not known for the inexpensive pick.
[01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:03.420]   No.
[01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:05.420]   No, I'm not having inexpensive pick.
[01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:06.420]   Okay.
[01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:07.420]   Take that, Alex.
[01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:09.420]   It's only half an Alex, Alex. What are you talking about?
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:10.420]   I know exactly.
[01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:11.420]   It's nothing.
[01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:13.420]   So you're right. It's going to be expensive for you.
[01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:16.420]   It's going to be expensive for me because I'm like, "Oh, I need one of those."
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:17.420]   Yeah.
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:18.420]   These are beautiful.
[01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:19.420]   What do you got for us?
[01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:24.420]   So my pick, a little untraditional on a show like this is actually...
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:26.420]   I'm picking the HTC.
[01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:29.420]   Oh, you're a bad, bad man.
[01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:30.420]   So here's the deal.
[01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:33.420]   I'm picking this for a specific reason because I want to talk about something.
[01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:37.420]   The phone on the camera on this, it's not that it's a higher resolution.
[01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:38.420]   It's only a megapixel.
[01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:41.420]   It is the most revolutionary phone that's been put on a...
[01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:45.420]   So I got this a little before it was released and got to play with it a little bit.
[01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:49.420]   And then I had to go to Africa without it and then I realized how much I was missing it.
[01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:51.420]   And so I went out and bought it.
[01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:53.420]   So I paid for it myself.
[01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:54.420]   I didn't...
[01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:55.420]   Yeah, I bought one too.
[01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:56.420]   I bought one too.
[01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:57.420]   I said it. I love this thing.
[01:19:57.420 --> 01:20:03.420]   So the thing is, is that this is the most revolutionary phone, I mean, most revolutionary camera on a phone.
[01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:05.420]   Of the things that you can do with it, the things that you can add to it.
[01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:07.420]   And the thing is, is you want it on the...
[01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:11.420]   This is to me, what I'm really buying is a camera that uploads the G+.
[01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:13.420]   You know, and...
[01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:14.420]   It's a non-cutation of photography.
[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:16.420]   It's the future of photography, I believe.
[01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:22.420]   And the reason I'm bringing it up on Mac break is specifically because this is not...
[01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:26.420]   The number one thing people use their phone for is taking pictures.
[01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:30.420]   And I think it's why iPhone sells so well because it is the best camera on a phone.
[01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:31.420]   But I think Apple is gonna...
[01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:38.420]   This phone is the Apple needs to step up and think about dual lenses.
[01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:41.420]   There's been lots of rumors that they're looking at that already.
[01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:43.420]   But think about the stuff that is...
[01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:45.420]   Because this leaves anyone who's been using the little...
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:46.420]   I have a little lightro.
[01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:47.420]   It's kind of doesn't.
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:48.420]   It's kind of like a light.
[01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:49.420]   The lightro light.
[01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:51.420]   So it only has two focal points.
[01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:53.420]   In fact, I could show you.
[01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:54.420]   Yeah, but this one...
[01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:55.420]   You can finalize it.
[01:20:55.420 --> 01:21:00.420]   All I gotta say is I took the lightro to Africa instead of this because I had to leave it behind.
[01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:02.420]   And at the time I couldn't take it out of the country.
[01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:07.420]   And the lightro, it was really a bummer.
[01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:09.420]   It was really like...
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:11.420]   And the thing is you're gonna wanna take pictures.
[01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:12.420]   Not all the photos are gonna work.
[01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:14.420]   People think this is an April Fool's joke.
[01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:16.420]   No, it's not an April Fool's joke at all.
[01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:17.420]   So I know it's the wrong day.
[01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:20.420]   I was trying to think of a really good April Fool's joke, but I bought one.
[01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:21.420]   So that would be really expensive.
[01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:22.420]   Well, you're a camera buff.
[01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:23.420]   I mean, I think you're the only...
[01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:25.420]   I think you're the only one that carries some weight if you say that.
[01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:27.420]   Well, I'm taking pictures of my family and my kids.
[01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:32.420]   And what I will say is that my...
[01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:37.420]   They are all gonna work, but this makes photography fun.
[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:40.420]   Because what happens is you end up taking photos and take a lot of the photos.
[01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:42.420]   And then you sit there and you're playing with them all the time on your phone.
[01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:44.420]   You're not playing with them on your computer.
[01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:46.420]   You're not like, "Oh, when I upload them, I'll go work on them."
[01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:50.420]   You're sitting around in a line somewhere noodling around with your photos.
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:51.420]   It's awesome.
[01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:53.420]   There's an option just to give...
[01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:56.420]   I'm doing a full review on it this afternoon before you buy,
[01:21:56.420 --> 01:22:00.420]   but here's a picture I just took at the beginning of the show of Alex.
[01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:02.420]   And I have to say the detail is quite good.
[01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:04.420]   I mean, if you look at the grill...
[01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:08.420]   The thing is, it's four megapixels, but it's two microns.
[01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:10.420]   They're quality.
[01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:16.420]   And then you can do things like this in the camera.
[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:17.420]   I didn't even know I could do this.
[01:22:17.420 --> 01:22:18.420]   Alex showed me.
[01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:20.420]   I can give him alien eyes.
[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:22.420]   But no, I've been very happy.
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:24.420]   I've been playing with this quite a bit.
[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:28.420]   The low light performance is quite good because it is two micron pixels.
[01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:32.420]   One thing that you can do that's different on this is you can now...
[01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:37.420]   They have manual settings for exposure, for F-Stop,
[01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:41.420]   but you can also say, "This is the Max ISO that I want you to go."
[01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:43.420]   This is ISO 800.
[01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:45.420]   I'm going to even turn it down a little bit, I think.
[01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:46.420]   Actually, you know, this is 2000.
[01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:48.420]   And you can see it's quite grainy because it's quite dark.
[01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:50.420]   But it's got...
[01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:54.420]   It's stealing the flash that Apple did, the two-color flash,
[01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:56.420]   to do white balance in the flash.
[01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:58.420]   I think...
[01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:01.420]   I'm not sure I'd say it's as good as the iPhone 5S.
[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:03.420]   That still is the gold standard, but...
[01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:05.420]   But I just feel like there's a lot of shots.
[01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:08.420]   And if you go up to my G+ page, you'll see a couple of them that I posted last week.
[01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:09.420]   Have you posted some?
[01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:10.420]   Yeah.
[01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:11.420]   There's a lot of shots that I just find.
[01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:13.420]   As a snapshot, I don't...
[01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:15.420]   It's whatever it is, but being able to have the nice short depth of field,
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:17.420]   be able to post it to your blog, be able to post it to whatever.
[01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:21.420]   Here's an example, here's a Chad picture that I then...
[01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:22.420]   Yeah.
[01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:25.420]   I just tap one click, three seconds.
[01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:27.420]   It defocuses the background.
[01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:30.420]   You could do it the other way around, defocus Chad, but I really didn't think that was a good idea.
[01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:33.420]   And it gives it a kind of a nice professional look.
[01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:35.420]   They do have stupid stuff like stickers.
[01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:40.420]   But because it knows the background can also do stuff to the background.
[01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:43.420]   And this is all in camera, which is kind of interesting.
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:45.420]   And phone, I should say.
[01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:46.420]   But it's the only one now.
[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:47.420]   I'm not saying...
[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:48.420]   I always have another Android phone.
[01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:52.420]   I always have an Android phone of some sort that I'm testing and working on as well as my iPhone.
[01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:55.420]   But this is the first one that I could see myself actually...
[01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:58.420]   It may become a majority usage.
[01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:00.420]   I mean, I'm pretty attached to my iPhone.
[01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:01.420]   You know what's good for?
[01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:05.420]   Because it's four megapixels, maybe you're not going to make a poster on the wall for this.
[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:07.420]   But for what mostly we do, which is supposed to be social networks...
[01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:11.420]   Posting to G+ or Facebook or whatever, this is a...
[01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:13.420]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:15.420]   It really just adds a whole lot of fun to it.
[01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:16.420]   I don't know about that.
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:18.420]   So I don't know if it's a little 3D moves, whatever.
[01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:21.420]   It is going to be the bane of existence for everyone that works at the Pixel Core.
[01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:23.420]   Because there's a little thing where you can take pictures and annotate it.
[01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:24.420]   You can draw on it.
[01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:25.420]   There's going to be a whole lot of like...
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:26.420]   This shouldn't be here.
[01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:27.420]   It shouldn't look like this.
[01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:28.420]   That's useful.
[01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:29.420]   You know, and you walk around...
[01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:31.420]   So here's John Slavina foregrounding...
[01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:32.420]   Isn't that...
[01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:35.420]   I mean, it's a snapshot and then it's a really fun photo.
[01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:38.420]   And it gives me the look that I'm oftentimes looking for.
[01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:40.420]   But I don't want to carry around an SLR.
[01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:42.420]   And I can immediately upload it.
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:44.420]   And you can add David Hassel.
[01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:45.420]   Well, there's that.
[01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:48.420]   I really should have a David Hasselhop filter.
[01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:49.420]   That would be...
[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:51.420]   You can place it on the moon around.
[01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:52.420]   I've been happy with the pictures.
[01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:54.420]   I wasn't so happy with last year's HTC One.
[01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:56.420]   I thought the pictures were not great.
[01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:57.420]   This is the same sensor.
[01:24:57.420 --> 01:24:58.420]   They've done some bad things.
[01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:00.420]   They've taken out optical image stabilization.
[01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:04.420]   But I think that they haven't proved the over...
[01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:06.420]   I call it pleasingness.
[01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:09.420]   So there I've added some text to the image.
[01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:12.420]   I've taken some... I think the pleasingness of the photo,
[01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:15.420]   which is something that I now use when I'm reviewing
[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:17.420]   camera phones as opposed to pure technical specs.
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:21.420]   And I think that, again, the issue is I just bring it up
[01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:24.420]   because I really think that I'm really hoping that we see
[01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:26.420]   something from Apple that is competitive.
[01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:28.420]   That they're going to do something not only have a great sensor
[01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:30.420]   but have the ability to do this.
[01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:31.420]   This is being able to...
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:32.420]   This is future photography.
[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:34.420]   And, you know, Nokia's done it with Alumia, too.
[01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:38.420]   I mean, I think that this is pretty clear that that's where things are going.
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:40.420]   It's interesting not to the Hornet and Alex's pick,
[01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:42.420]   but Nokia's doing a lot of amazing things with the glass.
[01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:45.420]   Apple's doing amazing things with the image signal processor.
[01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:47.420]   HTC and Samsung are doing great things with the software,
[01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:50.420]   and Google's doing fantastic things with Auto Awesome on the server.
[01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:53.420]   And if we could just get everybody to start doing more amazing things
[01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:54.420]   in all four of those areas.
[01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:56.420]   We'll have some really good mobile cameras.
[01:25:56.420 --> 01:25:57.420]   Right.
[01:25:57.420 --> 01:25:58.420]   And people point out, "Oh, I could do that in Photoshop."
[01:25:58.420 --> 01:25:59.420]   Yeah, you can.
[01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:00.420]   Of course you can.
[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:01.420]   It's not doing...
[01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:02.420]   And there are apps.
[01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:04.420]   It's the fact that I'm standing in an airport in Ethiopia
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:05.420]   and able to upload it.
[01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:06.420]   That's what I...
[01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:07.420]   Yeah.
[01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:08.420]   That's important to me.
[01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:12.420]   The most cool thing is that when the argument against phone cameras has always been...
[01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:15.420]   well, there was always limits to how this tiny, tiny little lens
[01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:16.420]   and this tiny, tiny little image sensor,
[01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:18.420]   the things you physically can't do with it.
[01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:22.420]   And now all these makings are saying, "Yeah, it would be nice if we had a nice big lens,
[01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:26.420]   if we had a nice big image sensor, but now because we have so much processing power,
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:31.420]   we can fake pretty much any optical feature that you've got in this big honkin' camera,
[01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:36.420]   including automatically smoothing background noise at high ISO's.
[01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:40.420]   The iPhone, one of the reasons why it does such a great job is that it just has so much
[01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:45.420]   time with the speed of that processor to take several pictures and then figure out which
[01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:47.420]   one is the one they should actually show people.
[01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:51.420]   They're like the chef that makes a tray of cookies and only picks out the three that are
[01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:55.420]   perfect to actually put into the box to ship to people and when things go, "Oh, wow,
[01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:56.420]   it takes such great pictures."
[01:26:56.420 --> 01:27:00.420]   No, it takes some crappy pictures which it never ever shows you because it took up much...
[01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:02.420]   it learned from that and took a much better picture of fraction of the second lens.
[01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:04.420]   Yeah, and these ones feature this kind of interest.
[01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:05.420]   I don't know if you've used it.
[01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:07.420]   It has 12 frames per second.
[01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:09.420]   Maybe the shot...
[01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:13.420]   And then first, up to 99 shots, and then there's a button that comes up and says,
[01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:14.420]   "You want to make the best of those?"
[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:15.420]   Right.
[01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:17.420]   I haven't tried it, but that's an interesting thought.
[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:20.420]   When you take the photo, the zoe style...
[01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:25.420]   Yeah, the issue is you don't get the short and up the field anymore because it's doing
[01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:26.420]   different processing.
[01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:28.420]   For me, I'm really attached to the...
[01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:32.420]   I'm afraid I took a picture of my daughter walking through and I was like,
[01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:34.420]   "I like the photo so much, that's exactly what it's holding me on."
[01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:36.420]   You made an interesting point, Andy.
[01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:39.420]   I think a lot of this is possible because the processors and these phones have gotten so
[01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:40.420]   fast.
[01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:46.420]   Anon did a great article on the iPhone's processor saying it's essentially...
[01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:51.420]   the A7 is essentially a desktop class processor and very few apps take advantage of it.
[01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:52.420]   Yeah.
[01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:54.420]   So, which is exactly what Apple was saying when they rolled it out.
[01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:58.420]   They're saying this is desktop class computing and we're not saying that just because it's
[01:27:58.420 --> 01:27:59.420]   the 64-bit processor.
[01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:01.420]   We're saying that this is a desktop processor.
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:02.420]   Yeah.
[01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:03.420]   Well worth reading.
[01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:06.420]   This is a highly technical article as Anon often does.
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:11.420]   But well worth reading if you're interested in what the architecture of the A7 means.
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:18.420]   The kind of the takeaways are it is a desk class processor and yet a lot of apps just don't
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:19.420]   yet take advantage of it.
[01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:22.420]   I think some of that Apple can over time do things like...
[01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:23.420]   Yeah.
[01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:24.420]   ...and add more functionality into the camera.
[01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:28.420]   And I think one of the reasons that a lot of apps don't take advantage of it is that
[01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:31.420]   it's very hard to develop something that is that heavy for $3.99.
[01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:32.420]   Yeah.
[01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:37.260]   So, I think that part of it is that there's just not the market for the kind of engineering
[01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:40.420]   that's required to make that worth the investment.
[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:41.420]   The ROI.
[01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:45.420]   It's the only way it used to take to save an HDR image on an iPhone and now it's so fast
[01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:46.420]   they just put it on auto.
[01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:47.420]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:48.420]   Yeah.
[01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:49.420]   Andy, your pick of the week.
[01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:56.180]   It is April Fool's Day so this isn't a trick but I thought I'd pick a documentary that was
[01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:57.420]   just released today.
[01:28:57.420 --> 01:28:59.220]   It's called Stripped.
[01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:03.980]   And it is a documentary years in the making about comic strips.
[01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:08.100]   About the transition from the people who've been doing this for decades who are watching
[01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:13.660]   newspaper markets dry up including also the people who started doing comic strips on web
[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:17.100]   comics and are now doing some of the most innovative and one of the most popular work
[01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:18.100]   that's out there.
[01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:21.660]   I mean, you look at the list of people who have been interviewed for this.
[01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:26.580]   Bill Watterson was interviewed in depth for this thing and you like this documentary so
[01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:31.020]   much when they showed him a cut that he said, "Would you be interested in my drawing a
[01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:32.020]   poster for you?"
[01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:36.860]   And then the film said, "Yes, we would be interested in Bill Watterson who never gives
[01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:40.300]   interviews and we've seen one piece of artwork over the past 20 years.
[01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:41.820]   We would be interested in that."
[01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:44.340]   And so it really is a who's who were.
[01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:46.260]   Matt, you've been to Oatmeal's on this.
[01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:47.260]   Oh, this is great.
[01:29:47.260 --> 01:29:48.260]   Yeah.
[01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:49.260]   They've got Charles Scholz's widow.
[01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:52.580]   They've got Danielle Cressado, one of my favorites.
[01:29:52.580 --> 01:29:55.940]   They've got Carl Curschle, one of my favorites.
[01:29:55.940 --> 01:30:01.300]   This basically is a list of almost all of the comic strips imprinted online that I read
[01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:02.380]   every single morning.
[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:04.180]   And they've got the release today.
[01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:07.500]   They're trying to get to number one on iTunes so everybody should buy it.
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:08.500]   Yes.
[01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:09.500]   Today.
[01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:10.500]   I have bought it.
[01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:11.500]   I have not.
[01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:13.380]   That is my reward at the end of the day today to get to watch it.
[01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:18.100]   But I've spoken to people who have already seen it and they're like, "Oh, this is long
[01:30:18.100 --> 01:30:20.500]   time coming and exactly what this industry needed."
[01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:21.500]   All right.
[01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:24.700]   $15 to buy in high-def, $4.99 to rent.
[01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:26.860]   I'm going to buy it because let's make them number one.
[01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:27.860]   What do you say?
[01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:29.260]   Buy it and gift it.
[01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:32.140]   Well, let's not go crazy.
[01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:33.140]   Is that a request?
[01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:34.140]   Would you like a copy?
[01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:35.780]   No, I bought it and I gifted it.
[01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:36.780]   Oh, you already did.
[01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:38.100]   Good for you.
[01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:39.100]   That's awesome.
[01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:40.100]   All right.
[01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:41.900]   I'm buying it right now as we speak.
[01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:44.300]   It looks really good.
[01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:47.140]   And I'm a huge fan of Bill Watterson.
[01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:53.340]   So again, they spent years flying out to pretty much everybody that had something to say.
[01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:57.700]   And so it's almost like sometimes you see these documentaries where it's like, thank
[01:30:57.700 --> 01:31:02.780]   God that they got to people and got these interviews before they get too old and they
[01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:05.660]   die or before they move on to other things.
[01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:09.780]   I think this is going to be something that we refer to back for the next five, 10, 15,
[01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:11.060]   20 years.
[01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:12.060]   Just bought it.
[01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:13.060]   Yes.
[01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:15.500]   And now I shall watch it.
[01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:17.540]   Today, Goat Simulator comes out.
[01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:18.540]   That's my pick of the week.
[01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:19.540]   Everybody should go out.
[01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:21.140]   Buy Goat Simulator.
[01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:23.220]   Perhaps you saw the trailer.
[01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:26.500]   I thought, frankly, that it was an April Fool's joke.
[01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:28.740]   I didn't believe it was real.
[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:35.540]   But in fact, apparently you can buy it on Steam and play.
[01:31:35.540 --> 01:31:36.540]   Have you ever purchased yet?
[01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:40.620]   I thought we should play this on Twitter live at some point.
[01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:43.740]   You get points for licking things and points for smashing things.
[01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:45.060]   You bought it.
[01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:46.660]   And it's a lot of fun.
[01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:47.660]   It's probably 10 bucks.
[01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:48.660]   Yeah.
[01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:51.660]   You can get a jet pack and go into an anti-gravity room.
[01:31:51.660 --> 01:31:53.780]   I like a goat in a jet pack.
[01:31:53.780 --> 01:31:58.300]   I think that's an idea that whose time has come.
[01:31:58.300 --> 01:31:59.300]   Yeah.
[01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:01.660]   It's an interesting-- it's funny.
[01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:06.660]   The game developers-- I think there's a poster that is like, you get to be a goat.
[01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:08.420]   Lots of bugs.
[01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:12.260]   Seriously, we're not going to fix anything that's not game breaking.
[01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:13.260]   A lot of bugs.
[01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:14.260]   Yeah.
[01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:15.660]   And you get to be a goat.
[01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:18.300]   People love glitches in a game.
[01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:19.820]   You know, people play Gary's model.
[01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:20.820]   Love this.
[01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:22.820]   It's actually kind of Gary's mod with goats.
[01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:23.820]   Right.
[01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:24.820]   Actually, for all I know Gary's mod has.
[01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:27.460]   It most likely actually was built on Gary's mod.
[01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:28.460]   Who knows?
[01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:29.460]   Yeah.
[01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:30.460]   It kind of feels like that, doesn't it?
[01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:31.460]   Could easily.
[01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:32.460]   Yeah.
[01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:33.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:34.460]   Buy Pick of the Week.
[01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:35.460]   Goat-simulator.com.
[01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:37.700]   You have to have Steam.
[01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:38.980]   I don't know if it works on the Mac.
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:40.940]   I didn't even check.
[01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:42.780]   I probably should.
[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:44.580]   Steam on the Mac actually is well worth getting.
[01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:50.580]   If you don't have it, it really turns the Mac into a great gaming platform.
[01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:53.380]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have concluded our broadcast day.
[01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:55.340]   The April Fool's joke is over.
[01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:57.220]   You may now go about your work.
[01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:01.900]   Thank you, Andy and NOCO for joining us at the Chicago Sun Times, and NOCO.com.
[01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:04.020]   Always a pleasure to see you.
[01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:08.060]   Are you going to post some of those John Singer Sergeant pictures on your flicker?
[01:33:08.060 --> 01:33:09.060]   Yes.
[01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:13.180]   That's one of my test pictures and you will not believe the crazy amount of detail he
[01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:14.180]   put into this.
[01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:15.180]   I can't wait.
[01:33:15.180 --> 01:33:16.180]   But it's huge.
[01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:18.860]   And now I've kind of got an ongoing project of I've got to spend some more time in that
[01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:21.260]   gallery and learning more about this sort of stuff.
[01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:23.820]   It's good happens.
[01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:26.580]   People keep asking me, I'm in Boston for a couple of days, what should I see?
[01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:27.580]   And they're surprised.
[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:29.100]   I was saying, "What are the public library?"
[01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:34.340]   And they're never confused after they visit, said, "Oh my God, I spent three hours there
[01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:37.740]   and zero dollars of my money and it was the best time I ever had."
[01:33:37.740 --> 01:33:41.500]   It's kind of hard to believe that, I mean, I'm looking at the ceiling and the...
[01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:47.140]   It was late 1890s and it really is a who's who of whoever was an important artist or
[01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:49.420]   sculpture at that time got a commission.
[01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:54.500]   I just found out last week that James, that Whistler was supposed to do a huge mural for
[01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:55.700]   the big study room.
[01:33:55.700 --> 01:34:00.780]   This is why there's a big empty spot for who was supposed to be Columbus Discovery America.
[01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:05.660]   And so you see this get and that's everybody else that was of any notability.
[01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:10.060]   Even the doors, the front doors for this were done by Daniel Chester French, the guy who
[01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:12.580]   did the Lincoln Memorial.
[01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:17.020]   Because if you were a hot shot muralist or sculptor, you got a commission to do something
[01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:19.020]   for the Boston Public Library.
[01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:23.260]   And if you go to flicker.com/andii, there's also squirrels.
[01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:24.260]   Yes, squirrels.
[01:34:24.260 --> 01:34:25.260]   Squirrels.
[01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:30.040]   By the way, as we wrap things up, I think we should go back to our international friendship
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:32.660]   satellite feed.
[01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:36.220]   Because an engineer just ran by.
[01:34:36.220 --> 01:34:37.220]   Quick get the astronaut.
