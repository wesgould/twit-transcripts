[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, Episode 46, the moment that
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Scott Born has been waiting for his entire adult life, and I think even some of his childhood has finally arrived.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Scott, are you all?
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   He's no longer an iPhone virgin, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   He's holding it in his hands.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Oh!
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Put it down and take up the iPhone now.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   And let's -- what do you think?
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Oh, geez.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Sorry.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Sorry.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Okay. So Alex, I just want to say, I have an iPhone.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Alex Lindsey is here from Pixel Born.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   I have an iPhone.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   He has an iPhone.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Scott Born is here from applephoneshow.com.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   He has an iPhone.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Merlin Man is here from 43folders.com in the Merlin Man show.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   He does not have a phone.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   But he did a great segment on that by mouth the iPhone.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   He will now reppry representing the holdout.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   For a margin.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Yeah, not necessarily a margin.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Just holdout.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And I think there are quite a few holdouts.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   I think a lot of people -- in fact, it was my advice to anybody who isn't a fanatic.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   A lot of people did holdout.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Wait for generation two.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Is that what you're waiting for?
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Well, I think, yeah, exactly.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   The apples -- I don't know if this is the real story tonight,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   but my experience with apple stuff, I think if you can wait for a two or a one point one,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   it's a good idea to hold out.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   See, I'm going to wait a little bit.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   It looks fantastic.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   I saw one on Muni coming home tonight.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And it looked terrific.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   A guy was showing it off.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   It looks fantastic.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   But yeah, I'm going to wait.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   But I want to hear what you guys say.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   You guys, you're the ones with the phones in your hand.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   What do you guys think?
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   If Scott has stopped giggling, maybe we can ask him.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Well, actually, I haven't been able -- I just got home a few minutes before we did the show,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   and I didn't want to start the activation.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   We should say -- yeah, we're taping this at 8 p.m. Pacific time, two hours after the store's opened.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Yeah, but I do have it in my hand.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   I've read through the manual.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   I've played with all the accoutrements.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   I got my jawbone ready to go.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   You know, I just -- after we're done, I'm going to actually fire the puppy up.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   But I did get to see, you know, several people play with their stay.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I got to handle them.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   And I have to say that my initial impressions are that the things I was concerned about,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   i.e. a cell phone that worked and the ability to sync have been dealt with.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   It syncs beautifully.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Yes.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And the phone works because I can vouch for that because I've actually received a call now from Alex of all people.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I wanted to be the first call.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   You were.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I wanted to be the first.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I think I'm the only one with a working one.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I think you are.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   You're still setting yours up, Alex?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Evidently, you know, I had -- every time I buy a new cell phone, my tradition has always been that I just get a new number.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   A new cell phone means a new number means I get rid of all the old people who know what my number is that I don't want to --
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I love that.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I love that about a new cell phone.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   And, you know, and it was just -- I have a good number.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I'm not going to say it on the air, but I have a good number right now.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And I was reticent to give it up.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   It's hot, right.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   It's an 4.1.5 hot butt.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Hot butt.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Well, there was that.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   You know, that's what it was.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   And so now you know what it is.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And it was a good number.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   So now all these people are going to call 4.5 hot butt.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Yeah, whoever that is.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I'm going to try to --
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I'll be waiting on the other end.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Let me try that.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   You're going on --
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   19.5 and all the loving you can take.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   So I think I found a bug in the process, which is the issue is that if it says that when you're registering that if you haven't been finalized, if the registration hasn't been finalized, what it says it'll do is it says you can go ahead and use all the other features of your iPhone
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   while you're waiting for activation.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   But the truth of the matter is you really can't.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   You have to wait until the activation finishes, which may take hopefully sometime this weekend.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   You guys were in line at the San Francisco Apple Store, which is really kind of -- except for the one in Cupertino, really kind of is -- and maybe the one in New York City.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   It's kind of Apple Central.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   It was surreal.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   How did you go there?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Yeah, it was close to a circus.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   It was close to, you know --
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   I've never seen it like it.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I mean, there were people watching the people.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   There was the line of people that wanted to get into the store.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Then there was a line of people who wanted to photograph the line of people getting into the store.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Then there was a line of people taking pictures of everybody.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   There was no -- I don't think there was any less than 1,000 people in the vicinity of what was going on.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   And the whole time, there was like 12 people in line at the AT&T store block away.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Well, I went to an AT&T store.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   There were about 60, 70 people there by the time the doors opened.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   And by the way, they didn't -- I wasn't there at the end, but I think that they were sold out, which is unlike the Apple stores.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   In fact, I'm looking at the Apple store locator right now.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   It looks like every single Apple store in the country still has iPhones to sell tomorrow morning at 9 a.m.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   It definitely seemed like there was plenty at the Apple stores.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   How did it go once they opened the doors?
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Very quickly.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   It was shocking.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   It was shocking, you know.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   I mean, Leo, we were about 70 people back.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Yeah, you were almost at O'Farrell Street.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   You were pretty far back.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Well, we had paid waiters that got there at about 6 a.m.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   and there was already 70 people ahead of it.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Wow.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   And then -- but I swear, once the doors opened, it was like -- like a knife through butter.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   I heard there was 50 at a time.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Is that right?
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   I can tell you, by 6/20, Greg and I were at the parking garage.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Wow.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   So we had the phones, we paid for them.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Greg was giving me a ride home at 6/20.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   It was one of the most brilliantly executed things I have ever seen.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Those guys know what they're doing.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   They just moved massive people through there.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And my hat's off to them because they brought out water.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   They were communicative.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   They had Starbucks bring around refreshments.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   The whole thing was handled really well, in my opinion.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   I agree.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   I would say the same thing at the AT&T store.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   It was a little slower because I think AT&T was doing more validation.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   But it went fairly quickly and easily.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   And I left about -- it took about -- they were letting 10 at a time.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   And this is a small store.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   But the people were well-trained.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   They were knowledgeable.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   I'll tell you the big decision for me.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   I don't know if you guys face this, was which case to get.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   You know, I didn't get one.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   I was --
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Well, because I got three.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I couldn't decide.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   So you can come over and look at the --
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   All right, all right.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   I'm good.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   I'm good at actually using Leo's hand-me-downs, you know, because I really like the jacket
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   that I got.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Oh, you got it.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Well, that was a Twitch jacket.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   No, yeah, yeah.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   And I used it in Africa.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   It was very --
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   We have new hoodies just came in.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   You're going to love these new hoodies.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   But wait, let's not get into that.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   This is the iPhone show.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Although it has a pocket for the iPhone.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   [Laughs]
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Made just for the iPhone.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   And you can run your wires through it.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   So I got the rubber case, the plastic case, and the leather case.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Now, do any of these cases have something that covers the glass?
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   None of them.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   That's good because it wouldn't work.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   I can tell you right now, I'm fingerprinting all heavy on the glass.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   It doesn't take long.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   But it comes with a nice little cloth suitable for rubbing.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   [Laughs]
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   I thought that --
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Yeah, I thought that that was interesting.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   You know, with most of the new Apple products, you always expect to get some kind of funky little thing where you go, "Oh, they really thought about this."
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   And that was the little cloth.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   It comes with a dock, a nice little heavy dock.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Which is good because you -- I have a standard dock and it doesn't really wobbles if it goes in there.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Although the connector is the same, we should point out so many of your accessories will work.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   And following Apple's pattern, most likely the dock will only be available for the first two weeks.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   And then after that, you're on your own.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   You just get a cable.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Oh, really?
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Oh, yeah, that doesn't get out.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   A lot of times you get all this cool stuff on the very first ones.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   And then after that, they're like, "Ah, no, I don't really need it."
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   They did that with the iPod, didn't they?
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   What's that?
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Is that a phone?
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   That was a --
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Kind of like a true -- Kendra.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   So Kendra got her phone.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Kendra from Macbreak got her phone.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   And she just text-messaged me, which I'm still getting on my camera.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Do you want to hear the ringtones?
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Yeah, let's break them out, man.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   This is, of course, one of the complaints that some people had.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   I included -- we can't install our own ringtones, although there seems to be the suspicion that
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Apple will be selling ringtones.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Any day.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Any day now.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Any day.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   The default is the marimba.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Can you hear that?
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Yep.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Where's it coming out of?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   I left it that.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Here's an alarm.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Not a good ring.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   That's nasty.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Not a ring you'd like.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Here's ascending.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Making no sound.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   I guess it was -- that's good.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Dog barking.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   I like this.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Where's it coming out?
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   I can't tell.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   It's magical.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   There's no speaker.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   It's coming through the screen somehow.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   You know, I'm really glad they have this, actually.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   This is usually my favorite ring on most phones.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   That's my favorite, right there.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Although you kind of look around for the dial phone that -- you're sci-fi.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   This is -- you'll like this.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   This is a little theremin action.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   But, you know, kind of standard phone rings.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   But you know what, the marimba, the default is so nice.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   And I'm going to stick with it.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   And that's going to be for a while, a status symbol, won't it?
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Yes, it will.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   I like -- I like vibrate.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   You know what's vibrate, by the way.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   When you played the science fiction ring, it reminded me of something that happened while we were in line.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   John C. Devoreck walked up to me and said hi.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   No!
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Yeah, you're kidding.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Yeah, he just got through doing a bash, the iPhone segment for CNBC.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   And he came over and said hi.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   He agreed to be on my show so we could do a point counterpoint.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Did he -- what does he think?
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Did he bash it?
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   No, he said he kind of act like he goes, well, I guess I've been labeled as the guy that they all want to hire to get on in bash.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   He kind of said it apologetically.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   So he was in what you would call a good mood for John Devoreck.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   He's always in a good mood.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   He's saying so nice.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Yeah, I think you and he just hit it off poorly.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   And I'm sure you guys will get along later.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Well, he posed with the picture for me.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   There you go.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   I don't think he's going to be eating crow.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   There's plenty to say about this phone, oh, I don't like it.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   But the experience is, as you would expect, it's beautiful.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   I mean, the zoom that you get when you open up these icons, it all works kind of as you'd expect it.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   I think it's a pretty nice phone.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   I'm looking at the calendar right now.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   It's quite beautiful.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   The Apple site recently added, for those of us who don't have a phone in hand, I told you
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.240]   you mentioned this to you, Leo, before the show, but apple.com/iPhone just added this
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.480]   thing that called "Finger Tips," which is a couple of nice, it's kind of like four or
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.000]   five nice little tutorials on how to do different things with your iPhone.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   And it looks like, again, a great, even though it's meant to be kind of, you know, pedagogical.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   It's really interesting as another view of how the interface works.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   It just looks just beautiful.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   This actually comes with the phone.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   It's on the phone as well.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   It's not on the phone, but it might be, but it comes as a piece of paper in the phone.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   It's actually a manual.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   And you need it because it's not obvious.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Some of these little tips are not obvious.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   And you can also download the manual now.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   It's a PDF available on the website.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   And by the way, Leo, we're going to have as a guest on the Apple phone show in a couple
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   of weeks, the guy who made all those videos.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Oh, really?
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Yeah, it's one guy.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   You have a podcast about the iPhone?
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   Thank you, Merlin.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Have you tried the RSS reader yet?
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   No, although I was sitting in line with a fellow Chris Weatherall, who's a Google guy.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   I don't know what he was doing.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   You know him.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   I don't know what he's doing in my neck of the woods, but he's the Google Reader guy.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   He told me they were up till three in the morning last night making Google Reader work better
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   with the iPhone.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Wow.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   So I said, well, what'd you do?
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   He said, well, you know, it's just cosmetic.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   We wanted to look like the other iPhone apps.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   You can see.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Scramble is on.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.240]   I mean, my friends over at Omni Group that I work with, this closure, work with on the
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.520]   Omni Focus product, they just pushed out a new beta of that that will work.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.720]   You can run it off of a port on your own machine.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.720]   Oh, really?
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.040]   I don't see it on the iPhone.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.040]   So how do I test?
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.600]   How do I, you're saying I should test the RSS reader?
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.600]   You mean in Safari?
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.040]   Yeah, there's a new, what is the address for this?
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.200]   They just added this the other day.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.400]   They added a new iPhone only RSS feed.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.400]   Who added it?
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.400]   RSS reader.
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.400]   Apple did.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.400]   And how do I get it?
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.400]   At reader.mac.com.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.400]   All right.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:18.400]   I have to say it's taken me a little while to get used to the keyboard.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.400]   Oh, that.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.080]   It is not immediately intuitive.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.400]   That's what everybody said, in fact, that you got to give it a couple of days.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.400]   Give it a while.
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.800]   You act as if you have one.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.400]   I'm not allowed to say reader.apple.mac.com.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.600]   That's right.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:39.400]   And again, this was such a brilliant piece of Apple, Apple, Alia.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.080]   Because you said it's not word, Merlin.
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.080]   It is now.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:48.520]   You go to this page and it says this application is viewable only on the iPhone.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.280]   If you want to see an RSS feed, just enter the URL directly into that.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.920]   I started to call this "metascicity."
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.280]   No, I just want to tell you something.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.560]   It's a little bit of a bust.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.080]   I've gone to reader.mac.com.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.200]   It says if you'd like to view an RSS feed, just enter the feed URL directly into Safari's
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.680]   address bar.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.760]   There is nothing there.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.440]   It's just an error message.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.440]   Really?
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.440]   Yeah.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.280]   In other words, you don't have to have--
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.560]   That's probably pretty easy to code.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.000]   You don't have to have-- yeah, you don't have HTML, baby.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.760]   So let me add-- well, you know what?
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.120]   Let's try a podcast feed.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.440]   Do you think it would be smart enough to know to play the enclosure?
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.680]   See, that's the kind of thing it should do.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.780]   We shall see.
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.400]   You guys talk amongst yourselves so I navigate this keyboard.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:37.680]   Well, you know, I wanted to point out Merlin's position of waiting is one that's been echoed
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:42.440]   by a couple of my friends and they played back to me what I said about Apple TV, which
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.080]   turned out to be a good move, I think, on my part.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:49.400]   And I think-- I just wanted to say before we got into all the nitty gritty, whether or
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:54.760]   not you were a fan of what they shipped today, I really do think this is important for the
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:59.520]   future just like I said about the Apple TV, which I didn't buy, but I also thought it
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.880]   was important for the future.
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.320]   This is one of those things that-- I mean, I think it's a game changer whether or not
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:10.600]   you like this phone or all the stuff on it, it certainly has raised the bar.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:15.320]   There's some really neat UI stuff in here that I would love to see more widely used.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.560]   That's what I liked about that though.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.560]   That's why I didn't--
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.360]   That's a little tutorial is all that whizzy, age-accent, whatever it is.
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:26.800]   Well, for instance, if you're entering a URL or correcting URL and you press your finger
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:33.840]   in the URL, a magnifying glass comes out so you can easily see where the insert caret
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.920]   is, it's little things like that.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.600]   Actually, you can do that, Leo, anywhere you're typing.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.600]   I'm sure that's the case.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.200]   Yeah, and that's very cool.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.440]   I'm curious, Scott, of-- so you've been looking forward to this for a really long time.
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.600]   Now that you've actually had some little bit of time to have it in your hand, what's surprising
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.440]   you in a good way the most?
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:56.160]   What's the thing that you saw that you didn't expect to be as cool as it is?
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.000]   You know, just-- you know, Merle, I'm here.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   Oh, there it is.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Okay, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.760]   So you're in a URL, then it loads Mac Reader.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.240]   So this is not the Safari traditional thing.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.240]   You get a new reader.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.800]   Oh, look at that.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.120]   And let me just see the MP3.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.440]   Yeah, it doesn't give you a play.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.440]   Doesn't do attachments?
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.440]   No, we should do the employer.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.440]   That would be nice.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.440]   Go ahead.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.440]   Tell us a little bit about what--
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.600]   I think it's the screen quality really, Merle, and it surprised me the most.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.800]   I just wasn't prepared for it to be so beautiful.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.280]   I just-- you know, I didn't think about that part of it.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.280]   And when I saw--
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:35.240]   So you can really-- you can watch a movie on this, and it's not like the squinty iPod
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.240]   video experience.
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:42.640]   Well, and sitting right next to my iPhone on my laptop, I have my iPod, you know, with
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:46.640]   video, and I'm looking at it going, "How in the hell did I ever even think about watching
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.640]   a movie on that thing?"
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.760]   And I look at the screen.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:56.120]   It's the size and the clarity and the color saturation of the screen is-- that's what surprised
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.120]   me.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.120]   I think I was prepared for everything else.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.480]   I was not prepared for how pretty it is.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.480]   What about your pinching?
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.840]   You were very excited about the two finger thing.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.840]   How's that working out?
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:04.840]   Is that cool?
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:05.840]   Well, you know, it's--
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:06.840]   Well, are you-- are you even using your phone?
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:07.840]   You haven't activated it yet.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:11.000]   Well, like I said, I can't talk about that.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   I don't understand.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.760]   Do you have a phone that you're using?
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.440]   I talk-- I can talk about another phone.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.440]   Did I use--
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.280]   Lea, what you don't understand that Scott has reached a point in life where he's got
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.280]   the finances.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.280]   He's actually been able to move into the future.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.280]   I don't understand what's going on here.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.160]   Working on the 3.1--
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.160]   The phone that's got--
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:34.400]   This particular phone in my hand, I have not activated.
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.400]   You have another phone.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.480]   He may or may not have touched another phone.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.080]   I have used another phone.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.560]   Well, why would you keep that a secret?
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.280]   Because I don't want to get somebody in trouble.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.680]   Oh, I see.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.880]   So you haven't-- OK, so-- but how long did you have with that phone?
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.880]   45 minutes.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:50.880]   OK.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.880]   All right, so you've used a phone before, in other words.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.880]   Yes.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.240]   Yeah, I mean, which means you've had as much time as I have.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.280]   I've been playing with it while we're talking.
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.280]   It's pretty--
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.200]   And in 45 minutes, I confirmed, like I said, the things I cared about.
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.320]   It makes good calls, and it syncs well.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:11.240]   And I know that the Uber geeks want to do lots of stuff with it that's special that
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.920]   I don't particularly care about.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:18.800]   But I probably will start doing more of that kind of stuff because this makes it easier.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.880]   How many did you end up buying?
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:26.360]   Well, if you-- physical phones, five and then--
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.080]   Physical phones as a pair to a--
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.080]   As compared with options.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:35.560]   As compared with gift cards equaling the value of the phone and other so many.
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:40.000]   So tell me, Mr. Expert, then how do I tell the keyboard to go horizontal?
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.360]   Because it doesn't seem to pay any attention.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.920]   It only goes horizontal when you're in the web browser.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.720]   Unfortunately, this is a flaw, in my opinion.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.760]   Yeah, because I tell you, it's a little small.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.480]   Yeah, when you're in web browser mode, then it will go horizontal for you.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.000]   And then it really looks nice.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.120]   And I'm thinking to myself, so why can't we just always do that?
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.120]   But we can't.
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.640]   And the nice thing is, though, this isn't like some phone with a bunch of buttons that
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.640]   you're stuck with it.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.640]   They can change that.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.640]   That's software.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.640]   I mean, there's some things they can't change.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:14.280]   It's not going to all of a sudden have a GPS or stereo Bluetooth.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.680]   But it could easily add software.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:21.720]   I think, frankly, that they'll open this up after a little while.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.640]   For instance, there's no chat application.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.720]   And why should we have to wait for Apple to put a chat?
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.320]   Why can't we put Addy in on this?
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:34.280]   Well, July 6, 7th and 8th is the first ever iPhone developers conference right here in
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.280]   San Francisco.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.800]   And who knows what's going to come out of that?
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.120]   Unofficial, unofficial, we should say.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.120]   It's a bar camp.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.600]   No, I think this is a beautiful phone, I have to say.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:49.880]   And I understand their desire to preserve the integrity of the experience, at least for
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.120]   a little while.
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.920]   And the video is great.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:54.920]   The YouTube is working.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.880]   I'm on a Wi-Fi network right now, so the YouTube is working quite well.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.520]   Have you tried the Edge network, Leo?
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.520]   I have not.
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.520]   I could turn off the Wi-Fi.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.720]   The Edge is faster.
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.440]   I was trying it today on my BlackBerry.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.720]   And remember, you were talking about the press release that they put out that they were
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.720]   going to improve Edge.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.720]   It is faster.
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.720]   Still not.
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:14.720]   It's still slow.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.840]   Yeah, it's still not super fast, but it's faster.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:26.320]   Andy Inaka was making the point that he has access to some 3G networks where he lives.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.760]   And he said, "They're not always faster than Edge."
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:34.160]   He said, "He often has to wait as long or longer on 3G work."
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.880]   Yeah, well, anybody who's used the Sprint card or the Verizon card knows that it's possible.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.800]   They'll have very, very snappy 3G cell access.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.480]   And I do wish they had done that.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.280]   But this is a first generation.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.280]   I think we'll see.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.920]   That would be one of the first things I think will fix.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.200]   Well, and Steve Jobs said in the Wall Street Journal interview yesterday that they're looking
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.200]   at that.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:57.080]   I do want to correct a couple of misconceptions I've seen on the web.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.520]   People are saying they can fix that in software and they cannot.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.880]   That's a chipset issue.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.200]   That's a chipset issue.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:07.480]   And the reason they decided not to do it right now is because of weight and cost and
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.960]   probably because it is fairly hefty.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.360]   I have to say, this is not a light phone.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.880]   No, and which is good.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:13.880]   It feels solid.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:14.880]   I mean, in a way, that's a positive.
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:15.880]   And you know what?
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.880]   It is a little slippery.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.560]   I've dropped it three times.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.200]   I got it out of the box.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.200]   I dropped it.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.200]   Exactly.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.640]   When I was taking the plastic off of it, I almost dropped it.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:29.080]   And I thought, you know, the guy that wrote the review of the thing saying it was slippery,
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.040]   he must have actually actually really seen one because it is.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.040]   Slippery.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.040]   You do need a case.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.280]   Trust me, you need a case.
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.280]   Well, I got three of them.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.560]   I got a rubber one.
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.520]   I got a plastic one and I got a leather one.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.240]   And you know, that will make it not slippery.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:48.040]   And I frankly am so nervous about dropping it because of the glass that I think that
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.800]   that's a case is a critical.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:50.800]   It was interesting.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.760]   As soon as you go in the store while they're ordering this for you, you know, while they're
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:00.160]   setting you up, the AT&T guy said, now go over and pick a case while we wait for the
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.160]   computer.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.240]   That was very well timed.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:08.480]   Yeah, in the Apple store, they were bringing them around and showing them to you.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:12.920]   You couldn't focus on them because your eyes were glazing over as you looked at the hundreds
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.240]   of iPhones in the back wall.
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.440]   So just to run down the icons on the front, you've got SMS text.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.680]   You've got a calendar, very much like I call photos.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:28.640]   I have to say the pinch, the fingertip navigation is very intuitive and really works well.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.200]   You've got a camera, two megapixels.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.200]   It's greenish.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.440]   It lit as those images we saw on the web.
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.760]   They were iPhone images.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.560]   It's not a great camera, grainy and greenish.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.680]   But it doesn't crash your camera when you try to take a picture.
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.840]   That's a good point.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.360]   So far, I haven't crashed the iPhone once.
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.160]   Then on the second row, there's three rows of four.
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.800]   There's YouTube.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:47.800]   There's stocks.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.960]   Interesting that they give stocks their own button.
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.960]   I'm not sure.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:51.960]   That was interesting too.
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.520]   That doesn't seem really appropriate to me.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.760]   Why do you think they did that, Marlin?
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.720]   Is that a usability thing to you?
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.240]   Are you being serious?
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.240]   I can't.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:06.200]   Personally, I think it's the whole kind of Sky Mall magazine, cigar golf culture.
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.280]   It's a little high priority for just stocks.
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.840]   If you put stocks on something, it seems like a business thing.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:12.840]   You know what I mean?
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.560]   It's got that sky kind of feeling.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:19.080]   It comes with the four stocks that are on it are Apple, which by the way was up a buck
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.320]   and a half today.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:25.080]   So much for all the people saying that Apple was going to tank today.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.640]   No sell off yet.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:33.520]   Although it's not a huge growth, but still Google down two dollars and Yahoo and, of course,
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.520]   AT&T.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:40.080]   Well, you know what's really interesting about stock prices in the last couple of days?
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:45.200]   RIM is up 25% in the last quarter.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.560]   How do they do in the last couple of days?
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.040]   I think maybe this is good for phones.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.040]   This puts a lot of attention on smart phones.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.560]   I'm ready to eat my words.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.200]   I think this might be good for phones.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:58.400]   I think this is going to reinvigorate, this could potentially reinvigorate interest in
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.920]   the whole idea of what you can do with this.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:01.920]   Who knows?
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:05.440]   I mean, this is going to raise the bar, but it's also going to make people just become
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.440]   more, look at it this way.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.200]   It's going to make people more aware of the stuff you can do with the phone that they
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.760]   may not be thinking about right now.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.120]   And I think it's really important.
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:15.440]   And I know you've been saying this, Scott, and I think others and certainly Steve Jobs,
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.440]   this isn't a phone.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.640]   This is a portable computer.
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:19.640]   Exactly.
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.440]   And I think it's very significant in that regard.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:28.040]   You've solved the issue of how do you get something this small and yet have usability?
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.000]   And I think they've actually really figured that out.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.680]   Well, and I think one of the things is that the phone really answers what all of us kept
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.400]   on saying we wanted in a phone.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.800]   So we had the closest, we were just talking about this today in the office.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:45.920]   And the closest we could get, a lot of us could get was the trio or something that's
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.560]   kind of in that vicinity.
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.520]   We wanted to do all of the stuff with the phone.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:54.120]   It was all of this kind of poor facsimile of what we really thought in our head.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.600]   And the iPhone is by far, it's not the answer.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.480]   It's not everything we ever wanted.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.760]   But it is so much further closer.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.760]   It's a pleasure to go ahead.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:03.760]   And all of us had imagined it.
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:04.760]   You'd all thought about it.
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.320]   And I think that's what it gets people so excited is that it was what was in their
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.320]   head.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.280]   It was what they wanted to see.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.520]   And no one seemed to be willing to give it to them.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:17.320]   And I think it's a pretty exciting one when I actually can.
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.320]   I'm actually going to say this is better than I thought it would be.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:25.160]   It's more exciting and it's much clearer how this changes computing.
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.160]   This is portable computing.
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.960]   To continue on, there's maps, not GPS.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:33.120]   And I talked to a guy in line who's all excited about the GPS functionality of the phone.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.120]   And I had to disabuse him.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.960]   I said, oh no.
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.480]   You know, there's maps, but it's Google Maps.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.360]   You have to enter in the start and the end.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.880]   And it will tell you turn by turn, but you have to go next, next, next.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:44.880]   You have to navigate yourself.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.920]   I really think that's going to be one of the things we see in the next phone.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:48.920]   Didn't dot him.
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.560]   He was there in an RV with his wife and daughter and the three of them.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.200]   The three of them all have iPhones now following maps, weather.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.120]   And you know, you may think that's trivial, but I think weather is very important.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.320]   And it's a beautiful weather application.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.320]   Interesting.
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.320]   It's a Yahoo widget.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.760]   And I think this is actually very important.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:12.760]   This is the same widget functionally as you get on the Yahoo desktop, the Yahoo widgets.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:18.480]   And since we know that they're just JavaScript and CSS, there's no reason why I think you
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:22.000]   could see a whole lot of widgets programmed that way.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.440]   I think if they do open the platform, this is where you're really going to see some growth.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.440]   This is a Yahoo widget.
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:29.960]   It's got the little info thing on the right corner, flips it around.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.080]   It says powered by Yahoo.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.080]   It's a Yahoo widget.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.080]   Hmm.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.080]   So that's interesting.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.920]   I wonder how Google felt about that.
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.120]   Yeah, interesting.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.280]   Yahoo is all over this phone.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.840]   You know, Yahoo mail is really best supported by the phone.
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.040]   It's a Google Yahoo phone.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:47.160]   I remember when they announced it, they had both Yahoo and Google on stage with them.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:51.000]   Well, the big question for me is, are they going to eventually support Flash?
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Are you, if you go to a Flash site to get anything, to get an error?
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.280]   No, you get what you would get if you went with a non-Flash browser.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.360]   Sorry, we don't support this.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.400]   I went to twit.tv, which uses a Flash player.
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:04.080]   And it just said, of course, we degrade gracefully on twit.tv.
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.760]   It looks, it says, oh, you don't have Flash.
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:09.040]   If you had Flash, you'd see a player here.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:13.040]   So let me throw a little tidbit that could or could not be relevant and could or could
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.040]   not be interesting.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:21.800]   But the aforementioned iPhone developers conference has been graciously hosted by and sponsored
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.560]   by Adobe.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.520]   Oh, Apollo, you think?
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:32.720]   It's going to be at the 601 Townsend old Macromedia building down the street from my condo.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:33.720]   Maybe it'll work.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.720]   If I was working tomorrow, I'd be there.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.360]   I think that's going to be a very interesting place.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.240]   It's July 6th through 8th.
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.240]   Maybe it'll support Cold Fusion.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.000]   That'll be sweet.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.520]   Let me look at my iPhone calendar.
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.520]   See what I'm doing.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:52.280]   So the point is, is that you got to wonder, you know, why is Adobe sponsoring an iPhone
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:56.320]   developers conference when it doesn't presently run Flash?
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.480]   Maybe I'll come on the 6th.
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.800]   Is there anything going on that Friday?
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:00.800]   There's the end.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.800]   There's the thing.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.800]   We're sponsoring it.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:03.800]   So it's 6th, 7th and 8th.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.640]   I'm working, obviously, but I'll come down from the 6th.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.560]   Next row, the third row of 4 o'clock.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.240]   Very nice clock, by the way, with a stopwatch timer.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.840]   And that's something you can actually use on a cell phone.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.800]   Yeah, because it knows what time it is.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.960]   It thinks I'm in Cupertino, but it knows what time it is.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.440]   I'm sure I'll be able to fix that.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.880]   Calculator, pretty standard.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.760]   It doesn't look like any financial functions or additional functions.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.880]   At least I don't see any menu for that.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:31.880]   It's a traditional calculator.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.280]   But it's for the first time your calculator on your phone
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:38.120]   is actually like a real calculator.
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.480]   The keys were invented.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.000]   No linear algebra, I'm sorry.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.520]   No linear algebra.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.080]   That's kind of a deal breaker for me.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.800]   I don't like having to do my own vector model.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.360]   I would love it if it had a little bit more sophisticated calculator.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.880]   This is the same calculator that came with the Finder 1.0.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.800]   I mean, it would be nice to have a little more.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.720]   It has a note pad, very nice note pad.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.000]   I wish it turned sideways.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.120]   Don't understand that.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.560]   Can't do that.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.240]   That is the weirdest thing to me.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.680]   It's one of those things you've got to ask yourself.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:10.640]   Did they just miss this or is there something that we don't know?
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.560]   Well, you know they're going to do updates.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.520]   There's a lot of room to grow here.
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.280]   All we got to do is plug it in through iTunes
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.280]   like you do your iPod.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:21.440]   And I think job one was to get a solid feature set out the door
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.800]   that was very reliable.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.440]   It's clear that jobs wants, at least in these first few months,
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.280]   this phone to be rock solid.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.520]   And I understand that.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.720]   I think that makes sense.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.440]   People are watching very closely.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.000]   Do you hear they're giving away one to every Apple employee?
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:34.560]   Isn't that nice?
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.120]   $12 million worth of phones.
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.080]   Of course, that's how much you made in Ratatouille
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:38.880]   in the first 10 minutes.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.440]   So I guess it's all right.
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.160]   I'm surprised there's no Ratatouille trailer on here, actually.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.000]   I'm surprised that there wasn't some kind of tie
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.800]   and given that they were both being launched at the same time.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.040]   Then there's a Settings button, very intuitive,
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:52.920]   very straightforward.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.360]   There's an airplane mode right away.
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.960]   Just turn off all the wireless.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.120]   It found my Wi-Fi access point quickly,
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.640]   and I was able to log in.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.120]   You've got wallpaper, you've got sounds,
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.280]   you've got a lot of configuration capabilities.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.200]   It's, I think, very straightforward.
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.960]   Then the bottom row, which is kind of-- by the way,
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.840]   there is now a blank row where four icons could go.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.560]   There's nothing there.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.320]   And I have to think that we're going
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:20.080]   to see Yahoo widgets or something like that.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:20.960]   A limited--
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:24.120]   That's a powerful piece of real estate
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.480]   to take you into a business development discussion to go.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.480]   No.
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.720]   You want row four?
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.440]   If you lived here, you'd be home now.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.920]   No kidding.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.760]   I think you might have hit the nail on the head.
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.280]   That might be exactly what they're up to, Merlin.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.400]   Bottom row is the main functionality--
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.600]   phone, mail, safari, and iPod.
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.800]   The browser's fantastic.
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:46.720]   Just beautiful.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.200]   You like it better than Blazer, huh?
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.080]   And you will too.
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.560]   No, I'm not kidding.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.440]   I think fun do forks in the eyes would be better than Blazer.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.520]   Well, there are browsers.
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:03.000]   The Nokia browser is based on the same basic technology.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.240]   But the key is this pinch.
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.560]   And they're using the finger to move around.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.760]   You really see the value of this when you start playing
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.760]   with the touchscreen, frankly.
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.720]   So here I'm on a site with Flash,
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.760]   and I just get that Flash object, the LEGO piece,
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:18.960]   with a question mark on it.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.120]   It says, can't play it.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.760]   Now, I don't know what it is.
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.280]   The thing that I think is interesting about that
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:27.840]   is that hopefully, I think it's more important
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:32.080]   for Adobe, in fact, that Apple supports Flash than it is Apple.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:32.920]   Do that.
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.400]   Yeah, have that conversation, Alex,
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.720]   because that's your take on that, I thought, is brilliant.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.840]   Well, the thing is that we already
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.960]   have some people that we work with that are called me
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.680]   and said, well, how do we get Flash off our website?
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.880]   They see iPhone users as their main--
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.240]   or as a very large constituency forth.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.040]   And they just want to get the Flash off of it.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.600]   I mean, it's not that important to them.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.080]   And they want to move it off.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.320]   The other thing that we're seeing
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.720]   is if you open up Apple TV, the thing you're looking at
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:05.680]   is all the new YouTube stuff is all H.264.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.200]   In fact, YouTube has said that they're
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:11.040]   going to move all of their library to H.264.
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.280]   And they're not getting rid of the Flash,
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:16.640]   but they're making everything available in H.264 by the fall.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:19.600]   Chances are, if they're going that far down the path,
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:23.040]   when eventually YouTube starts providing HD content, which
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.760]   I think is inevitable, I think we're
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:27.040]   going to see that being H.264.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:30.080]   It's much more efficient than using Flash for larger size
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:30.280]   images.
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:34.680]   But it's not interactive in the way that Flash is, isn't it?
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.800]   Quick time can have some--
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.000]   You could use Flash for a player still,
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.840]   but have the video encoded in H.264.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:40.760]   Absolutely.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:41.440]   Absolutely.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.560]   Couldn't you do that, Alex?
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:42.960]   Yep.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:42.960]   Yep.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.280]   And then don't forget there's Microsoft Silverlight.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.400]   There is competition, and it may well be the issue.
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.840]   The issue you get into, though, is that if Apple only
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.440]   sells a couple hundred thousand phones, it's no big deal.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:58.120]   If Apple sells 15 or 20 million phones over the next year or two,
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.200]   it becomes a real issue if it's not supporting it.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.280]   People are not going to people--
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:04.040]   because this is a very interesting market.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.680]   This is a market of people who spend a lot of money on stuff,
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:09.840]   little stuff that a lot of people don't spend money on.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.520]   That's the kind of market that you want to be in.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.480]   And the question is, will people use that technology
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.200]   if it won't run on that phone?
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.520]   And I think that's an interesting situation.
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:27.160]   There's obviously a lot more to this than meets the eye.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.160]   I mean, they could have put flash in here, right?
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.440]   Well, I think that's the issue.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.840]   I mean, the question is, this is a really--
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.400]   it depends on how Apple plays it, but it
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.720]   seems like a great opportunity for the QuickTime development
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.360]   team to really press forward.
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:39.360]   Which is ironic.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:42.320]   Because they've kind of let that interactivity feature.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.320]   They've kind of let that go.
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:45.880]   They've really seen it as a video playback device.
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.880]   Yeah, but they spent a lot of time--
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.960]   and I can't get into it too much with--
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.320]   but at WWDC, there was a lot of discussions
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.960]   related to adding interactivity to QuickTime
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.480]   and how to do that next and stuff like that.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:01.640]   So I think there's a lot of interest that Apple has.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.960]   I think everyone is clear that interactive video is something
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.800]   that within the next 12 to 18 months
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.360]   is going to be a really big deal.
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.120]   And so I think everyone, including Apple and Microsoft
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.880]   and Adobe are paying attention to it.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:18.040]   I have to say, I mean, it's what we're seeing.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.560]   It's obvious is a baby taking its first steps
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:26.000]   that has huge potential for growth in a lot of different directions.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.680]   It's a pretty impressive baby, too.
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:29.400]   And I don't think it's a coincidence
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.880]   that it was nine months ago today that we first
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.680]   started talking about the iPhone.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:34.960]   Aw, that's just sweet.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.840]   Yeah, go, boogie, go, boogie, boogie.
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:37.560]   It's a boogie.
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.400]   It's a boogie.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.440]   It was just a glinted--
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:42.000]   My baby is born.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.120]   My baby is born.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.640]   I like the iPod functionality.
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:47.880]   I tell you, it's pretty nice.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.760]   People are going to really like this, I think.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.520]   Horizontal cover flow.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.360]   Horizontal cover flow is the bomb.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:54.360]   Yeah.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.280]   Have you had anyone call you while you're watching anything?
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:57.760]   Not yet.
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:58.880]   I've only had one call, Alex.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:34:59.960]   It was you.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.160]   Should I call you so you can see what it does?
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:02.960]   Oh, sure.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.200]   Let me start a movie.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.600]   Should I start a movie?
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.440]   Yeah, because Kendra said--
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.840]   Kendra called Kendra.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.720]   And Kendra said she was sitting there watching a movie,
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.120]   and the movie stopped.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.320]   And the phone call came in, and she
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.520]   was able to answer it and talk to Kendra,
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.760]   and then go back to watching a movie.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.800]   It was pretty seamless.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:21.000]   Yeah, I've got Battlestar Galactica episode.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:21.520]   Got a plan?
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.360]   Three.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.480]   I've got a plan.
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.320]   Yeah, you got my number.
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.240]   Go ahead and call me.
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:28.720]   Let me turn the phone volume up here.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.880]   This has given me chills.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.560]   Battlestar Galactica's study.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:33.400]   It's taking me.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.960]   It's just no good to get my calls from.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:35.480]   You know what?
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.000]   I don't have your--
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.160]   I don't have your phone, dude.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.120]   I don't have your new name.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:41.320]   That's my Nokia ringing over there.
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.920]   I just sent you an email with a new number.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.280]   I just keep on staring at my phone
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.880]   and just keeps on saying activate iPhone.
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:48.880]   Oh, no.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.120]   Connect the iTunes.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:53.160]   I have to say that the screen is so good that the iTunes video
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.480]   of Battlestar Galactica download, it doesn't look so hot.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.120]   I'm going to need to upgrade to--
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:01.160]   I can't remember if I downloaded this before or after the upgrade.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:01.800]   I mean, it's OK.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.960]   And I'll tell you, it's very--
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.480]   you could sit with it in your lap and watch TV.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:06.800]   I mean, you'd watch the video.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.720]   It looks good.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.040]   In fact, it looks good enough that you kind of get drawn into it
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:15.440]   as if it's a real experience, even at arm's length.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.960]   I think I'm going to have to put my iPod with video on eBay
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:18.960]   tomorrow.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:19.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.400]   Absolutely.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:21.920]   Absolutely.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.520]   The only issue is 8 gigs.
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:26.560]   Well, see, it's interesting.
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.840]   I only have about-- I have a 40 gig iPod with video,
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.600]   but I only have about 8 gigs on it.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.600]   So it looks out to be just about a lot of it.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:34.760]   Which service?
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:35.160]   Yeah.
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.160]   Which service?
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:36.920]   What?
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:37.400]   Who?
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.240]   What service did you get?
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.240]   Did you just keep the exact same service?
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.120]   Which of those services did you get?
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.120]   So here's how the plans work.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.160]   Actually, that's a good--
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:45.040]   That's a good discussion.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:49.960]   If you have an existing phone plan-- oh, somebody calling me.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.480]   Hey.
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.720]   I'm just going to listen to the Mirimba for a while.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:56.920]   Let me answer that.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.680]   It stopped the movie and answered the phone.
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:36:59.760]   All right.
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.240]   Let me put you on speakerphone there.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.920]   Oh, hi-hi.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:04.400]   Oh, there.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.320]   I have a very special offer for you tonight.
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.400]   There is the "shoot this person" button.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.400]   Now, is this your home phone?
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.840]   I'm calling you from my trio.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.400]   So it might sound really old school.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.440]   So I'm going to press contacts.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.400]   And let's see if I can add this now.
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.440]   I guess I don't know.
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.880]   See, I have to learn all these little things.
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.040]   There's some buttons on here, but I don't know.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.200]   I could add it all.
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:28.880]   Go ahead and hang up.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.760]   Maybe it'll give you-- it'll prompt you like on the trio.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.200]   Oh, that it said, would you like to add this person?
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:34.880]   No.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:36.960]   For some reason, it went to voicemail.
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.560]   I have a lot to learn, obviously.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.360]   Well, you know, this is--
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.800]   obviously, Leo, there's going to be some changes in habit
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.960]   you're going to have to make.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.600]   From now on, whenever you hang up a call,
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.600]   you'll have to go to voicemail.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:46.440]   Flick it.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.120]   I think you'll find in time that this will--
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.120]   behavior that's very natural.
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.280]   Better way to go.
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.320]   Give it a couple days.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.600]   You know, it came pretty well charged.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:55.920]   So I only charge it for a little bit,
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.080]   but I better charge it some more, because I'm
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.400]   going to want to play with this all night long.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:03.880]   I really like to try to find those people
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:06.240]   we interviewed yesterday at the--
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:10.000]   Merlin and I went interviewing for MacBrigge yesterday.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:10.960]   Interviewing for MacBrigge?
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.360]   First guy at the front?
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.200]   Alec, the way it turned out--
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.240]   I mean, I was being asinine as usual.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.640]   But the first guy in line, I saw him in lots of interviews.
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.120]   I heard him on the radio this morning.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:22.440]   You know, the people in line two or three days earlier
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.000]   were just publicity slots.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.200]   That's all.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.200]   They agreed--
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:26.720]   Well, you know the--
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.120]   Are you going to name names?
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.600]   We know who I'm talking about.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.040]   Well, the funny thing is the guy that
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.760]   was in the front of the line in San Francisco, you know,
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.320]   he said, oh, we got here at 10 o'clock.
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:38.560]   We was a big word, because I saw the other guy.
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.000]   You know, the other guy that's in the video.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.600]   I saw him from there, and there wasn't anyone with him.
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:43.920]   And he was getting all set up.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.200]   He was like the guy who worked for the guy, and he set up.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.400]   And he was the guy that wouldn't talk to us.
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.920]   I really-- I have to say, the experience--
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:52.680]   and Dane was with me.
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:55.800]   The experience of line sitting was really kind of interesting.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.480]   I actually didn't come down in San Francisco,
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.600]   go to Palo Alto, because I had some funny feelings
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:01.960]   about that.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:04.160]   I thought, if you're a journalist,
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:07.360]   it kind of starts to cross the line when you start acting
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.360]   like a fanboy in public.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.360]   I tried to do that only on Mac break weekly.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.960]   No, I think that I was reluctant to be, oh, yeah,
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:15.600]   I'm so excited.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:16.760]   I got to get my iPhone.
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.600]   I had a wait in line, because I had to have the iPhone
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:19.640]   for tomorrow's radio show.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.600]   But I didn't want to do it too publicly.
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.560]   So you needed it for professional reasons?
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.560]   I did.
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:28.040]   You know, the honor of the mayor of Philadelphia,
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:30.160]   the mayor of Philadelphia, did you see him queued up?
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:31.160]   Kind of made a mistake, though.
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.180]   Did you see that guy in a Mohawk walks up, said,
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:34.600]   Mr. Mayor, what are you doing sitting here
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.920]   when there's 200 murders this year in Philadelphia already?
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:38.400]   Ouch.
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:43.040]   And the mayor got up, left the line, and his aides stayed there.
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.480]   You're not going to fix that with a pinch.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.840]   However, I think he probably got his phone.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.680]   The irony is, the line sitters, I think many of us
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:55.200]   knew, we could go tomorrow and get a phone.
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.640]   We could walk in, no line, and get a phone.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.520]   That wasn't the point.
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.000]   There was a sense of community there
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.040]   that was very interesting.
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:05.000]   I sat next to a kid, a sophomore in high school
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.200]   was going into sophomore high school,
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.720]   so I was 15 or 16 years old.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.960]   He went to the cash machine, took his life savings out.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.040]   He had it in cash.
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:15.280]   I saw him do it to get this iPhone.
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.600]   And he was really excited about it.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:22.160]   And it was a neat thing to kind of watch this kid get this.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.240]   His friends were there, his buddies were there with him.
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.760]   Actually, one of his buddies made 20 bucks.
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.800]   Another guy came up, said, can I have your place in line?
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:28.760]   And he sold it.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.280]   So it actually worked out quite well for him.
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.080]   There was a woman sitting to my left
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.920]   who was just a self-confessed gadgeteer.
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:37.760]   I mean, just a gadget haul.
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.160]   She said, I haven't bought anything since January.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:43.360]   I'm saving myself for the iPhone.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.840]   She called her husband and said, honey,
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:47.440]   you've got it.
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.240]   She just found out, oh, I have to download 7-3.
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:51.640]   She called her husband and said, get the latest iTunes right now.
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.040]   He said, why don't I understand how to do that?
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:54.080]   He was a rancher.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:57.400]   She walked him through downloading iTunes 7-3.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:59.200]   He calls back, says, it says to restart.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.760]   What should I-- she said, restart, restart.
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:03.000]   She wants to walk in the door and plug that thing in
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.640]   and have it be-- she doesn't have time to download iTunes.
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.040]   She's the alpha geek.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:07.680]   She was great.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.240]   It was really fun.
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.280]   There was a guy from Google--
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:12.560]   We need to mention that, Leo, that you--
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:15.440]   many people are unaware that you do need to download
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:17.400]   iTunes 7.3 for this to work.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.560]   And 10-4-10.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.520]   Oh, really?
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.320]   Yeah, yeah, I got-- I got 7-3.
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.040]   And then I got it this morning thinking, well,
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.000]   I'll be ahead of the game.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:26.840]   So when I get my iPhone.
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.440]   And then, of course, I got here.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.320]   And it said, no, no, no, you need 10-4-10 as well.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.640]   So you need both of those.
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.800]   You activate through it.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.280]   In fact, you can just walk into the store
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:37.520]   by a phone, pretty much.
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.680]   Did they ask for any information at the Apple store?
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:43.160]   They did it at the AT&T store.
[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:46.680]   They wanted to know a little credit information.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.120]   So it's easier at the Apple store.
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.440]   That's why they were able to handle people so fast.
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.640]   Well, it's easier to walk out with it.
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:52.680]   I'm still waiting for my activation.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.200]   Well, but then that's right.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.760]   You have to go through a credit check and stuff.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.440]   And that was actually much faster for me.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.640]   It didn't take any time.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.080]   So I'm getting some email, Leo, here.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:05.920]   Sorry, breaking news that from various AT&T stores
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:08.320]   in New York City that they were allotted 60,
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.400]   and it's each and all sold out.
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.920]   That's what we heard from our store.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:17.000]   They had 15 4GB and 45 8GB.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.560]   And they did, in fact, sell out.
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.280]   So it's the Apple stores that had hundreds
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.160]   and did not sell out.
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.400]   So I mean, I'm guessing that if Apple still has any
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:28.040]   at the San Francisco store, they had at least 1,000.
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:31.680]   Because they're going to move 1,000 easily.
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.840]   Well, the line went clear around the block,
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:35.800]   almost doubling on itself.
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.240]   If you want one of these, you probably
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.600]   should go to the Apple store 9 in the morning tomorrow,
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:43.040]   because according to Denise Howell, who was sitting at home
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:46.240]   to order, the Apple store came online at 6 PM,
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:48.280]   and her order was processed 11 minutes later,
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:51.480]   shipping estimated two to four weeks from today.
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.320]   Ouch.
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:56.120]   Plus, she installed 7.3, and it had all sorts of trouble.
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:57.320]   Now, I didn't have any trouble.
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:01.000]   But she said, iTunes 7.3 will not save my iTunes library
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:01.400]   anymore.
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.520]   She had a downgrade.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.440]   The Apple Care Support Guy I worked with said
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.720]   he was seeing this problem with 7.3 reported all
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:09.720]   over the message boards today.
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:13.040]   So maybe there's some issues with 7.3.
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:15.680]   If you don't have an iPhone or you don't plan to get one
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:19.400]   right away, you might want to wait.
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:22.920]   I do think that if you're not dying to have an iPhone waiting
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:25.120]   until the middle or end of next week,
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:26.200]   would probably be a good idea.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.560]   I think a lot of the stuff that we're having right now
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:29.880]   with the activation and everything else
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:33.040]   is just coming from this huge horde of people
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.480]   gucking up the system.
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:37.760]   Well, remember when the iTunes went to the high res songs
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.280]   and it took forever for it to check your library?
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.920]   It's one of those kinds of things.
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.680]   The other thing that I'm a little disappointed with the
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:48.600]   headphone jack is highly recessed and will not work
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.560]   without an adapter for most of my headphones.
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:52.040]   Really?
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.480]   So my headphones won't work.
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.360]   None of them, the ER6's, the edimodix, the--
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:58.860]   Really?
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:43:59.760]   The ultimate ears.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:01.800]   You have to get-- now, Apple sells an adapter, but you might
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:05.040]   want to consider getting that adapter.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:05.880]   It's too recessed.
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.920]   You can't get the thing down far enough.
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.400]   What is up with that?
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:11.360]   That does seem like a dumb idea.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.040]   Very upsetting.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.200]   Certainly.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.800]   Is there an adapter for that?
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:18.200]   Apple sells one apparently, but it doesn't show up.
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.000]   You know what?
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:19.600]   You know what?
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.040]   An adapter I'm going to use, it's going to be like a knife.
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:24.480]   I'm just going to cut some of that rubber around my--
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:25.640]   It ain't--
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:26.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:26.360]   Right.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:27.440]   That's actually a good idea.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.840]   You could trim the phones down.
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:29.240]   Yeah, you're--
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.480]   Just trim that little rubber around the phones.
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:32.600]   It'll work just fine.
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:32.960]   I'm looking--
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.320]   Yeah, I'm not taking a knife to my iPhone, Alex.
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:35.760]   Sorry.
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:36.120]   There's a--
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.320]   No, it's not to the iPhone.
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:38.840]   It's to the headphones.
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:39.360]   OK.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.600]   You might want to use your Apple headphones, because you know,
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.240]   they're not--
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.440]   it's a three-ring jack.
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:46.760]   That's probably one of the reasons that it doesn't fit,
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:50.680]   so that you can pick up phone calls by squeezing your headphones.
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:51.200]   That's true.
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:52.920]   I just wish-- see, now the problem is
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.480]   you're going to have to talk to ultimate ears or someone
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.040]   like that to make ones that are like that.
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.040]   But--
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.720]   Well, why change the standard, you know?
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.760]   Well, I do like the squeeze thing.
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:05.560]   And so my question is, is somebody
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:09.160]   going to come out with a really nice music quality headphone
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.680]   that still does the squeeze thing?
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:11.180]   Right.
[00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:12.640]   Because I have to admit, now that I
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:14.160]   have these ones that go way into my ears,
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.960]   I have the ultimate ear ones, and then I also have the sure ones.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:20.440]   And one of the most of those, I can't even imagine going back
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:21.600]   to these crappy little headphones.
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.520]   It makes a big difference.
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.000]   Yeah, I don't want to worry the Apple earbuds,
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.240]   but I guess I'm going to have to.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.440]   They're also uncomfortable.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.520]   Yeah, it was.
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:31.480]   And they don't come--
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.600]   Wait a minute, where's my--
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.160]   they don't-- oh, man, they don't come
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.680]   with those little fuzzy muff things that make it--
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:38.080]   that's the only thing that keep them in my ear.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:39.960]   Oh, I can't have the fuzzy muff.
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:41.600]   You don't like fuzzy muff things?
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:42.560]   No, no, I don't like them.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:44.080]   They're just too big, and then it hurts my ears.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:44.560]   These are rubber ones.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.120]   Maybe I have very sensitive ears.
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:47.320]   Yeah, I know you do.
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.400]   Except I have these.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.720]   They have those sure ones that go like--
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:51.240]   I have them, maybe.
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.720]   Almost all the way into my--
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:54.320]   Very sensitive ears.
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:57.000]   They're very sensitive.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.720]   Well, you know, and I noticed Alex
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:02.040]   spends a lot of time putting headphones in and out of his ears.
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:02.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:06.040]   He does, as do we all.
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.800]   Yeah, but it takes him a little longer.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.720]   Oh, you know.
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.280]   Are you saying he enjoys it more?
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:12.840]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.600]   I get little mini Apple stickers in here.
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:15.320]   That's good.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:15.760]   They haven't changed--
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.080]   It's stickers with anything you buy from them.
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:18.880]   I haven't changed that, but they're little ones.
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:19.680]   Not that little one.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:20.200]   Really?
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.280]   They're not-- they used to get--
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.640]   you'd get a big one and a little one.
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:25.960]   Now it's just two little ones.
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.560]   Because it has to fit in this nice box.
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.120]   Don't you like that box?
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:29.720]   Box was nice.
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.240]   The box is cool, and a lot of people
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:33.680]   won't even notice that the box has the cloth thing
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:34.720]   and all that stuff in it.
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:35.560]   No, you have to--
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:35.960]   There's a--
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.400]   --work your way through it to finalize it.
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:38.480]   The box is really heavy.
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.880]   Did you notice the box is like--
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:40.880]   It is.
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:41.840]   It's like--
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:42.240]   It's really nice.
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:43.280]   OK, I think we've got to wrap this up,
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.520]   because we've pretty much now--
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:44.680]   You guys are--
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.040]   We're talking about the box.
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:46.560]   We're in--
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:50.120]   Huge, huge nerds.
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:51.040]   You had to do it.
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:51.760]   We're excited.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:53.160]   And I don't have anything else to be excited about.
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.560]   I'm still beneath my freaking phone.
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:59.200]   I'm waiting at the rising fault.
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.280]   Has this been painful for you, Merlin?
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.840]   No, no, I am enjoying this.
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:04.920]   I think I have been--
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:06.360]   either-- this is probably my own fault,
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.600]   but I've been slightly mischaracterized.
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.800]   I have nothing against the iPhone as a thing,
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:14.200]   although I have said I hate the iPhone and want it to die.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:16.840]   You mean it was the hype you hated, not the phone itself?
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:17.160]   What?
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:18.680]   The word hype even.
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:25.560]   It's the slathering, self-reproducing lust for scarcity
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.240]   that seems so ridiculous to me.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:29.720]   I'm seeing my friends now on Flickr who literally went
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:32.040]   to get a drink and then just walked in and bought an iPhone.
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:34.600]   I've talked a number of people who did that.
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.920]   And it's just so funny.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.360]   It's like, well, why do you have to have it today?
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:40.040]   What is it about that first day?
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:42.040]   And I do understand there's things that I've wanted,
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.400]   but it's a beautiful, beautiful device.
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:47.280]   I imagine I will buy one sometime.
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:50.080]   But there's some juju here.
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:52.160]   Yeah, there's something-- I got to say,
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:55.800]   this is-- I thought we saw it with the iPod.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:57.160]   I thought we'd seen it with other things.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:01.160]   But this has just been handled so masterfully.
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:04.360]   And I am certainly one of the greatest
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:07.200]   of the apple-flying monkeys out there spreading the word.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:10.480]   But it's been really amazing to watch how people will take
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.360]   just the tiniest little bit of non-information
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.720]   and make some even more excited.
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:19.120]   I was stunned to watch people trope into this store
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:21.800]   and lay down their credit cards and spend $600 or $700
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:24.080]   without blinking an eye.
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:26.560]   Now we're like 13-year-old kids.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:27.920]   There was no question.
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:30.080]   It was like, yes, whatever, of course.
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:32.080]   Nobody bought the 4GIG.
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.640]   Everybody bought the 4GIG.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:36.560]   I stood in line when I heard that Merlin was going
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:39.760]   to be in Time magazine to get the first copy.
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.600]   Was that right?
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.760]   Merlin's in Time magazine?
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.840]   Merlin is in Time magazine.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.920]   So anyway, I'm almost certainly going to buy one.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:46.800]   What did you do?
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:47.400]   What did you do?
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:47.800]   Wait a minute.
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:48.280]   Wait a minute.
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:49.080]   Wait a minute.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:51.560]   OK, listen, I had to stab a guy.
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:52.680]   I had to cut him.
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.960]   And he was giving my wife the stink guy.
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:57.240]   He had a comment.
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:58.680]   I put it between a couple ribs.
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:48:59.760]   I showed him a little bit of lesson.
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:01.400]   Now he knows how to respect a lady.
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:04.160]   Congratulations, Merlin.
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.120]   I am almost definitely going to get one.
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:08.000]   Because you saw me at Mackerel.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.240]   I was very excited about this.
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:12.400]   This looks to me like the distillation
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:15.680]   of a lot of what Apple has learned as a company about a lot
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:17.120]   of what makes Apple interesting as a--
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:17.560]   I would review.
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:20.080]   And I think it's a new direction for Apple
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:21.480]   and for handheld devices.
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:23.280]   I think that's what's really significant.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:27.800]   But I also think that-- oh, look, I'm getting a text message.
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:28.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.000]   I got distracted by a beautiful object.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.160]   And I guessed.
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:34.800]   I also think-- and I'm giving this advice to most people.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:35.600]   You're wise.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.800]   There's no reason you have to have the first one.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.640]   There's plenty of time to think about it.
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:41.200]   You can get it next week, the week after.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.880]   There's not going to be a short supply.
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:45.640]   And I think there'll be a second generation and third and fourth.
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:46.840]   What's that thing?
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:47.680]   It's my precious--
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:49.440]   They call it the six month rule.
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.080]   Precious.
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:53.240]   They call it the six month rule, that idea
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:56.840]   that if you can wait six months after the release--
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:57.840]   I'm going to mangle this.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:59.760]   But it's a long line of saying if you can wait six months
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:01.400]   after the first release of our product,
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:02.200]   try and wait.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.000]   Because almost certainly, the product
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.440]   will improve and the prices will go down.
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:08.440]   At the same time, if you could benefit immediately
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:10.080]   from having that--
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:12.720]   if you've got a broken phone or whatever in this case,
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:14.160]   go ahead and give it a shot.
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.440]   But it's just-- it's been really interesting as somebody
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:19.720]   who's not as emotionally engaged as some other folks.
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:21.840]   It's been fun and interesting to watch.
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:23.000]   A little frustrating sometimes.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.440]   But I really think they've done a hell of a job with this.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:29.600]   Down to giving people sunscreen while they're waiting in line.
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:32.040]   It's just-- they're really-- they're getting it.
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:34.040]   They really get how to treat their customers.
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:34.520]   And I think--
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:36.600]   That's the stuff that I really was impressed with,
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:40.640]   and right there, sunscreen, water, Starbucks.
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:42.400]   Lots of guys coming out, giving information.
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:43.560]   And so what are they doing this, though?
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:46.200]   They're doing this with-- and just to extend the thought
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:49.040]   just a tiny bit, like what is it that we all know about things
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:49.920]   like phone companies?
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:52.440]   Phone companies-- they don't need your business.
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:53.720]   They don't care.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:56.720]   The way that I've been treated by phone companies
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:00.080]   is like-- I'm not even a number.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:01.360]   You get treated so badly.
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:04.400]   And now they go and they make an entry into this area.
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:06.400]   And understandably, they're not the phone company.
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:08.760]   But you take something that's been completely commodified,
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:11.000]   turned into the most kind of generic--
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.280]   it's like buying toilet paper to buy a phone nowadays.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.480]   And they find some way to add that zest and personality
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:15.840]   to that.
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:18.120]   And I think that's really remarkable.
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:20.320]   I just have to say that walking into a Verizon store
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:22.760]   is just one of the worst experiences
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:25.640]   that I have on any time that it actually happens.
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:27.480]   And I'm a Verizon customer.
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:28.680]   Every time I walk in, I go--
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:29.560]   I have to say experience a sprint.
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:31.160]   Every time I go to sprint, I feel like I'm asking--
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:32.080]   Everybody does.
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:34.200]   And singular AT&T is no better, though.
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:36.800]   I mean, I have to say that this same store that I just spent
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:39.400]   six hours in front of waiting to get into,
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:42.080]   I had rejected out of hand my last experience with them
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:45.800]   was so god-awful I actually canceled my singular account.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.440]   It was interesting the device itself
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:48.720]   and what you felt--
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:49.520]   Well, I don't--
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:49.920]   Well, I don't--
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.760]   The question is, is this going to change the company?
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:53.640]   Or is this a one-time-- I mean, look,
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:55.640]   the cold stone ice cream place next door
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:56.640]   brought us ice cream.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:00.840]   I mean, it doesn't mean that AT&T is a newly invented store.
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:03.200]   But I think the question is, is it two years into this
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:06.200]   if AT&T isn't taking care of the customers,
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.000]   how far will Apple take this?
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.120]   I mean, will they just say, well,
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:13.400]   we could become our own provider, which I think they could.
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:14.280]   I don't know how--
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:16.160]   You know, USA Today says they have a five-year deal.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:18.280]   You said even longer, I think, Scott Bourne.
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.320]   No, no, it--
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:19.880]   It's five years.
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:20.600]   I can confirm five.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:21.480]   It is five.
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:24.120]   I don't know how easy it is to get out of that.
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:25.320]   You know how easy it is?
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:27.920]   You just have the money that Apple has to throw at lawyers
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.040]   and say, I want to quit.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.440]   Any contract can be broken.
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:33.120]   But here's the thing.
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:37.440]   One of the things I found trying to think more sophisticated
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.600]   about this, like a Merlin man might,
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:44.360]   I'm trying to say, OK, now why is it there 400, 500 people
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:46.960]   in front of the Apple store and a couple of dozen
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:49.560]   in front of the AT&T store a block away?
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:50.560]   Good point.
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:53.040]   It says a whole lot about how the customers
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:55.680]   feel about their relationship with Apple
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:59.280]   and how trepidation they might be about starting one with AT&T.
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:02.800]   And everyone knows it's heard me talk about this from day one.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:04.560]   I've said, that's what's made me nervous,
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:06.600]   what's going to happen with AT&T.
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:08.000]   And the jury's out.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.520]   I will say that I was impressed by the pricing plans.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:13.280]   They could have done some gouging, $20.
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:14.440]   Oh, yeah, we started this.
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:15.480]   We didn't finish it.
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:17.920]   $20 data plan for existing customers
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:19.680]   is exactly what they already charge.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.160]   And if ever you were going to gouge,
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:22.440]   now would be the time to do it.
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:23.160]   It's unlimited.
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:24.640]   So if you have an existing plan,
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.600]   you continue with your existing plan,
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:31.120]   an unlimited iPhone data and 200 SMS messages for $20.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:32.680]   And you're getting a new kind of data
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:35.320]   you couldn't get before in the visual voicemail.
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:36.200]   Yeah.
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:39.320]   I had to say, my plan actually went down.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:40.320]   Wow.
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:44.560]   Yeah, $45 a month.
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:46.480]   Yeah, and we did an analysis of it, Leo.
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:49.760]   We looked at all the similarly situated phones
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:51.680]   in the same class.
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:55.400]   And when you look at total cost to operate over two years,
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:58.200]   they're in the ballpark of about $200 a month.
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:00.120]   Give or take 10 here or there.
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:02.560]   My opinion is that people who are buying this class of phone
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:05.760]   aren't going to make a decision on $8 or $10 or $12 a month.
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:07.560]   So they're all about the same.
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:10.400]   The iPhone is a little more expensive upfront to acquire,
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:13.840]   but they really all come in at around 200 bucks a month.
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:18.200]   And so I think the price is a little misunderstood
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:19.240]   in that regard.
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:21.720]   The plans though, they could have really gouged us.
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:25.960]   So I'm hoping that this is a first step on their part
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:29.280]   to say, yeah, we really want to be more like Apple.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:30.400]   Right.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.080]   Well, we'll see.
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:33.840]   I think that there's no reason for AT&T
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:35.480]   not to be jumping for joy today.
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.840]   They had the biggest day they've ever had.
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:38.880]   There's no doubt about that.
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.640]   And they have a lot of new customers.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.440]   Apple too is probably celebrating a pretty big payday.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:46.320]   If not from sales of iPhones from AT&T,
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:50.080]   we must have paid them a pretty penny for this five-year deal.
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:52.480]   And I think for those of us who have played with it now--
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:54.000]   and I did it early yet, and I'm certainly
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.320]   going to give you a more thorough review in the weeks to come.
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:58.920]   But it's pretty clear that this is a device that
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:02.280]   is more important than just another new phone.
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:04.160]   Apple's done a good job.
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:05.200]   We're going to wrap this up.
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:07.760]   I will thank you all for being here.
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:09.800]   On a late night, on a Friday, I know
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:12.040]   you're dying to go activate your phone.
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:13.520]   So go do it.
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:15.200]   Except for you, Merlin, man.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.160]   Back to work.
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:18.360]   I'm going to watch the wire.

[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:23.520]   Scott Born is, I'm sure, ready to crank out
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:24.880]   another Apple phone show now.
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:28.720]   That now is when it gets serious at applephoneshow.com.

[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:31.800]   Coming up tomorrow.
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:34.440]   Yeah, it'll be all about the actual phone now.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.560]   Yeah, now it changes.
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:37.520]   Now there's a lot to say.
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:39.680]   Yeah, I'll be subscribing on the phone.
