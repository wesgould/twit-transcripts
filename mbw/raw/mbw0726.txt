[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   Time for Mac Break Weekly Andes here. Renee is here. Lori Gills here. We have lots to talk about.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.360]   Well, of course, the iMac. Renee has his review. The new iMac.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.080]   Oh, I won't spoil it for him.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:19.440]   We're also going to talk about Apple Silicon, whether there will be anything this year or not. There seems to be some confusion.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.000]   TikTok is a good thing banning it. Is it a bad thing?
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.440]   And we're also going to talk about WatchOS 7. The new beta is here. Renee has it.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.400]   He'll tell you why you shouldn't get it. And then it's time to celebrate the birthday
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.680]   of one of our heroes. We'll do it with the song. It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.880]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we get together with our friends and family,
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.480]   basically, to talk about the Macintosh computer in the world of Apple. A $2 trillion company.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.400]   Renee Richie's here. He was here on Sunday. It's nice to see you again, Renee, from Renee Richie.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.040]   That was so much fun. It's fun to be back with the team too.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.160]   The nice thing about doing Twitch, he was on the Sunday show, is you could talk about things
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.000]   besides Apple. Although there was lots of Apple stuff to talk about.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.360]   Andy Nacos is also here from WGBH Boston Public Radio. Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.800]   Hello. Good to see you again. Good to see you. And of course, from imore.com, where she
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:28.240]   reigns as managing editor, it's Lori Gill. Hello, Lori. Hi-oh. Hi-oh. Hi-oh.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:35.280]   Okay, that's just a rumor, right? That they're not going to do a Silicon,
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.800]   Apple Silicon Mac until next year. That's just a rumor. Nobody knows.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.360]   They said they're doing one this year. They said they're doing one.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.200]   Yeah. Tim Cook said that there will be an Apple Silicon Mac system released this year.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.320]   Okay. I just wanted to ask.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:55.280]   Though it's in defense of the rumor, though, we don't. I mean, there's always going to be
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.800]   something that could come up that could postpone the launch of something. So even though they did
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.800]   say they would have something at the end of the year, the one thing that we've learned about 2020
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:12.960]   is nothing is what it seems. I'll be so sad. Yeah. I'll be put to be fair. This was an announcement
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.720]   that Apple made during the shank of 2020. So at this point, they should have a good idea of
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.120]   whether something's going to ship on time or not. So I would tend to believe that it's going to happen.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.560]   Yeah. I didn't say which one. The only reason I say that is because I have pledged to myself,
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.000]   since no one else is asking, "Self, don't buy any computers until Apple Silicon comes out,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.080]   because then I'm going to want to go crazy."
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.800]   Yeah. Don't even look at the new I'm actually. I just don't turn it.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.080]   You love it, don't you? I saw your review on YouTube. You think it's great.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:51.120]   So for what I do, the combination of the nano texture display, which I only got to try it out,
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.000]   last WWDC during the event. I haven't lived with one because I just can't spend
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.800]   that much money on a display. But this iMac with it is latest generation Intel, which is the same
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.760]   as last generation Intel, but it's got way better AMD graphics, a way better camera with a back
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.880]   illuminated sensor and an A11 series or an A10 series image signal processor. Camera looks great,
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.960]   but that nano texture display, that big on top of P3 color gamut and retina like 5k,
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.920]   it is the best screen I have ever seen. And I have an LG OLED across the room from it.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.520]   But how do you not touch it alone? I know, right?
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.480]   No, you're telling me to. I'm not just like, "How does it feel?" I mean, I will never know.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.120]   I want to touch one so bad. What would happen? You're not even allowed to clean it normally.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.440]   You have to use a special. Oh, you are. I asked. They said like, they give you a cloth with it,
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.080]   and you can use a microfiber cloth. They're just saying that it will degrade over time if
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.720]   you're not careful with it. So use a microfiber cloth. You can use water. You can even use display
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.240]   cleaner, but be gentle with it. Act like it costs an extra 500 bucks, as I think the takeaway message.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:08.320]   Will there be issues with Apple Silicon, though? Maybe I should just go out and get that new iMac.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.280]   Oh, you're just trying to bring it to yourself to get it now.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.440]   Well, I do. There's two things that are unique. I mean, besides the fact you get 10th generation
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.160]   Intel Silicon, which I've had. It's the same as mine. I've had. Who cares? Same as mine. Just
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:29.280]   get two X reports if you want them. I've been there, done that. Got the t-shirt. But the better camera,
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.720]   right? That's a, and you said it's a lot better. Like it's not just 1080p. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.720]   1080p with Apple's image signal processor. And they make one of the best image signal processors
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:47.200]   in the business. Is that going through the T2? Yeah. So the T2 is essentially an Apple A10,
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.960]   the same chip that was in the iPhone 7, and they're doing everything. They're doing wipe
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.400]   balancing. They're doing facial face detection for the focus. And also they move the illumination
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.160]   behind the sensor. So produces a much cleaner image. Okay. So that's one selling point. And then
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.960]   there's this matte screen, which is a $500 upsell just to get the the the. Well, they got to have a
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.920]   little robot go in there and texture it. And Natalie Leo doesn't texture itself. Well, that's
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.360]   an interesting question. How do they make the nano text? Really? I believe it's a little
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:26.480]   mysen to nibble at it. I know it's keep her out. What is the it works really well? Because like
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.360]   the traditional way of doing a mat is a layer on top of the screen. And it does diffuse light,
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.600]   but it does at the expense of contrast. And what this is doing is making an irregular surface.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.720]   So the light is not bouncing off clean, sort of scattering it instead of diffusing it. So you get,
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.000]   you will see light on it, but it'll be like this just lighter diffuse area instead of like these
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.280]   big like you will never see your window on the screen. Yeah, this is a lot of data.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:59.680]   Deeter Deeter with his original iMac 720p camera compared to the new iMac.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.080]   It's not worth buying a whole new computer just for that, right? You could just.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.120]   Well, this camera I have here is 200 bucks is the 4k Logitech Brio. And I look like I don't look
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.480]   like me on it. But on the iMac camera, I have my skin tone and it handles the colors way better.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.520]   It exposes way better. So I'm way happier with that than I am with this
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.560]   tuner or Logitech right now. Here's an image of this screen with glare and then on the left
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:31.120]   the nano texture and that's that's just that's exactly it. That makes me want to just buy a new iMac
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:37.440]   just for that screen. I know that's a ridiculous thing to do, but god, it's gorgeous. Look at that.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.400]   I want to look at my book. Sorry Andy, go ahead. Apple's looking at my book.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:46.560]   I mean, I interrupt. No, I was just going to button what you said by saying that it's essentially
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.600]   the essentially the camera has gone from totally sucks to good. Yeah, I know.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:57.200]   Yeah, I know. Realize that one of the hallmarks of Apple has always been absolutely sucky webcams.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.520]   So it's nice. It's nice that they realize that the people actually use these damn things.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.440]   Not just a whole they can just drill into the face of it and just keep put nothing behind it.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:11.840]   And I'm like such an interesting point there too because Apple has always really prided itself
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:17.520]   on the good how good its camera is on the iPhone and it and it's actually one of the early computers
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:24.720]   to have a built-in webcam. Yet they never really did much with it. It's been kind of a crappy webcam
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.920]   all along. As I remember the even the eyesight, the stand alone camera. Yep.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:37.680]   Wasn't that good? Well, kind of time. The time is great. Right. But yeah, I mean,
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.240]   mostly the engineering has been behind. How small can we make a potato? Can we slip up
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:48.080]   behind that bezel? Yeah. So I have the iMac Pro, which does have a 1080p camera and has a better
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:55.440]   camera. And I've used it. It's not great. The best thing. Hello. The best thing is if you can get
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:03.600]   something like the Elgato capture dongle and use a good camera. If you're Alex Lindsay.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.800]   Well, no, I'm going to do that. That's what I'm doing. I'm using the A7, my Sony A7
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:15.200]   with the Elgato. Well, actually I don't have the problem unfortunately is Elgato has been
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.760]   wildly sold out of the cam like I think it's now bad. That's what I'm using. I can use an ATEM.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:24.080]   I have a power cable so I can't use it for Mac break because that battery doesn't last long off.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.520]   You have an ATEM, but you're running it via the battery? No, my Canon EOS R.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.920]   That makes much sense. I never got a power cord for it. That's so I can't run the camera long.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.160]   It is annoying. There's a few things you have to do. You have to get it. I bought a dummy battery
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.080]   that goes in the battery slot. Yes. And then as a power line coming out of it, you could plug that
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.960]   in the wall. You also have to be able to get clean HDMI out, which I'm able to do on the Sony's.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:52.320]   Your Canon, you can do that with as well. Your Canon has the ability and firmware to do it over
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.960]   USB, but I don't think that's a good choice. It didn't work until recently with the Mac.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.680]   A lot of those are getting those updates though, which is nice. That's one of the big F
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:08.560]   capital F finalies. My Olympus finally got that upgrade just two months ago and it's a five-year-old
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:14.080]   camera. If you have an older camera, by all means, check for a new firmware. USB is never going to
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.920]   be quite as good though as the HDMI out on a lot of cameras. And of course, don't forget it.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.920]   The new USB's probably got to bandwidth for it, doesn't it? I mean, like the new one has
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:27.120]   a PlayPort One, but does your camera have even USB 3? Oh, no, probably not.
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.600]   You're right. Yeah. The other one comes on the other.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:35.520]   Problem is the camera. And so the ideally, you'd be able to get a clean HDMI out of it. You can
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:43.920]   get that little power adapter. The Cam Link, I'm told, is now back on sale from Elgato. So that's
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:51.280]   the easiest choice. You see it has HDMI in. You'd also have to get a mini or micro HDMI to full-size
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:56.800]   HDMI cable. Plug that into the USB port. But I have also found on Amazon, in fact,
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.560]   I somebody got one. Was it Micah or somebody got one? We're going to try a bunch of them.
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.240]   If you look for the Cam Link, you'll see there's a bunch of
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:12.160]   knockoffs, Chinese knockoffs, that are a lot less expensive. The Cam Link's expense over 100 bucks.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.480]   So I'm going to try one of these cheap Chinese knockoffs and see.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.400]   They just announced a new item last week to the A-dom Live or something. I forget what the game is.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:26.000]   They announced brand new A-dom as well. This is the Blackmagic Design hardware switchers.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.960]   And I have the Mini, which is 300 bucks. There's the A-10 Mini Pro, which is 600 bucks. How much is
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:38.400]   the Live? It's got to be more, right? I can never tell because they're smaller or bigger and more
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:43.360]   expensive or less expensive. I get pretty confused. I see a little handle there, new 12K cameras.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:48.000]   Because that's a thing. Yeah. Let's see. The A-10. I'm looking at B-N-H.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.600]   Oh no, it's only 300 bucks. So maybe this is the one I have then. What's nice about this is it has
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:01.600]   software. You can do a green screen. So and this has the Cam Link equivalent inside. You put HDMI
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.920]   into it from the camera. And it's got a good speed. And Alex, Lindsey, you can hear. Yeah.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.440]   Just be aware, I believe the less expensive version is capped at 1080.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:17.760]   It'll take 4K out inputs, but it'll only give 1080 output. That's one advantage of the new
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:25.600]   A-10 Mini Pro, which is, I guess it'll do, will it? I don't know. I'm so confused. And then there's
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:31.760]   Blackmagic is kind of cool. Yeah, it is 4K compatible, but I can't see how it puts it.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.600]   They're like actualized nerds. It's like a bunch of nerds have the ability to make a company and
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.320]   put out what they wanted to. That's exactly what Blackmagic feels like.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:44.560]   You can record and I do record using one of Blackmagic's recorders. So I imagine if you could take 4K
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.920]   in, you could record 4K. You might need that instead of using the USB port to your computer.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:55.440]   Because all of these end up looking like a USB webcam. That's how they work. They take HDMI
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:00.320]   and turn them into a webcam. They could also do this with your phone, your iPhone. There's good
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:07.840]   software out there that will turn your iPhone into a webcam. I've never tried that for the
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:15.520]   reason. I think the problem is that some of the streaming services like Zoom and Hangouts
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:21.360]   and things like that, they don't play friendly with it. So the Epic Cam, which is, I think the one
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:31.040]   Micah might use, EPOC Cam works with Zoom, Teams and Skype. These virtual
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.680]   cams have always had a little bit of an issue. So that's on the App Store. Good news is it's free.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:44.080]   So Epic Cam EPOC. There's an iPhone and there's iPad version. Now that the new iPad Pro has a
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:49.600]   decent camera, maybe that's a good solution. And you can use the iPad's microphone, which
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:55.200]   probably sound better than a lot of other microphones. I don't know how we went down this rabbit hole.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.280]   Where were we? We're talking about how bad the
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:03.440]   what cams usually are in the back. Yeah, okay. What actually I was going to ask is, is it foolish
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:12.080]   to buy Rev 1 of Apple Silicon? For us? No, for other people, sure. I'm prepared to take the
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:24.640]   hit. Leo, did you just say that you are willing to buy this Intel Mac? I feel like last week,
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:30.960]   you said who would buy Intel Mac? No, Lisa. So this all came up before the show. I found out my wife
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:36.560]   bought the 16 inch MacBook Pro. And now I'm jealous because she's got a better laptop than I do.
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:45.840]   But I have sworn to myself I would not buy another Intel Mac period because as good as this
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.720]   time is or whatever. I don't first of all, I don't need one. So I don't want to, I don't want to,
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:56.880]   you know, I want to get but that means I probably will buy if they do a 13 inch MacBook Pro
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:03.120]   Apple Silicon this year, I will probably buy if they do or 14 inch or if they do a MacBook Air
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.720]   Apple Silicon this year, I will buy it. And maybe I'm making a mistake is what I'm asking.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:14.240]   Oh, the getting that no, I don't think you are. I don't think I am either. I don't think I
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.640]   think the Apple Silicon Mac is going to be a good business. I think really Rev 1, they've been
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:25.360]   making Apple Silicon since 2007. Yeah, yeah, exactly. But they but they haven't had 5 million people
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.960]   using it. No, the people know they've only had a billion people using it. Y'all.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:36.560]   Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were talking about like the the silicon they've been making you like
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:42.000]   for Max inside inside Cupertino. No, no, exactly. But I don't think it will be so different.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.440]   Well, so that's that's actually really maybe the more germane question. It's not Rev 1, but
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:55.200]   is the transition from mobile Apple Silicon to desktop or laptop Apple Silicon. How big a
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:00.400]   transition is this and how many hiccups might there be along that road? That's really the real
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:07.440]   question. I think the only question is going to be app compatibility. Like if you're using older
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:13.200]   apps that a lot of us have favorite utilities and favorite the labs that was the pet project of
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:17.760]   somebody until about three or four years ago, and it'll still run, but it'll run under emulation
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:23.200]   whereas like BB edit on day one, you know that the you know that bare bones flip the
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:28.320]   click the button and it's just going to make it work. Yeah, exactly. You click the button
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:33.600]   ex-hotsie yes, by all means, please do make my please do make my app work really well on Apple
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:41.840]   Silicon. So I don't I think there I think that it'll be if you have an app that you that you rely
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.960]   on day to day to day and you know that it's been upgraded for Apple Silicon, I might hold off for
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:51.760]   a month just to make sure that the first penguin off the ice, ice flow doesn't get eaten,
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:58.080]   but I wouldn't worry about it as far as so for instance, like for for a Mac book in my own use,
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:02.560]   my Mac book, I don't I wouldn't hesitate to upgrade to Apple Silicon almost immediately.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:08.240]   For my desktop, where I do have a lot of like open source projects that are three or four years
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:13.920]   old, one utility that's five years old that I really like, but again, some some probably some
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:20.640]   high school or the punch it out in about six weeks and then moved on, that remains to be seen how
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.960]   well those apps are going to work in an emulated environment. But yeah, I mean, this for me,
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:30.000]   the sweet spot has always been a battery powered Mac running Apple Silicon. So I absolutely wouldn't
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.920]   have if Apple, one of the many colorful rainbow rumors that that are out here is that not only
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:41.760]   we're going to see a new Mac Mac book, nothing under Apple Silicon, but it's going to be super,
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:46.720]   super crazy cheap as far as Mac books go. And if that were to pan out, if there were to be an
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:51.520]   $800 or $900 Mac book, I would be on it like a fly on a ship.
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:18:00.800]   So you may erase the interesting thing. So Rich Segal could flip that switch on Xcode.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:06.400]   But for all we know, there's stuff he's doing in BB edit that for one reason or another just won't
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:11.920]   translate. That's the that's the real risk. It's not like that he's not going to flip that switch.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:20.000]   It's that there are capabilities that for some reason are not supported in Apple Silicon.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.880]   I think it's see that I don't see you're not going to see bugs, right? Because
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:29.200]   like I said, it's not a revenue. I think this is what the developer kit that Apple is offering.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.520]   That's what they think. I think that's the thing that will take care of that so that while
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:40.720]   developers are actually transitioning to Apple Silicon, this little kit will just allow the
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:45.840]   translation of the language. So again, I don't at first, I don't think that's going to be an issue.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:51.520]   I think if anything will start to see the issue a year or two from now when these developers haven't
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.440]   done their due diligence to update to Apple Silicon. Here would be the show stoppers and it's not
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:00.640]   even a show stopper. But if Chrome doesn't work or Electron doesn't work, which is kind of a chromium
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:05.360]   framework for apps. And we know Google is so speedy about updating their apps in the best
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:10.240]   circumstance. And if Electron doesn't work, well, there's a lot of apps like Skype and Talk and
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:18.320]   Slack, Slack that will work. So that could be not a show stopper, but it could be a cause for
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:25.120]   the pause. Although Chrome worked on ARM for years. I mean, there'd be no excuse not to like,
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.360]   I just can't see a world where Chrome doesn't work on ARM on it.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:32.080]   Yeah. These days, as I was saying this in the chatroom, Apple Silicon
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.440]   in the chatroom, which is a different thing. I do not think that word means what you think it means.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:42.080]   But anyway, says that no one really is programming to the hardware these days,
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:49.280]   any or the system architecture anymore. You're not writing code. But Intel kind of asked people
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:56.480]   sometimes to do things. Not so nice to take advantage of the processor. So I wonder.
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:01.200]   Well, Apple is sometimes the same thing. But one of the consistent complaints I keep getting
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.160]   from developers is that they've had code that works absolutely perfectly and reliably. And it's
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:10.960]   at the heart of the way that their app works. And Apple, without being able to tell them that we
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:15.760]   have a Titanic change planned in 2020 or rather, we're going to be switching to Apple. So looking
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.080]   at some point, we don't know when, but that could happen at any moment, please just switch this.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:27.280]   Please swap out this old code you're using. And the resistance to upgrading that software is that,
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:33.680]   hey, look, we have this amazing idea for version nine of our app to expand it to make it much more
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:38.080]   functional to add features that our users have been asking for time and time again. And you're
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:43.040]   telling us that we should stop all that instead devote the next two months of our time to just
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:48.080]   making sure that we can follow a mouse cursor again, because you're telling us that the way that
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:52.640]   you've told us in the past and the way that you've approved it for the app store no longer is no
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:56.560]   has been deprecated. And you're not going to approve this for the app store. If we have our mouse
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:01.200]   cursor working this way forever more, right? So that's that's that's the sort of stuff that can
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:08.320]   bite people in the butt. And to be fair, it's it's hard to balance Apple's need to keep developers
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:15.760]   informed of things they absolutely need to do in order to make a transition like this painless
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:20.240]   without being able to tell them a transition like this is coming up. So yes, you are definitely going
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:24.960]   to want to pull all of your resources into changing you changing your code so that this old piece of
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:29.840]   deprecated code doesn't work anymore. Those are the little sort of side cases that are going to
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:35.120]   bite a lot of people in the butt. And those are the sort of things that I those are the reasons
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.600]   why I would wait a month on not not because I think that the the hardware is going to fail,
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.760]   but because that's when you're going to find out that okay, Andy, but your favorite CD
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:50.000]   Ripper is no longer going to work because it's because it's older code. It doesn't excuse me.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.840]   It's either not going to work or it's going to work in emulation and now be have a performance
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:58.320]   that maybe you're not going to like be aware of that before you plunked on $2000 for a pro model.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:02.960]   Although to be fair, that's what happened when a lot of people upgraded to Catalina.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:09.360]   True. So we might have already gone through that pain. If it were my only Mac, I would absolutely
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:13.120]   maybe hesitate, but I'm going to have an. Well, just keep your old one. Yeah, I'm going to keep
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:19.760]   my Mac pro and I have a Mac book here on Intel. I I'm really waiting to. I'm so excited about
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:24.400]   Apple Silicon, maybe maybe inappropriately, but I think I'd be willing to put my money
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:30.080]   with my mouth is and buy whatever they come out with. I think the potential for great battery life
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:35.120]   performance in interesting ways. It's not just going to be faster. It's going to be faster.
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:40.800]   But dedicated accelerators. Yeah, interesting ways. I don't know. And of course, I'll have to
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:48.080]   review it. So I could tell you one program that's going to be guaranteed to work on any new hardware.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:52.080]   That's last pass. See there right there. Last pass. The first thing I put on every new device,
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:56.000]   just got a new phone. What did I do? I put last pass on it. You know why? Because it makes it
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.320]   easier to log into everything to set up the old aren't thing. I'll show they brought to you by
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:09.920]   last pass. Last pass is a timely thing to know and have during COVID-19. Last pass surveyed
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:16.560]   global IT decision makers and almost everybody, 96% of organizations said the remote workforce
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:23.520]   has impacted their identity and access management strategy. You've got workers at home. They have
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:30.400]   the keys to the kingdom in their little lands. Let's hope not on the post it notes that they took
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:34.080]   off their screen at work and brought home and put on their screen at home. Those are the log
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:39.440]   into your bank accounts and your databases and your websites and all of that stuff. I hope they
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:43.520]   didn't do post it notes. If you were smart, if you had last pass enterprise, I guarantee you,
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:48.320]   they didn't take anything home. They just went home and suddenly they're able to access all that
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:54.640]   securely, quickly and easily. They can share passwords with other employees. That's important
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:59.200]   because you want to be able to do it. But you don't want to do it by text or email. You want to use
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:05.840]   it the secure way with last pass. It makes it convenient and easy and secure. Employees will
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:10.960]   have their very own vault for storing every app and web login they use. I use it. It's so secure
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:17.040]   and I trust it so much. I use it as my secure enclave for everything, even important documents.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:22.000]   When I traveled, I had my passport in there so I'd always have a copy on every device,
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.280]   my driver's license, social security numbers, things I'm going to need access to. Last pass,
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:33.360]   not only captures and fills every credential without disrupting your employee's workflow,
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:39.440]   it lets you enforce policies, things like two factor and password minimum policies
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.760]   that make you more secure. Plus, you'll always get your IT department, always get actionable
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:49.440]   insights into employee password behavior. They just released a new updated version of this
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:54.880]   admin dashboard. It's incredible. You can easily add and remove users. You can automate user
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:25:01.360]   management with directory integration. You see, and this is the most important from your point of
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:07.440]   view, who's using what company resources where? You can make sure it's only the people who are
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:13.280]   allowed to. When user identities are centrally and securely managed, a business can be sure that
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:17.760]   the correct employees doing the right thing has the right access. And employees, this is the nice
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:22.640]   thing. It's a double virtue because employees like using LastPass. Our employees love it. They
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.800]   love it so much. We make it a benefit of employment. You get your own LastPass personal account as well.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:34.400]   LastPass is IAM solutions help businesses improve the employee experience and safeguard the business
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:39.760]   from cyber threats. With employees working at home and most of our employees are, we are really glad
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:45.360]   we're on LastPass. You should be too. Let your remote workforce focus on their work without
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.760]   compromising your business security. Secure your remote workforce with LastPass. Go to

[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.160]   We did the Apple Silicon thing. I think we're going to have to start every show that way.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:08.800]   Okay. Is it okay now? Is it okay? Is it safe? Is it safe?
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:18.400]   Let's talk. I want to know what. So the 27-inch iMac came out, but the 21-inch didn't really get
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:27.680]   much of a push. So are we going to see a 21-inch complete redesign with Apple Silicon at the end of
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:33.200]   this year? 24-inch. I don't know if it's the end of this year. The Intel for the 21-inch was
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:41.120]   not compelling. I think it's over for Intel. I can't imagine they have a lot of Intel stuff.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.440]   Well, never say never. There's always a Hail Mary, but it doesn't seem like they have the people
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.960]   in place this time. They did with the core series when they did their last big comeback.
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:59.920]   Now, Apple is facing some, I think, reasonable challenges over the App Store. Actually, Russia
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:06.080]   just decided that the App Store is big. It's illegal. But I think there's
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:12.480]   reasonable concern among, well, it's Google and Microsoft who both have
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:21.680]   gaming, essentially gaming stores that they can't put on iOS. I think it's worse than that, though,
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:27.680]   because it's not a store. It's a streaming service. It's like Netflix. I would understand if it was
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:32.320]   a store and it downloaded arbitrary code, and Apple's like, we want to make sure this code is safe.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:38.240]   As far as I can tell, it downloads zero code. It streams pixels, and yes, you have a controller,
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:42.480]   but you have a controller for a video. You can play and pause and fast forward, and we want. This
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:47.920]   is a more sophisticated controller, but the core dynamics of this seem no different to Spotify
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:53.760]   or Netflix or any other streaming service to me. Now, that's good news. Apple says they're not
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:58.960]   going to allow XCloud or Stadia, the two Google gaming services. They don't currently allow
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:11.200]   NVIDIA's GeForce Now streaming service. On iOS, yes. On iOS. And they say that's because they offer
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:18.000]   access to apps that Apple can't review individually. In that respect, it's more like a store,
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.160]   but Apple doesn't need to review Netflix contents. No, exactly. Netflix isn't a store of video.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:29.120]   This may be the loophole Apple could use to save some face because honestly,
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:37.920]   look, Apple could say this. I don't think there's any legal challenge to it, but users may not like
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:42.560]   it. Users may not like it. It's gross, and that's the risk. Especially with anti-treat. The thing
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:47.360]   is though that Microsoft does not allow Stadia on Xbox. Like for me, they have no leg to stand on.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:52.560]   Both Apple and Microsoft have Windows and Mac, which are open computing platforms,
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:57.840]   and they both have their controlled iPhone, iPad, and Xbox. And Google, to their credit,
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:02.240]   they will allow all these services on all of their platforms. As long as you have Chrome,
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.000]   you are good to go or whatever else that can app. You can do whatever you want.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:10.960]   Microsoft wants to yell at Apple, but they will not allow Stadia on Xbox. I think
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:16.000]   you can make that a policy, but then just own the policy and take whatever pushback you get from it.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.880]   The rest feels like it's Office-stream. There is face-saving though. Apple could say,
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.320]   "Oh yeah, you know we thought about it, and it's really just streaming. It's not an app."
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:26.880]   They will, right? Like in two weeks of two weeks of utter disaster, they'll say, "Oh,
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:30.720]   we..." But that's their thing. Usually they're so careful they think about it. They examine every
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:36.000]   repercussion. They measure 18 times before they cut. And while they're measuring, they just get
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:44.480]   "soriated" and rightly so all over the media. They allow remote access apps, right? Local one.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:52.880]   I don't know if the set app is now available on iOS. It's apps instead of games, but like that's...
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:58.400]   I don't think this is going to stand. Yeah. So we were talking about this today on iOS today.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:03.200]   This is brand new. So set apps been available for quite a while on the Macintosh. You pay one
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:08.880]   monthly subscription and you get a bunch of apps. That's part of it.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:12.160]   And they're good. I want to point out, set up is fantastic.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.440]   Yeah, they're not cheesy. They're not amazing apps. They're good apps.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:22.720]   Clean My Mac X I-Stat. Men use Bartender Downey, I guess. It's still available on the Mac.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:27.120]   You're Lissies. And you can't get from the Mac App Store as well. You can't get I-Stat. You
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:31.920]   can't get Downey on the Mac App Store. So that's never going to problem on the Mac.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:35.920]   Gemini 2, which I love. And they download you down on the app.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:41.600]   So it really isn't. It's kind of a rental store, I guess, on the Mac.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:48.720]   Don't get. I know. The one thing that I wonder though is maybe because of how many apps are
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:55.520]   available, maybe Apple actually does its research of the vetting, which is the thing that they're
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:01.440]   saying is why they won't let Xbox. So this is the news that they're now offering the same thing
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:08.400]   that you'd get on the Mac for iOS. But it's weird because the way you do it is you have to scan a QR
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:15.360]   code. So you can download the app and then to get the in-app purchase effectively, the subscription,
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:21.200]   which all of these apps use, you scan a QR code and the app goes, "Oh yeah, yeah, never mind."
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:26.000]   Clever though. It's clever. It's a direct violation of Apple guidelines.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.960]   Like literally. Well, Apple approved it. So.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:34.400]   Okay. So. It doesn't mean anything though, because they were reviewing it. One of the biggest
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:38.480]   problems they have still is that the review process is totally removed. And this was supposed to be
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:42.320]   fixed, but the reviewers would review something, like would prove something. It would get featured
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:46.320]   by the editors and then the higher-ups from the view go, "Oh no, no, no, that really should never
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:51.040]   have been on the platform." I just removed it. I predicted it. I hope I'm wrong, but I predicted
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:55.280]   it on iOS today that we would not have this app next week to kick around.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.200]   It's actually a cell phone every time.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:02.880]   But on the other hand, I really think Apple has no leg to stand on in blocking XCloud and
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:09.120]   Stadia. And I think XCloud on the iPad is a very exciting proposition. I think there's a lot of
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:13.280]   users that would like to see that. We don't want to be limited to Arcade. And unfortunately,
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:17.840]   it looks like Apple's saying, "Well, it could be in their heads, it competes with Arcade." So
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:18.840]   that's the real reason.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.920]   Kase doesn't stream. And some people are saying it's not going to be a good experience and Apple
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:26.080]   doesn't want to have bad experiences. But first, they never said that and they put YouTube on a
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.760]   2G iPhone. So I'm not going to take any of that excuse.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:34.320]   It really is interesting. And this is, I think it's a blurred line because
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:39.440]   I could see how Apple would say, "Well, that's an app we can't vet." But it isn't an app. The app
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:44.400]   is not running on your iPad or your iPhone. It is running on a server. All you're seeing is a
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.760]   streaming view of that app. It's a huge threat to App Store revenue.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.160]   And it's where it distills down. Is that the problem?
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:55.760]   This is, by the way, the future of, I believe, of computing is streaming.
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.760]   Yes. It's a future for that. That may be why they drew that line in the sand.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:04.960]   Go ahead, Andy. I'm sorry. Right. It's not just, and there are two aspects of this. One of which is
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:09.680]   that this is an awesome service for people who have an iPad or an iPhone. The ability to run
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:15.680]   top tier console apps, excuse me, console games on your nice little iPad.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:20.880]   That is such a benefit to consumers. And the other thing here is that,
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:27.440]   exactly right, there is absolutely no reason that Apple has for denying this app. It doesn't
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:33.360]   compromise the security of the device. It's in terms of not wanting the user to have a bad experience.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:38.400]   Well, you don't get to do that. If you gave me this $1,000 iPhone for free,
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:42.400]   you could do that. You could say that, well, the reason why we give it to you for free is so that
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:48.000]   we can control your experience because it is, after all, not your iPhone. It's my iPhone.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.960]   It's our iPhone. But no, I paid a thousand bucks for this. This is my damn iPhone. If I want to run
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:58.080]   the service on it, I should be able to do that. And the fact that streaming games is very, very
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:03.600]   much the future of gaming, that everybody's trying to get in on this, not because it's a buzzword,
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:10.800]   but because this is an incredibly cool way to expand your library of access to gaming and other
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:17.680]   titles, but also to bring it to lower powered devices that maybe I can't afford the latest,
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:23.440]   even the last gen game console. But I do have a three-year-old iPhone that has plenty fast enough
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:28.960]   to stream this game. That is a huge value for me. So yeah, Apple hasn't a leg to stand on.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:34.240]   Now, I will say just to clarify something that to hack on to something that Renee said earlier,
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:44.800]   it's at least Microsoft has the credible argument that, look, you are playing this on a game console.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:49.440]   You're not going to get as good an experience streaming this game from, even if it is from a third
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:57.120]   party, as you will actually playing it locally. But yeah, that is something to talk about.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:04.400]   Again, Apple has a requirement here to give a not a vague sort of, oh, App Store guidelines,
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:08.080]   App Store guidelines in the face, particularly in the face of all the testimony that they had
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:13.680]   to give just two weeks ago, they have to explain point blank. No, we are absolutely not trying to
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:20.080]   get people to buy titles so we can creep a 30% discount. Excuse me, a 30% SPF off of every single
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:25.440]   title. We are legitimately concerned about the future of the platform and the experience that
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:29.920]   people are going to have. And they haven't had that argument yet. Anthony Niels is pointing out in our
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:37.200]   chatroom that Apple has Sony's PS4 remote play in its App Store, Shadow PC and its App Store.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:44.800]   They do effectively the same thing, stream games from other sources. I think that's actually streamed
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:50.960]   from a, like you actually have to, but no, no, I know you're right. I think that's right. Yeah.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.080]   Garner says, and I think Garner says it in a nutshell, very nicely, Apple's statement,
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:01.680]   they're protecting customers is simply false on its face. This is entirely about protecting
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:07.360]   Apple's revenue stream. They're not. I don't think that's true. I think that they would be able to
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:11.600]   get a deal with Microsoft with almost anybody to put the service on. It would be a negotiation.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.960]   And some people have said they're trying to use this as a bargaining chip to get windows on
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:20.720]   ARM licensing or Silicon Macs. They're going to hold a line at this until Microsoft agrees to that.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:24.320]   And who knows? These companies are huge. What do they want from Google? They're almost like Game
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:30.400]   of Thrones. A cut in the map. They give Google for a search. But with Apple, no, but with Apple,
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.680]   mostly when people think it's about money, it ends up being about control because they don't
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:39.120]   necessarily care as much about the dollar today as the $300 million tomorrow. And this is a mass,
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:43.440]   moving to streaming, like you said, with set up, I think just like what happened with news and with
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:48.240]   video and with music, we used to buy CDs. Now we get all the music for $10. We used to buy DVDs.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:52.800]   Now we get all the movies for $10. It's going to happen to games. It's going to happen to apps.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.320]   It's going to fundamentally change the economy of all these mobile platforms.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.320]   And they just don't seem to want to deal with that right now.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:02.000]   Well, we've been talking a lot about this on Windows Weekly because
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:11.120]   I'm of the opinion and we'll see what happens that the future of a lot of computing is streaming.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:16.960]   So for instance, I think, and I think this is one of the reasons Microsoft has changed the way it
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:23.120]   does business. Their money was in selling a desktop operating system and selling apps to go on it,
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:30.240]   Microsoft Office, chiefly. That was their entire revenue in the 90s. But that's changing.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:35.280]   And I think they see a world and future, especially in business. Business still buys PCs with Windows
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:41.280]   on it. But ultimately, it's turning out to be more of a nightmare than it's worth between ransomware,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.120]   failed upgrades, maintenance. All of this stuff is just a pain in the ass.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:51.600]   I think what business really wants is, and I think what they will buy in their next computer,
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:57.200]   it's certainly what we're looking at buying for our editors, is a thin client or a thinner client
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:02.160]   that's running software in the cloud that Windows will be running on Microsoft's Azure service,
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.840]   the apps are running me on an Azure service. Scott McNealy is finally right.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:10.320]   Yeah, the network is the PC. And you'll be renting all of that stuff.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.400]   That's a much easier management scenario for most small businesses.
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:18.640]   And more affordable for most people now, given they don't want three apps anymore,
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.360]   they want access to a million apps and a thousand games.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:24.560]   And the time has finally come because we have enough bandwidth,
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:29.600]   and it's reliable enough to do that. The cloud has proven that. And I think that's the next step
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:33.840]   in the cloud is not just data, but cloud is a service, apps is a service.
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:38.240]   Well, compute. So that's my point. And I think you got it right away, Renee, which is,
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:44.560]   this is a battle, Apple's fighting right now because they see a bigger war in the future,
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.880]   which is there. They're not ready for it right now. At least they're not
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:53.760]   positive. They don't have these services. So although I have to point out,
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:59.920]   they could be very ready. Apple Silicon could really make a very attractive thin client
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:05.440]   with great battery life. The services side, they have to be buying it for Microsoft.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:08.960]   Confice subscription service, sorry, it could become a streaming service. Apple's not ready to make
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:15.600]   Mac OS streaming service. Yes. Yeah. I mean, the biggest problem is that Apple has,
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:20.720]   Apple makes its money off of hardware. And if you're saying that the hardware is now
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:26.240]   commodity insignificant, it's just right. One of the most exciting things about having
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:33.120]   an iPad is the ability to stream not games, but stream an instance of Windows. The idea that
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:40.000]   there are an iPad will do me just fine for 90% of what I want to do with productivity. But
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.080]   I still want there are still one or two apps that I would like to still have access to.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:49.360]   I will happily spend 10 bucks a month to a streaming service so that I can have a remote
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:55.680]   Windows desktop where I download, install all my software on it via an app store. I virtually
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:40:01.360]   download it into the into the into the machine. And the ability if Apple now says that not only
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:06.960]   are you not going to be able to not only is this a world in which it doesn't really matter if
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:15.120]   people spend the extra 30%, 40% would cost to get premium Apple hardware. But also the
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:20.800]   30% the buying apps through the app store is also not going to be important because I can
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:26.080]   buy my apps almost anywhere. That is a scary thing for Apple to contemplate even if you are
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:30.160]   sitting on that much money. Can you imagine the ad though you have two kids in the back of a car
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:34.240]   and one kid is trying to play X cloud or stadium. It's like it's not it's not streaming other
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:40.000]   kids like I downloaded my games on Apple. That's how I was handling this. Yeah, like make it a
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.560]   competitive product issue and not a policy issue. That's only I think we got that statement about
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:49.360]   review because of oversight. That's a holding action. That's only good for the next few years.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:54.400]   The other no, no, the other kid would if it were commercial for anybody else, the other kid would
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:41:00.480]   say, oh yeah, well, I only have to get permission from mom. You have to get permission from mom
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:07.920]   and 10 cook. It looks too cuddly. It'd be a hard sell. So this is this is the the germane
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:15.520]   section of the app store guidelines that really is what this is all coming down to. Section 4.2.7
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:21.680]   remote desktop clients. And this is what Apple allows and does not allow if your remote desktop app
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.200]   acts as a mirror of specific software services.
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:31.520]   Rather than a generic mirror of the host device like like like a
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:40.160]   you know, remote PC would be it must comply with the following. So so this is what Stadia and X
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:46.160]   cloud have to comply with the app must only connect to a user owned host device that is a
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:51.120]   personal computer or dedicated game console owned by the user. Well, that's why the Sony
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:57.600]   PlayStation app works because it's your PlayStation both the host device client must be connected
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:03.920]   on a local and land based network. And so strike one. Any software services appearing in the client,
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:09.760]   i.e. on the iOS device are fully executed on the host device rendered on the screen of the host
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:15.920]   device. What? What if it doesn't have a screen and may not use API's or platform features beyond
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:20.480]   that which is required to stream. So they just don't want to have a hybrid situation where the
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:25.360]   iPad's running some of the software and the streaming devices. I don't know about the screen thing
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:30.400]   because no cloud server has a screen. All the countless. Yeah, they're all endless. All account
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:35.840]   creation management must be initiated from the host device. See, that means you'd have to set
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:39.760]   Stadia. I guess you could do that. Although I don't know why Apple would insist on that because
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:44.800]   they're going to lose their cut. If you bought Stadia through the app store, they'd get 30% of it.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:48.960]   But anyway, they're saying, Nope, can't buy it from us. You got to buy it from the host device.
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:59.280]   Wait a minute, who's the host device? The host? No, the host device is out there as the cloud.
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:04.400]   So they're saying it has to be done through Microsoft or Google. The UI appearing on the client,
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:11.840]   the iOS thing, does not resemble an iOS or app store view, does not provide a store like interface
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:16.640]   or include the ability to browse, select or purchase software not already owned or licensed by the
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:20.800]   user. For the sake of clarity, I understand why they want to do this. They don't want somebody
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:25.520]   set up a store basically. For the sake of clarity, transactions taking place within mirrored software
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:31.040]   do not need to use an app purchase provided the transactions are processed on the host device.
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:37.360]   So that's actually good for Stadia and XCloud. Thin clients, this is the final one,
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:41.120]   thin clients for cloud based apps are not appropriate for the app store.
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:48.560]   Yeah, they've never wanted you to make an app that was just a web kit holder for a website.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:53.200]   They'd much rather you just load that in a browser. You know, I have a terminal program
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:59.920]   that I run on my iPad that I access my server here. That's as far as I could tell a thin client.
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:06.880]   So that's another complaint we hear a lot from developers. These rules are applied inconsistently.
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:12.160]   That particular last part was because there was a ton of apps at one point that was that were
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:17.520]   literally just websites that were wrapped in a UK what UI web view back in the day.
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:20.720]   And they were put out and they were like a bunch of junk and entry gaps.
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:24.480]   Even Facebook, they didn't want low value. They wanted you to make an app that you needed to be
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:30.240]   an app. You could not do what you need to do with it. I agree with that. But in fact, I am using
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:35.680]   my iPad and I like using my iPad as a thin client because I run Emacs and I can't run Emacs
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:44.640]   in my iPad. I run Emacs on my server or VS code or a lot of coding stuff. I run on my server,
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:49.760]   but I can do it on i, which is great. That's huge value to me for the iPad, especially now that I
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:54.960]   have the keyboard and trackpad. That's a real computer now. I do that with screens and with my
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:03.680]   Mac. I don't want to get too lazy to get up. So this inherently is in these rules are inherently
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:06.160]   contradictory. Isn't a web browser a thin client?
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:13.840]   Yeah, no, that's a that's a because it's using.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:22.320]   I mean, it is a it is a container for for for JavaScript code. And that that is a that
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:27.600]   that is an interesting point. When I'm running Gmail on my browser. Yeah. See,
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:32.080]   this now we're getting into is a burrito a sandwich. Yes. Hot dog or no.
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:37.680]   Hot dog. Yeah, where there's an obvious answer, which is no, it isn't. But okay, fine. Let's
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:43.120]   smoke some weed and talk about the existential nature of what defines the sandwich anyway.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:47.760]   This is the real problem with making rules in the app store. This is fundamentally the real
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:52.240]   problem. It's for scene. Yeah, and it's just it's like the same problem with making laws, I guess.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:57.760]   What Apple needs is a court because that's why the court system exists. The legislators
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:02.400]   write a lot at enacted. And then it's up to the courts to figure out what the hell they meant.
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:06.320]   Yeah, but the actual life argued in front of the Supreme Act course.
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:12.240]   That's that shows what a blind spot that Apple has that we were all talking about. It
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:17.120]   wasn't it nice that Apple announced that that developers now have the ability to sort of appeal
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:23.440]   a decision, but that was the the EU forced them to do that. And so that's and so
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:28.800]   there's definitely a problem that Apple has just dogmatically with how they run the app store.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:33.840]   And I don't know what it is, but it needs solving because this has always been,
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:38.720]   I was talking about this on the radio the other day, that there is only one aspect of Apple,
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:44.480]   one only, where if there is some sort of a controversy, I don't think that, well, geez,
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:49.280]   let's wait and see exactly like how all this plays out because it could be a very complicated
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:54.880]   issue. The only issue in which I'm thinking, if I hear that, oh, there's a controversy or an issue
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:59.840]   of someone that has a problem, where I immediately go to, okay, Apple has either done something evil
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:04.960]   or done something incompetent. It's the app store. That's the only area in which I don't simply
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:09.840]   I don't simply do a wait and see Apple has such a bad track record managing the app store.
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:15.280]   And doing things that are just arbitrary and don't seem to be aware of the effects that you have
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:20.080]   on a developer when you suddenly pull all of their apps for an entire day without a single word,
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:25.920]   they need to be more intimidated and more impressed with the level of responsibility that they have
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:31.520]   in running the app store. And yet, app store is probably the thing driving most of the revenue
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:38.400]   in services, right? And certainly the revenue growth. And Alex Lindsay, where he here, he'll
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:43.200]   be back someday. He's still on assignment. But Alex Lindsay, where he here would say, well,
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:51.120]   that's the price you pay for getting access to iOS users. And Apple built this amazing things like
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:56.320]   saying to the manager of a mall, you built the mall, but I want to do whatever the hell I want.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:02.560]   I'm not going to pay you rent to be in your mall. No, that I feel is the way if that's Apple's
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:08.800]   attitude, that's an arrogant point of view. If the developer community spoke with one voice
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:14.640]   and said that, Oh, we're sorry. We don't want to sully your beautiful, perfect platform with our apps.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:20.560]   We're going to let you create every app that's out there or let your users just use web apps.
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:27.520]   And again, we apologize. We apologize. So Apple is not the only person that added only entity that
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:31.920]   added value to the app store. In fact, you probably could argue it's the value of the third party
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:36.240]   developers that really made the app store valuable. I think you could add like, I think it would be
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:40.560]   fair to say that Apple deserved in the beginning because it was and you want people forget this
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:44.240]   because there's the opposite of rose colored glasses is I don't know, turdy colored glasses
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:48.560]   that Apple really did change things from my palm OS days and crackberry days and all that.
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:53.120]   It was a fundamental shift and they have been rewarded for that richly. But I think like,
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:57.360]   I don't know how long a patent takes to expire or I think there's after a period of time,
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:02.400]   your ability to withdraw wealth from that innovation should diminish like it should gradually decrease
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:07.600]   and certainly 10 years later, there should be a pause and a reimagination of what that
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:12.880]   relationship should be. Yeah, I think it's time to do that. I think that's really what we're saying
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:20.240]   is time Apple to rethink this. And you're really coming up against and I don't think it's the EU
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:25.360]   or Russia. What you're coming up against is going to be users where you say, but I want X cloud.
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:34.800]   I want Stadia. I think the X cloud thing is probably going to be the real moment of change or
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:41.760]   digging heels in for Apple because this is such a huge platform. The other platforms that have tried
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:50.480]   to exist on iOS that haven't made it, they're not as big. And I think here's a moment where the
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:57.520]   public, the world is really going to title wave their opinions on this. And Apple will either
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:02.880]   decide, okay, we'll make some changes or they're going to really be stubborn and not let it happen.
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:09.040]   Then we're going to see people legitimately saying, I'm switching out of Apple and for reals,
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:12.080]   not just making that claim and not doing it, but actually doing it.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:15.840]   That's really the thing I said up until now is that there's never been like, if you want to
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:19.920]   tell me the app store is broken, then show me the app that Google Play allows that could just
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:24.160]   never work on the app store and is truly transformative. And you can't because Instagram
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:30.080]   lift all these apps. They came first and were often better on it. And then now that app is here.
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:34.320]   These sorts of apps are here. These are the apps that people are going to care about and simply
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:38.880]   cannot operate on the app store. And I think that's the point where Apple has to re-decide the app store.
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:44.720]   I'll just say, I'm going to buy a Galaxy Fold 2 so I can play X cloud.
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:52.000]   Is that a sandwich, Leo? It's a hot dog. But that is an interesting point.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:51:00.480]   If we consider that there is a certain percentage of customers out there, for whom the advances at
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:08.960]   all levels of mobile phones has elevated just the table stakes for almost any phone you can buy
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:17.680]   over $400. And that for so many people, the phone is just a medium for running
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:23.200]   Instagram and Facebook and TikTok and the individual social media apps that they actually use.
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:28.320]   That does become a vulnerability for Apple. When they, if a small thing like
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:37.920]   someone walks into a phone store, they suddenly have a friend that's using a streaming gaming app.
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:42.000]   And they say, oh, that's a really great app. I really love it. We can play together like
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:48.560]   illegally in school. And it's time to buy a new phone. And you realize that for $500 or $600,
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:54.000]   they can buy phone A that will run that gaming app. Phone B made by Apple that does not run that
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:00.400]   gaming app. And they see them as fundamentally equivalent sort of pieces of hardware. That is
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:05.600]   a thing that will push people to a decision towards Android. And Apple does not want to do that.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:12.000]   Yeah. Actually, the real reason I'm going to buy the Galaxy Fold is for years as a chess player,
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:17.520]   I would carry a chess wallet. Yes. Which was almost exactly the dimensions of the Galaxy Fold.
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:22.240]   You opened it up and it's a chess set. And all I can do is look at the fold and say,
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:25.920]   that would make such a great portable chess set. That is pathetic.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:29.600]   You think that and Joanna Stern puts a hot dog in the middle. You guys are very wide range.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:35.520]   It is a pathetic requirement to fill it. I am an Oh, I think I'm going back and forth on this
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:42.880]   for a couple of weeks. But I'm not buying the beans. Actually, they're so cute.
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:48.080]   So Sam had a big event last week. And that's what we're talking about. And they announced in
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:54.560]   the Samsung Galaxy Note 20, the Note 20 Ultra, which are as far as I can tell, and no way different
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:59.840]   from the Note 10. So I'm pushing those aside or the S20 or the S. The camera bump is bigger.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:04.640]   It's a huge camera bump. It's the size of a domino Lexi-Subiti. It's the size of the original
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:10.640]   iPhone said. Yeah. Yes, exactly. They announced a new watch, which actually I think might give
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:14.240]   the Apple Watch a run for the money they announced but said, Oh, but unfortunately,
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:21.040]   we don't have FDA approval for the ability to do both blood oxygen monitoring and blood pressure.
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:25.200]   And they are going to do ECG. They do have approval for that. They say they hope to get approval
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:31.280]   and be able to ship those sometime next year. That's intriguing. It's now a watch with a round
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:39.200]   face and a turning bezel that does many of the things that people buy Apple watches for. So I
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:42.880]   think that's going to be interesting. It's also Apple Watch prices starts at 400 bucks.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:47.280]   It's great to see some competition in the wearable space.
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:52.160]   Yeah, because Sam is aware of the other is not right. There's nothing. So this is
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:57.040]   Tizen. This is not Android where this is Samsung's own operating system and Samsung has slowly,
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:01.520]   I always like the Samsung watch. They've slowly improved these to the point where I'm now thinking
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:05.520]   that looks pretty good and they're doing earbuds and they're going they're smart because they're
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:10.400]   not they're trying to differentiate. They're not like everybody else making a clone of AirPods or
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:15.760]   AirPods Pros, but they're making it's it's it's looks like the bean in Chicago. They should have
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:19.120]   called them beans. They should have called them galaxies. They would have been so beautiful.
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:23.440]   And it goes in your ear, but the idea is it's super comfortable to wear for a whole day.
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:27.600]   So it doesn't go in your ear. It's actually more of a surface thing, which means it doesn't do a
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:34.080]   great job of a background noise reduction noise. And they have colors. They have actual color.
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:39.760]   Yeah. Mystic bronze. I don't think I'm going to get those. I because it's so glamly. You have to
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:45.440]   like your your phone will go together and it'll make like a laser show. But I'm definitely thinking
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:46.800]   it might be time for the vote.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:51.680]   Definitely in might don't go together. I understand that was the most interesting thing. I saw that.
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:55.600]   That's how equivocal I am about this. But I think it might be time
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:55:01.440]   for a folding platform. It was the pretentious unfold Leo. Every beginning of every show you must
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:05.840]   pretentious. Oh, I will. Oh, believe me. If I spent two to three thousand dollars, we don't know
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:09.840]   the present to be two to three thousand dollars. I am opening it everywhere.
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:17.360]   Let me just see what the chess move is here. Oh, yes, that's good. I said good day, sir.
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:19.200]   Slice. Good day. I said good day.
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:24.160]   That's the best thing I still miss about flip phones. Yeah, it is kind of monstrously thick.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:28.880]   They have put a decent sized phone on the front though now. So I don't know. You're trading serve
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:32.080]   you're trading with for thickness. Leo, that's the guard. That's what you do with every foldable
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:36.400]   from wallets to books to everything. Yeah. Well, look what I look at the crazy wallet case. I
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:41.200]   was just going to say the thickness of your wallet case is about as thick as the phone. So you're
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:46.400]   used to it. You'll be fine. That's why I did it. I want to get used to it. And this side does
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:50.560]   nothing, but I've got it. And that's the key. No, actually, it was. I realized why am I carrying
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:55.840]   a wallet in a phone? I have always wanted a decent wallet for my phone. And this one seems to work
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:56:01.600]   pretty well for the iPhone 11 Pro Max. And it's got a little rubber thing that closes it, which I
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:05.120]   kind of got an orange belt. It's working its way up the ranks. Well, actually, you would like this
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:10.080]   Renee. They sell different color accessorized. So I have four different colors, depending on my mood.
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:12.320]   I need to spend more money on accessories.
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:19.760]   Yeah, no, I am in a way kind of ready. This is no thicker than a that a fold too will be, I'm sure.
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:28.080]   And I hope I it's tantalizing to think about Apple already having built probably non-functional
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:32.000]   prototypes of what they would design wise. What would they do with a folding phone or a
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:38.480]   with a call to folding iPhone or a folding iPad? Either way, if they had a version of the Mac
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:44.000]   Mini that I could fold and pocket. Oh boy, when I be on that quickly, that is such an enticing idea.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   Yeah, they're right though. It's not ready yet, right? I think it's we still have a ways to go.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:56.960]   It's for yeah, it is. I think it is on a certain level, like the $10,000 Apple watch, where at the
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:57:01.440]   time when we were when we weren't ridiculing it, we're talking about, well, there are people that
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:07.280]   have that kind of money where it's okay for them to spend $2,000 on something that will fail in
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:11.520]   six months or it's not going to they're not going to get five years of of life out of it.
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:16.400]   They like it. They want it. It's interesting to them. And actually, I do know a lot of people who
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:24.480]   aren't like in the $10,000 Apple watch tax bracket who do have who do have a folding Samsung because
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:31.440]   the story of one of them was that I was I bought it prepared to just like return it because I just
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:34.960]   wanted to play with it and see what it was like. And then it was like it was the day I was supposed
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:38.480]   to box it up and I just couldn't because it was I just liked it too much.
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:44.000]   Let's take let's see. Let me think. Okay, that's enough of this.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:50.480]   Yes. We see the problem. Apple is going to have to address this at some point, right? Yes.
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:53.920]   That's the issue. And this might be the changing point of that.
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:56.320]   This might be the inflection point that they've been waiting for.
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:02.240]   Yeah. All right. I think it's time to talk TikTok.
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:08.560]   Oh, can you tell us what TikTok is because I'm, you know, I need to be one of the kids.
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:12.880]   What is the TikTok? It wasn't legal on YouTube.
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:16.240]   Let me explain it. And he had like the full backwards hat and skateboard on it was amazing.
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:19.520]   Exactly. Oh, let me tell you need. I need to turn my desk.
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:25.600]   Dusli. And now I can talk about what the kids are actually skateboard over there. So I can't
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:29.440]   I can't do the whole like Steve Busch. I mean, hello fellow youths.
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:36.800]   We, you know, when Alex was here, he was singing its praises, right? He's got the two kids doing
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:42.880]   and he loves the TikTok. And I see from his point of view exactly why it is a really
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:48.960]   great creative platform, especially if like Alex Lindsay, you can bring the technology skills
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:54.560]   of Lucasfilm. You can bring ILM. Yeah. To the TikTok.
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:59:00.720]   But ultimately what's really interesting about TikTok, and I admit it's addictive for me and I
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:05.840]   have to put it aside because it's just I'll waste hours looking at it, is that it attracts
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:10.960]   a new kind of new kind of creator doing a new kind of thing. We've sought with Vine
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:17.920]   much of the charm that Vine had. And I think it's, I honestly think it's a great medium and it's
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:27.040]   great. And I don't understand if I have TikTok on my phone, why I'm giving the Chinese government
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:33.840]   any, any leg up over say what I've given the American government with Facebook. I don't,
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:37.760]   I don't know what's the threat government Leo. It's ridiculous.
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:43.360]   That's the threat model. Pompeo saying, Oh, well, don't don't put TikTok on your phone unless you
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:49.280]   want all your personal information to go directly into the hands of the Chinese communist party.
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:52.480]   Well, and that may be the case on Android, but on iPhone, if I like it,
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:57.760]   the permissions, it's not exfiltrating anything that I don't want to certainly not my web history,
[00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:01.760]   which people say it takes. Well, so that's, that's, that's not the case anywhere. The argument is,
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:06.960]   hey, I think it's a, it's part of the, of the ongoing culture war between the United States
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:12.640]   government and, and China. Because it is technically it is, and it is a Chinese owned company.
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:20.480]   And so technically speaking, any Chinese company is subject to Chinese national security laws,
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:23.840]   which essentially says that, Hey, if we ask you to help us with an investigation, you're going to
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:28.080]   give us what we ask for. No questions, no questions, no talkbacks. But the thing is,
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:33.120]   every time, and that is something that comes into play when you think about any Chinese own
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:37.920]   company, I will, I will certainly allow that. But you have to look at exactly how this company
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:43.360]   is operating. And they are operating like every other social network that, that wants to have
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:48.880]   a presence in China, which is that they have once, one server in China that operates all of their
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:53.840]   Chinese users, so that to comply with local laws, and then they have another server for everybody else
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:01:01.680]   in Virginia, and that operates the entire rest of the world. And yes, the CEO, you can sort of like
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:06.240]   sigh when the CEO says, Oh, if the Chinese government ever asked us to commit espionage on our users,
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:11.120]   we would absolutely flatly say, no, you have to file that away as okay, that's what the CEO says.
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:16.720]   But recently, the Chinese government cracked down on the Hong Kong protesters by instituting
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:23.600]   even more draconian security laws in Hong Kong. And TikTok did exactly the same thing that every
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:27.760]   other social network did, which is that they withdrew from Hong Kong, so that they would not
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:34.480]   be required to comply with any Chinese orders to basically commit a dangerous act against its
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:41.200]   users in Hong Kong. They've security researchers have been investigating very closely what TikTok
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:45.680]   is doing with its data. And they determined that it doesn't do anything worse than what any other
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:50.240]   social network does. So yes, it does, it does siphon off a lot of data off of your phone, but that's
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:55.200]   a problem with social networks in general, not Chinese owned ones. And finally, the only thing
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:03.280]   that one researcher was able to find in terms of surveillance was kind of subtle. They, you know that
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.800]   there is China, there's censorship laws that apply to their operations in China, that of course,
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:15.440]   the government means that if you talk about their chairman as a compare to Winnie the Pooh,
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:20.640]   that is not going to fly on any Chinese social network. That is one of the things that's censored
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:26.000]   like Tibet, like all these other like the Tiananmen Square massacre, all that stuff you can try to
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.560]   you can try to type it in, but it will not appear on the service. Apparently, one thing that they're
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:36.560]   doing is that internationally, or at least in the United States, if you, if two United States users
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:45.120]   were to swap a piece of content that would have been flagged and illegal in China, and the Chinese
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:48.560]   server is not aware of the existence of this piece of media, like let's say it's a brand new
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:54.560]   brand new Reddit meme, then that will be that content will still be allowed to pass between those
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:03:00.720]   two users. However, the checksum of that image will be added to the database in China of stuff
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:05.200]   that Chinese servers will not allow to go through. So that's, that's the only thing that they,
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:08.560]   that any researcher as far as I know has been able to find in terms of
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:16.320]   doing any kind of surveillance on individual United States users. So, so to, I mean to wrap up,
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:22.240]   it's just there's nothing to indicate that TikTok is any sort of security threat above and beyond
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.240]   just being a social network that runs on a phone.
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:32.720]   And incidentally, this executive order, which says beginning September 20th, no transactions
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:39.840]   between the parent company, ByteDance, and any American entity, including you. So effectively,
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:46.160]   it cuts off their oxygen supply from the United States. It's not just for TikTok, it's also for
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:54.240]   WeChat. And their scene at brought up an interesting point. They feel like because WeChat
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:04:02.880]   is so important in China, it's important here for Chinese Americans, people with family in China,
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:07.920]   but it's like really important in China that they can actually impact iPhone shipments by as
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:17.600]   much as 30% globally. So it depends on one of the big problems of these two executive orders is that
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:24.320]   it uses this really, really vague sentence and saying it declares a national emergency,
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:29.520]   which I think is overstating the case. Absolutely. And that's one of the weaknesses that TikTok
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:35.440]   is playing to sue them for. But the situation is that they're, they, it said that this vague thing
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:42.160]   about interactions with entities, which could mean as far as not only would that will be
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:47.040]   be forced to remove WeChat and TikTok from its own app store, but also have to remove it from
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:51.840]   international app stores. And not only would it affect TikTok, it would also involve
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:57.200]   any company that is owned or invested in by ByteDance and Tencent. The thing is that they've,
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:06.400]   they put a 45 day grace period on this. And that the, the order says that only after 45 days,
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:11.920]   will the Secretary of Commerce actually define what interactions, what interactions are actually
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:17.120]   covered by this executive order. So this is apps they've created, what has to be an intentional
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:22.480]   state of absolute chaos here, which they could have avoided by simply saying that we are ordering
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:27.280]   that this, these two apps not be allowed to be sold or sold or distributed in the United
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:33.120]   States of America, they chose not to do that. That's, they also, and this is TikTok is reportedly
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:38.880]   going to sue them. And maybe as soon as today, they haven't yet filed suit, but reportedly in the
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:44.240]   lawsuit, one of the things they'd say is, all right, where's the findings? Show us the evidence that
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:48.480]   we're nefarious. You can't just ban something because you don't like it. And
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:54.160]   potential nefarious at Elio. Yeah, potential. And I think I understand it's complicated.
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:58.960]   I'm not a fan of what the Chinese government does to its citizens. I'm not a fan of lock and
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:02.720]   kids in the region where American social networks are blocked from within China,
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:07.440]   which is not a precedent you want to just because they do it. We should do it to them. That's kind
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:13.840]   of childish. I also think that it's reasonable to say, look, we're not going to use Huawei gear
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:20.160]   in critical infrastructure like 5G. I can understand. I think that that's reasonable.
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:24.560]   That's a critical issue here, though, too. And that is they're not banning behavior,
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:28.640]   which is how these orders usually are handled. They're targeting specific companies.
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:31.920]   They're not saying it is illegal to do this with data, which would be fine because then
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:35.520]   TikTok couldn't do it. Facebook couldn't do it. Yeah, there's some privacy issues.
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:40.560]   Damn straight. Yes. Let's fight it. Let's figure that one out. But they are targeting companies,
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:44.400]   not behavior. They're not even targeting companies. I think they're targeting people.
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:48.880]   They're targeting the Chinese people. That's really what's going on. And I think that's
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:52.320]   for the K-pop stands who have been causing Mr.
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:56.640]   If the president could figure out a way to ban K-pop, I think he would.
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:01.840]   I think the K does stand for Korea. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:08.640]   Stanceable in ally. Now, this is interesting, and I don't know if this is the case,
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:13.840]   but it affects, apparently, any video game Tencent has a stake in as well.
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:18.720]   They said no, but they've only said no, and you don't get to interpret laws by what some
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:23.680]   backroom politician tells you in a whisper ceremony after the poorly written thing is released.
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:26.800]   There is only going to be adjudicated based on the poorly written thing.
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.840]   So people are saying, "Oh, no, no. Don't worry about the games." I heard, you know,
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:34.720]   White House staffers have told me that's not a problem. So League of Legends.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:42.480]   100% owned by Tencent. All of Riot. Epic Games. 40% owned by Riot. That's
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:48.560]   Fortnite. Would a player unknowns Battlegrounds? 11% owned by Blue Hole, which is Tencent.
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:54.720]   Or Tencent. Your top gun movie is financed by Tencent. Tencent is huge.
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:59.760]   Tencent is a technology company that owns lots of games. Supercell.
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.720]   Lots of stuff, period. Yeah. Lots of stuff. Actually, that's right.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:07.440]   And this is part of the bigger issue is you start banning China.
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:16.560]   I don't know what you have left. You know, this is, I mean, who go make their iPhone now?
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:20.320]   And all this stuff. That's not why you were. That's a problem because the
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:24.240]   hardware is such an integral. And I say this, you can never predict the Chinese government,
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:29.520]   but the amount of GDP that Apple's business brings to, especially Southern China,
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:35.200]   is very high. And one of the things the Chinese government does fear is if they hurt the economy,
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:39.520]   like they can do a lot of things as long as the economy is strong. But retaliating on Apple
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:44.080]   services, because Google's not there. We're telling you on Apple services, like iTunes and
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.720]   the App Store and things like that, that doesn't hurt China at all.
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:51.600]   They certainly were willing to retaliate on the NBA. Although I have to say they've shown a little
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:58.720]   more reticence than we have to go after American companies. So I don't, I think it's not,
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:05.040]   that's certainly a potential specter. I'm just, let's just, but who knows what the Chinese
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:10.000]   government will do just just on the face of it. It doesn't seem like a good policy. And I have to
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.880]   say it, mostly it hurts me because I feel like there's some amazing, creative, wonderful stuff done
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:21.920]   by young Americans on TikTok. And I think it's a shame that for-
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:25.040]   If you're supposed to sell to Twitter, Twitter will just cancel it and Microsoft
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:28.800]   Rewind it.net, which is effectively canceling it is just like, it's not.
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:36.640]   Yeah, I don't know. And well, the other, there's lots of, you also have to consider because of the,
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:42.560]   because of the current tone of the our current White House, you have to also reflect on the fact
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:51.600]   that the usership of TikTok is 32% teenagers. The another 29% is people 20 to 30. And given that
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:56.320]   the given that we have an election coming up, shutting down the one of the biggest social networks
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:02.880]   for young people to communicate messages, to communicate political related sort of content,
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:08.480]   shutting that down would certainly help one political party and not the other, shall we say.
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:14.720]   And it's also, remember that, remember in Tulsa last month of the month before when
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:21.200]   Trump was like, we've got a million requests for invitations for tickets to our, we've got
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:26.480]   for our, my big political rally in Tulsa, we actually have going to have overflow in the parking lot.
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:31.360]   And it was like, if the event happened, it was those like crickets, they basically had just,
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:37.840]   a monkeys concert with only half of the monkeys appearing. And one of the reasons for that was
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:43.440]   that there was a concert, the TikTok, a bit of Tom Foolery campaign saying, hey, everybody,
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:49.840]   let's go, let's all request tickets to this event and not go. So there might be some retaliation
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:55.840]   involved as part of the mentality here. We'll see what happens.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:04.880]   One thing that I find to be, one thing I find to be kind of disconcerting about this situation
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:11.760]   is the fact that with an executive order on September 15th or whenever it is,
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:19.120]   using TikTok will effectively be illegal. So you and I, well, we don't know because
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:24.560]   the executive order is so vague. I mean, I know that you could. If that's what that means,
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:30.080]   then the individual, which is you and I, using TikTok, that becomes illegal.
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:36.560]   Well, that's weird. I think it would be. I don't think so, but I honestly, I don't,
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:39.280]   I think the whole executive order is going to be withdrawn.
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:44.480]   I have to say, like a lot of people, I downloaded TikTok and installed it. So I'd have it in case
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:51.360]   they banned it. But that's the thing though, is if the executive order, depending on what that
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:57.760]   wording means, you having it on your phone could be considered illegal, which might be why Apple
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:01.920]   would actually not just have to remove it from the app store, but would have to flip the switch
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:04.560]   and remove it from your phone. It kills the switch.
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.920]   Which means that people who side load it, because there's going to be people who are going to
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:11.520]   side load it. This is Android too, we're talking about not just Apple.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:14.880]   I think they just kill the servers though. That's the simplest way to do it.
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:17.600]   Yeah, but they would do it. They would have a great firewall.
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:24.560]   My point being that something that is ubiquitous, that so many people use,
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:29.680]   suddenly becomes something that you aren't allowed to buy federal government law to use anymore.
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:37.600]   That to me is a very scary stepping stone into the kind of sentiment that we talk about a lot of,
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:43.040]   well, I don't do anything wrong, so you can have access to all my data. Well, guess what?
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:49.360]   TikTok could become illegal. If you use it again after it becomes illegal, you're doing something
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:58.080]   wrong. Now, all of this tracking of us and everything that we do, to me, this is this really big red
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:06.240]   flag of what it actually means to let organizations have access to all of our personal data. Things
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:12.000]   that we don't think are a big deal now out of the blue might become illegal in 45 days.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.600]   Timing's weird too, because we just called up all these big tech companies and criticized them
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:25.280]   for monopoly and stuff. Now, the biggest competitor to both Facebook and Twitter out there right now,
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:31.120]   we don't want that one. I can't decide who's being favored and who's not being favored.
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:33.040]   Remember when we thought this was going to be a boring summer?
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:39.840]   Instagram has released a TikTok clone called Reels.
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:45.040]   Reels. It doesn't have the algorithm though. TikTok always gives me something, almost always
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:47.760]   gives me something I want to keep watching where Instagram does not.
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:56.080]   No. Although, I think some of that comes with, you got to build up an audience. Reels has tools
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:01.440]   people like TikToks even saying, "We'll help our creators move to another platform."
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:05.360]   We don't want them to be disadvantaged by this exact game.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:08.000]   A lot of big YouTubers all came from Vine when that was shut down.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.120]   Yeah, Twitter easily killed Vine by just saying, "Now, we're not going to share revenue. Bye-bye."
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:20.080]   So, I don't. If Microsoft were to buy it, I think that this is such a
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:27.360]   TikTok is such a jewel and it is such a completely missing component of Microsoft's business.
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:32.880]   I feel as though they would simply take over their servers and try to run it as directly as
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:37.760]   possible while also forcing you to switch. Maybe forcing you to switch to a Skype sign in, but
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:43.040]   it's gone. Then making you take a different username.
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:48.320]   So, has anybody tried Reels? I haven't tried it.
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:54.560]   I mean, I didn't post any, but I tried making some. It's fun. They really copied the TikTok
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:58.800]   secret to success with that you could easily create really compelling video and then the
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:02.400]   algorithm would gain you an incredible audience and they managed to clone the
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:05.680]   instantly create compelling video part really, really well. They had a good blueprint,
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.000]   they followed it. Same like they did with stories and stuff.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.200]   Yeah, you just steal it.
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:15.600]   It's such a scary thing because there are a lot of people who are now creating
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:19.760]   successful businesses based on a YouTube presence, based on a TikTok presence,
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:26.480]   based on a Twitch presence. There are some superstars that would be wooed from one platform
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:31.600]   to another with exclusivity and signing bonuses. But a lot of the people who are doing very well
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:37.040]   making let's say 80 to $150,000 a year are like, well, guess what? If TikTok goes away,
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:42.400]   that was your connection to all of your audience. You're going to have to rebuild from the ground
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:48.400]   up and hope that as a mid-tier sort of internet celebrity, internet influencer, that someone,
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:54.320]   as soon as people go to the brand new version of TikTok, they don't find someone who is a direct
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:58.560]   replacement for the content that you are creating. And if you are mid-tier, there's always that
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:05.840]   risk that, you mean that someone is giving makeup? Did I hear that right? Makeup tips on,
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:10.400]   I've got to check this. I have never heard of someone giving makeup and fashion tips on a
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:16.640]   social network before. So it's a scary thing to suddenly on one area be on top of the world.
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:23.200]   And then on the other end, suddenly, even if you've gotten an agent who's setting up brand
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:27.600]   sponsorships anymore, suddenly has to resell you all over again on a brand new network because
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:31.200]   you've had the rug pulled out from under you. What a weird economy that we've created here.
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:35.600]   It's happened actually in India where TikTok was banned along with some other Chinese apps because
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:40.640]   of course, there's a border dispute between India and China. TikTok did set up a $200
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:47.040]   creator's fund. TikTok, I think makes a lot of money on advertising and brands love TikTok.
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:52.640]   Creators, though, and can now participate. In fact, TikTok has announced its first payments
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:58.400]   going to three creators. Oh, by David Dobrik is getting some form of support in these hard times.
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:05.920]   You as a YouTuber probably know these people. And it's so beautiful because for a second.
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:10.320]   It's famous. No, he used that nice tone of voice that Canadians have.
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:14.640]   Dobrik is a YouTube creator as well, right? Yeah, one of the wealthiest in the world.
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:18.640]   Oh, nice. Well, he's made somebody. This is, you know, the rich are going to get richer.
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:22.640]   If you're a big star on YouTube and you bring your audience to TikTok, TikTok's going to love you,
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:29.280]   you're going to get a chunk of the action. And you know what? David has the clout to demand that,
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:34.640]   right? That's what killed Vine is as Twitter says, no, we're not giving you any money. They
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:40.400]   said, well, I guess we won't stick around. So David Dobrik, Brittany Tomlinson, Cheyenne Jazzwise,
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:45.840]   Justice Alexander, Michael Lee, Marissa, ran and Ross Smith, 19 creators.
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:49.040]   They think there's a lot of thoughts in the industry that it's going to move towards
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:53.120]   embedded advertising the way movies did. Like when Robert Downey Jr. picks up that big
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:56.400]   Mac, the end of Iron Man, because of the way the regulations are being handled,
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:59.760]   everything's going to be embedded advertising. They're just going to skip right over podcasting
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:05.200]   and go straight to TikTok. Thanks for all the fish. You'll be like, Lori, how did you enjoy
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:10.080]   your big Mac for lunch? We got desperately trying. Well, we did sell studio naming rights,
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:14.640]   which I think I think were the only podcast in history to study your naming rights.
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:18.080]   There was a bunch of YouTubers getting in trouble for not the school. I think it was primarily in
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:21.840]   Korea, but it's happened another way, where they don't disclose advertisers or they don't disclose
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:27.200]   or they don't disclose. You have to in the US, the FTC. You're supposed to, but every time they
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:32.800]   don't, it's another nail in that particular coffin. So we'll see where it goes. But the line is
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:39.440]   really blurred now for advertising versus recommending a product because you like it. But actually,
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:44.320]   the reason you like it is because it was sent to you free. It's not very clear line.
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:50.640]   If they send you a free product, you're getting paid. But FTC is very clear on that.
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:56.000]   As a content creator, they don't necessarily understand those rules, especially if you're
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:01.920]   just a young person who just started your little Instagram page and suddenly you're really popular
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:07.760]   and now people are sending you stuff and you think it's really cool. It's definitely
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:15.520]   FTC is a document here, which they, by the way, have put in a suitable vertical format.
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:26.800]   Yeah. Hey Tony, we need a pamphlet for 20 years. Make a sideways. Use that sort of really young
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:32.560]   fun. Put things on a skew. No problem. I got the young person fought. They're going to eat that.
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:36.800]   We're very careful. We always put a hashtag sponsored or hashtag advertising.
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:42.960]   If you're eating that Big Mac, Laurie, you could say, boy, this delicious Big Mac from our sponsor,
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:48.800]   McDonald's is really filling or whatever has keeping movies. How I stay slim.
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:54.240]   The M&M video has a bunch of embedded ads and they don't disclose that they're paid promotions
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:57.360]   at all. You see Hollywood getting away with it all the time.
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:03.040]   Yeah, unfortunately. Well, not only that, but I'll sidetrack this for 30 seconds and no longer
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:10.160]   I swear, but it's gotten so bad that it's not going to go ahead. It's got your own sliding.
[01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:18.720]   It is kind of our brand. It's fascinating to me that now we have, because so many sitcoms just
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:26.160]   live forever in syndication and on streaming, that oftentimes when they sell it to a new service,
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:31.040]   they will actually remaster them and replace the box of corn flakes without a box of
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:37.200]   casa cereal because they decided that, hey, do you want to do you want placement in this
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:40.720]   episode of Friends and they will now change out the products digitally?
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:43.920]   Yeah, no, no, we talked about that. Maybe you weren't here, Alex Lindsey.
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:48.240]   There's a term. What is the term for that? But Alex was talking about that. Yeah,
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:53.920]   there's no such thing as a free lunch. We always did that at tech TV. We put tape over any brand name.
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:21:00.880]   It's not just that, but again, I understand the idea of like, if there's a, if there's a,
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:07.200]   at this point, like if someone is like, hey, I haven't done my Purell yet. There's, then there's
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:12.640]   two brands and that debated for that. But the idea that, again, if this is rerun five years from
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:18.720]   now, suddenly I'll be holding, oh, I didn't get my, I didn't spread my Heinz barbecue sauce all over
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:24.000]   my hands today. It'll be a totally different product because they just digitally changed it.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.280]   Yeah, they call it sort of thing. They call it Greek. They call it Greek.
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:30.720]   Greeking. Yeah, because there, because a lot of times what they do is they take the alphabet
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:35.120]   and they make it look, you know, looks like it's real writing, but it's not. It's Greek.
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:38.080]   Yeah, I'm sorry for that. Yeah. It was just, no, no, I'm talking about that.
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:43.760]   I love how weird the world is. Again, my sleep schedule has been super wacky for the past
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:48.880]   month or so. So I was, I was, I was, I was up at like 4 a.m. now just saying, I can't get the sleep.
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:52.960]   Let me, let me go through every single, let me at least look through every single documentary
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:59.360]   that's on Hulu. And I found a documentary on influencers. And it was fascinating to me because
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:04.800]   the tagline was, or the cut line was, oh, the pressures of fame for these new generation
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:11.200]   of Instagram influencers. And it was all like, the first 20 minutes was people I have never heard
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:15.280]   of in my life. And then I will look at, I will look at their Instagram tag. And it turns out they
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:19.600]   don't have like 8 million followers. They have 150 million followers. And they're like, oh,
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:25.280]   it's just so much responsibility that I kick. It's really tough that I going out and I can't be
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:30.320]   anonymous anymore. And I'm like, dude, you have 150,000 followers. It's like you're only 10 times
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:36.240]   more famous than I am on Instagram. Why? And again, no, it's these, that's why I was thinking
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:42.320]   about these sort of mid tier people, people who can make a very decent living and not have to have
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:50.240]   an external place of employment. But nonetheless, they are just like hand over hand on a rope bridge,
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:55.920]   because as soon as somebody decides to shake one end of that rope, they are in the middle of the
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:23:03.360]   air. And that is such a weird thing. When I watch my favorite guilty pleasure, which is a reality
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:11.520]   show about yachting. Oh, I forgot the idea. You know, the drama of yachting. I know the drama of
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:18.080]   yachting below deck. Lisa and I did a calculation. We've watched 83 episodes of it. That's
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:25.280]   of a guest. King of the world. But I always know when there's a product placement, because it's
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:31.520]   not greek. They blur out anything. But if I see a label or a logo, and then at the end, it says,
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:35.600]   you know, promotional consideration provided by and there's there's all the labels you see.
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:40.240]   You always remember CBS had Mike and Microsoft PCs before surface was ever announced. They had
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:45.760]   the Microsoft logo in the back of all the theaters. Yeah. Oh, you always know. I love it when it's
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:52.160]   obviously an Apple laptop, but strategically placed. There's a little sticker. Yeah. The most
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:57.760]   hysterically funny example of this was parks and recreation, where it's like, Pawnee, Indiana is
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:02.640]   the only town in which, Oh my God, who wants an iPhone when I can have my windows phone?
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:08.960]   iPad, I'm going to use my Microsoft Surface. It's like, and kind of almost fit in with like the
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:14.080]   image of Pawnee and Indiana as this really bizarre community, because it's like, my God,
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:18.560]   I've never I have never seen this is the first time and only time I've ever seen somebody using a
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:23.840]   windows windows phone in the wild when I was not at some sort of a Microsoft office or event.
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:30.480]   Yeah. Yeah. There was Steve Martin, who's 75th birthday's coming up, by the way.
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:36.640]   There's a his first appearance on Letterman. And I think it was when Letterman
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:42.880]   was at the morning show, but he he shows up like Andy in his jammies. I just woke up his hair as a
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:47.200]   mess and he's got beer and he's drinking beer. And for all the world, it looks like Budweiser,
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:51.920]   but then I paused it and I looked and it's clearly Greek. It's really, but it was it was
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:59.120]   Greek with class. So you notice was the can originally Greek or did they actually it was a
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:04.240]   bud? No, no, no, no, it wasn't digital. I was someone like a Sharpie. Yeah. Yeah. I think they
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:09.840]   took a Budweiser can and they Greek. They just Greek it and they made it look like a Budweiser
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:14.400]   can. But when you look closely, it wasn't anything. Yeah, they do make they do make it prop
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:18.640]   company prop stores. They do make these labels that you can put over cans. Right. So it looks
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:23.200]   like it is it looks like a professional as clearly supposed to be died coat, but it is. But now it's
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:27.040]   exactly what they were they actually created. They actually created the trademark created the
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:34.160]   company. So they own the trademark to Dilep copy. Apparently. So somebody in the chatroom is
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:38.240]   saying we never had a Greek anything on our Showtime or HBO shows. I guess he worked for this.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:43.600]   And it's it's not required. You can show trademarks. I think sometimes it's just fear.
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:49.280]   You know, sometimes you'll see that you'll see Apple is a registered trademark of Apple
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:53.600]   Incorporated and that kind of thing at the end just to just so some of it's just fear. I think a
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:59.520]   lot of it is you're getting diggly unless you give us some money. Yeah, give us a product,
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:04.320]   give us some money. Otherwise you ain't getting no brand. So I think a half of that as well.
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:07.440]   And sure you might be out on care about that. One of my favorite movies,
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:12.000]   repo man. I don't know. I don't know whether they're making a comment on consumer culture or they
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.280]   just couldn't afford to clear all these logos, but everybody drinks like a white can with a word
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:22.320]   beer on it. They're a supermarket and there's like a white box with a word cereal on it in the
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:27.920]   Helvetica. That takes me out of the the movie when I see that. It doesn't then it doesn't feel real.
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:31.600]   You know, that's why I think it's better just to. Well, I don't know if you've seen repo man,
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:37.760]   but there's a lot of that. It's not that real. It's very it's very punk. Great movie. Great.
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:41.760]   Yeah, you know what? They that's part of the ethos probably the aesthetic of the movie, right?
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:47.520]   Yeah, yeah. We're generic here. We have they have situations where I was really
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:52.720]   article where people who are like like wannabe influencers or they're just or they they're not
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:59.120]   as successful as they want to appear to be. They will actually like do posts of gosh, I really enjoy
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:06.000]   my new squish against my face by my my new Stanley 12 foot outer retracting tape measure.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:11.840]   Spawn con hashtag hashtag hashtag to make it appear as though. Yes, Stanley tools is
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:17.200]   thinks my thinks my channel is so valuable. They're doing sponsored content when in fact
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:22.560]   nobody knows about you and nobody cares. That's an interesting. This is a hell of a tape measure
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:28.560]   by the way. I'm not being I'm not being paid. I really do. I've got so many Stanley tape measures.
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:32.080]   See, I've got great pains. We say it all the time. Nobody believes it because
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:38.080]   trade media often is completely corrupt, but we're great pains to say no, no, we buy our products,
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:42.720]   you know, or if it's not bought, it's a loner. We never take products. We never take payment.
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:46.960]   And we're great pains to say that. I don't want anybody to think that we're doing that.
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:55.200]   And when we do an ad, like for instance, here's an ad. We do the ad and then we come back and
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:28:00.560]   it's obvious. I hope I know people aren't fooled. Wow. Why did Leo spend an hour talking about last
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:10.320]   pass? Do you think they're paying for that? I'm so weird. Yeah. On the material podcast when we
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:16.240]   talk about Google, I have to when there used to be three hosts and I was the only journalist. And so
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:21.680]   I'm from the beginning for the first 150 episodes, I'm like, I do not do ad reads because I don't want
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:27.680]   to mix up my editorial voice with my sponsor voice. Completely. And now Florence Ion, the wonderful
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:31.440]   Florence Ion, who is also a journalist is doing it. So we decided that we're going to have to trade
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:35.920]   off. But every time you get to that point in the ad read where it says, "Enough." At this point,
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:40.320]   give your give a personal story about how using this service has affected you. And it's the biggest
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:45.680]   bargain that the that the advertiser ever gets because I will say, and now here's the point in the ad
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:49.360]   we're supposed to read. But what I'm told to tell you about what personally had, and then we'll talk
[01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:55.200]   for 20 minutes just specifically about how now this is sponsored content. I'm being asked to tell
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:59.280]   personal experience. And here's I'm trying not to make I'm trying to make it look as honest as
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:04.240]   possible. Because if it weren't, if I would not say something about it, I don't honestly believe
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:08.640]   and fortunately, it's not been a problem before. But I work as a certified this. We're very careful.
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:12.160]   Yeah. No, I choose the average. I'm sure because if I'm doing an endorsement, and by the way,
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:17.520]   that's an FTC rule, you should know if you are saying I use this product in an ad,
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:22.080]   you have to actually be using that product. You can't make that up. And that's a strict rule
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:26.400]   in the FTC. I think people don't know that. Yeah, I'm concerned that this new generation,
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:31.920]   I don't think that they have they have they don't have as good ethics or morals as older
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:37.360]   generations do. I just think that they didn't grow. I grew up in an era in which this was the
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:41.440]   third wire. If you're talking about if you're talking about if you're reviewing products,
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:46.080]   you have to make sure that you are as close to pure as you can possibly get. I mean, I bought
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:52.880]   app Google gave me the the Pixel 4 phone. So there wasn't a loan. I own it because it was just
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:57.040]   everybody got a bag or excuse me, certain people who were reviewing got bags with the Pixel 4 at
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:03.280]   the end of the event. And my Pixel 1 is definitely at end of life. And I had to I have not even so
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:07.360]   I've been using my Pixel 1 because I don't feel even though no one will know about it,
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:12.800]   I don't feel as though I can use this phone that I technically own as my real phone because it
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:17.280]   was given to me by the company that made it. And so that's why I bought a Pixel 3 excuse me,
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:22.800]   a Pixel 4A last week. I would much rather use a phone with much lower capabilities that I can say,
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:27.040]   no, no, I paid for this. I bought it with my own money. This is because it is my day to day carry
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:32.800]   phone. I feel as though the current generation, I don't feel as though it's the third wire that
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:39.200]   it used to be. However, I don't think that a lot of these influencers understand that if you talk
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:44.640]   about if you if someone gives you like a $2,000 laptop and you're using it day to day to day to day,
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:51.520]   that sort of grinds away at your objectivity. And you need to sort of monitor that carefully. So
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:53.840]   it's again, interesting times.
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:31:01.520]   Yeah, let's let's take a little. Actually, we don't have a break here, but if we did,
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:05.120]   this would be where we take a little break. And then have an ad.
[01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:07.200]   And then have an ad which we don't have.
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:16.320]   Sorry. No, no, they've ever had to do it to take a message that walk all the way back to the end
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:21.760]   to get that tape measure back. Say no more with with automatic retractable technology. Thanks to
[01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:29.200]   the amazing. Actually, we, one of the reasons I don't make or encourage or ask any of any other
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:33.920]   people on the shows, any of you guys, for instance, to join in the ads, you can if you want. I never
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:38.720]   stop you, but is for that very reason, I consider you journalists. And I don't mind if I compromise
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:45.600]   my own integrity, but yours. No, no, that's that's sacrosanct. And again, I hope I'm not coming
[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:50.880]   across as saying that unless you're unless you are like consumers union where you buy, you don't
[01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:57.200]   even accept a loaner for purpose review. We really accept loaners. This I bought this. I bought this.
[01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:03.680]   I bought this almost everything we use. I bought now. There's a pixel for a in house Jason has
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:09.600]   that is a loaner from Google, I believe, but he also interestingly bought one. And when the
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:15.280]   loaner from Google goes back, he's going to own that one. Most of the time we try. I'm in a lucky
[01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:18.960]   position where we have enough revenue where we can do that. I far prefer that partly because I
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:24.240]   don't want to talk to these PR people. I don't want to get a call from them saying, hey, we gave
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:28.720]   you that for a, but you said it was terrible. What's wrong with you? I don't want to get involved in
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:35.680]   that. So I think it's always better. It's also more realistic for us to have the experience of
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:40.560]   buying something and then reviewing it. If you could do that, most people can't. I wouldn't
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:46.640]   expect. I certainly can't afford to buy everything. Unfortunately, that has its own kickback. When
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:53.520]   Olympus years ago sent me the OMD EM1 to review, I had for 60 days and then I had to send it back.
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:58.000]   And I'm like, but I love you. No, that's the other reason. And so I had to,
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:03.920]   so months later, I had to buy one because it's like, but I love you. I want you to stay.
[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:15.280]   Let's see here. I'm stalling a little bit because in 15 minutes, we have a little birthday party
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:19.440]   for somebody you all know. We're going to do a little celebration. We've got a visit from
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:27.280]   Jonathan Mann. We're going to sing a song for somebody we know and love. So hey, Renee, talk to
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:35.280]   me about the new beta for watch OS 7 because you have spoken about it. First of all, caveat,
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:40.560]   right? Not a good idea to do the public betas on the watch. Yes. And it's actually now
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:47.840]   course over. It's not working. So if you rely on voice over, well, first, don't ever put it on a
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:52.000]   main device. So there should never be a problem. But if you are reckless, like I am, be aware that
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:55.200]   voice over is not working. And that could be a huge problem if you rely on it.
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:34:02.240]   Yeah. And it still could potentially require a trip to Apple.
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:08.640]   The port is not user accessible. So you can't just plug it into your computer and
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:11.440]   for a DFI. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:15.520]   Yeah. So don't make you oversell how great this is.
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:21.040]   Well, by the way, when watch OS 7 comes out, which is probably a month from now,
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:25.280]   something like that, right? Two months, yeah. Two months, you don't think it'll be September?
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:30.800]   And it'll be October, early October. Okay. So understand that you'll be living with it for a while.
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:35.440]   And when it comes out, it'll upgrade automatically and you won't have to work. You no longer in a
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:40.480]   beta version, right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I did do this with iOS 14 on both my iPad and iPhone.
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:46.000]   And I'm glad that I love the features of iOS 14. And we've had the third update to that public
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.440]   base. And there was really no being worse. There was no chance that he was on iOS 13, frankly.
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:54.880]   So tell us about, so you have the soap squish, squish, squish, wash, wash, wash.
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:58.400]   I love that. I love that so much. I wanted for it. I wanted for tooth brushing now. I want it
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:03.360]   for mask. Yeah. So basically you come in and if it realizes you've been out, it'll just pop up
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:07.280]   a thing saying, Hey, you should wash your hands. Otherwise, if you just go to wash your hands,
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:11.520]   it understands the hand movement and the sound of the water, because it does a lot of audio
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:15.440]   identification now if you want it to, the sound of the water and the soap, and it'll start to
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:20.080]   count down for 20 seconds. You don't have to like sing happy birthday to yourself twice. It'll just
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:23.840]   do that countdown and then give you a tactic and some fireworks saying like, well done.
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:31.120]   Now, some have said it often mistakes other behaviors. I want to say what they are.
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:37.360]   I have not had that happen. No, no, it's my vibrating toothbrush. I promised.
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:44.640]   My mistake, other behaviors for hand washing. And that would be could be annoying, at least
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:50.080]   distracting. No, you haven't had that happen. It's not well. I mean, I don't I can't think like
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:54.560]   because you really have to be like turning your hands and like doing like nothing that you would
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:58.560]   occur in nature like house cleaning. I could think of something. But like,
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:05.040]   the extent of activity and reversal of hand positions, I think you'd mutilate several
[01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:11.040]   several farm animals before you got. Okay. And it also listens for the sound of water. Yeah.
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:14.000]   Yeah. Water and soap. So I mean, you do you.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:22.640]   But what's for peace? Hey, man, you're encouraging everybody to waste water, man.
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:28.000]   Now I'm thinking it could you could have an app that would just that would say,
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:31.840]   should you really be doing that right now? That would be kind of interesting.
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:35.360]   Well, so what I really want is for it to detect you leaving the house and ping and say,
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:39.280]   you should be wearing a mask. And if you try to face ID and it doesn't see a mask, say, I do,
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:42.720]   it really. I love it. I love it.
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:47.280]   Your phone just starts just goes to max volume and starts going ding.
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:55.200]   Hey, what else is new in the beta seven of watch of seven?
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:37:00.080]   So sleep tracking is new. It doesn't do quite as much as some of the third party ones. And I don't
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:04.560]   know if that's because Apple doesn't consider things like light sleep, deep sleep, REM sleep to be
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:09.040]   accurate at this point. Or if they just want to do what they typically do when they Sherlock and
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:13.760]   that is do base level functionality so that apps can can Moriarty them with with deeper
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:18.240]   functionality on top of it. But there's basic sleep tracking and it's really in depth.
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:21.760]   You set a bedtime like you used to do in the clock app, but now it's in the health app.
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:26.240]   When you go to sleep, when you go to when you want to wake up, you can have a wind down period where
[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:32.240]   it will play music or do a home kit scene or execute a series shortcut for you. It will lock
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:36.400]   the watch so that if you accidentally move your arm, it doesn't light up. You have to actually
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:43.040]   tap it or press the digital crown to get a very minimal, very dark watch face. And if you want to
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:47.920]   actually wake up the watch and use it, you have to spin the digital crown quite a lot
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:52.400]   to actually get back access to the watch. And on the phone, you have to press a dismiss button.
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:55.360]   So they're really trying to make sure it's like a low disturbing
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:38:00.640]   mode. And then when you wake up, it'll measure sort of the sleep that you've had and your blood
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:06.160]   pressure and all these, your heart rate and all these things. And it's across iPhone and iPad.
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:10.320]   That's by the way, blood, that's why I'm interested in the Samsung thing. I know they don't have the
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:15.120]   feature. But if it could do if it's a blood docimeter, which is by the way, useful in
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:19.520]   COVID detection, because that's one of the symptoms is reduced efficiency.
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:24.640]   Or in blood pressure, which I monitor regularly, my doctor is always saying,
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:28.640]   has your blood pressure, has your blood pressure. It'd be great if they could do that accurately.
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:32.640]   You see, so many companies, they bought so many companies, they're trying. It's one of the
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:37.840]   highest things in the car seem to do accurately. All these companies had wonderful claims,
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:41.920]   and none of them were reliable enough through testing to release the public yet.
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:44.800]   It's the risk. If we're in your ear, it probably could do it.
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:50.000]   So I think maybe that's the next AirPods Pro Pro.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:55.920]   The thing I really love though is watch faces. So like, if you design a killer watch face or
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:39:01.200]   Andy or Lori does, she has the killer rock watch face and Andy has the perfect photography
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:05.520]   watch face and you have a great yoga one, we can send those to each other, or we can download
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:10.160]   them from the app store or from like, you can share them on social media. And because apps can
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:14.560]   have multiple complications from the same, sorry, faces can have multiple complications from the
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:20.720]   same watch now, same app now, you could have a Nike watch or a fantastic, like a carrot weather
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:25.600]   app to just insult you five different ways every time you look at it. It's super, super interesting.
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:27.040]   And I'm enjoying it already.
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:32.160]   All right, good. I can't wait. I'm actually very excited
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:40.800]   about all the new products. We might be waiting on the iPhone 12, but speak about that rumor.
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:45.520]   Everything. They were, they couldn't travel, so they couldn't go to China. They couldn't do
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:50.320]   the usual prototyping and testing and vetting that, I think it's no secret either, that United
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:55.360]   Airlines was dependent hugely on Apple's business. They would do non-stop flights. Their people
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:00.640]   would go over there over and over again to do all that. And now they've been working from home as
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:05.120]   well, which has its own constraints. So on the financial results call, Luca Maestry said that
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:09.520]   there would be a few weeks behind on the, or a few weeks later than normal for the iPhone,
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:13.920]   which probably means first week of, instead of second week of September, you know, end of the
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:18.640]   of September, beginning of October. And the Apple Watch will is paired with the iPhone, so that
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:23.600]   bleeds over. And it's hard to, it's hard. I would hope that they'd release iPhone iOS early,
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:27.200]   because it would help break up. They would wear his mind new iPhone, you know, like at least I
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:32.240]   can play with iOS, but there's no telling, you know, it just feels like October is a big month,
[01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:37.840]   this year instead as a temblor. Congratulations to Tim Cook, now in the three comma club.
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:43.040]   We have to give him a new t-shirt. And of course, Apple, as I mentioned,
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:47.760]   the beginning of the show coming precious close to a market cap of two trillion. I remember when
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:53.360]   one trillion was a big deal. Yeah. And he still has no pounders money.
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:41:00.000]   Oh, well, you know, after he's given it all away anyway, after a certain point, you probably,
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:05.120]   Bill Gates said that he said, you know, once you got a billion or so, you're in virtually
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:07.840]   in the facility. Yes, I was just telling that you can't run a company and count your money at the
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:11.600]   same time. Like, he just has no idea what's going on his Amazon. There's so much money to count.
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:20.160]   Yeah, I'm busy counting my money. Stop bugging me. So, but Apple is going to do that stock split.
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:25.440]   I don't really normally do financial news. I don't think it's, you know, germane to what we
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:29.600]   talk about, but it's, you know, you could say Apple's successful. There's no doubt about that.
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:34.240]   Good. I will mention this really good piece, I thought in the Wall Street Journal, about Tim
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:40.880]   Cook and how he made Apple his own by. And we mentioned this, we talked about this. Steve Jobs
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:47.280]   advised him. Tim Cook's repeated it several times. As you said earlier, you do you, Tim.
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:51.440]   Don't try to be me. Don't try to think of what would Tim, what would Steve do,
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:56.960]   but do what you think is right. And Tim Cook's clearly done that. And it's to actually take an
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:02.800]   Apple a little bit in a different direction. Instead of, you know, innovative new products,
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:07.680]   they've gradually and gracefully improved their existing products. And at the same time,
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:14.480]   improve their financial position dramatically. I think in hindsight, we're also learning that
[01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:19.280]   there's a lot of mistakes that might have been made before that maybe.
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:23.760]   Cook is hopefully trying to avoid this down around things that have to do with, you know,
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:31.520]   bullying other companies into this or that. Yeah, Steve Spindle, a lot of cycles being angry at
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:37.680]   Google over Android, right? And sued the hell out of them and said this thermonuclear war,
[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:42.640]   what that energy could have been much, used much more wisely. You don't get the feeling Tim Cook does
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:49.600]   that. Tim, Tim. Well, on the one hand, you know, Steve Jobs was, he was, you know, like a little
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:55.840]   indie guy who was scrappy and, you know, wanted to do it his way. And then Tim Cook took over and
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:43:00.240]   wanted to make this company a trillion dollar company. And guess what? He made it a two trillion
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:05.760]   dollar company. So, you know, there's a difference there for sure. Yeah. Well, he's an operations
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:11.120]   guy. There's no question about that. That's why Steve Jobs brought him in. That's what he did.
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:17.520]   And that's what he's brought to the senior role. But at the same time, I think he's guided Apple
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:23.600]   intelligently and well, that's not an easy thing to do these days. Yeah, absolutely. Again, just
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:32.800]   if all he ever got credit for is their manufacture, basically bringing just in time manufacturing to
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:41.040]   to Apple, if all he did was creating infrastructure so that they could make exactly the products they
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:46.320]   want to the quality they want and not get and get them in the at the speed that they want,
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:50.400]   that was absolutely transformative. And maybe it's you can be, you can argue that they're
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:59.120]   unforeseeable. The upcoming trade wars with with China and human rights problems with China were
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:06.000]   maybe unforeseeable. This is this is the reason why Apple went from a successful company to an
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:13.040]   to to an Apple to the the absolute the absolute pinnacle of what American business can do without
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:18.160]   great one to punch jobs cook, right? I mean, there was a perfect combination one after the other.
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:24.400]   Now I have to point out that it could be a jinx. This article could be a jinx. You know, they
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:28.720]   always said, if you're on the cover of Sports Illustrated, that's it for your career. And this
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:34.640]   is one of those it almost feels like an elegy for Tim Cook. And so it could be a little bit of a
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:39.840]   chance. Probably ulterior motives. I think that this feels to me like, you know, some someone's
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:45.440]   preparing their publishing resume. I'm not gonna be with Tim Cook. Oh, interesting. That's my usual
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:52.800]   publishers do not like Apple, though, for a lot of reasons. Apple News Plus, for instance,
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:59.200]   though, I don't think the Wall Street Journal is in there, is it? New York Times is not. They are
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:02.960]   the Wall Street Journal. I think your time is pulled out, but I think the Journal is still in.
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:08.000]   Yeah, so what's it? The Journal is still there. Okay. What's interesting is a story this week
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:15.680]   that Apple's iOS 14 is going to change how links work in Apple News instead of when you click on
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:23.520]   an article instead of taking you to the website of the publisher, it's going to send you to news,
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:28.720]   even if you click that link in Safari. Now, this is the default setting. You will be able to turn
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:33.440]   that off in the Apple News Plus settings. But wow, now you have to be a subscriber to Apple News Plus.
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:38.320]   So I think what Apple's saying is you subscribe to Apple News Plus because you care about this
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:43.200]   publication and you want to read it this way, maybe? No, it's not just that. It's like the
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:46.800]   problem they had before, and this is one of my biggest frustrations with News Plus,
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:50.800]   is like, I can read that article because I pay for News Plus and it's in News Plus,
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:54.160]   and I click on the article and it says I have to buy a subscription to that magazine,
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:58.240]   and there is no way to get to that article because news, you can't search for it,
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:02.240]   you've got to just scroll forever and hope that it's there, and it is so frustrating because I
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:06.960]   know I have access to it, I paid for it, and I can't get it. And my solution would have been to just
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:12.960]   make decent search in the News Plus app. But what they're doing to be customer-friendly is that if
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:18.160]   it detects you have a subscription to News Plus, instead of opening you up in Safari and you having
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:23.920]   that gate saying please pay for subscription, you knew you already paid for it's sending over there.
[01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:29.680]   The problem is that they are doing it in like Slack and other apps. They're not calling Apple,
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:33.600]   someone last night went through and did all the packet sniffing, they're not calling Apple for
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:38.800]   some white list, sorry for some allow disallow list. They're not doing anything very as that way,
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:45.440]   but they are taking over. They are taking over the link. Yeah, and publishers could reasonably
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:50.160]   say, as somebody did on Twitter, Architect Tony said, "Whoa, I wonder how many publishers in Apple
[01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:56.160]   News Plus realize the new iOS 14 and Big Sur does this to are by default intercepting traffic to
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:01.840]   their sites and sending it to the Apple News app instead." That's a one way of looking at that.
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:07.760]   TechCrunch's premium content is a very small portion, but it's not in discriminatory. If it detects
[01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:12.480]   a TechCrunch link, it's like, "Oh, you pay for Apple News Plus and that has, I forget what TechCrunch
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:16.320]   Plus is called." It's got a different name, but it'll just send any TechCrunch link there,
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:21.680]   and then they lose out on the traffic for like 95% of their articles, which aren't premium content.
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:30.560]   Big move from Google. Google Maps is coming to Apple Watch and they're adding carplay dashboard
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:34.880]   support. So it's now, is that mean it's a parody with Apple Maps? And I didn't realize that was up to
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:45.120]   Google all this time. I don't know. Google Maps has been on the watch before, but it was not a
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:50.720]   good implementation. Whenever I always use Apple Maps, if I want it to show up on my watch, it's just
[01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:56.080]   chiefly when I'm walking, because I like that feature and I can't get anything else to do that,
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:48:00.960]   I always assumed it was because Apple said, "Well, it's Apple Maps, right? You're going to use that?"
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:05.120]   No, Google didn't have the access that Apple had to the watch, so they couldn't provide a good
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:11.440]   experience with other apps left as well. Does this mean that Apple has capitulated to Google to do this?
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:15.440]   They keep adding, no, it's everybody. A bunch of podcast apps came back last year too. Apple
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:21.280]   just provided way more background access and API access. SwiftUI is doing wonders for what they
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:27.600]   can do on terms of interface and things. Also, this is an area where you want to be careful,
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:32.720]   because it looks a little anti-competitive, if you say, "Well, Apple Maps just works better in
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:39.760]   car playing on in the watch." This is where it's all about communication. In so many of these cases,
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:45.040]   in any other company, you would assume this is an anti-competitive act. Apple can legitimately
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:49.280]   say that we're not opening up this API because we're concerned about the stability and the security
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:54.320]   of the platform, and you know that it's not BS, but they need to be very, very clear about why
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:49:00.720]   these things are happening, because silence is dangerous, especially in the current climate.
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:08.560]   Hey, a good friend of the network, somebody we like an awful lot, I think everybody
[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:17.760]   likes an awful lot. Steve Wozniak is celebrating a birthday today, August 11th. In fact,
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:21.600]   you're invited to a party tonight. We try to get Steve on, but he's just way too busy.
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:29.200]   But his 70th birthday celebration tonight benefits Jules' inspiring children foundation.
[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:37.040]   Of course, Steve loves the music, and that's kind of nice. I gather, Janet, his wife put this
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:46.320]   together. It's w-o-z-b-d-a-y dot com. It'll also be on Twitch and Twitter. Apparently,
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:52.560]   you just can go in and register. Janet invites you to celebrate Woz's 70th birthday. So,
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:57.040]   they're going to stream music and stuff, music, entertainment, stories, and heartfelt expressions
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:04.880]   of love tonight at five o'clock, Pacific time. So, that's pretty awesome. I want to make sure
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:11.760]   everybody knows, and it is for a very good cause. Oh, here's the guest, Penjalette will be there.
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:17.760]   That's cool. Andrea Bocelli, Andy Hertzfeld will be there. Got his name wrong, though, but
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:23.040]   that's okay. We know who he is. Randy Wiginton, some old timers from the good old days. Richard
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:32.400]   Branson. I hope he's not singing. Santana, Roger Mcguin, who is a geek in spirit, and I'm glad Roger will
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:38.480]   be playing former founder of the birds. Magician Lance Burton, comedian. Well, use that word loosely.
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:46.000]   Larry, the cable guy. David Copperfield, Shepherd Ferry, some big names. Emi Lou Harris, Mark Cuban.
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:53.760]   Wow, the list goes on and on and on. Mickey Hart, Mick Fleetwood, Mr. Brainwash, Nancy Pelosi,
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:51:00.880]   Nitrous Hack and Snaggy, William Shatner, and Olivia Newton-John.
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:07.920]   Wow, Jewel and Jay Leno too. Jewel, of course, is the founder of the inspiring or the promoter,
[01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:11.520]   I guess, at the finest show. Janet was doing a really good job. She was reaching out to so many
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:16.400]   different people to say, "Hey, we're doing this. Try not to tell Steve about this, but if you
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:21.440]   create a video, that would be simply awesome." Also, is there a little Andy Anaco in there too?
[01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:27.840]   Probably. I think, no, no. I made it. It was one of those things where I made a note to, "Oh,
[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:30.880]   let's definitely do this." And then, I was like, "But what am I going to do?" And then, you know,
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:34.480]   so I didn't... Plus, I mean, I can't come on. You got Emi Lou Harris. You got Penjalette.
[01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:39.760]   Yeah, you're going to fall. I'll do something in my... I'll figure out something to do.
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:41.440]   Shabbat was maybe a lot of...
[01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:47.280]   Reading this list. I just got an idea that, like, for the after times, once when we can actually,
[01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:51.280]   like, do things in theaters again, you know how, like, their podcasts that will do, like,
[01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:56.960]   do like a tour of, like, little theaters and just do, like, an episode of the podcast,
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:02.240]   you know, from a theater, and it'll sell out. If there were, like, sort of, a monsters of Mac
[01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:10.560]   or monsters of Apple tour, where it was just a panel of, like, Waz and Andy and Steve Capps
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:15.120]   and all these other people just for... They will do, like, a 12-city tour of just staying on stage
[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:21.040]   and talking about, like, the old days for two or three hours. Wouldn't you spend $75 for that?
[01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:26.160]   Even if there were ticket master surcharges, I would spend $75 for that.
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:34.640]   W-O-Z-B-D-A-Y. Waz says, "It's my 46th birthday today. It's in hexadecimal."
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:41.440]   He'll be 70 years old, and I think they're staying at the O'wani Lodge in the world-famous
[01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:47.920]   Yosomite National Park. So that's... That's... That's a nice view he's got out his window.
[01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:52.960]   There we thought we would... John, are we... Are we ready? No? Okay. We wanted to sing him a
[01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:58.640]   happy birthday, but we're having trouble getting our... We couldn't get jewel music clearances.
[01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:05.360]   But you have me, so... We have Lori Gell. We have Andy and Aiko. We have Renee Richie.
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:09.360]   All right, I'll tell you what. We're going to go to our picks of the week and maybe
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:18.720]   Skype Willing will have a song for Mr. Waz and the Happy Birthday, Steve. We're all big.
[01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:21.520]   Yay! We love you. Fans, we love you. Happy birthday.
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:26.480]   Let's kick off the pick of the week with you, Renee Richie.
[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:34.080]   So my pick of the week is... So I love the stuff by Rogamiba because they are just
[01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:39.040]   9th-level ninja masters at hacking around everything that I typically find annoying
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:45.040]   and limiting about OS X, Mac OS's sound system, which goes all the way back to Core Data,
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:50.160]   sorry Core Audio and Foundation Issues I won't get into now, but I've used a ton of their products
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:55.120]   over the years and SoundSource has been particularly useful over the last few months.
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:59.360]   And they have a brand new version of it, SoundSource 5. If you're not familiar with it,
[01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:05.280]   it lets you individually control SoundSource's on your Mac, which might sound like not important
[01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:10.720]   to you. But for example, I sometimes am on a call like a hangout or I forget what Google calls
[01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:13.760]   and that, whatever Google meets. I have no idea what Google calls are, software anymore,
[01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:20.480]   or Skype or Zoom and like a FaceTime call or a phone call will come in. And I want to answer it,
[01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:24.080]   but I want to mute everything, but I don't want to mute this and you just, you can't. Like you'll
[01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:28.560]   put the volume down or I want to listen to like you or Andy or Lori will mention something and
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:33.920]   I'll try to watch the video while someone else is talking and you just can't control anything.
[01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:39.360]   This lets you set the individual volume for every audio source on your Mac. So you can make,
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:43.680]   you can have an information stream running quietly in the background while you're on your meeting.
[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:48.000]   You can have your meeting quietly on the background while you're just talking to someone
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:52.240]   quickly about an urgent need that they have. If you want to have multiple streams, like you're
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:56.400]   trying to listen to Apple's earning call while doing your live stream and you have to have
[01:54:56.400 --> 01:55:00.400]   Apple's earnings call low enough that you can still hear what the other people on the live.
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:06.800]   All of those things, like Rogen Miba does so often, they just solve it for you. Beautifully,
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:14.320]   professionally, elegantly, simplistically, you don't have to worry about it. They do. It's just,
[01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:18.560]   it's software that makes you happy about owning your Mac.
[01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:24.160]   It's funny because on the radio show this weekend, somebody, a guy, Brian, who lives in
[01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:27.120]   National is a naturalist, records bird sounds and he says, "I have all these
[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:33.360]   sounds that are different levels and I want it to be consistent when I play something back
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:37.200]   from this and this and this. Is there anything I'll do that?" And I said, "Boy, there sure ought to be,
[01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:42.080]   but I don't know." And then somebody said, "Oh, Rogen Miba just released Sound Source 5."
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:47.600]   And it was a weird coincidence because it was exactly, I think it's what, 50 bucks? It was
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:54.960]   exactly what he needed. Yeah. Oh, maybe there's Chris Mark? No, no, Chris uses it, but it was,
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:59.840]   it was before Chris, it was right before Chris is called, Chris confirmed. He said, "Yeah,
[01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:02.880]   this is a really good choice." I think it was somebody in the chat room actually. I want to give
[01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:10.800]   credit to, it was Edmonton Oil, or a guy who knew. So thank you. So yeah, pretty cool Sound Source
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:15.600]   and this, that's one of the things you could do is you could set a standard level for all the
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:22.640]   devices on your network. It's not the same thing as Audio High Jack. It's more, is it mixing? Audio
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:26.400]   High Jack is, I don't even use it for that. I don't know if it does. Like I used to use a tool
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:29.760]   called Levelator where you would give it an audio source and it would just level every
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:34.000]   thing inside it. And that's, I haven't checked if this can do that. I don't know. I don't use it for
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:38.560]   that. I just use this again as like having separate volume knobs for every single audio.
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:44.560]   That's what he was looking for. It does support some additional processing that you can do.
[01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:49.760]   And it does support audio units. So once you support audio units, there's nothing, the sky's
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:55.520]   the limit. That's Apple's plugin, audio plugin format. Hey, speaking of audio, before we get to
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:57:03.280]   your picks, Andy and Laurie. I want to welcome Jonathan Mann onto the show. He's been writing
[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:10.640]   a song a day for more than 4,000 days. Here's Jonathan Mann. Hi Jonathan. Welcome.
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:16.240]   Thank you. How you doing? We're thrilled that you could come on. We all wanted to wish
[01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:22.000]   was a happy birthday and I thought maybe, maybe Jonathan would have a good way to do that.
[01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:28.960]   I do have a good way to do that. 10 years, 10 years ago, after Steve,
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:36.400]   after Steve Jobs used my song and the Intenigate thing, Steve Wozniak's wife commissioned me to
[01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:43.760]   make him a birthday song. And then out of the blue a couple months ago, here we are 10 years
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:50.640]   later for his, that was his 60th. This is his 70th. She asked me to do it again. So I, so I, I,
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:57.680]   10 years, all of us are 10 years older. And so I wrote him another song. And we'll be hearing
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:03.360]   it. I'm sure tonight, but let's get a preview. Yes. Yeah. I think they're going to be playing
[01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:11.120]   the video there that I made for him, but I will do, I will do you a version. So here, here we go.
[01:58:11.120 --> 01:58:24.000]   Well, happiness equals smiles minus frowns. And laughter is the most beautiful sound.
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:35.280]   What's the point if it isn't fun? You get nothing done without passion. Oh, oh, oh, that's the woz.
[01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:48.080]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, that's the woz. He likes math tricks and gadgets and raspberry pipe projects.
[01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:58.640]   He made a camera that detects hummingbirds. Three kids and seven grandkids. Oh, he loves taking road
[01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:08.800]   trips. He'd give you the shirt off his back. You just say the word. Who was his god? Everything he could
[01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:20.080]   ever want, including honorary doctorate degrees. So on his birthday, don't email no gifts, please,
[01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:31.760]   as well. Please donate to his favorite charity. Inspiringchildren.net. Oh, happiness equals smiles
[01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:43.200]   minus frown. And laughter is the most beautiful sound. What's the point if it isn't fun? You get
[01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:54.800]   nothing done without passion. Oh, oh, oh, oh, that's the woz. Yeah, oh, oh, oh, that's the woz.
[01:59:54.800 --> 02:00:06.240]   He invented the personal computer, pouring his heart into subroutine.
[02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:20.960]   Remember when he was on dancing with the star and Big Bang, a theory. And on celebrity watch party,
[02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:32.080]   oh, you can clearly see woz's tender heart is on display. And he's proud of being a geek.
[02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:38.880]   And feels so lucky because Janet loves him every minute of every day.
[02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:49.680]   Ooh, Ben could never have broken. He loves inspiring children to be the kindest, most passionate they can be.
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:01:01.920]   He's always got time for fans, so if you can lend a hand, please donate to his favorite charity.
[02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:11.040]   Inspiringchildren.net. Oh, because happiness equals smiles minus frowns.
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:16.640]   And laughter is the most beautiful sound.
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:24.080]   Who wants the point if it isn't fun? You get nothing done without passion.

[02:01:53.060 --> 02:01:55.420]   you can follow him on YouTube.
[02:01:55.420 --> 02:02:00.220]   Unaccountably his YouTube channel is the Rock Cookie Bottom,

[02:02:28.180 --> 02:02:30.500]   there's silent, but they're plotting, trust me.
[02:02:30.500 --> 02:02:32.660]   Well, if someone who's written a song a day
[02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:35.100]   for thousands of days can't find a rhyme
[02:02:35.100 --> 02:02:38.100]   for inspiringchildren.net, it's not possible.
[02:02:38.100 --> 02:02:39.940]   (laughing)
[02:02:39.940 --> 02:02:41.460]   Was is easy to rhyme though.
[02:02:41.460 --> 02:02:42.700]   - Was you got it? - Was you got it?
[02:02:42.700 --> 02:02:44.380]   - Was you can rhyme.
[02:02:44.380 --> 02:02:45.900]   Really, really nice.
[02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:49.300]   70 years old, it's a great big important milestone birthday,
[02:02:49.300 --> 02:02:52.620]   and we're just so happy for you, was wasbday.net.net.
[02:02:53.460 --> 02:02:57.620]   The stream will also be a twitch.tv/inspirehouse.
[02:02:57.620 --> 02:02:59.620]   Twitch.tv, a twitch.
[02:02:59.620 --> 02:03:03.620]   Not twitch.tv/inspirehouse.
[02:03:03.620 --> 02:03:06.140]   Andy and I call you a pick of the week.
[02:03:06.140 --> 02:03:08.100]   - Mine is a very, very simple thing.
[02:03:08.100 --> 02:03:11.660]   It's a site called window-swap.com.
[02:03:11.660 --> 02:03:13.980]   Two developers have simply created a platform
[02:03:13.980 --> 02:03:17.380]   where you can upload, anywhere in the world
[02:03:17.380 --> 02:03:20.380]   can upload a 10 minute HD video with sound
[02:03:20.380 --> 02:03:22.500]   of the view outside their window.
[02:03:22.500 --> 02:03:25.260]   And so now you just go to window-swap.com
[02:03:25.260 --> 02:03:27.300]   and you're looking, and of course you want
[02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:29.060]   to full screen the window.
[02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:31.260]   And now you're looking through just the window
[02:03:31.260 --> 02:03:33.500]   of a random person who decided to shoot
[02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:34.780]   this 10 minute video.
[02:03:34.780 --> 02:03:39.420]   And it is like, in a time where you can't really travel
[02:03:39.420 --> 02:03:41.900]   and maybe you're feeling a little bit isolated,
[02:03:41.900 --> 02:03:46.900]   you just look out what is a random street in London.
[02:03:46.900 --> 02:03:48.780]   Again, they're now rainbows.
[02:03:48.780 --> 02:03:51.780]   It's not like, oh look, there's a herd of elephants
[02:03:51.780 --> 02:03:52.740]   going through the Serengeti.
[02:03:52.740 --> 02:03:55.140]   It's like, no, there's just, oh look, here's a taxi cab.
[02:03:55.140 --> 02:03:57.540]   I wonder if someone's getting out of the taxi cab soon.
[02:03:57.540 --> 02:03:59.340]   Oh, nope, nope, he's just picking someone up.
[02:03:59.340 --> 02:04:01.060]   Okay, that's interesting.
[02:04:01.060 --> 02:04:02.620]   And it's such a simple thing.
[02:04:02.620 --> 02:04:04.820]   - It's fun because it's so mundane.
[02:04:04.820 --> 02:04:05.900]   It's real life.
[02:04:05.900 --> 02:04:07.380]   It's not, yeah, just as you say,
[02:04:07.380 --> 02:04:09.460]   it's not some magical moment.
[02:04:09.460 --> 02:04:12.300]   It's just how it looks out the window and yeah, burgundy.
[02:04:12.300 --> 02:04:14.700]   - And it's only starting to get sort of traction.
[02:04:14.700 --> 02:04:16.580]   So we're not yet at the point in which,
[02:04:16.580 --> 02:04:18.820]   like it's being Instagrammed where someone is saying,
[02:04:18.820 --> 02:04:20.260]   oh, let me make sure we can,
[02:04:20.260 --> 02:04:23.260]   I can show people my incredible lifestyle here.
[02:04:23.260 --> 02:04:25.820]   And it's like, no, it's, and a lot of the,
[02:04:25.820 --> 02:04:27.820]   yes, a lot of these views are very picturesque.
[02:04:27.820 --> 02:04:29.620]   But again, the ones I really like are just,
[02:04:29.620 --> 02:04:33.540]   here's a street view, random street in Dallas, Texas.
[02:04:33.540 --> 02:04:35.700]   - It's the closest you get to traveling these days.
[02:04:35.700 --> 02:04:37.740]   - Yeah, and I found the,
[02:04:37.740 --> 02:04:42.740]   I came across the link on FARC and, excuse me, on Reddit.
[02:04:42.740 --> 02:04:44.860]   And I just clicked it, saying, I wonder what this is.
[02:04:44.860 --> 02:04:46.500]   And then I was surprised to find that,
[02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:49.500]   I was dedicating one of my monitors on my desktop
[02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:53.220]   to just this view because it is just nice to have,
[02:04:53.220 --> 02:04:54.940]   as I'm working, just,
[02:04:54.940 --> 02:04:56.740]   - Can you have it automatically switch,
[02:04:56.740 --> 02:04:59.100]   or do you have to click each time?
[02:04:59.100 --> 02:05:00.580]   - I believe it automatically switches
[02:05:00.580 --> 02:05:01.860]   at the end of each video.
[02:05:01.860 --> 02:05:02.700]   - Oh, okay.
[02:05:02.700 --> 02:05:04.260]   So you could just leave it up and then it will switch
[02:05:04.260 --> 02:05:05.620]   every 10 minutes.
[02:05:05.620 --> 02:05:08.060]   For instance, here we are in Cornwall in the UK.
[02:05:08.060 --> 02:05:10.140]   Who knew they surfed in Cornwall?
[02:05:10.140 --> 02:05:12.100]   No idea.
[02:05:12.100 --> 02:05:13.180]   - Cornwall, don't surf.
[02:05:13.180 --> 02:05:15.060]   (laughing)
[02:05:15.060 --> 02:05:16.420]   - It's kind of fun.
[02:05:16.420 --> 02:05:19.100]   I love the, the mundanity of it.
[02:05:19.100 --> 02:05:19.940]   - Yes, exactly.
[02:05:19.940 --> 02:05:21.540]   - Here we are in Greece.
[02:05:21.540 --> 02:05:23.460]   It is a very human connection.
[02:05:23.460 --> 02:05:24.300]   - Yeah.
[02:05:24.300 --> 02:05:25.140]   - That you really like it.
[02:05:25.140 --> 02:05:25.980]   - Yeah.
[02:05:25.980 --> 02:05:28.260]   - And you know, it's out somebody's window, which is great.
[02:05:28.260 --> 02:05:29.660]   You know, you even see the reflection of the window.
[02:05:29.660 --> 02:05:31.260]   Here we are in Madrid.
[02:05:31.260 --> 02:05:32.740]   - You also get room sound.
[02:05:32.740 --> 02:05:34.740]   I think they had to, later on that.
[02:05:34.740 --> 02:05:37.460]   Oh, by the way, warning, we will post the audio too.
[02:05:37.460 --> 02:05:38.300]   - Yeah.
[02:05:38.300 --> 02:05:41.420]   - Don't have a fight with your cat while you're shooting this.
[02:05:41.420 --> 02:05:42.460]   - I feel bad for this poor person.
[02:05:42.460 --> 02:05:43.820]   - Oh, there's a cemetery in the background.
[02:05:43.820 --> 02:05:47.100]   - Who lives looking out of their balcony to a cemetery.
[02:05:47.100 --> 02:05:49.500]   - I love that I would love that.
[02:05:49.500 --> 02:05:52.900]   - You would, 'cause you have a kind of morbid turn to you.
[02:05:52.900 --> 02:05:53.740]   (laughing)
[02:05:53.740 --> 02:05:54.580]   - Well, thank you.
[02:05:54.580 --> 02:05:55.380]   - No, that's right, it reminds you.
[02:05:55.380 --> 02:05:57.340]   Yeah, it reminds you, you know, life is short of joy.
[02:05:57.340 --> 02:05:58.340]   - They're little parks, yeah.
[02:05:58.340 --> 02:05:59.740]   - Yeah, they're little parks.
[02:05:59.740 --> 02:06:02.180]   Thanks, it's a good way to put it.
[02:06:02.180 --> 02:06:03.900]   Here's Brazil, Salvador City.
[02:06:03.900 --> 02:06:05.300]   It's really fun.
[02:06:05.300 --> 02:06:09.220]   Window dash, swap.com.
[02:06:09.220 --> 02:06:12.820]   Florence, let's all go.
[02:06:12.820 --> 02:06:14.060]   That's the only thing wrong with this.
[02:06:14.060 --> 02:06:15.940]   I just wanna go.
[02:06:15.940 --> 02:06:17.700]   - I know, you can go virtually, man.
[02:06:17.700 --> 02:06:18.540]   - You can go virtually.
[02:06:18.540 --> 02:06:22.020]   - You can go there, Honolulu, I just wanna go there.
[02:06:22.020 --> 02:06:24.700]   I don't wanna go there.
[02:06:24.700 --> 02:06:27.140]   (laughing)
[02:06:27.140 --> 02:06:29.700]   - Lori Gill, your pick of the week.
[02:06:29.700 --> 02:06:34.700]   - Well, this time around, I'm pulling out my makeup
[02:06:34.700 --> 02:06:40.580]   and nail art cards, and it's called Espionage Cosmetics.
[02:06:40.580 --> 02:06:43.340]   - What?
[02:06:43.340 --> 02:06:44.180]   - So, and if I see-- - What are you
[02:06:44.180 --> 02:06:45.820]   and nail artists, let me see your nails.
[02:06:45.820 --> 02:06:47.180]   - Oh, no, I'm not.
[02:06:47.180 --> 02:06:52.180]   But what's so awesome about this is it's very nerd-centric.
[02:06:52.180 --> 02:06:56.820]   So, there'll be makeup color palettes
[02:06:56.820 --> 02:07:00.500]   that are named after, you know, firefly things.
[02:07:00.500 --> 02:07:01.740]   - Yeah.
[02:07:01.740 --> 02:07:04.180]   - Or, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[02:07:04.180 --> 02:07:06.940]   There's nail art, one of my favorite nail art,
[02:07:06.940 --> 02:07:11.540]   it's actually processor chip as nail art
[02:07:11.540 --> 02:07:12.340]   for your fingernails.
[02:07:12.340 --> 02:07:17.340]   So, anybody, if you wear makeup or do nail arts
[02:07:17.340 --> 02:07:20.460]   and you're a nerd, this is such an adorable website.
[02:07:20.460 --> 02:07:21.300]   - Oh, here's the one you were talking about.
[02:07:21.300 --> 02:07:22.220]   - They have, you know-- - The circuit board.
[02:07:22.220 --> 02:07:23.620]   - The circuit board, exactly.
[02:07:23.620 --> 02:07:25.260]   - So, these are wraps. - Let's have a few of that,
[02:07:25.260 --> 02:07:27.540]   - These are wraps so you don't have to paint your nail.
[02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:29.300]   - No. - That you just put it on, yeah.
[02:07:29.300 --> 02:07:30.540]   - Exactly.
[02:07:30.540 --> 02:07:32.100]   So, anybody can have a circuit board
[02:07:32.100 --> 02:07:34.660]   on their fingernails, it's so cute.
[02:07:34.660 --> 02:07:36.740]   And it's all nerd-based stuff.
[02:07:36.740 --> 02:07:40.420]   So, you kinda, you know, the nerdy makeup wares
[02:07:40.420 --> 02:07:45.420]   and nail art users can have a place to connect, you know?
[02:07:45.420 --> 02:07:47.580]   - Will you do this of an important evening out?
[02:07:47.580 --> 02:07:50.820]   Will you put on a wrap for the special things?
[02:07:50.820 --> 02:07:55.820]   - Yeah, yeah, I would do, I mean, nothing is crazy
[02:07:55.820 --> 02:07:58.620]   as some of the makeup on here, it's so beautiful.
[02:07:58.620 --> 02:08:00.300]   I could even come close to it.
[02:08:00.300 --> 02:08:03.660]   But, yeah, I would decorate myself a little bit
[02:08:03.660 --> 02:08:06.900]   to go out and do some fancy things for sure.
[02:08:06.900 --> 02:08:07.740]   - Yeah.
[02:08:07.740 --> 02:08:12.340]   - So, espionagecosmetics.com.
[02:08:12.340 --> 02:08:15.340]   Very nice.
[02:08:15.340 --> 02:08:17.460]   I think this is a good way to end the show
[02:08:17.460 --> 02:08:21.300]   with a song, a dance, and some nail wraps.
[02:08:21.300 --> 02:08:24.020]   So, thank you, Lori Gill, for being here.
[02:08:24.020 --> 02:08:28.180]   She's managing editor at imore.com.
[02:08:28.180 --> 02:08:31.780]   And always a welcome presence here on the show.
[02:08:31.780 --> 02:08:33.380]   Thanks for being here. - That song was great.
[02:08:33.380 --> 02:08:35.460]   - I'll see you at the party tonight, yeah.
[02:08:35.460 --> 02:08:38.420]   - Yes, put on some Woz nail wraps, put those on.
[02:08:38.420 --> 02:08:39.660]   - Yes, something with it.
[02:08:39.660 --> 02:08:42.740]   - Maybe a cute little dress, a BB-8 dress.
[02:08:42.740 --> 02:08:45.100]   - BB-8 dress, perfect, get nerdy.
[02:08:45.100 --> 02:08:48.220]   Andy and I go, when are you gonna be on GBH soon?
[02:08:48.220 --> 02:08:50.980]   - I was on earlier this week, so if you go to
[02:08:50.980 --> 02:08:54.620]   to wgphnews.org, you can hear what I had to say
[02:08:54.620 --> 02:08:58.380]   yesterday, normally I'm on Fridays, usually in about one.
[02:08:58.380 --> 02:08:59.660]   - Good.
[02:08:59.660 --> 02:09:03.260]   Thank you for being here, I-H-N-A-T-K-O
[02:09:03.260 --> 02:09:05.660]   on the Twitter, on the Instagram, and of course,
[02:09:05.660 --> 02:09:08.660]   and notco.com on the internet.
[02:09:08.660 --> 02:09:12.260]   Renee Richie, he's at youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[02:09:12.260 --> 02:09:15.580]   None of these silly, weird handles for you, sir.
[02:09:15.580 --> 02:09:17.020]   Just your name. - I need a brand, Leo.
[02:09:17.020 --> 02:09:18.020]   I need a brand.
[02:09:18.020 --> 02:09:19.300]   (laughing)
[02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:22.060]   - It is a good brand, RR, great brand.
[02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:26.060]   Catch his reviews of the iMac, the new iMac 27-inch,
[02:09:26.060 --> 02:09:29.460]   the Apple Watch 7 and a big sir as well.
[02:09:29.460 --> 02:09:31.700]   He's got it all up there, great interviews too.
[02:09:31.700 --> 02:09:32.540]   It's always a pleasure.
[02:09:32.540 --> 02:09:34.860]   Thank you, Renee, for being here.
[02:09:34.860 --> 02:09:36.100]   Thank you all for joining us.
[02:09:36.100 --> 02:09:40.700]   We do the show every Tuesday, right after iOS today.
[02:09:40.700 --> 02:09:43.180]   So if you come in early, you can watch iOS today
[02:09:43.180 --> 02:09:46.100]   with Mike Asargent and a kind of older guy.
[02:09:46.100 --> 02:09:48.340]   I don't know who he is, but he's kind of sometimes
[02:09:48.340 --> 02:09:50.660]   he's a little weird, but he's okay.
[02:09:50.660 --> 02:09:53.460]   Walks around his underwear occasionally, but you know,
[02:09:53.460 --> 02:09:55.300]   it's a good show, I highly recommend it.
[02:09:55.300 --> 02:09:57.220]   It's one of the best shows.
[02:09:57.220 --> 02:09:59.380]   That starts at 9 a.m. and then around 11 a.m.
[02:09:59.380 --> 02:10:01.140]   Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern.
[02:10:01.140 --> 02:10:02.940]   We do Mac Break Weekly.
[02:10:02.940 --> 02:10:05.740]   That would be 1800 UTC.
[02:10:05.740 --> 02:10:07.740]   You can calculate your own time zone.
[02:10:07.740 --> 02:10:12.500]   Live Streams, audio and video are at twit.tv/live.
[02:10:12.500 --> 02:10:14.900]   On-demand versions of this show at our website,
[02:10:14.900 --> 02:10:17.260]   as with all our shows, twit.tv.
[02:10:17.260 --> 02:10:20.220]   Twit.tv/mbw for this one, Mac Break Weekly,
[02:10:20.220 --> 02:10:22.900]   twit.tv/mbw.
[02:10:22.900 --> 02:10:24.460]   YouTube, there's a YouTube channel.
[02:10:24.460 --> 02:10:26.460]   I can never remember the name, something like
[02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:28.300]   youtube.com/macbreakweekly.
[02:10:28.300 --> 02:10:30.940]   I would guess in that vicinity,
[02:10:30.940 --> 02:10:33.620]   the main twit channel has links to all of our channels,
[02:10:33.620 --> 02:10:35.700]   it's youtube.com/twit.
[02:10:35.700 --> 02:10:40.180]   I think the last thing I'd have to say is subscribe.
[02:10:40.180 --> 02:10:42.380]   Find your favorite podcast application.
[02:10:42.380 --> 02:10:44.340]   There are many to choose from.
[02:10:44.340 --> 02:10:45.900]   Subscribe in that way.
[02:10:45.900 --> 02:10:48.180]   You know, ring the bell, click the button,
[02:10:48.180 --> 02:10:49.620]   do all the things the kids do,
[02:10:49.620 --> 02:10:52.140]   and that way you'll get it the minutes available
[02:10:52.140 --> 02:10:53.340]   of a Tuesday evening.
[02:10:53.340 --> 02:10:54.180]   Thanks for being here.
[02:10:54.180 --> 02:10:56.460]   Now I'm sad to say time to get back to work
[02:10:56.460 --> 02:10:59.060]   because break time is over.
[02:10:59.060 --> 02:11:00.460]   Happy birthday, Waz.
[02:11:00.460 --> 02:11:01.300]   Bye bye.
[02:11:01.300 --> 02:11:02.140]   Happy birthday.
[02:11:02.140 --> 02:11:03.380]   Happy birthday.
[02:11:03.380 --> 02:11:04.420]   One more twit.
[02:11:04.420 --> 02:11:08.620]   Well, check out hands on iOS, twit.tv/hoy,

[02:11:16.380 --> 02:11:17.900]   If you wanna get the most out of your device,

[02:11:19.980 --> 02:11:21.860]   twit.tv/hoy.

[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:27.020]   (upbeat music)
[02:11:27.020 --> 02:11:29.600]   (upbeat music)
