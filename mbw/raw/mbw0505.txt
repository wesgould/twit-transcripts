[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.520]   Hello. Nice to have always nice to have you in studio. It's good to be here. Actually,
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.240]   we saw you at NAB. That was fun. You were having fun with the Ozo camera. We did. Yeah, we had a
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.880]   good time. We we did three days of where is that video? It was only a private stream. It's still
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.440]   rendering. No, no, it was all done. No, that was on live. So that was all rendered live. Oh,
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.360]   neat. Big, big horse horsepower to do that. And but we just get your theta working live yet.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.680]   Yeah, I did. Oh, good. It turned out to be the cable. So after all that, I swapped. I swapped
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.440]   USB cables. Fine here. I walked out. You use cables. Boom. It showed right out. Nice. The
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.040]   Yeah. So we that stuff was there's a lot of rights issues. It was bands and
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.600]   search to slay and a lot of other stuff. So it wasn't something we could post online. Ooh,
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.360]   maybe some of it will show up. But yeah, so you could just give me a USB key.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.880]   I wouldn't mind. Actually, probably be. You could just give me a 14 terabyte hard drive. Yes,
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.960]   exactly. You know, it takes up some in. Renee Richie's also here from imore.com in Montreal.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.600]   Hello, Renee. Hello, Leo. How are you doing today? I'm trying to compete with you with my action
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.920]   figures. I just copied you. I saw you had the old school. So I went with the new school. Nice.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.320]   Yeah, I think this is kind of fun. Rick, what is it? B-R-I-K-K-S-T-com.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.440]   Gave me this cover. He was in the studio a couple of weeks ago. It's a Lego
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.480]   plate that goes on your MacBook. And then he built the the Twit logo on it. The thing about
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.880]   what you have right now, Leo, is you have Apple, you have Lego, and you have Disney properties,
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.440]   like Star Wars. That is the triumbrity, the trifecta. That is everything of our dreams.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.800]   Every designer wants to work on all those things. Yeah, that's true. It's like the
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:23.200]   big thing. There it is. B-R-I-K-Book.com. And once you get the base, you can buy pre-designed
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.800]   little designs, but you can also do your own, obviously, because it's a standard Lego.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.800]   That's cool. That's really cool. I'm glad that the Lego, what do they have, a patent right on the
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.920]   bricks? And that expired a couple of years ago. Now anybody can do compatible. Lego compatible,
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.960]   toy. Annie and I, coz also here from Chicago Sun Times. Good to see you, Andrew. Hello,
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.560]   and we got all the Hamilton talk out of the way at the beginning before the show began. So you've
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.960]   can listen without fear, although congratulations to our favorite Broadway show for 16 Tony nominations,
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:04.000]   a new world record. That's going to be some funny running gags there. If we left at,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.840]   as he's a sorry, at the Emmy Awards, like holding up the books when he was nominated for against
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.640]   Jeffrey Tambor, holding up a book saying how to lose to Jeffrey Tambor's dignity. It's going to
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.960]   be, we're going to see people in like beach shorts and like Beft Up t-shirts who are nominated
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.040]   against Hamilton. Forget it. It's hopeless. You're going to see the most unprepared people in the
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.320]   world if you win against Hamilton. Right, a speech. Why bother? Yeah. No, you're right. You're
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.680]   right. It's it. Well, I know what this is. Fun. I'm up on stage and now I'm all getting
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.920]   tired, teary and weepy by didn't expect. And that's what you get. Get away from me and say,
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.160]   "Ha ha, of course you lost the Hamilton. Well, I'm not paying along. Here is my butt."
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.680]   Actually, the tough one's going to be best actor in a musical because it's Leslie Odom Jooner,
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.880]   Jr. who plays Aaron Burr versus Lin-Manuel Miranda, who plays Hamilton. And I hope they don't have
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.640]   a duel on stage. A duel all over again. That would be bad. All right, let's talk because just
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.120]   after the show last week, Renee Richie ran off early because Apple had its earnings call and the
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.400]   earnings came out. And as we said, expectively, Apple had warned us the quarter before it wasn't
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.920]   a great quarter. In fact, the first time Apple did not have a record quarter in 13 years
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:24.080]   and the stock market plummeted. 13 quarters. Well, since no, since 2008,
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.720]   nine. Remember offhand. It's been a long time. It's been a long time. 10 years and a thing.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.480]   So anyway, the point being, it was so funny. I was talking to my mom, my three-year-old mom,
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:44.800]   and I was giving my, I gave my nephew and iPad Pro for his birthday and I gave my, his brother,
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.400]   a MacBook because he's going off to college MacBook Pro for his graduation. And my mom said,
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.160]   oh yeah, William told me I shouldn't buy, you shouldn't buy those Apple products because it's
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.680]   all over for Apple. And I said, mom, mom, they, they made almost a billion dollars a week.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:07.040]   I mean, I was like, what was he a bad quarter? I was like, I was like, when we say a bad quarter,
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.760]   a bad quarter for Apple was at a whole different level. I mean, it's kind of like, you know, it is a,
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.400]   it is a bad game for Michael Jordan. I mean, it's basically, yeah, it is, it would be the best
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.920]   quarter ever for 99.999% of every publicly traded company that's there, except for,
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.560]   and I think even Apple said, you know, part of the problem is we've saturated the market. You can't,
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.640]   you know, can, you can't, there's a limited number of iPhones. You can sell any individual,
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.800]   although I seem to be the counter example to that. Well, they're being measured off growth,
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.000]   not off of like they, they're selling a lot of iPhones, but Wall Street doesn't foresee growth.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.600]   They don't foresee them selling even more iPhones in the future. And Wall Street,
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.680]   traditionally, at least in companies like Apple, not old incumbent companies where they look more
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.080]   towards things like dividends in companies like Apple and growth stocks, they don't care about how
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.280]   many you sold now. They want to know that you're going to sell more than that the next quarter and
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.680]   the next year and the year after that. And when you have a product that is being used by, you know,
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.040]   it's not like Android, but it's still being used by, by hundreds of thousands of people,
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.520]   they try hundreds of millions of people. They foresee it to being very hard. It's like acceleration.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.800]   You can get from zero to 100 on a highway really easily, 100 to 200 is hard, 200 to 300, almost
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:18.000]   impossible. So to maintain acceleration is sort of like a fool's errand. Yeah. Jim Kramer appeared,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.880]   I mean, Tim Cook appeared with Jim Kramer. Let me see if I can find the,
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:32.320]   can you go, do you have the video? He wanted to defend. He said investors got it all wrong on CNBC.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:40.720]   He wanted to defend the stock. So Jason, do you have it or should I? Okay, Jason is going to
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.600]   play a little bit of that clip here. This is from Jim Kramer's mad money on CNBC last night.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.080]   Welcome back. We're here with Apple CEO Tim Cook. Tim want to talk about the stock a little bit.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.280]   Just mad. Kramer's in such a hurry. You can't bother to say the E and CEO. It's like,
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.400]   hey, wait, they keep buying back the one fifth, the company. But what has it done? Your stock is
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:04.080]   down below where you bought the average amount, you know, much higher price. Is it a waste versus
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.880]   innovation or is it not really a trade off? It's not a trade off. Is the answer to that.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.320]   We first look at all the money that we need to invest. He's talking about the stock buyback.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.520]   Apple would have a significant, what is it? 50 billion or something? It's a huge amount
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.480]   of stock buy. They increase it again. I'm telling you, they're buying themselves back,
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.280]   which they should. We take the money that's left over if we have some and we do at this point.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.720]   Right. And we give it back to our shareholders and we do that in terms of dividends and buybacks.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:36.880]   And so if you look at dividends, we just raised it for the every year. I don't know if we're going
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:43.840]   to, it's deeper in the interview where he says, Kramer says, is Apple dead?
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:50.000]   Yeah, that was the, what's his name's quote from the New York Times where he said the best,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.560]   Apple's best days are behind it. But I think the legitimate.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.240]   And by the way, Tim's response is, I think that's a huge interaction,
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.560]   overreaction. The most important thing is customers love our products. Well, that's true.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.720]   Yeah, the legitimate concern here, they mean there's so much noise, but the legitimate concern
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.400]   here from investors isn't that Apple had a down quarter. It said Apple did not,
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:14.560]   Apple's management seemingly did not anticipate the downturn in iPhone and did not, and underestimated
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.400]   the demand for iPhone SE. And those are two things that historically Apple has been very good at.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:23.120]   And they had to down, they had to sort of ramp up on iPhone SE and ramp down on iPhone 6.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.440]   I think that's, any time you're releasing a new product, even if it's within a product that you
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.680]   have, you're not going to know exactly how many and what you don't want to do, it obviously is
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.040]   overproduced. So I think that I'm amazing.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.120]   It's a good bother with mad money. I mean, can I do jobs doing that?
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:45.040]   No, I don't think he needs to justify it. The problem is you have the most successful consumer
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:50.160]   electronics product of all time in the iPhone and the market's punishing you for not having a sequel.
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.720]   Which they're working on. I think that I think the timing hasn't lined up exactly the way,
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:01.600]   that would be perfect, but Apple fortunately has a lot of layroom. They can go a long way
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.640]   and if it's priced, when you look at it, they're still making money. Like I said,
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.880]   $10 billion in a quarter is not shabby enough to keep it.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.080]   It gives you some runway. Yeah, exactly. You're not going broke.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.320]   They have run away for a very, very long time. I mean, look at Microsoft. Microsoft
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:21.760]   has had a lot of trouble for a decade and they're still making money. But I think that
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.920]   Apple has a long time to work on this. I think that they have, they do have big products in front of
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:31.040]   them. And I think that if you have something they can sell, almost every other cell phone
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.640]   company would know other cell phone company can command that kind of margin.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.760]   Yeah. So everybody else is selling it a much lower margin than what Apple's doing.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.760]   And I don't think that's going to slow down.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.640]   $50 billion revenue, 51 million iPhones, 10 million iPads, 4 million Macs.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.680]   If you don't compare that to previous season sales, it's not bad.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.640]   That's a decent amount. Mac was flat iPhone and iPad down.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.880]   Let me eliminate the last year's quarter, which was an anomaly because so many people rushed to
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.800]   get the larger screen iPhone, then it falls within a pretty steady line graph.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.200]   Okay. Okay. So it was a blip last year.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.280]   It was a bad year over year compare. So because the iPhone six,
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.600]   sorry, because the iPhone six was such a phenomenal hit and there was so much anticipation built up
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.560]   for the bigger phone, when you do the year to year comparison, it looks bad. If you do the year
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:19.360]   to two year comparison, it looks much better. The fear comes in when you start to compare to iPad
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.600]   and say, well, this is similar language that Apple used with the iPad and we saw where that went.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.920]   So in the back of the mind, everyone still has this sort of gambler's paradox with Apple, where,
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.560]   oh, you know, they won this time. They're going to lose next time. Oh, they won again.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.920]   They're going to lose even harder next time. Oh, they went a third time boy. When they lose,
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.280]   they're going to lose bad. And it doesn't matter that that math this doesn't exist.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.320]   That's the sort of emotional reaction that Wall Street has always had with them.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.960]   Yeah. I mean, we, that's that's it's always, it's always important to know that there are
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.800]   two different games being played here and that both of them are very, very real. There's the
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:53.520]   games that we play, which is how is Apple going to do in the next two, three, four, five years?
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.440]   Are they still going to be able to do exactly what they want to do? And the answer is, of course,
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:03.120]   yes. But then there's the investors game, which is how is holding onto Apple stock going to affect
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.360]   my ability to get the gains I want to get in the next six or seven months. And sometimes that's
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.160]   based on what Apple is doing, but also sometimes it's based on game theory and understanding how
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.960]   other investors are going to react to this news. So well, and it's it's deeply, I'm just saying,
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.040]   it's deeply partition the what how this news affects two groups of people.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.400]   Well, and I think that the other thing that you the only reason Apple really has to defend
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:29.680]   its stock is employees getting stock options and everything else. It does affect morale if
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.760]   if that is all continues to slide. You know, so I think that that also becomes a
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:38.560]   you know, the only reason that you release the day should spend any time, you know, caring about
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:45.040]   the stock market. So they lost Carl icon though. I mean, I can't sold all his Apple.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.480]   I'm wondering. I'm wondering. I'm wondering. I'm wondering if Apple like has some party
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.800]   plan, you know, like Carl's going on. I kind of as of course the very famous kind of,
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.840]   what do they call investors, activists, activists, man, really pain in the ass investors,
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.560]   good. Effing rid of it was pushing and I can't as always done this. He pushes companies to
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.960]   make money for stock holders shareholders as opposed to maybe the strategic right move for
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:13.440]   any company. And he really was needling Apple to the point where he wanted to support a seat
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.720]   seat on the board and so forth. And so it's good that he sold all his shares because meaning
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.600]   won't buy back in. I think it's an interesting strategy to see if Apple can get can basically
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.440]   take it private again. I think it was China though. I thought he pieced out. He was worried about
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:30.880]   China in the future. Well, and rightly so. And even even Tim Koch referred to economic headwinds
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.800]   in the quarterly call that, you know, they say the downturn is not because of
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:40.160]   necessarily because of falling demand, but because of economic headwinds. Here's the quote.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:46.320]   We have the quote from CNBC. Tim Koch talking to Jim Kramer on Mad Money last night.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.800]   It's your thoughtful guy, life literature, life movies like life TV and you like it arc.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:56.960]   Yeah, we we don't talk about future. That's a question. As you say, we're fairly secretive.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:01.600]   We don't talk about products that are in the roadmap, but I would tell you that we're incredibly
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:07.520]   excited about things you're working on. Incredibly excited. And and so I don't want to be more
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:14.400]   more specific than that. But I think that the other thing maybe that's worth pointing out is
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:20.400]   if you kind of look at all the things Apple has done over time, at the time they were done
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:26.320]   they were rarely ever seen like they were in retrospect. Well, this bus you talk about the
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.800]   bust of the phone of the watch. I think the bus would be like that too because if you look at
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:36.240]   his wearing a watch, he also held up an iPhone. But today it's viewed as an overnight success.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.640]   Right. The iPhone was the same way. People were writing about there's no physical keyboard.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:48.000]   Obviously nobody would want it. And and so I think that in a few years, we show on the original
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.840]   iPod. And people would say, how could I have ever thought about not wearing this watch?
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.400]   Oh, I don't know. That's interesting. That would be an interesting shift, wouldn't it?
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.920]   You said, how could I ever not? I couldn't go back. I could send a second letter by
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.680]   consent to you about doing it by the way that was in the mid one time. All right. We don't
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.240]   keep showing this. But you can watch it. It's on CNBC's website. The fact that
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.480]   Cook appeared on that show shows that they do care a little bit about what the stock market says.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.120]   Again, I think they have to defend it. I think that again, when it comes to gather,
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.960]   when it comes to getting talent, when it comes to, because all those things are driven by your
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:26.720]   stock options, your things, I think that I think the talent driven stock option issue is probably
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:32.160]   bigger for talent than it is. If your stock is going down, it's just it's not exciting to have
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:37.360]   the stock options. And so I think that because talent acquisition for all these companies is
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:43.200]   one of all of our problems. It's getting good talent. And they have to do it in mass. I mean,
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:48.080]   they're hiring hundreds of people at a time. Also, there's it's a good indication that the
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:53.040]   Apple has has totally changed its attitude about dealing with the press and dealing with the public
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:59.200]   that you can't imagine five years ago, Apple having a conversation like this, having a what
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:04.960]   will you call a proactive conversation? Whereas now I think that they appreciate that no harm can
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.040]   be done and lots of good can be done by getting ahead of the story and saying, I know that there
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:14.080]   are a lot of people who are worried about Apple's future and Apple's performance. We're going to
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:20.880]   at least tell you what we think about that before it's in a situation where it's not crisis management.
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:26.560]   It's just, well, okay, we can send one of our guys out maybe even our top guy to have a
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:32.320]   have a non to talk to the shouty guy about why this is a there's no real problem Apple to talk about.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:41.440]   It is it significant that Apple now makes more money from its services than from selling
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:47.280]   Mac and Tasha's. In fact, a big profit center, the services Apple music up to 12 million or
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:54.160]   subscribers now revenue from the app store increased 35% year over year iCloud
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.640]   could grow. Apple pay is a success of million new users a week.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:04.160]   Yeah, they like the markup on phones with oh my god, the markup on electrons. The markup on
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:10.240]   electrons is phenomenal. Well, it's also a newity, right? You buy a phone once, but you continue to
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:14.640]   pay every month for the services Microsoft learned that right? Well, I decided they didn't want to
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:21.120]   sell. Actually, a better example, even a better example is Amazon where they've they had a really
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:26.400]   good productive and profitable quarter. And it's mostly because of the app services that they're
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:30.720]   selling not necessarily of their operations as a Kindle distributor or as an online store.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:36.800]   It really does if you it's it's nice to sell light bulbs. It's even better to sell the electricity
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.160]   that serves every light bulb that way you don't you make money on the light bulbs you don't sell.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:51.520]   Anything else to say about the results? I think we can move on. I know I'm just trying to find any
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:57.760]   other bits and pieces. Apple music's steady growth, probably a good sign. Apple music, in fact,
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.920]   exactly what you would expect, frankly, because Apple music is, as we've said many times, not
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:06.960]   particularly different from any other of the music. I think the number one self for Apple music
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.400]   right now is the fact that you can just tell Siri that you want to hear a song and appears and
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:18.160]   that's on your phone. I can just say I want to listen to the song is I'm fine with that.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:22.240]   Yeah. Well, if that's one thing, you know, that may be the differentiator that puts you over the
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.880]   top, you're going to pay 10 bucks a month to somebody. Exactly. Why not?
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:29.200]   Because they're all the same. I think there's a lot of opportunities for them to expand that.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.600]   They're not taking advantage of right now. But I think that that is the thing that
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.160]   it's the same thing that Apple Maps does really well on Apple on the iPhone because that's what
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:42.400]   everybody by default goes to. And I think that exactly, you know, the connection to watch is very
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:47.280]   useful for me because it connects to my to Slack. I mean, really for me, that's really all it needs
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:52.400]   to do. So, you know, those kinds of things. It's a super powerful thing to have an app that is,
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:57.520]   if it's not if Apple Music is not thrilling, if it's not the app that will get you to switch from
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:04.160]   whatever servers are using right now to switch to Apple Music, it's very, very good. It's pre-installed.
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:09.200]   It's the one you're basically going to tap for starters. The first thing that it tells you is,
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:14.560]   oh, we'll give you free music for a good amount of time if you tap this button. And it's good
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:20.240]   enough that people will not want to can or will not put a reminder on their calendar to cancel it
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:27.520]   after 30 or 60 days as bad as it's been from time to time with me. It's never been so bad that I would
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:32.400]   uninstall it in a fit of rage, even if I had the ability to uninstall Apple Music. Whereas
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:38.880]   there's a music app called Vox. Yeah, a music app called Vox that I installed to try it out a
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:44.640]   few months ago. I hate reinstalled it. I hate to install it after it said, are you really
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:49.600]   interrupting my work to tell me to listen to music right now? I'm in the middle of something?
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:55.120]   Are you putting up a pop up saying, hey, just one song? Like, no, how about just one removal, please?
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.720]   So yeah, that's the power of something. Well, and what more would you do, Alex? You said
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.480]   there's things you would do to make Apple Music better. Would you improve beats or launch some
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.400]   additional stations? It feels like that's a missing. They're missing that boat. Yeah, well,
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:13.440]   so I think that what no one's taken advantage of is allowing tastemakers to make money.
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:18.160]   Curate. Both of the curation? Well, allow them to curate. So for instance, if I, and it could be a
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:24.320]   very small percentage, but let's say if I build a playlist and I put it up on Apple Music and a
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:29.120]   lot of people subscribe to that playlist, I should, if I was able to make a little bit of money on that,
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:33.520]   and it's not just, it's not me that would make a lot of money on that. It's DJs that already work
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:41.120]   at DJs that, you know, the, the, the, it would be the death of radio like that, because all these DJs,
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:46.800]   thank you, no, but I'm just saying that it would be like a music radio. Not talk radio. Oh, good.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:54.240]   Thank you. So, so the, but the, because the thing is, is all these DJs are already well-followed.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:59.040]   People know who they are. And if they found out that they had, you know, the Mycala ran, you know,
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:03.440]   playlist or whatever, but they're not going to go ahead and do that unless they had a, you know,
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:07.200]   people can do it to make feel good. But really what you want is them to get a little percentage of
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:11.520]   that. And in Apple, even if it took, took a little bit of a hit, it can afford to do that,
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:16.400]   to pay a 2% on that or whatever. So if I have 100,000 subscribers, I get paid some little amount,
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:22.880]   as people play my playlist. And, and I think that that would turn a whole organic, you know,
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:27.600]   movement from a lot with a lot of celebrities that have a lot of followers that could generate
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:32.320]   a lot more revenue, you know, and, and I think that, that, that could be, you know, one of the bits
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:37.040]   and pieces, I think that another thing is, is from a technical perspective, I think from a playlist,
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:44.640]   I know it sounds silly, but building, building the ability to blend songs in a playlist
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:49.360]   would create something very, like, so basically be able to have like a little blend curve so I can,
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.960]   you know, fade from one to the next in my preview. Once you build that, you can't get out of that
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.960]   playlist. Like right now I can move all my stuff from Spotify to Apple Music. But if I have a thing
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.120]   that is basically sets up how I want to blend everything, so it's just nice, this nice thing,
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:05.440]   I think that you end up, it's a very, it's a very sticky thing. And then I also think that
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:12.160]   finding ways to allow users to find other users like them in a very big data sort of way, I think,
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.600]   is, is something that no one's really taking full advantage of. They, they try to do it in the
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.880]   background, but they don't give the users enough control over it. And I think that those three
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.680]   things, whether it's Spotify or Apple Music would, you know, could definitely increase,
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:28.640]   you know, what kind of subscribers are. I think that Apple by default will pass Spotify in the
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:32.480]   next 18 months. You know, I think, and it's just from a default, you know, they're just going to
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.480]   keep on growing that. But I think that, you know, there's a lot of other things that, that could be
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.840]   done. And then all the exclusive stuff that everyone's trying to do, but, but I think that that's not
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.800]   as, I don't think it's as compelling as people think it is. Yeah.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:51.520]   But I will say that Apple would have 50 million subscribers if they had listened to us,
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:55.760]   me specifically. Listen to Alex. If they listened to me six years ago,
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.760]   saying they should go to subscription, I just want to say, told you so. They should have done
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.280]   this years ago. You know, like, you know, like, but there, I think they're probably in good shape.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.880]   They'll probably have steady growth. I mean, they grew two million users in the last few months.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:12.080]   They probably have just continued steady growth. I don't think they're going to kill the competition.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.880]   But I think that, and we've said this before, the competition is going to boil down to companies
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:23.840]   that don't just make money in music like Spotify does. It'll be Amazon, Apple, Google, and you know,
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.200]   the titles and the spotifies of the world are going to struggle because the record
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.480]   industry is not going to let them succeed. They're going to, they're going to squeeze in.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.520]   Well, I think the record industry is trying to play everyone against each other. What they don't
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:37.280]   want is anyone to get a significant one. They don't want another iTunes situation.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.080]   Yeah, they don't. They don't.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:42.480]   Or, you know, that's why Apple's having such a hard time getting cable TV subscriptions and
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.840]   everything else. And now they're going to back up Hulu for that kind of thing because they don't,
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:49.040]   they're trying to even that out because once Apple gets ahead, you know, obviously they don't
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:53.760]   have any leverage. I think we'll see steady growth in Apple music. I don't see any reason not to.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:58.080]   No, I think it'll become the, I think it will be it will be slowly become the largest service,
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:03.360]   paid service out there. And I'm grateful because, because of then the family plan now is available
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.840]   on most services, $15. I pay $15 for six users and Google music. So thank you, Apple, for
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:12.000]   bringing friends down there. Right. Anyway, competition's good. That's why we want to keep
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.920]   competition. We want to want to want music to be strong. We want Spotify to be strong. I wish
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:22.320]   I was worried about Spotify. I'm worried about Pandora. Title. I don't have a title worried about.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.760]   Well, the exclusive. Well, they're never going to hear that Beyonce album now.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.560]   I know. Oh, Bay. Hey, where's my lemonade?
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.160]   I did. Did you see the video? No. Remarkable. Oh, is it? Oh, you got to watch it.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.640]   It's a video guy. You got to watch it. Okay. Yeah, it's remarkable.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.000]   Nice thing about Apple music is I just bought it on iTunes and now I tell Siri to play it for me
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.360]   and it plays just like it was available on Apple music. It's just one thing I have to worry about.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:48.320]   Yeah, there's another advantage, right? Yep. I'll integrate it. All integrated. And I think
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:54.080]   people still want to buy music to if only just kind of it's almost a tip to their favorite artist.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:25:00.480]   Streaming music is so important. But if you love Beyonce or Taylor Swift or the
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.040]   Mumpfries McGee or whatever it is, you kind of almost want to pay them the 10 bucks just to say
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:08.000]   thank you. Make another out. I have to admit that. John August and Craig Maison were saying on
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.440]   their podcast that the writers get paid the most for rentals, not for purchases. So if you like
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.520]   the writer more than the director, it's so complicated. I think people don't understand how this works,
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:21.520]   publishing rights, performance rights. If the performer didn't write it, then the radio stations
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.440]   only play the publisher. They pay the guy who wrote it. They don't pay for the performance
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:30.160]   royalties. It's very weird and complicated. And that's why if you want to support an artist,
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:35.120]   you buy their album. I think that one of the fundamental things that Apple is doing wrong.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:40.720]   This is bad and wrong. With their movies, you know, I lost my
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:49.040]   lost credit card in Vegas that was connected to my iTunes account. And I was waiting for the
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:54.640]   replacement and Apple literally, I bought these movies. And when I say I bought movies, I have
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:26:01.600]   like hundreds of movies on iTunes. And not only could I not buy new music, buy new movies,
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:06.240]   but it would not let me watch any of the movies that I already had bought until I fixed my credit
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:11.040]   card problem, which I really think is foul play. You know, you're not buying a movie.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:11.840]   That's interesting.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:16.320]   You're not buying a movie if I'm not allowed to watch it if my credit card is up to date or
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.080]   whatever. I had to do it. I mean, it was fine. It was like that.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:20.800]   That is BS.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:25.120]   That is BS. But they're security things there to keep somebody else from playing your music.
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:28.800]   I got it, buddies. But that was, you know, that's but I get I run into that all the time. And
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.760]   they're always asking for passwords, even though they have my fingerprint. There's a lot of
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:36.800]   inconveniences with Apple. And I think it's because of their security focus. They're trying to protect
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:43.280]   you. I think that they it was more than a convenience BS if I bought it when I open it up
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:46.720]   on iTunes. It should work. You know, like, like I say, you know, it should know it's you, but
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:51.680]   unless you validate it with a credit card. In fact, that happens a lot because I have family sharing.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:56.720]   So my kid is asked for the last four digits of my credit card frequently.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:03.120]   And, you know, Lisa is and so that's that's not great either. Like your child has to come to you
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:08.400]   and say, Daddy, what's the last five digits of your credit card? What's the CVV code for your
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.400]   credit card? No, I mean, that's a convenient, but I understand why they do it. It's to protect you
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.000]   and the music industry and the movie industry and the movie industry.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.920]   Hey, you know, who else has protected the Indian telephone company? Apple has been trying to sell
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:27.760]   refurbished iPhones in India, the world's second largest mobile population, a good way to bring
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:33.280]   inexpensive iPhones to India. The Indian government has rejected again, rejected their request.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:38.800]   Apple's been trying to do this for a couple of years now. Apple's rivals
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.280]   mounted a public campaign against the effort arguing such a move would trigger a flood of
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:47.680]   used electronics while defeating the government's make in India program to encourage
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:54.480]   electoral manufacturing. The Indian government's somewhat protectionist of its own companies.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:28:02.640]   This is actually this program is actually something that happens in a lot of industries.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.680]   So it's going to happen in the United States after the presidential election.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:10.160]   We with the wall goes up. So if you want to sell something, you know,
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.280]   if you want to sell something into a country, so this is electronics, defense industry.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:20.000]   This is very, very common, which is that you basically, if you want to sell F-16s to someone,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.120]   they have to buy. You actually have to build the tires there or something like that.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.760]   Right. You know, like there, you know, there'll be a lot of these emerging world countries.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.600]   I'm trying to get, you know, they're going to spend millions of dollars. They want to do that.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.240]   It's a little, you know, India's is I mean, obviously, India has these
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:36.480]   mental spending. I understand. But I don't think government should block consumers from
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.080]   speaking. No, I agree. I think that's allowing them to do it. But I'm saying that's the
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.880]   and the problem that you have with some of these folks that are fighting it is they're like,
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:47.440]   hey, we built factories there to be to deal with this. And now Apple's just going to be able to dump.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:53.440]   So make better phones and then demand will go up. Apple has 2% of total shipments of
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:58.240]   phones in the country. They also are trying to open their first Apple stores in India and
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.600]   waiting government approval for that. They can't do that without government approval.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:07.200]   And Brazil, let's bring up Brazil because as you may remember yesterday, another Brazilian
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:12.720]   court in a separate case banned WhatsApp for three days. And again,
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:17.120]   realize that was not a good idea. A hundred million Brazilians, right.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:24.320]   91% penetration in Brazil for WhatsApp because of protectionist rules for cell phone companies.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:30.880]   And the you know, exorbitant cost for SMS in Brazil. People use WhatsApp. And again,
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:37.440]   the, you know, the high court said, yeah, we better turn it back on. That was a mistake.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:44.000]   You know, you know, the, you know, Facebook and, and telegram are going, come on, turn it off again,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.520]   turn it off again. It's really, really good for us. The, the, um, the reason, by the way,
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:53.760]   is because of the end and end encryption. And WhatsApp says Facebook says, we, you know what,
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:58.800]   you can ask for it all you want. We cannot tell you what those messages say. They're encrypted.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.040]   We don't have the key. Yeah. And that's the future.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:08.080]   Jan Koom, the founder in a Facebook post yesterday said we have no intention of compromising the
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:13.360]   security of our billion users around the world. Thank you WhatsApp for fighting for it. And this
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:18.400]   is one where consumers won, right? They said, Hey, wait, I need my WhatsApp. It was going to last three
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:28.000]   days. $140,000 penalty for any carrier who allowed WhatsApp to work, but within hours,
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.080]   they turn it back on. Let's take a break. We got lots more to talk about, including rumors of a
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:36.320]   new MacBook. You know, you know, I know there's going to be a new MacBook or just a spot. Yep.
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:42.000]   Thanks, Leo. There you go. Not MacBook. Not MacBook from MacBook Pro. Not the, not the MacBook,
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.600]   because that's new, but the MacBook Pro course is a new one. I knew there'd be a new one. I knew
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:51.280]   it. I know it. We knew you knew it, Leo. We still say thank you. We've been saying it,
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:54.560]   but Will needed one. He's going to college. You needed one.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:59.840]   So I bought him, you know, the nice. He wanted to. He told me what he wanted. I had sent him a
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:04.320]   little gift card. And he said, Could you help me with the rest? Because it's three times more
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:10.560]   than a gift card. Oh, you want that one? So, but no, he deserves it. He's worked hard. He's
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.800]   going to the Rhode Island School of Design to be a design student. He wanted a nice high-end
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.760]   MacBook because all, you know, that's all he needs. Yep. Right.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:23.600]   So we'll talk about that and a lot more. Andy and I go here from the Chicago
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:30.000]   Sun Times, Renee Ritchie from iMore.com. And of course, Alex Lindsey from the pixel core. I have
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:37.040]   to say this is a 2012 MacBook and it's just fine. I don't need a change. I'm fine. It's just fine.
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:42.560]   Now that I have a new cover for you kids, our show today brought to you by Wealthfront.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:47.040]   So we're talking about the market and about investments. You can see why it's crazy out there.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:53.440]   If you're, if you're basing your long-term investment strategy on Jim Kramer's mad money,
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:58.480]   you might want to think about that a little bit long-term investing. Now, I'm not talking day
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:03.040]   trading. If you want to day trade, go right ahead and be my guess. But long-term investing for your
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:09.280]   future is a little bit, you know, more important retirement by that house, the kids college fund,
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.280]   things that you're going to keep invested for a while. You're not going to put it in the savings
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:18.560]   account because the rate interest rates were deculously low. Even a CD, you know, I think you
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:22.400]   really want to be in the market. You got to invest. But how do you invest? And who do you trust?
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:26.400]   Do you do it yourself? Read all the books. Read all the books. Did everything. I said,
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:32.480]   okay, I got it. I got it. I figured it out. And I opened an account, put a bunch of money in.
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:36.000]   And then I watched it for a while and then I forgot about it. And 10 years later, I thought,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.600]   oh, I probably should have been paying more attention. Whoopsies. Okay. So maybe you said,
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.680]   I said, oh, no, we'll hire a pro because they'll know what to do. There are a couple of problems.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.040]   First of all, sometimes the pros don't know what to do. In fact, if they were so good,
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:53.280]   how come they're telling you how to invest your money? Maybe they'll just be investing for their
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:58.720]   own account. The other problem, of course, is, you know, the commissions, the extra hidden fees,
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:03.760]   and the fees they charge upfront, like 1 to 3% per year of what you've got invested.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:08.960]   You know, that means you'd have to make 3% more just to break even. That's not good.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:14.560]   So I got a better way. Automated trading. A computer and computers are cheap, right? A computer
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:20.320]   will do it for one quarter of 1% a year, a lot less, and do it better because instead of checking
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:24.640]   in every month or so to see how you're doing, your computer will watch all the time. This is
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:30.480]   wealth front I'm talking about. Wealthfront is really great based on the best thinking,
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:34.480]   the state-of-the-art thinking, Nobel Prize-winning academic research, best investment
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:38.320]   practices from some of the best minds in the business. Just look who's on their advisory board.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:44.160]   You'll see what I mean. So you're getting all of the smarts, but you're also getting it monitored
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:48.400]   for things, frankly, even a professional investment advisor is not going to do because they're just
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:54.160]   not going to pay attention that much. Rebalancing every day, every minute, looking for
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:34:01.680]   tax-lost harvesting so you can reduce your tax bill while increasing your returns, things like that.
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:08.800]   You can have multiple accounts, joint accounts, retirement accounts, and accounts for that big
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:16.400]   rainy day fund. No additional charges pass the one quarter of 1% a year. That means no monthly fees,
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:22.960]   but also no hidden charges, no transaction fees. Take a look. Go there now. You can get a portfolio
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:28.080]   review for free. I really do want you, as always, they say this in the disclaimer as read carefully
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:33.120]   before investing, but I mean it. I think you got to, this is your money. It's your future. So read up
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:38.880]   on this. I was really impressed, but I want you to read up on it. You can get a portfolio review
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:43.760]   right now. They'll show you how much you're paying in fees, how risky your investments are,
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:48.080]   see if you're comfortable with that. They will also, if you answer a couple of questions about
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:51.440]   your, and this is one of the things it's neat, they don't have to do a big long question here,
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:55.760]   they have really figured out what to focus on. Ask you a couple of questions about your
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:02.560]   risk aversion, your goals, your long, your timeframe, and then they will generate a portfolio for you,
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:08.320]   which you can have. That's free. And you can see how it works. Just take a few minutes at Wealthfront.com
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:13.840]   and see how it works. And by the way, what's nice about Wealthfront? They've got a dashboard that
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:18.320]   will track not only your Wealthfront savings, but also all your other accounts. So you get a complete
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:22.320]   summary of your assets. It's a really nice kind of single page view. They have apps.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:27.520]   We've heard from so many people now who've used Wealthfront and are thrilled. The minimum
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:32.960]   investment, once you've read up, the minimum investment is $500. So you can just taste it,
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:38.080]   you know, for a little bit. And by the way, if you go to wealthfront.com/macbreak,
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:45.680]   your first $15,000 will be fee-free, not one quarter of 1%, but zero for ever,
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:51.920]   for ever. So a great way to get that nest egg going. And if you're a young person now's the time,
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:56.240]   young people think they're going to live forever. They don't think anything's going to happen.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:02.160]   I was that way too. And I kicked myself for not starting this when I was in my 20s,
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:08.560]   because by the time you're my age, so much more because of the magic of compounding.
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:15.920]   But it's like magic. It's magic. Go to wealthfront.com/macbreak. You can do it. You can right now.
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:21.280]   And we thank you for their support of Macbreak Weekly. I want to correct myself. It's not 12 million.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:25.840]   13 million paying customers. And that's a continued growth since February of 2 million. That's pretty
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:34.320]   good. Pretty good for Apple Music. Let's see. Oh, hey, it turns out the FBI did not pay a million
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:42.400]   dollars. There's a million dollars. Sources say it was under a million dollars to unlock the
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:47.920]   San Bernardino iPhone. We still don't know exactly. We just turned out to have nothing of use.
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.720]   Well, we did. Did they ever say? Yeah, they know. There was some there was some reports.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:58.240]   It's also it's useful in the sense that had they they know that they weren't in direct
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:02.880]   communication with anyone else higher up on a line that they're working independently. That in
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:06.480]   itself is useful information. Sometimes the lack of information is actually information. Right.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:12.480]   The FBI has the physical possession of the mechanism. This is according to the sources
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:19.040]   reported from Reuters. The FBI has physical possession of the mechanism. Sounds like it's like a little
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:25.280]   machine machine used to open the phone. But get this Lego Mindstorms project. It this it must be
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:30.320]   hard work because they say they have no details of how it works. It's like magic. It's a little
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:38.000]   fox. Yeah. The identity of the contractor is so closely held inside the FBI that not even director
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.280]   James Comey knows who it is says the source. They are still investigating. They're still
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.640]   looking at the contents. This feels like a movie that nobody would believe is this though this is
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:50.480]   ludicrous. This is just impossible to never happen. Right. No one's this home. Yeah. Well,
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:53.440]   I mean, if Apple actually knew who it was, they just buy them. Like, here's a hundred million
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:57.680]   dollars. You know, and we'll know how you know, like, that's what I know. That's what I would do.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:01.200]   Well, it was an IP box for a long time that just did something somewhat all this. And I should
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:06.160]   point out that when you have unnamed government sources as the source for an article, I need some
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:11.920]   guy making it up. You have no idea. Well, what it may well be a government source, but you don't
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:16.320]   know what their agenda is. You don't know if they're lying to you for a purpose. Right. Right. So,
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:22.160]   I wish, you know, I guess you have to do this. But as a consumer of news, I just want to underscore
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:29.280]   when you hear unnamed undisclosed sources said, consider that and remember that often in the past,
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:35.040]   those sources have had a hidden agenda. Yellow. It's the same thing with the Apple articles when
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:38.800]   they say like, Oh, there's feuding in the iCloud office. It turns out one guy was second in the
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:44.960]   coffee machine was really upset about it and texted somebody. I'm feuding. Yeah, absolutely.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:49.440]   Yeah, it's true in all on all journalism and unnamed sources are as good as the paper they're
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:54.720]   written on. And they're going to keep it a secret. The FBI says we are not going to give that
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:59.120]   information. Ellie, Ellie quiet. We'll keep it. I guess I said that they're not licensed to give
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:03.200]   them like they got all licensed to use it, but not to up to the company that made it
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:07.600]   to hand it over. I think that's really the bottom line of that.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.720]   And I have to admit, if I was the company that made it, I would still sell to Apple because Apple's
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:15.280]   going to figure this out. And then you're you will be not as useful. I think it's past already,
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:18.880]   isn't it? And they say it was already passed in turn operating systems. All right. Yeah.
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:25.360]   So there's a vulnerabilities, equities process created in the Obama administration where law
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:29.440]   enforcement, there's this process that goes through saying, here's the vulnerability we discovered.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.640]   We're going to we're going to now look at whether we should reveal this to the company.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:41.680]   And in this case, the FBI, according to Amy Hess, who's the agency's executive assistant director
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:47.200]   for science and technology, cannot submit the message to this vulnerabilities equities process
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:51.840]   because, quote, we do not have enough technical information about any vulnerability that would
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:54.960]   permit any meaningful review. In other words, we don't know how it works.
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:58.240]   What that means, Ellie, was they asked the president and he basically just looked at them, said,
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:03.440]   open it out and drop the mic and walked off. Wasn't that funny? Yeah. He's getting a little
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:09.280]   loosey goosey now that it's almost over. And he's getting kind of what? Yeah. I think that's a
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:14.640]   shame because, of course, any vulnerability means that we are vulnerable. But it underscores, in my
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:19.760]   opinion, the most important thing, which is you shouldn't you can never trust any company to
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:25.840]   protect your privacy. It's up to you to protect your privacy. Yeah. And I mean, the bottom line is,
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:32.240]   is a code longer than four digits is enough to go a long way to protect your privacy.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:37.440]   He's a passphrase. I mean, you can, there are means. I mean, the real issue, and this is the
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:42.080]   issue Apple, even Tim Cook has said this, is not for sophisticated users, the people who watch this
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:47.840]   show. But for people who are not sophisticated users, don't they deserve protection against
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:52.800]   hacking? Don't they deserve protection against snooping? Not just by governments, but by anybody.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:57.280]   And so Apple's trying to make it something that is just kind of works automatically for people who
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:02.560]   don't have the sophistication to do it themselves. Bad guys, I mean, state terrorists, that kind of
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:06.880]   people, they know how. Well, we know how. I remember the San Bernardino, the terrorists,
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:11.760]   they destroyed their own phones. They know enough to. You know, they're not, you know, so the chances
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:16.400]   of finding anything on this phone that they didn't destroy was fairly low. We should also point out
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:23.840]   that there is a rules change that is in front of Congress has till December 1st to change this.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:30.880]   Rules change the federal code. Supreme Court kind of gave it its seal of approval a couple of weeks
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:36.960]   ago and it is now kind of working its way through the process that would allow in the case where
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:43.120]   the government can't tell what jurisdiction the bad actor is in, because they're using
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:50.000]   tour or encryption that any judge in any jurisdiction in the United States could issue a warrant. That
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:57.920]   would be okay. And so the concern of the EFF and others is that that means that if the FBI wants
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:02.800]   to crack an iPhone, they go to the most friendly judge in this, you know, could be somebody in a
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:07.840]   backwater somewhere and say, Hey, you're on or we need a warrant and that judge is going to say,
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:14.880]   yeah, whatever you say. And so it really reduces the protections we have from a court in the warrant
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:21.280]   process. Just FYI, you might want to write your member of Congress and say, Hey, that would be
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:28.000]   nice if you said no to this. Phil Schiller says, Don't pluralize Macintosh or iPhone. In fact,
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.320]   it doesn't even need an article. And he said it in Twitter. Can we stop for a second? So,
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:39.600]   what happened with this is Michael Gartenberg, who used to work for Phil Schiller, decided to
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:46.080]   pull Phil's leg on Twitter by, you know, just making a comment about iPhones or iPads Pro,
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:49.280]   in sort of because he's a big fan of the West Wing as well. And there's that whole sketch about it.
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:52.400]   Right. And then Schiller decided to have some fun back with Gartenberg, because that's what
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:56.400]   you do if someone serves you a softball, you hit it back to them as hard as you possibly can.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:00.800]   And then this being Twitter, it's sort of quasi private conversation is in the public.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.400]   It is a private conversation.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:06.800]   He is a director marketing in Apple. And I think this is in fact, Apple's point of view is it's
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.520]   not Macintosh's. It's Macintosh. You have to Macintosh.
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:14.240]   Look at any press release or any comedy makes in a event. They pluralize them all the time.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:21.200]   Well, they say, as Phil said, you say to Macintosh computers or to iPad Pro devices,
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.720]   you don't have to say iPad Pro's. They never say that. That's in their partner marketing collateral.
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:28.480]   They don't want developers to pluralize. It's a marketing thing. Exactly. Yeah.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:32.240]   But they don't expect the press not to do it. I hope.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:36.080]   You never got a memo, have you?
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:42.720]   Not from Apple, but I don't know. I think we all got that really detailed email from Adobe saying,
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:48.640]   I noticed that you used the word photoshopped to a generic term for editing a photo.
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:52.080]   Here's the guidelines for how you should be using the word photoshop.
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:55.680]   IMAX is the worst about that. Anytime you use IMAX and it's not referencing their brand,
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.800]   they have a team of people sick. That's different. That's protecting a trademark.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:03.520]   Kleenex should have done it. Xerox should have done it. I understand that. That's different
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:09.120]   from saying, well, I'll give you an example. This was something that's always been an issue in
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:15.760]   journalism is, do you use weird typography, the company's own Type-R? CNET. Remember,
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:21.040]   CNET was all lowercase with a bar between the C and the net. Do you have? I mean, that's just
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:26.960]   all caps. That's trademark stuff. Do you use that when you're reporting on them? No, I would do
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:32.960]   capital ASUS. In videos, all caps. It's all those things. The all-cap thing is...
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:37.520]   If you're going to use Twitch in a sentence, you better damn well lowercase the eye.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:42.560]   Remember they did iPhone with an i-phone for a long time in BizPubs, which was always very
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:46.080]   weird to me because there's just no dash anywhere. That's a dash mail, i-phone.
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:53.200]   Anyway, it would be proper, says Phil Schiller, in this jokey Twitter to say, I have three Macintosh,
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:45:01.200]   or I have three Macintosh computers. If you say I have three Macintosh to me, I'll go, what?
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:06.960]   I have three Macs. Three Macs? Yeah, I'm sure Apple doesn't want you to call them Macs either,
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.720]   but that's fine. But for a tweet, it's funny, though, because one would say it's done in a very
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:14.640]   non-fatal version. One that needs never pluralized Apple product names. Example,
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:21.440]   Mr. Evans used two iPad Pro devices. That's very shrunken white. It's okay to do that.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:26.320]   That's his jokey. He could tell he's Josh in there, but there's a certain modicum of
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:34.160]   truth in this jokey kind. But again, that's trademark or ease. It's not something we have to
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:38.960]   use in our regular speech. I think it's a great... And actually, there was a great article in the
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:46.400]   Verge, Jacob Castrenakis writing about Apple grammar in general. And everyone seems to agree,
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:51.920]   Apple's grammar is weird. And so you see it in the press releases where Apple does, in fact,
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:58.160]   adhere to their no articles. So everyone who wants a smaller phone is going to love iPhone SE,
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:02.640]   or iPad Pro is a new generation of iPad. And they don't like the Vah. They've always hated
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.720]   you both speech and in PR, not to put a Vah. I think that's a Steve, though. That's a Steve.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:14.720]   Yeah. It's Macintosh. Macintosh. And that's fine. If you're a company, you should be able to do that.
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:22.560]   But it's a funny article. And remember, think different is ungrammatical.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:26.160]   So they just help... Shiller doubles down at WWDC and gives us a...
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:31.200]   Break it down. They need a little video about that at WWDC, like a little...
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.080]   I hope it says full Trump. It just calls us all idiots.
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:38.800]   You're an idiot. You're stupid. We've got great iPhones. We've got the best iPhones.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:41.520]   They're the best. That's getting buddies. Fantastic.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:46.960]   Windows is over. It's the losing market share that we've done in two or three years. Ask anybody.
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:50.160]   People on Twitter ask me about Windows. I don't know what they're talking about.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:56.160]   I don't know what it is. Yeah. The iPhone sock was not a failure. I still use an iPhone sock.
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.560]   It's a great... It's a great... It's a great iPhone.
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.200]   I don't want to tell them that they love the iPod sock.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:06.480]   By the way, this from, according to our chatroom from Microsoft's trademark guidelines,
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:10.320]   Microsoft trademark should never be used in the possessive or plural form.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:14.480]   So there. That's why lawyers have good cars.
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:18.400]   Now, in this new MacBook, are they... So here's an interesting question. The MacBook
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:24.880]   did not redesign it. They just opened it up, put a different processor and closed it back up.
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:29.120]   Are they going to do the same with the MacBook Pro? Or are they just go to Skylake? Or are they
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:34.640]   going to fancy these things up a little bit? The only thing I could see possibly is seeing a USB-C
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:38.400]   conversion. And I bought, and I should have brought it into the...
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:38.960]   Thunderbolt 3.
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:46.000]   I'll show it next week. The Kideo Thunderbolt 3 thing. And I put two Samsung Evo SSDs in it.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:53.440]   I cannot wait to use that with a Thunderbolt 3 port, which is not my MacBook port, unfortunately.
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:57.680]   I am going to get a device which shall remain nameless.
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:00.160]   Important question, Leo, is will there be a rose gold MacBook Pro?
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:01.680]   I mean, that's all anyone really cares about.
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:05.600]   Of course there will. But you'll never know, because we've got a Lego cover.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:11.120]   That's supposed to hide the fact that I'm even using a Mac.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:13.680]   This could be any... This is generic. Any computer.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:14.720]   But you should get a cover.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:17.200]   Any good functional computer that's lasted since 2012.
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:20.400]   Right. But I will say that you should get a cover. I use these spec covers.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.200]   Well, we actually...
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:21.840]   spec is great.
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:22.560]   These are standard.
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:23.600]   And look how beat up that is.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.680]   But just snap it off and now it's perfect.
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:27.920]   But like see these corners?
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.320]   This is why you have a case.
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:30.640]   Right.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:32.240]   Because those would have been... I forget a new one.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:33.840]   But that would have been a dead corner.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:35.040]   Yeah, that would have been dead.
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:37.280]   And stick stuff to it.
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:42.000]   It'll be the thinnest and lightest MacBook we've ever made, right?
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.280]   Always.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:46.640]   No, it'll be Skylake.
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:49.680]   Slightly faster processors, better GPU.
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:50.320]   I mean, it's all...
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:51.040]   I still would like to see...
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:53.600]   Okay, so Thunderbolt 3.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:54.400]   Yep.
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.040]   USB-C.
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.000]   USB-C.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:56.880]   Oh, they won't do that.
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:57.840]   It's the same endpoint.
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:00.720]   I mean, like the Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C are interconnect compatible.
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.080]   So you can have the same port.
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:03.200]   I still do that if you do both.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:04.640]   I hope they don't do that though.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:08.800]   Well, you can have multiple versions of each take USB-C and Thunderbolt 3.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:09.280]   It should go good.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:10.000]   You can go get multi-purpose.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.360]   Keep talking. I'm gonna go get you something.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.720]   I told Andy that
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:13.680]   Ethernet didn't matter.
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:15.200]   And I think of Andy almost every day.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.720]   You know?
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:17.840]   Because that was right.
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:18.320]   And I was right.
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:18.560]   Yeah.
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:20.160]   I reorganized my office.
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:23.280]   I have this beautiful library card catalog case
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.200]   like from the Boston Public Library.
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:28.480]   And I had to create a whole new drawer just labeled "Dongles" now.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:31.120]   So I have a dongle draw.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.920]   I have a little bag when I travel like a little makeup bag,
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:39.120]   those little mesh bags that is just one whole bag full of dongles to connect.
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:41.280]   But oh, you want to see something historically funny?
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:41.680]   Hang on.
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:42.400]   I got it right here.
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:49.360]   And this is where I'm not trying to make a nasty comment.
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:51.280]   This is a double dongle solution.
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.760]   I had to go because I had to hook up my...
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:54.880]   After coming back to the wedding,
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:57.120]   this was like one of my cameras.
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:59.680]   And so I had to figure out how to get the fireware connected.
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:00.960]   And the only way to connect it.
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.960]   Again, thanks to my dongle drawer,
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:08.960]   I needed dongle A to turn the original fire wire into the new fire wire.
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:12.400]   And then dongle B to turn the new fire wire into thunderbolt.
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:15.600]   This is not an ideal solution for anything.
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:16.080]   It worked.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.040]   Of course it's fine.
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:20.800]   And I appreciate that this is a really, really old fashioned
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:21.760]   connector.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:25.360]   But it's like, now it's like, it's dongles all the way down.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:32.160]   And when you, when you, you know, I'm going to hook up ethernet to my phone now.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:35.920]   And now that I can do that, and that's like this weird dongle to dongle.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:39.520]   And I've been thinking about like getting a shrink wrap to just like tie them all together.
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:44.080]   So that's just like one dongle, you know, that never come apart.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:50.320]   I'm finding that like gaffers tape is now an essential part of my hardware setup.
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:54.880]   Because I need, because I need to tape the thing I need to the other thing I need and make sure
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:56.240]   they never, ever shrink wrap.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.240]   Never, never take one without the other shrink wrap.
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:58.640]   That's all.
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:50:59.680]   How about a heat shrink?
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.120]   That's what I meant.
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:02.640]   Like I meant heat shrink.
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:03.680]   Yeah, not shrink wrap.
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:04.000]   No, I don't.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   So the one that I'm, the one that I'm doing for the, for my phone stuff.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.400]   Oh, I have, I have rolls and rolls of different sides.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.600]   You never know what kind of heat shrink.
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:14.400]   So it's like a rubber, but you then you heat it and it goes.
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:14.640]   Yeah.
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:16.080]   So you, it's like shrinky dinks.
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:19.680]   So when you want to either seal something or you want to put a little
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:24.320]   thing, you know, either, you know, label something or seal something,
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.000]   oftentimes you're sealing connectors with it.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   You got a little heat, you're a little heat gun.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.360]   Then you put it on there.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:33.520]   So this is the, the kiddio that I bought this, but I don't have a smaller one.
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:36.880]   It's too big, but it's pretty on the, unfortunately I don't have it here.
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:37.760]   It's a home.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:43.520]   So Thunderbolt three, you put two drives in there and you, and I put SSDs for, you know,
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:44.320]   best speed.
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:49.440]   And if you raid zero then, scare you, you get the full throughput of the
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.280]   Thunderbolt three, 40 gigabits.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:56.080]   But it's also, see, and this is the other thing that really is cool about
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:52:02.560]   USB-C is it is by its nature able to do drive a monitor.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:06.640]   And so this is in a way a dock just because it has two USB-C's in the back.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.480]   Is it a Thunderbolt three and USB-C?
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:12.560]   It's a USB-C connector that supports Thunderbolt three.
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:14.640]   That's the new, that's the new way.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.080]   That's the new, that's the new black.
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.320]   But there's no computers that have that except for the little one.
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:21.040]   The MacBook does, and then I just bought that HP thing.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:24.000]   And then, so this, I ordered this years ago.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.320]   It feels like years ago.
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:29.680]   I think it was last year when I got the MacBook from other world computing.
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:31.440]   And it finally came to the other day.
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:35.600]   And it's like, oh, this is for the 2015 MacBook just in the nick of time.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:35.920]   Right.
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:40.160]   However, I think because of USB-C it's going to be generic enough.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:41.680]   This is a dock, right?
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:46.160]   So the idea is, and it's powered, so it's a powered dock so you don't carry it with you.
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:53.040]   You leave it on your desktop and you plug in your Mac, or I'm hoping any USB-C computer
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:56.400]   doesn't have to be the 2015 MacBook to that.
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.840]   And then you get all these benefits.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:59.840]   That's the one connection.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:03.360]   One of the big things is that you have, I connect a lot of things for my laptop.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:05.600]   And having that all, sitting all pre-connected,
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:07.440]   now I got to just run one little cable to the wire.
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:07.920]   Just a little wire.
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:13.680]   And these would be on the proper hardware with the Thunderbolt three.
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:14.160]   Yep.
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:16.640]   It wouldn't be on the MacBook because they decided not to do it.
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:18.000]   But you get HDMI.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.360]   I did do some research.
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:27.200]   And if you do put data and video over the Thunderbolt three USB-C connector,
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.640]   it prioritizes video.
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:31.600]   So that might slow down your drive a little bit.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:32.000]   Right.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:32.320]   Okay.
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:35.760]   But there's a lot of channels on here.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:36.240]   Yeah.
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:36.640]   That's great.
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.200]   So it's, you know, I mean, you're going to get a lot of speed throughput.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:42.720]   So the Mac goes in here, then you get HDMI out, ethernet.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:45.120]   You get a USB-C out.
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:47.280]   You get three USB-3 one ports.
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:51.760]   So these are the fastest USB, you know, and then you get another one.
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:52.560]   This one is suitable.
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:53.520]   Let's get printing on it.
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:54.320]   This is a high.
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:55.440]   Oh, these are all charging.
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:56.640]   Charging ports.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.720]   There's a couple of them are high powered charging ports.
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:01.520]   So you could charge your iPad from there.
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:04.080]   That's a mic and a headphone jack.
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:05.040]   And then that's the SD card.
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:07.760]   So this is, I wish it had come out a little faster.
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:08.640]   But this is a good look.
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:09.680]   This look, this look a little breakout.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:10.480]   It's kind of nice.
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:12.880]   It says, please remove plastic film.
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:16.160]   I'm just going to do, I leave this things on to the bitter end.
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:16.560]   I know.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:17.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:18.240]   I can see you're lapped up.
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:22.320]   I'm probably buying a breakout box for my own MacBook Pro.
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:29.040]   Now, now that it's the Mac Pro starting to have a semi-permanent home here in the office desk,
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:32.560]   now that I'm using my iPad Pro for pretty much everything that involves going out of the house.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:32.720]   Right.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:36.400]   I am disappointed that the new MacBook does not support Thunderbolt 3, though.
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:40.960]   I got to say, and I'm hoping that new MacBook Pro will, it will, right?
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:42.080]   That's why they didn't do it.
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:43.920]   They want to make a distinction between the high end.
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:47.840]   I don't know how many people using the MacBook would need to.
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:48.240]   But care.
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.920]   Would care about Thunderbolt 3.
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:53.280]   Well, that's why it's a joke that I have that kiddio giant.
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:55.920]   It's bigger than the computer.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:57.680]   It is much heavier than the computer.
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:02.560]   So other world computing, let me see what they sell that dock for.
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:06.400]   The Thunderbolt 2 dock is $219.
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.200]   That's ridiculous.
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.600]   And it's not Thunderbolt 3.
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:15.200]   I bought it back when they announced it a year ago.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:17.200]   It took them a little while.
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:17.520]   Yeah.
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:20.080]   Firewire 800 port.
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:20.320]   What?
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:22.960]   I don't see a firewire port.
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:24.560]   Oh, I don't have this one.
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:25.680]   Wow.
[00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:26.400]   That's the new one.
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:27.920]   Screw you.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.560]   You got the other one.
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:36.640]   Every time I look at these boxes, I always see one spec that I really, really want that
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:42.720]   I can't imagine isn't imminent as soon as a new chip enters into the into the into the
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:47.840]   the the the factory space as like I don't want to spend $250 on this box.
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:51.440]   And now a year later, I can't get exactly.
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:51.680]   It's.
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:55.120]   What one did I get then?
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:57.280]   Is this not there anymore?
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:00.240]   I ordered a long time ago.
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:01.920]   Was there a label in it?
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:02.240]   And it said,
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:02.640]   suck.
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:06.080]   We finally made it, but we're not going to sell it anymore.
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:08.240]   Uh, is this it?
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:08.480]   No.
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:13.600]   It comes with a cable.
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:14.960]   That's the other thing nowadays you got to.
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:17.440]   Oh, this was $249.
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.600]   It's even more expensive.
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:21.040]   Okay.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:21.840]   Enough.
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:26.720]   Once again, Leo bought something that's now obsolete.
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:29.200]   It's that's what you do for your listenership, Leo.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:29.920]   This is for you.
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:31.840]   I do it for you, my friends.
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:34.400]   You want to watch the video of the new campus.
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:39.360]   Every month we get another great video of the.
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:40.800]   Apple puts up the anti drones.
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:44.240]   They haven't, you know, I think they actually, they're liking this.
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:44.560]   Wait a minute.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:45.920]   This one somebody else.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:47.120]   This is Matthew Roberts.
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:49.840]   Uh, competing drone footage.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:50.960]   There's competing drone.
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:52.800]   Now they're now they will bring out the drones.
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:54.400]   Now they will bring out the drone guns.
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:59.360]   This is the May version of the Apple campus.
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:00.960]   Look at that crane.
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:01.920]   It's a giant X.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.760]   What is it?
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:06.000]   It's a site for the next X games.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.400]   It's having a big motocross track.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:10.800]   Underground auditorium progressing rapidly.
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:12.000]   Yeah, it's all sealed up.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.680]   Got the roof on it.
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:16.240]   Not only in the round part, but on the underground part.
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:18.960]   They're going to want that finished as soon as possible.
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:19.200]   That's true.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:21.600]   That's I bet that's the first part to be open.
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:23.280]   I bet they're going to use it for the September event.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.680]   Oh, this September?
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:26.320]   I don't think so.
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:28.880]   I I wouldn't bet against it.
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:31.440]   It's looking at the layout of the campus.
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:35.920]   It's designed so that they could basically keep people away from the rest of the campus.
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:39.360]   And it's a lovely distraction.
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:40.400]   Look at all these tunnels.
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:42.400]   This is partly the underground parking garage,
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:46.800]   but I think there's also probably an underground railroad for Tim Cook.
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:48.720]   No, it's a Mario Kart.
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:50.000]   It's a Mario Kart track.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:50.960]   It looks pretty cool.
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:55.040]   I hope the Tim Cook called George Lucas and said,
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:57.440]   "I know you're making fun films for yourself.
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:58.320]   Please make another..."
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:03.120]   We know that you've filmed THX-1-1-3-8 in the end completed Bart Tunnels.
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:06.640]   We're going to give you our tunnels for three weeks to film whatever you want.
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:07.440]   That's a great idea.
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:09.280]   Either that or there's something...
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:11.520]   I got competitive with a large hadron collider.
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:13.680]   Well, I think of a lot of us not feeling like you have any cars around.
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:17.760]   When I was at, when we worked at the ranch, all the parking was underground.
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.720]   There was only a handful of cars and they were all hidden behind trees.
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:21.280]   Just very rural.
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:27.520]   So you went like either under the THX building or under the tech building.
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:30.640]   Looks like there's another tunnel in the center of the circle.
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:31.280]   There is.
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:32.560]   Yeah, so am I connected with that?
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:33.120]   The circle...
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:37.200]   So the circle is the entryway and then you go down to the auditorium.
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:41.040]   But I have a feeling you're exactly right that there's also a tunnel to the executive suite.
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:41.760]   No, I'm sure there is.
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:45.200]   So that Tim Cook doesn't have to go through public scrutiny.
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:47.040]   I bet there are horizontal bat poles.
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:47.600]   (Laughter)
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:51.360]   But he actually changes into the open collared shirt and the slacks.
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:53.760]   I bet you build the first working hyperloop.
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:54.960]   Yeah, totally.
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:56.400]   Shoot him in the matic tubes.
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:00.640]   And I bet you can drive a car from the outside to the theater.
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:01.520]   Like into the theater.
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:02.080]   On to the stuff.
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:02.880]   Oh yeah, guarantee you.
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:03.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:03.920]   (Laughter)
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:05.520]   These needs executive art and lot.
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:06.800]   I don't know why they would need to do that.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:07.600]   But I bet you that was part of the spectrum.
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:08.000]   Some reason.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:11.040]   There's a big door that opens up and the car can drive in.
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:12.000]   Right in.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.040]   You would do that in a theater.
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:13.520]   Look at that.
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:15.120]   Oh, they're really getting there.
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:18.560]   And of course, this is the pyramid that they'll bury Tim Cook in after he passes.
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:20.800]   Seven large cranes.
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:23.120]   Mountain of dirt.
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:25.600]   Still as tall as the main building, but I'm sure it'll go down.
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:27.040]   Or will it?
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:31.520]   It looks like the pyramid at Sakura.
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:34.160]   Parking structures nearing completion.
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:34.800]   Look at this.
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:35.680]   Wow, look at.
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:36.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:39.360]   Look at all of those solar panels.
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:41.360]   I wonder if they're going to be able to power the whole building from it.
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:45.120]   I could tell you that's a lot of capacity they got there.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:47.280]   If they were going to do it on the other side too, I'm sure.
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:50.160]   Bridges and ramps connecting the garages.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:51.840]   Solar panels over the whole garage.
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:52.240]   Look at that.
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.760]   And I'm sure there'll be more on the other side, right?
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:59:55.920 --> 01:00:00.480]   The best that $12 billion can buy.
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:02.720]   When you got money, you don't have to buy electricity.
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:10.000]   Frame to be lifted into a place on roof.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.640]   One big ass air conditioning unit.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:12.880]   Yeah.
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.960]   I wonder if they're actually going to...
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.680]   When this whole thing is fully armed and operational,
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:20.400]   are they going to actually do an extended video tour?
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.000]   Oh, I have an idea.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:22.640]   Sure.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.120]   Yeah.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.080]   The making of.
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:24.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:27.280]   I wonder if the whole roof is solar panels.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:28.320]   Yeah, it looks like it, huh?
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.320]   And way better than that Trump airplane tour video.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.840]   I haven't seen that yet.
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.200]   So uncomfortable.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.280]   Mr. Trump has gold in all of his faucets.
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:35.680]   Oh, lord.
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:39.760]   More progress made on an exterior of spaceship.
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:43.600]   I love the career class.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.160]   You just...
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.360]   There's no frame.
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:46.640]   It just goes.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.800]   This was the last Apple headquarters not built in orbit.
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:50.400]   Right.
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.600]   There you go.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:56.160]   Matthew Roberts now taking over the drone.
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.040]   Nice job, Matthew.
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:58.560]   Good looking forecast footage.
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:01.200]   That's on YouTube.
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:01.920]   I think Renee's right.
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.920]   I think the next Apple campus is going to be
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:08.160]   built 100 meters above the Earth's surface for tax reasons.
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:11.760]   You want your taxes?
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:12.400]   Come get them.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.080]   That was shot by the way on a DGA.
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.680]   The FANIM 3 professional.
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:16.960]   Nice.
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:17.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.240]   These guys have to be in the position where they're saying,
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:23.760]   we can't possibly stop drones without shotguns.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:28.320]   So we may as well pretend that we're okay with people taking these videos.
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:28.880]   You can stop.
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.160]   There's a lot of ways to stop drones.
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.360]   Really?
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:32.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:32.880]   Well, no, they have...
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:35.200]   There's tools to take them right out of the air.
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:37.120]   Just say.
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:40.880]   They're like literally pushing a button and they're gone.
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:41.840]   I mean, they'll just take...
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.360]   They've done...
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:46.080]   They have some that'll drop them nicely where they'll just land.
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.080]   But there's other ones that'll just literally...
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.680]   The drone will just stop.
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:51.600]   It's good PR for Apple to see this.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.320]   But yeah, it'll be bad PR for Apple to become more drones.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:56.640]   And it looks good.
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:57.840]   We're all excited and we're watching it.
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:58.080]   Right.
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:07.600]   Facebook Messenger testing Snapchat style disappearing messages on iOS.
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:08.560]   Have you seen that yet?
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:10.160]   I will try to.
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:10.640]   It was gone.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:14.960]   Someone's screenshot it.
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:15.760]   It's a we're okay.
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:16.400]   Yeah.
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:20.480]   Screenshots reveal the potential version of Facebook Messenger on iOS
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:23.280]   where users can set a time limit for their messages to remain visible.
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   I've been using Messenger as my day-to-day SMS application.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.760]   I like it.
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:30.720]   I think between...
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:35.440]   Depending on who we're talking to, I feel like I'm torn between all these different...
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:38.080]   You know, with Messenger hangout.
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:38.800]   No, we need one.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:39.360]   That's right.
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:40.240]   We need Telegram.
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.520]   Slack.
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.400]   It goes on my five.
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:45.120]   They're on my front page and I just decide which one we're gonna...
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:46.640]   Pan who I'm talking to.
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:51.200]   iPhone 7 leaked photos point to bigger battery.
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:54.000]   Do we even want to talk about the iPhone 7?
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:54.640]   Why are we...
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.200]   It's...
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:55.920]   They're gonna make one.
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.320]   They're not gonna switch and go into the hot tub business.
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:02.560]   They're still making phone.
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:03.200]   And you know what?
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.240]   When they make a phone...
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:07.040]   Mom will use one.
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:10.000]   This is the new Mother's Day shot on iPhone.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.040]   And with pictures of moms and daughters and children.
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.240]   It's kind of beautiful.
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:16.800]   Kind of sweet.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:21.600]   That really is the power of a camera on your phone.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.480]   Camera in your pocket.
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.320]   It's there when you want it to be.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.600]   When a baby's born.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.360]   I take my biggest first steps.
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:30.960]   My wife has an older phone.
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:33.520]   And my biggest reason for her to get a new phone
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.720]   is just to get a better camera.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.160]   Because you're taking a nice picture of the kids.
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:37.920]   Moms shot on iPhone.
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.360]   Maybe not the best headline.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:44.640]   Honestly, maybe could you...
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:45.920]   I don't know.
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:47.040]   Different word.
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.320]   Get the thesaurus.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:49.600]   There's got to be something better than that.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:55.360]   The major tech breakthrough that iPhone users
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:58.000]   have been waiting for is finally here.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.440]   According to the Boy Genius report,
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:04.880]   no more fingerprint reader that can just do it right on the glass.
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:07.680]   I thought that was an LG or Samsung thing.
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:08.800]   Oh, never mind.
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.160]   It is.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:10.960]   It's an LG.
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:14.960]   But Apple outsources all that stuff.
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:16.560]   They could buy it from LG.
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:19.520]   It's the first under glass fingerprint sensor module.
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:24.640]   They cut a shallow furrow of .01 inches.
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:26.240]   That's a third of a millimeter thick
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.720]   on the lower back side of the cover glass.
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:30.720]   And put a fingerprint sensor inside it.
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:34.400]   With their Supreme Precision and Combination Technology
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:35.440]   said the press release.
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:39.760]   In this module, the sensor is not exposed to the outside of the device.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:43.200]   From your point of view, the glass is smooth.
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:46.720]   The fingerprint recognition area can be indicated by patterns
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:49.440]   up to design of complete product.
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:52.000]   So in other words, you can figure out where the reader is
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.200]   by looking at it, but not by touching it, not by feeling it.
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.360]   LG Ino Tech.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:02.400]   It seems like more of a useful thing for a point of sale display
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.640]   or for an ATM display.
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:09.760]   Rather than a consumer phone, I can't imagine that any maker is so
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:16.560]   aggressive about removing bezel space that they would hand over technology
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:18.960]   like that to something that's quite so arbitrary.
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:21.760]   It's hard to imagine it working well for Apple,
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.040]   for any other handset maker.
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.760]   And I have to say that the reliability of the reader
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:29.440]   is way more important than the fact that the security of the reader.
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:31.920]   I mentioned CNET earlier.
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:33.440]   I worked for CNET for two weeks.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:38.320]   Was there third employee after Halsey Minor and Shelby Bonnie?
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.080]   Shelby Bonnie has moved on to other things.
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:44.560]   He's now a venture capitalist and a banker at Allen and company.
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:49.280]   And he lost his iPad at the Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport.
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:53.520]   He just got off a red eye, a little groggy, and he thought he'd never see it again.
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:56.080]   But hey, when you lose an eye device, what do you do?
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:06:00.560]   You turn on find my iPhone and lo and behold, he started tweeting this by the way.
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:03.520]   I'm sorry, put it on Facebook so you could follow the whole story.
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:11.520]   Lo and behold, he could see that his iPad was kind of having some fun.
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:14.880]   It left the Fort Lauderdale Airport and went to Graceland,
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:18.640]   stayed at the Heartbreak Hotel in Memphis, Tennessee,
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:26.800]   and then moved on to the links at Riverside, a golf course.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:35.760]   Moved on again after a short layover, Shelby was going back through Fort Lauderdale Airport.
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:38.720]   He saw that his iPad, he was on Concourse.
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:41.920]   He saw that his iPad was on an airplane approaching Concourse.
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:46.480]   He ran to the gate, looked over the passengers,
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.520]   trying to say, "You got my iPad."
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:48.720]   I mean, how you gonna tell, right?
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.240]   You got my iPad.
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:54.560]   In fact, he remembered you can make a sound, press a button, and they will go,
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:59.760]   he activated it, but he heard nothing, so he figured, "It must have been in the checked baggage."
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:00.240]   Dang it.
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:04.160]   He comments, "This is better than Game of Thrones."
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:05.840]   He's actually enjoying this at some point.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:12.320]   Eventually, the iPad came to rest in a suburb of Miami, Miami Lakes.
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:15.280]   He says, "It looked like a nice home with a sewing pool.
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:23.120]   Or spent $50 to have five Mylar balloons delivered to the house
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:25.680]   with a thank you card."
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:27.520]   I'm sure I a thinking of you card.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:33.840]   He says, or one of his friends says, "Friendly, it's slightly creepy enough for them to want
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:35.120]   that iPad out of their house."
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:41.040]   He left a voice, or actually, a reporter called, saw this reporter called the house,
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.320]   left a voicemail message.
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:49.440]   So the next morning, Shelby looks at my iPhone iPad and sees that the iPad's on his way back
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.040]   to the Fort Lauderdale Airport.
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:57.440]   He thinks, "Maybe I scared the person and they're bringing it back to Lost and Found."
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:00.480]   So he went to the website, filled out a claim for it for the Lost and Found.
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:03.680]   His phone rang, somebody from the airport's Lost and Found was calling,
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:08.080]   as described by Lost and Found when they called a second ago, Bonnie writes,
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:12.800]   "A fairly elderly woman came in a few minutes ago and said she had gotten the balloons
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:16.080]   and thought it would be a good idea to return the iPad in the airport."
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:20.240]   She said, "Thank him for the balloons, but please, no calls."
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.320]   He paid to have his iPad shipped home by UPS.
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:30.400]   He received it in San Francisco on Friday with a banner saying, "Welcome home on this front door."
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:31.760]   She's wearing a captain's uniform.
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:32.400]   That's no question.
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:33.520]   Such a great story.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:35.840]   So she left her iPad.
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:40.080]   She was driving back from DC and she left hers at a rest stop and didn't realize until the next
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:43.760]   morning and then quickly used to find my iPhone and went right back to the restaurant.
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:45.120]   She was at and luckily it was still there.
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.160]   Cautionary tale.
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:49.920]   Do not use it to try to go confront the thief.
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:51.280]   No, absolutely not.
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:52.240]   You could get killed.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:56.800]   Not only that, but a lot of the systems that use to triangulate the location.
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:01.360]   If you can't find a specific location, they'll give you a mathematical point.
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:06.560]   Apparently, there are a lot of houses where they just happen to be at a triangulation point
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:13.280]   between popular cell phone towers so that the find my iPhone feature will just basically
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:18.400]   point to not a vague area but this specific address so much so that a couple of these houses,
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:20.880]   they actually have signs up saying, "I don't have your phone."
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:24.560]   And terrible stories about how people bang on the door to it.
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:25.840]   "Hey man, I want my phone.
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:26.560]   I'm not even kidding.
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:27.280]   I want my phone."
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:30.720]   Isn't there one that's dead center USA and that just a lot of places default to that
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:32.240]   house when it can't find anything else?
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:34.080]   Do you love the rock?
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.480]   Who doesn't love the rock?
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:37.840]   Leo, I can smell it.
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:38.400]   I can smell it.
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:43.840]   I have to say, I wasn't a big rock fan.
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:48.960]   And then I started following him and I kind of, he's funny.
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:50.160]   He's funny.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:57.280]   I mean, former pro wrestler, beefcake, 44 years old just celebrated his birthday.
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:01.200]   Looks like a million bucks is another reason not to like the rock.
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:03.200]   ♪ Happy birthday to me ♪
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:06.560]   Happy birthday to me ♪
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.840]   Okay, it's not too self-centered.
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:08.720]   And he can sing okay.
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:09.840]   And he can sing okay.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:12.880]   He apparently does not like alarm clocks.
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:17.440]   In fact, he doesn't like really doesn't like, oh no.
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:20.800]   That's just a waste of a good alarm clock.
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:21.280]   Yes, me.
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:25.440]   And he really doesn't like snooze alarms.
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:27.760]   So he's created something called Project Rock.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:33.120]   His first app, or first thing was apparently some sort of bags.
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:35.840]   But the second thing is the rock clock.
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.920]   Which I couldn't find before when I needed the announcement.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:39.840]   Well, download it on the app store now.
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:40.720]   It's chief feature.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:42.160]   It has no snooze alarm.
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:45.360]   That is the number one feature of alarm for me.
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:49.760]   The best part of the current one is I can turn the snooze off on my watch.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.040]   No snooze alarm.
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.800]   And it doesn't just for waking up anymore.
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.560]   It's a motivational alarm clock.
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:55.840]   So you could set a personal goal,
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:00.160]   set your morning alarm, wake up every day with a new message from Dwayne Johnson.
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:04.640]   Are there in F purchases?
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:07.840]   Beep, beep, beep, wake up.
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:15.360]   This all morning.
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:18.800]   This wake up is brought to you by Cheerios.
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:22.240]   Get your candy, but directly out of this bed.
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:23.040]   Oh, I love it.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:27.680]   You guys probably fans of him from the Fast and Furious movie, right?
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:30.320]   He's supposed to be in the Shazam movie.
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:30.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.400]   The 30911 movie.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:33.120]   Reno 911.
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.160]   He was in the mummy, right?
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:38.320]   That's kind of where he started.
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.800]   The first movie after he, uh, it's a horrible CG.
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:43.280]   Oh, the scorpion king.
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:44.400]   It was the worst.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:49.440]   It looks like it's free and there's no, uh, there's no in-
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:50.160]   Marketing, yeah.
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:54.960]   So it's just, and the reviews are in and four stars.
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:56.720]   It's decent as an alarm clock.
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:02.240]   Ringtones are A plus and worth downloading for that in the videos.
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:02.560]   All right.
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:06.480]   Sure. Give one star to the rocks for the rocks review.
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.680]   That's fine.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:08.320]   That's smart.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:10.080]   Thanks for blowing my thing the week again.
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:10.720]   I'm just kidding.
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:11.840]   All right.
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.280]   I'm going to download it while we're doing it.
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:13.920]   I downloaded it.
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:16.480]   DJ, do you want to play some tones from the rock clock?
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:20.560]   It's, if you wanted, it's from Seven Bucks Entertainment.
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.960]   It's a great name also.
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:23.840]   Seven Bucks.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.040]   Seven Bucks from the long clock.
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:25.520]   Seven Bucks.
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:26.880]   No, it's free, my friend.
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:27.680]   I'm free.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:29.040]   Well, did he Murphy joke?
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:29.680]   No, I get it.
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:29.920]   Sorry.
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:30.800]   Sorry.
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:31.840]   I'm not hip.
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:32.480]   I'm not with it.
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:33.920]   I'm not with the kids.
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:36.080]   Our show today brought to you.
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:37.840]   Get your picks ready, folks.
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:41.440]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:42.480]   You got a rock sound?
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:44.800]   Make some rock sounds while I do the ad.
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:50.240]   Oh.
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:52.560]   You weren't kidding.
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:13:01.280]   Hold on.
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:05.120]   [MUSIC]
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:05.840]   I like that.
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.200]   Enter music.
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:11.440]   Oh, I'm getting this for sure.
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:13.760]   This is a manly clock.
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:23.520]   [MUSIC]
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:24.000]   Oh, okay.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:24.400]   You know what?
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:27.520]   Can't be long before he runs for office, huh?
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:30.320]   [MUSIC]
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:31.280]   Get off.
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:32.080]   Get off.
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:33.120]   Get off.
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:34.240]   And there's a new one every day.
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:36.960]   Oh, this is the best alarm clock ever.
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:42.960]   [MUSIC]
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:45.920]   You got this.
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:46.560]   You got this.
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:51.120]   [MUSIC]
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:51.600]   You know what?
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:52.560]   I'm inspired.
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.960]   I'm going to, I don't use the alarm clock, but I'm going to sit.
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.720]   Oh.
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:58.560]   Oh.
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:13:59.840]   Can this pull that?
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:00.640]   Give me a spot.
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:04.880]   Okay, that's pretty funny.
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:05.680]   That's good.
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:07.200]   And there's a new one every day.
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:09.040]   Sounds like Jason sounds like you've actually
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.600]   downloaded this and bought it and using it.
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:13.040]   Is it your alarm?
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:14.880]   No, I was just doing thorough research on the story
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.160]   before I put it in the dock.
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.880]   It is hard to find Apple.
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.560]   You got to fix your search, man.
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:21.280]   This sucks.
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:22.480]   Yeah, totally.
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:23.840]   I'm searching for the rock clock.
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:25.520]   I can't find it.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:31.120]   It's not like these aren't solved problems, like nearest neighbor and fuzzy logic and
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:31.920]   auto widening.
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:33.440]   These are all solved problems.
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:37.040]   I have a suspicion that that's the one developer that Apple's actually going to
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.040]   listen to and want to make happy.
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:42.080]   You don't want someone that big at WWDC.
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:43.280]   I can't find my clock.
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:45.360]   Standing in the middle of the aisle during the keynote,
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:48.560]   arching his eyebrow while popcorn,
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:54.880]   while popcorn pyrotechnics go behind him and all those laser lights are going.
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:55.840]   This is pretty good.
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.440]   I think apps with attitudes.
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:57.920]   I like it.
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:58.400]   I like it.
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:14:58.720]   Yeah.
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:01.040]   Let's do this.
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:03.520]   Wake up every day with a new message from the rock.
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:05.680]   Set your goal.
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:07.680]   Set your clock.
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:09.120]   Like it.
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:12.480]   Our show today, as I started to say, brought to you by
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:18.400]   Spooer Space, the place to make your new professional looking website.
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:21.920]   From a simple cover page, the perfect portfolio to your blog,
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.280]   to your online store.
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:25.760]   It's all in there and I love it.
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:29.200]   Now, Lisa has done a great thing with her new site for our new business,
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.400]   Artisanal Agency.
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:33.200]   She actually, Squarespace has a lot of developers
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:39.360]   who are working for you.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.240]   And she's hired somebody.
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:41.520]   He's doing such a great job.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:42.880]   But you can also do it yourself.
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:47.120]   They've got some new templates, by the way, five new templates with grid-style landing
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.720]   pages, infinite scroll.
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.560]   You know, that's the hot thing now.
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:52.320]   Related posts appear at the bottom.
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:54.560]   Author profiles.
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:57.520]   So you can have multiple authors and have each of them have their own profile.
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:58.960]   And search is right in the header there.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:02.000]   Your site will look like it's designed by a pro.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.640]   But of course, if you want to get geeky, there's lots of settings,
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:06.560]   fonts, colors, page configurations.
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:10.560]   Mobile, every site is mobile responsive.
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.400]   So your web, you don't have a separate mobile site.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.720]   Your site looks good on any size screen.
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:17.360]   And when you want to do an online store, there's no better way.
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:21.120]   It's the only place where your site and your store are so tightly integrated.
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:24.240]   People don't feel like, "Oh, I'm leaving the site to buy something."
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:27.200]   You get a free custom domain when you buy an annual plan.
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:29.520]   Great support 24/7.
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:32.640]   Many Squarespace users have used it over and over again.
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:34.400]   I have several sites.
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:38.640]   Members who have built or contributed to three or more active Squarespace websites
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:39.760]   now have access to something new.
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:41.840]   This is called the Squarespace Circle.
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:45.040]   Circle membership includes advanced guys to optimize support.
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:47.200]   Six-month trial periods for new projects and more.
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:50.160]   So if you're somebody who's setting up sites for people
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:53.920]   or you just use Squarespace a lot like I do, I know you do too, Alex.
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:55.600]   You can now be in the circle.
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:56.640]   You want to be in the circle?
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:57.840]   Be in the circle.
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:00.400]   And if you have an idea but aren't ready for the website,
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:04.560]   you can browse over 200 top-level domains and buy them directly from
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:08.000]   a new business for Squarespace.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000]   They're becoming domain registrar.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.600]   Squarespace domains.
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:15.440]   You don't have to have a Squarespace site to get your domain from Squarespace.
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:18.960]   Register for a clean, spam-free parking page
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:20.000]   until you're ready to start building.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.680]   And then of course, when you build a Squarespace site,
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:22.720]   it'll be great very easily.
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:23.840]   This is the only way to go.
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:24.400]   I like this.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:24.880]   That's all I got to say.
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.080]   I got to start using it.
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:28.400]   Squarespace.com, free trial awaits you,
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:31.920]   but do use the Africa Mac break when you buy for 10% off.
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:36.000]   And you'll show your support for the show Squarespace.com.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.840]   I'm really glad I moved my site over to Squarespace.
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:38.960]   I post a lot more now.
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:42.320]   Let's time for our picks of the week.
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.200]   Let's start.
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:43.680]   Let's see.
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:47.120]   Mr. Renee Ritchie.
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:47.600]   Kick us out.
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.440]   So I have two, but they sort of go together.
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:53.440]   In this fast-paced, ever-changing media world,
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:55.600]   we're all being told to Snapchat more often.
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:57.920]   And now Facebook Live is the new thing,
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:01.520]   because Facebook says it is and they control a vast amount of web traffic.
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:04.720]   So I'm having to do a lot more Facebook Live videos and Snapchat videos.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:07.760]   And we don't want the shaky cam where it looks like you're in the born movie
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:09.920]   and no one can see you because they stop watching.
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:12.000]   So I went and got at the Apple Store,
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.240]   they had a whole exhibit on different accessories.
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.160]   And these are from Manfrotto and I like Manfrotto.
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.000]   So they were easy sells for me.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.120]   And this just looks like it's very easy to carry with you.
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:24.400]   You can take it anywhere and then you just turn and turn.
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:28.960]   And it turns into a little clamp that you can use to secure your iPhone.
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:31.920]   I have a bunch of these, but that one looks really slick.
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:35.280]   You put it in there and you take it and then I have this little,
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:38.240]   I have a big one too, but I have this little desktop tripod that Manfrotto makes,
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:39.440]   which is pretty awesome.
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:44.240]   So if you just want to put it on your desk and do your Snapchat Live or your Facebook Live,
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:47.760]   so you can tell people just exactly how you are doing that thing that you do,
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:50.400]   you just put this on and then it's very easy to mount.
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.320]   Now Facebook hates sideways video right now,
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:56.480]   so you can actually turn it sideways to mount it, but sorry, port it to mount it.
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:57.920]   But I found this to be very effective.
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:01.600]   You just put it down somewhere, turn on the video, drop your phone on the floor.
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:02.640]   Oh my God.
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:04.640]   That was not a good ad for that plan.
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:09.280]   I was rushing to put it together, but yeah, but put it on.
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:12.800]   I've been using it for about three weeks and we've got a bunch of Facebook video,
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:17.360]   live videos on the iMore channel now and they all, it's been working really great for me.
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:20.880]   There's a couple bigger adapters that I use on bigger tripods when I'm outside,
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:25.920]   but this was so easy just to put in a bag and take with me and then just take it on a table and
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:31.360]   do app demonstrations or quick hands-on with a different device.
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:31.840]   That's cute.
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:35.120]   Manfrotto makes a lot, they're a big tripod company.
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:36.800]   We use a lot of Manfrotto stuff.
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:39.440]   Part of me hates unit taskers, like in a perfect world,
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:42.480]   this would be something that I could use on its own hand on another device,
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:45.360]   but for what it is and just to carry with me, not even in my suitcase,
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:47.440]   when my laptop bag, this is really hard to beat.
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:51.280]   And it looks like one of those Mars and Vades monsters.
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:53.920]   Because I could also use the tripod for the theta.
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:56.640]   I need a good theta tripod.
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:59.920]   It's no, actually, well, it depends if you're going to stream or not.
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:04.080]   So it is actually the theta mounting the theta.
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.520]   Oh, you can't put the tripod because it's streaming.
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:06.240]   Yeah, I'm working on that.
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:06.880]   I'm working on that.
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:07.760]   It's in the hole.
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:09.520]   I don't have an answer for that yet, but I'm working on it.
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:10.400]   Locks the hole.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:10.720]   It does.
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:12.080]   It's painted a butt.
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:13.680]   It's working on that.
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:14.960]   What do you got, Alex Lindsey?
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:20.320]   So I have one that I recommended a long time ago,
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:22.320]   but I want to re-recommend it because I was just using it recently,
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:25.520]   which is a one-two-three-d catch.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.880]   Oh, yeah, that was fun.
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:27.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:30.240]   And it was just like I was using it over the over the last week,
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:33.200]   and I was at Gettysburg doing some stuff.
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:39.120]   And I was taking some pictures of stuff and it's just such a cool little application.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.240]   And it's come a long way.
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:41.200]   I hadn't used it for a while.
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:46.560]   And basically what you can do is you can take a bunch of photos of an object from different angles,
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:50.640]   and actually it'll build a 3D model for you.
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:59.280]   And overall, I would definitely search the App Store for Autodesk,
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:06.560]   especially for iPhones because they are doing some revolutionary things with your iOS development
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.720]   is a pretty slick thing.
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:10.800]   So basically, you don't have to know anything about 3D.
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:12.720]   You can just sit there and take up these pictures,
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:14.160]   and it's going to build a 3D model for you.
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:20.000]   And this does, I haven't tried it, but it should integrate with,
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:25.520]   you can see someone taking a bunch of pictures and I can't believe that'll actually work,
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:28.320]   but he's got a 3D model as a kid, but he doesn't have to.
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:30.240]   He can just run him out.
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:30.880]   And he can print him.
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:32.240]   You can print one.
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:34.960]   Yeah, so but you can see how these models,
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:41.760]   and when you think about developing content for education or a lot of other things.
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:43.280]   Now, I will say that it works.
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:47.840]   The older version used to work with locations better than the newer version does.
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:52.000]   There was an old geeky version that was on the PC that worked a little bit better.
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.840]   I think they still have that, but it's come, a lot of the tools now for general
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:00.640]   purpose here, you can see it in there's the 3D.
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:04.080]   So you can actually print a, that is a cardboard version of his,
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:09.360]   so all of these things are, look child, I've printed you.
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:12.720]   So but but this is the ecosystem that Autodesk's building.
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:16.880]   You know, there's a printed version of from the photos.
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:22.080]   And I just think that there, and we don't, I have like absolutely zero relationship with,
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:25.200]   I mean, not bad relationship, but zero relationship with Autodesk.
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:28.640]   Other than I just really think that they're, that what they're doing here has been,
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:34.080]   watching from the outside has been really, pretty revolutionary.
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:35.280]   You know what they're doing on the iOS.
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:38.320]   And so I just wanted to give them props, because I was thinking about it while I was using it over the weekend.
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.120]   So that's my pet.
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:43.040]   It's an incredible app to have, just have on your phone, especially if you're traveling.
[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:47.680]   Like you will, once you realize you have this on your phone and you'll be in a museum or something
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:48.960]   and you'll see something cool.
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:49.280]   Right.
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:53.040]   And you'll think, well, what the hell I may as well see if I can get a 3D capture of it.
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:55.600]   And you'll be shocked at how good that capture is.
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:58.160]   And then maybe you will never do anything with this model,
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:02.000]   or maybe this will help you show off that cool thing that you saw to someone else,
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.520]   or maybe you can actually just send the file off to be 3D printed somewhere.
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:10.560]   I was using even an earlier version of this to do.
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:16.000]   I like, I'm now sort of obsessed with like art heists and stealing sculptures.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:16.720]   Right.
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:17.200]   I can't.
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:18.480]   I'm serious.
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:21.600]   Like I'll be in a place where let's see it's not butted against the wall.
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:24.080]   I can get above it and blow it all around it.
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:26.880]   I think I'm going to steal a 3D model of this.
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:28.400]   Not close to leather.
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:29.840]   Exactly.
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:31.280]   And you just feel like it.
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:35.760]   And it's such a wonderful thing when you get this thing home and you have this thing you can now
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:36.240]   play with.
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:38.880]   And it's a free app.
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:44.000]   The entire library of Autodesk apps, even if you're not really thrilled about this 3D capture thing,
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.360]   they have this wonderful suite of this 3D creation tool.
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:47.840]   Right.
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:53.840]   Is the simplest darn tools for creating objects that they reduce it to just maybe
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:24:02.400]   really just a theoretically like a screwdriver, a pair of pliers, a saw and a clamp and everything.
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.440]   That's not the four tools.
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:07.360]   But instead of giving you a hundred different tools, it's like here is something for pounding
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:08.480]   something into something else.
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:10.640]   Here's something for cutting something away from something else.
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:13.760]   Here's something for sticking two things together and here's a lathe.
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:14.400]   Basically.
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:15.840]   All the great though, which is.
[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:19.840]   That's the thing is it you learn how to use these four tools and you can build anything.
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:25.200]   This guy who's making the complete operational and functional BB8 droid.
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:28.960]   He's on exrobots.co.uk.
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:30.960]   Amazing engineer.
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:35.680]   And every single piece he's doing as a 3D print and every single piece he's designing in this
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:36.720]   free Autodesk app.
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:37.440]   It's amazing.
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:42.640]   For some reason now you have me inspired that I'm going to start just building a little printed
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:45.120]   museum of things that I stole from the world.
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:46.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.360]   You can just steal them.
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:48.400]   You walk into my office.
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:51.760]   I'm telling you, Andy, I'm going to start working on this where you just find something interesting.
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:54.160]   I'll just take a photo and print it.
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:55.360]   Any more than taking a picture of steel.
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:55.700]   It's a
[01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:57.680]   Yeah, it's a
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:02.880]   Well, sometimes it's sometimes it feels like a heist because they don't want you.
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:05.120]   Well, no, no, not that they don't want to.
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:10.560]   It's just that you have to like, how can I do this in such a way that it's very, very clear.
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:15.440]   I'm not doing something that's disruptive to any of the other museum visitors or something
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:18.000]   that's going to be destructive to the art piece.
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:20.320]   Like there is a
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.080]   I got it.
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:26.560]   I stole this wonderful piece of art from the Metropolitan Museum of Art Gallery 700.
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:31.520]   Fortunately, like a month before they banned selfie sticks because it's a really, really tall
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:36.160]   figure and I needed the selfie stick to get like the upper the taller angles of it.
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:40.800]   And so basically, I'm basically there like a like an ultra boy holding like a candle on the
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:45.840]   stick like walking around like every 10 degrees taking pictures from all these different angles.
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:48.800]   Squat the guy in the video just like squatting every picture.
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:50.080]   Exactly. No, exactly.
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:55.040]   And the only thing I didn't do was I thought if I if I just get a poker chip,
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:26:00.080]   a white poker chip and put and use the gaffer tape to make like a checkerboard pattern on it,
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:03.840]   I wonder if I can just put it on not the base of the statue itself,
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:05.760]   but the base of the modern plinth.
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:09.760]   It's on top of will they freak out because if you have that registration point,
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:13.920]   all these 3D catch things go together all that much better.
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:19.280]   And so it often does feel like I'm conducting a heist because I'm trying to get away with
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:23.520]   something that security may or may not approve of my doing even if it's not destructive.
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:26.400]   And and you're not co you're pick of the week.
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:34.160]   My pick is is this it's from 12 South guys who the the designers do this wonderfully designed
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:39.840]   iOS and Mac accessories. It's called the time porter and it's a I want to say that it's a
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:45.040]   travel case for your Apple watch, but it's actually multiple solutions at once.
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:50.480]   So because why am I why do I have the watch on the outside? Well, because it actually
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:56.800]   lets you take your your charger and actually coil it up inside the box like this.
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:04.400]   And you can actually like that so that when you are at your hotel or at your destination,
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:10.400]   you can use this as like a bedside stand for it. And it also has enough room on the inside
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:14.320]   to coil up your cord very nicely. It also has room for your charger.
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:18.960]   If you're if you're a sea charger, it has room for extra bands, maybe not for all of Renee's extra
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:23.600]   bands, but for however many of the minimum number of extra bands that Renee likes to travel with.
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:28.240]   And also things like you could also it also has enough room here that you could like have a battery
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:34.800]   like a USB battery charger. And then there there have been times where like I've had a day that
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:40.640]   checks starts with check out of my hotel in San Jose at 4 a.m. and then be on the go until I get my
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:46.160]   red eye flight at 11 p.m. And I wake up I'm after the red eye with a dead battery. And so this way,
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:50.960]   I could actually just stuff this in my bag and have this plugged into a US into a battery charger.
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:55.680]   And it will it will all it will be ready to go when I take it out of my bag. I've always had a
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:59.600]   problem with how do I transport this if I'm not necessarily going to be wearing it.
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:05.440]   And for the wedding that I went to in DC, this was my solution to it, which was to just like wrap
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:10.400]   it or wrap the cord around itself, wrap it around the watch and then tie it all together so that
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:15.200]   it doesn't all come apart. And I didn't have this for that trip. So this has not been road tested
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:20.880]   by me yet. But it's really nicely put together. If you don't have that if you want to make it,
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:24.080]   you don't want to have the sticking out. It also has a little plug here so you can make
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:29.040]   it completely self contained. It has a nice court keeper inside. It's not that expensive. It's 50
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:34.400]   bucks, which is a lot more than that. That's actually a very good price. It's nicely made. It
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:39.680]   doesn't it doesn't it's like a it's sort of like a leather at sort of things wrapped around what
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:44.400]   feels like a metal case or if it's not metal case, that's a very, very hard composite case.
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:48.560]   And it feels like something that you can toss into your bag. It'll protect your watch,
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:54.880]   it'll protect your gear and it'll stand up to abuse. But it's typical for what I expect from
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:59.920]   12 South products. It's not it's easy to say, well, we'll build a box that's built big enough to hold
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:04.560]   an Apple watch and a bunch of bands. And they would go to the next step and say, well, if we're
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:08.320]   going to have a box that's good, if we're going to imply that this is the great thing to travel with
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:12.400]   your Apple watch with what things would come in handy for someone who's traveling with an Apple
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:19.040]   watch. And this really is a really great solution always. There's there's no chance that I will not
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:21.760]   be traveling with this the next time I have to go somewhere with with my Apple watch.
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:27.920]   12 South spelled out calm. That's really sweet. Thank you, Andy.
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:37.600]   Great. My pick started with an anneal dash tweet after Prince passed away his favorite floppy disk
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:47.440]   of all time. This is a floppy disk. It was sent in 1993 by Warner Music to all the music publishing
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:53.920]   Rolling Stone, the music press because Prince in 1993 decided that he didn't want to be called
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:57.520]   Prince. He didn't even want to be called the artist formerly known as Prince, although that was
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:02.640]   something that many journals resorted to. He wanted to be known as this glyph, the love symbol.
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:07.680]   Which was a great logo, by the way. Awesome logo. He had guitars and everything. But the problem was,
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:14.320]   how do you write about Prince? No one has this glyph in their typeface. So Warner Music sent
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:21.760]   a floppy disk to everybody with a font with one symbol in it, the Prince font. And by the way,
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:26.080]   Neil Dash has this floppy, which is an awesome thing. Should have been purple. It's yellow. I
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:31.040]   don't know why that is, but sure is the color of the disk they bought. Yeah. Anything you think
[01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:35.680]   of that far out there, you couldn't buy purple. So here's the beauty that font is still out there.
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:43.600]   The Daily Dot found it. And you can download it from the Daily Dot. They put it on Dropbox.
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:51.920]   I have it right here. This is Prince Plain. And if you install it, you can have the font,
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:57.680]   the glyph in your collection anytime you need to show the, and by the way, scales beautifully.
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:04.400]   If you've got like a laser cutter or 3D printer, now you can just make one the size for the roof of
[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:12.800]   your car. Yeah. Or better yet, the roof of another employee's car that you don't,
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:16.400]   either you'd like or go particularly like, and who has left the car for the day.
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:21.040]   Now I'm on a mission because of course, if you use this font in Twitter or in a message,
[01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:25.120]   and the other person doesn't have it, they won't be able to see it. So I'm on a mission to get
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:31.600]   everybody to install the Prince font now, so that I can send you messages. It should be a sticker.
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:36.800]   It should just have a sticker. Otherwise, you get a square thing. It should be an emoji.
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:43.040]   A bit emoji. Anyway, if you Google Daily Dot and Prince font, you can find the article.
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:47.040]   And I don't know how long that Dropbox link will, you know what I should probably do is put this
[01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:52.960]   somewhere. We can store it. For the good of humanity. For the good of humanity, I could put it on
[01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:58.000]   cash fly because they're really good about giving us a bandwidth. And I can just, then millions could
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:02.640]   download it. It's still a good download. I don't know.
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:06.560]   Dropbox. Yeah, but in Dropbox normally has limits, but maybe they paid for like unlimited
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:10.560]   data. Yeah, you got it. So I guess you could still download it. All right, you know what?
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:17.200]   I'll give Daily Dot the traffic. They found it. It is. And if we could only make it a title of
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:20.560]   this show, I would, but you have to all download the font first.
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:23.840]   Like a secret club. We'll make that a prerequisite.
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:28.800]   I could put it on the Twit wiki. Maybe some of these. Any letter? Hold on. How do you?
[01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:32.320]   How do you? No, you have to. No, it's not any letter. I don't know. Actually, I didn't find that
[01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:37.600]   part out. How do you? That's a good question. I you just what you do is you know, as you do on
[01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:42.960]   any Mac, you go to the, you know, emoji and symbols. Only the funky keys.
[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:48.640]   Funky keys. If we look at emojis and symbols, we could probably figure out which
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:57.840]   which one it is. The Prince font. I don't know. I don't know how you invoke it. I don't know where
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:07.760]   it lives. How do you invoke it? You party like it's 1999. Oh man. The other thing I have came to me
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:16.880]   from Father Robert, who was this was an answer to a question somebody asked on the radio show is
[01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:20.400]   a truck driver and he wanted to. He didn't want to miss calls. He wanted something that would really
[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:25.200]   vibrate the hell out of him. And he did. But he didn't want to wear a watch. So if you don't want
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:31.920]   to wear an Apple watch, but you do want to be notified. Here's a $30 do hickey that buzzes like
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:36.720]   crazy when you get a notification. It's called the ditto. You put the ditto app on your phone and you
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:42.160]   can say who you want to hear from. You could even have discreet fau, you know, buzzes for different
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:48.640]   people, you know, five dot three dot one or whatever text emails calls. It will also notify you if you
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:52.240]   leave your phone behind because it pairs via Bluetooth. So it's kind of like one of those,
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:57.760]   you know, reminder tracker things. Silent alarm you could they have comes with a little wrist
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:01.360]   band. You could wear it on your wrist. Although I don't do it. I keep it just clipped in my pocket.
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:06.480]   It's a really small little thing. And when somebody calls you, no one can hear it, but it buzzes like
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:13.200]   crazy. Put it in your underwear. So that way no one will hear it. I can figure it well. Never mind.
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:19.120]   No cable. A lot of buzz. And here's the best part. It's not a rechargeable. It has one of those
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:25.200]   little coin batteries in it. It goes for a long time, they say from simple matters dot com. It's
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:31.120]   the ditto. And it's a name is on everywhere. And there's got the ditto app on iOS and Android.
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:35.760]   It's a silly little thing. But there for some people who don't want a more elaborate expensive
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:40.800]   way to get notifications. Like if you're you could set it. So if my mom calls, you know,
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:45.120]   that's the only one that will vibrate it. Like it's the emergency button. Something like that.
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:52.560]   Also, I love these remote, these remote things, because it allows you to put them in places where
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:57.280]   you may have you may have been missing tones elsewhere. Right. If you have a watch, it's easy
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:01.040]   to get things on your wrist. We don't have a watch. I had a I had something that's sort of similar
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:04.880]   to that. And for something that was super, super critical, I actually I was going to be
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:09.360]   going for a wall clock all day long. So I actually had one like on the on the back of my head,
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:13.680]   where it was just absolutely impossible not to feel this at the back of your head.
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:19.120]   Whereas buzzing in your pocket, you've almost programmed yourself to kind of ignore it because
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:23.680]   it's probably just Hulu app informing you that there's another episode of the Bob
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:29.360]   Neward show. Do you do you have phantom buzzes? I have to where I'm buzzing all the time.
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:32.720]   I'm on my pocket all the time where I feel buzz. I'm like, wait, there's no phone there.
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:36.640]   I'm going to buzz myself because you can do that on the app. And you I don't think you're going to
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:40.960]   hear it. By the way, it's waterproof. So you can swim with it. So you could put it in your bathing suit
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:47.360]   or whether you can't hear it. But it's buzzing me right now. Could someone do like a modern version
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:52.800]   of that old electric electronic football game, which is like the players just vibrating on this
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:57.440]   metal sheet. Yeah, but one of these at the bottom of like every little action figure you had it.
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:03.200]   You owe Matt. What was it called? It was a that was a long time ago. Yeah, just vibrate the players
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:06.960]   down the field. Oh, right. I remember that. You get it. Yeah. Yeah. Something
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:11.440]   automatic. I can't remember the name of it. Scammo. I can't believe it. We could feel it, right?
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:15.680]   It's a it's a pretty good buzz. And then you could have different custom vibrations and stuff.
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:18.800]   It's just, you know, it's not something everybody wants, but it's a little thing. Yeah, it'd be good
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:23.280]   for shows when you're dealing with someone and give it to them. Like cut. You know, this is if
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:30.960]   you feel a buzz, stop talking. Time to go. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. There is a
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:35.760]   credit wiki PDF. There is something called Phantom vibration syndrome or PBS.
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:42.240]   There it is. That's it. I don't think so. I don't know if it is. I had one of those. What's it called?
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:49.760]   I think I had one. I think one of my friends had one. It's so dopey. It's fun. It's so dopey.
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:55.440]   That's the days before microprocessors and LCDs. That's what we thought was fun. That's
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:37:02.000]   that's the best that we could do. Yeah. Does it say on that on that video what the name of that
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:06.560]   thing is? It's kind of a name. It's a disappointment. I think it's a disappointment later.
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:18.000]   Come on, chat room. You know the name of it. Something. No matter. Football.
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:28.960]   Matic. Oh, magic. Oh, man. Stratomatic. That's it. Stratomatic football. Is that
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:33.120]   really? We have the Tudor rod hockey table when I was a kid. Yeah. Actually, it wasn't
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:36.880]   Stratomatic. I played that in college a lot though. All right. Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:44.560]   we have completed this rendezvous with destiny known as Mac break weekly. I thank you all for

[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:09.280]   twit.tv. In this case, twit.tv/mvw or your favorite podcatcher or one of the twit apps on every platform.
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:16.400]   Renee Richie, thank you for being here. I'm more.com. And of course, many a podcast there at iMore.com.
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:22.320]   Anything you want to plug something big and debug? We just got, no, we just got a new,
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:27.360]   a new person on the staff at iMore. Mike Sargent, formerly of Newsy, he does a bunch of podcasts on
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:31.600]   relay FM. He's super awesome and he's going to help us, you know, be a little bit younger and
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:35.040]   hipper and use all those new services that we don't know so much about. I'm going the other way.
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:43.280]   I'm looking for more old people. That's right, Leo. Join me. Join me. Good. That'll be fun. I am
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:49.840]   O-R-E. iMore.com. It is the place, man. Are you guys just kicking it out of the park?
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:55.520]   So much. Alex Lindsey is with Pixelcore. You have to check him out. Follow him on Twitter.
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:58.640]   That way he'll keep you posted on all the things he does, including the other thing.
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:01.440]   And say silly things like, "Final Talk." I'm sure I've definitely got a lot of retweets.
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:05.680]   Well, what'd you say? I said that my success so far has been because I was a farm boy because
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:10.960]   everything in the geek world is better than shoveling manure. Yes. So you're grateful.
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:15.520]   It was in some conversation that came up and someone thought it was funny. So I'm not necessarily
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:20.480]   different from, but still better than. By the way, Capital S. Thank you to Stephen Capitelis.
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:26.000]   Yep. If you shift S, if you have the Prince playing font. I just want to say that,
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.840]   we talked about the watch. So we're sitting there talking. Stephen Kimbroe slacked me. He's in the
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:34.400]   company. He has lagged me. Capital S. It's Capital S. I looked down. I looked down on my watch.
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:38.320]   I was like, "There you go." There you go. That's why the watch is a great thing.
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:45.680]   And thank you, Andy Inako, Chicago Sun. Times, "My inspiration as a photographer, as a writer,
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:52.160]   as a sideburn grower." Oh, that's so lovely. And let's give credit where credit is due for you.
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:57.200]   That's such a great business model. You're going after an audience with retirement income,
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:59.920]   not after an audience with student loan debt. Exactly.
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:03.040]   Where are you going? I'm better for you. Yes. Exactly.
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:08.080]   Thank you all for being here. We'll see you next time. Now get back to work because you know
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:13.120]   what, break time is over.
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:19.920]   [Music]
