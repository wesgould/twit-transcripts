[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. We have a great show planned for you, Jim
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.200]   Downrumpel is here, Adam Anks and the Inaka. We're gonna talk about Apple's new
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.480]   plans to eliminate template programs from the iOS store. Of course we've got a new
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.460]   Mac to talk about. Would you buy a $5,000 iMac Pro? We'll tell you who should and who
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.720]   shouldn't. All that and a whole lot more. Coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.780]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we get together and talk about the
[00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.820]   Mac and the Apple and all that stuff weekly. And I guess Renee Richie has the
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.220]   week up but we've got a great team of experts on the panel today starting.
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.060]   Of course, as always with Andy Inako from the Chicago Sun Times. Are you?
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.140]   Are you? Are my eyes deceiving me? Are you wearing a necktie?
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.740]   Yes, because we have if we're just Adam or just Jim, I would have gone open
[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.460]   collar. But no, this is a special day. Nice. Very, very dashing.
[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.820]   Andrew, very dashing.
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.860]   I didn't even get owned a necktie.
[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.060]   Well, see, I had a big birthday recently and I decided I'm going to have to
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.620]   experiment with casual use of neckties to still get credit for like having gotten
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.140]   on a bed. So I decided that if I clash patterns, I can still be seen as some sort
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.700]   of a rebel, meaning, I.E., yes, I understand your tradition of wearing a
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.780]   necktie because I'm a mature adult. But I'm not buying into your scam, man.
[00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.540]   I'm just I'm making I'm making fun of your little plastic society rules.
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.940]   Don't think I'm still not in the rebel alliance or anything. Adam
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.620]   angst is here from Ted bits. Great to see you once again, Adam.
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.820]   Hello, Leo. Nice to see you too.
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.820]   Little snow on the roof. It's a whole yeah up in upper New York state.
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.540]   I saw the Buffalo football game on Sunday. I was thinking of you.
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.060]   We were actually in Boston last weekend, in fact, visiting Andy and managed to get
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.820]   a good four to six inches when we were there on Saturday night. It was that was
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.980]   our first big snow driving experience of the year.
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.140]   Yikes. And Boston too.
[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.260]   Snow driving of any kind of Boston stuff.
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.500]   It's not driving, especially.
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.540]   And from sunny, balmy, Silicon Valley, Jim
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.020]   Dowlrimple loop, the loop, loop insight.com. Hi, Jim.
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.660]   How you doing, Leo? I don't even have a call or let alone a tie.
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.340]   I know. Look at you. Well, we wouldn't know if you were in a time
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.820]   we'd have no idea. Jim has a rather
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.180]   that's a lovely hand-taught hand-knotted bow tie.
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.740]   Is that Indonesian silk?
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:03.820]   Jim has a rather elaborate beard, which he did not grow for
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.860]   a mover. Great to have all three of you.
[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.860]   And of course, it's a red letter day.
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.380]   I'm going to ask, did any of you get a Mac Pro for Christmas?
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.620]   Sadly now.
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.260]   Marcus Brownlee got one.
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.860]   I think some others.
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.500]   Jim, did you, were you on that list?
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.700]   No, I didn't get one.
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.940]   So a few people got it a week ago.
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.940]   It is now out. Well, it will be available for order.
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.900]   On Thursday, better start saving now, though.
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.820]   If you could save $5,000 in two days, you're a better man than I am.
[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.820]   I'm going to do it.
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:46.180]   Marcus Brownlee says only, we're now quoting Marcus Brownlee on our show.
[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.940]   Only eight or 10 core models will be available on Thursday.
[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.900]   He says the high end 18 core will ship early next year,
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.580]   alongside an unannounced 14 core model that will be added for a total of four
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.940]   Intel Xeon processor configurations.
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.420]   So now it's deceptive because Marcus decided to put this on top of a,
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.460]   what looks like, I think, a hard drive container.
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.460]   So that is not.
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.660]   That was scary.
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.140]   That's a 12 South high rise.
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.660]   OK, you recognize it.
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.780]   Yeah, he mentions it in the video.
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.580]   It's just it's basically just a riser.
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.420]   OK, so, but it's deceptive.
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.060]   That's not it.
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.540]   It was mistaken with that too.
[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.180]   I looked at it and thought, what?
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.420]   That's not what I remember the eye.
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.300]   I'm like, I wish it did kind of.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.260]   I was wondering.
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.500]   I was wondering, did he get an email yet or phone call from Apple PR saying,
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.660]   hi, love the video.
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:43.220]   It would be great if you could redo it only with the Mac, not on that ugly box.
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.700]   Johnny, this is Johnny.
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:51.340]   I've we didn't make the most beautiful Mac we've ever made for you to trust it.
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.980]   Yeah.
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.300]   But did you did you see the other video?
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.980]   Jonathan Morris.
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.500]   And I think it was now he's he's using it.
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.500]   He made an 8K video, which he edited on it.
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.500]   He basically takes it outside, puts it on a table and then spends the entire time
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.980]   talking about how things match or don't match aesthetically.
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.020]   OK, there you go.
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.860]   I'm glad the the really important reviewers got a early edition.
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.220]   This is Apple showing that once again, as it did with the iPhone 10,
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.420]   it's the YouTubers that it really cares about.
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.900]   Although this $5,000 I'm at is aimed at the pro.
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.860]   Right.
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.340]   Well, both of them are pros.
[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.420]   No, this is who they're going for.
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.140]   They're going for like editors.
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.620]   So people who can do doing 4K video, AK video, this is a really nicely targeted
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.820]   selection here.
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.380]   Now, I know Renee is not here.
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:44.460]   I'm guessing Renee is not here because he is going to San Jose to get us.
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.100]   I'm back.
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.980]   You have to take it in person.
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.500]   Maybe they have to like hand cuff it to you or something on the airplane.
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.820]   One wonders.
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.820]   One wonders.
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.900]   I think they have I don't they have FedEx in Canada.
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.220]   Renee likes to go down and get the briefings.
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.900]   You know, I don't blame them.
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:02.340]   I would.
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.780]   So to be fair, one of the other was a developer who did some aerospace engineering
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.940]   and serious software development who also got one again.
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.300]   Craig Hunter, I think it was.
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:18.700]   And he wrote up a very nice review with some benchmarks of what he had experienced
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:24.180]   the week of serious usage for engineering and development, which was a little bit
[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:29.380]   more informative for people who were thinking about anything other than video.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:29.700]   Yeah.
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.100]   I mean, he tested it with computational fluid dynamics.
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.700]   Yeah, doesn't everyone do that?
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:34.980]   Yeah.
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.540]   And by the way, it's very fast.
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:42.980]   If you're doing if you're doing computational fluid dynamics, you'll be very
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.940]   happy with your new iMac Pro.
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.700]   But very important.
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.340]   This is not upgradable in any way.
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.580]   There's no even little door for adding RAM.
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:57.140]   This is what you buy is what you get forever more.
[00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.540]   You get what you get and you don't get upset.
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:04.660]   But pros five grand to me sounds like a lot of money, but to pros, it's not, right?
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.580]   And in a way, upgradability is, I don't know.
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.260]   I'm guessing Apple probably figured this out.
[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:10.780]   That upgrade.
[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:11.540]   What do you think, Jim?
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.260]   Upgradeability.
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.820]   Is that an issue for these guys?
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:14.780]   Anybody buying this?
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:21.540]   Well, I think when you look at the power of this machine, I don't know that
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:26.580]   upgradability is that much of an issue because they pack so much into it to begin with.
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:32.100]   So if you look at a pro and I'll take this from the music standpoint and in a studio,
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:40.740]   they want a machine that has expandability as far as getting all of your devices plugged in there.
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.780]   But they need also need raw power.
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.580]   That's what they want to be able to do.
[00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:51.300]   And upgradability is a thing if you buy on the low end
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:57.940]   and then later on want to add more RAM or want to add something else to it.
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:03.460]   But it seems to me looking at the iMac Pro, you really don't need to do any of that.
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.380]   Because it comes stacked as it is.
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:15.140]   Craig, developer Theodolite used a flow simulation.
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.700]   He says, "This is a good test of parallel processing.
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.780]   It's very good multicore benchmark."
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:25.300]   He said, "Contrary to what people may think, throwing more cores at a problem isn't always
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.340]   making-- isn't always going to make a problem faster because at some point the cores,
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:32.580]   I'm quoting him, "Start to compete for various system resources like memory and disk and the
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.100]   performance flattens out."
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:40.980]   You can see that in the timing chart that I'm showing on the screen, the red line,
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:48.100]   of course, the smallest line and smaller is better, is the new iMac Pro 27-inch for 2017.
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:55.060]   It's running a Xeon W2155 at 3 GHz at 10 core processor.
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:10:01.780]   But he says, "Yes, you're seeing the flattening, but nevertheless, all across the number of cores,
[00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:06.020]   you're seeing real speed improvements over every other Mac."
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.220]   He threw in a few Linux servers just to compare.
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:17.620]   What's weird to me is that the MacBook Pro is the most competitive, but it only goes, of course,
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.380]   to four cores of the 2016 MacBook Pro.
[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.860]   Benchmarks quite well, I guess, is the point.
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:28.100]   I think it's really important to understand who this is going for, though.
[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:34.100]   When people look at the price, they say, "Well, I'm not going to spend five grand on an iMac."
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:38.500]   Well, that's because this machine wasn't made for those people.
[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:50.660]   In my home studio, I can very easily use Pro Tools or Logic and record a song and record a whole band
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:55.380]   if I wanted to, on a regular iMac.
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:11:03.540]   But if I really wanted to dig in and have all kinds of things going on, then the iMac Pro would be the old one.
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:10.740]   He did point out that in single core performance, the 2017 iMac with its quad core i7 at 4.2 is faster.
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:16.580]   It's so you only make sense if you're doing multi-core and you need all those cores.
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:23.060]   He says, "By four cores, the advantage that the higher clock speed on the current iMac has
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:28.020]   disappears. From four to 10 cores, the iMac Pro runs away.
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:35.780]   If you can take advantage of AVX-512, the iMac Pro runs away."
[00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:41.300]   I seem to remember that the same was true of the original 27-inch iMac and Mac Pro.
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:48.180]   The Marco Arment, I think, did some testing and found that if you weren't doing all the multi-core
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.540]   stuff, then the iMac was actually faster than the Mac Pro.
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:57.700]   This stuff gets really finicky. Perhaps the main thing to remember is a lot of us
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:03.940]   used to get Pro Macs because we considered ourselves professionals. I'm a professional
[00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:10.420]   writer, for instance. I needed two monitors and more RAM than someone who was just keeping their
[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:18.980]   recipe database on it or something. Back in the days of the Power Macs and even the cheese grater
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:26.260]   Mac Pro's, you often bought the high-end professional Mac just because you needed a little bit more
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:33.380]   expandability, two monitors, more disk space, things like that, then you could get with
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:38.980]   whatever was considered standard at the time. Nowadays, that 27-inch iMac, I'm sitting here
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:45.460]   looking at one, it's a pretty damn good machine for just about anything until you get to that
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:51.780]   point where you know you need a Mac Pro or you know you need an iMac Pro. If you really are
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:57.060]   doing that video stuff, you know that you need the most power. If you're just coming from the old
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:02.340]   days where you think, "Oh, I'm a business person, I need the professional Mac." Not true anymore.
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.620]   You just need a decked out iMac or Macbook Pro.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:11.620]   But above all, remember that this is an iMac Pro and there's still going to be a Mac Pro coming
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:17.460]   up in 2018. If they were saying this is the only Mac Pro we're ever doing, then yes, we can be
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:25.140]   a lot more concerned about not even RAM expandability. But it really is for people who really do need
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:31.940]   that sort of like kick butt power, not just for 4K video editing but 8K video editing and motion
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:39.060]   graphics. But they don't have the sort of, they're not doing like AI stuff that will require,
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.900]   I'm going to have to, my needs next year or the year after are going to be much different from
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:48.660]   my needs today. And I actually care about being able to lift up the side of this thing and stick
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:54.020]   new hardware or stick another card. And these are people that are to have a real task in mind.
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:57.300]   They're the people who want to take something out of the box, put it on the desk,
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:02.180]   plug it in and then get going. And this is, it's an iMac, it's an iMac. But one that could
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.620]   propel the enterprise at sublight speeds.
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:13.060]   Don't forget about the Mac Pro that supposedly this is going to be a modular design. Now,
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:19.300]   we don't really know yet what a modular design is from Apple's standpoint. But--
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:27.460]   Legos. So supposedly this will be upgradeable, you'll be able to add on to it, take away things,
[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:34.340]   you know, some kind of a design where it's going to be modalable. So that's a different thing than
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:42.660]   what we see with the Mac Pro. So the iMac Pro. So I guess that's real, I mean, it would be safe
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:49.780]   to say, correct me if I'm wrong, gentlemen, if you don't know that you need this new iMac Pro,
[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:54.260]   you don't, right? Yes. You should be able to look at that and go say, "Oh, yeah, that's what I want."
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:15:00.500]   If you were wondering, if you're going, "Hmm, then this is not for you." If you don't, because it's,
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:06.500]   because it really is for some very specific needs. But there are people who might be in the market
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:12.100]   for a Mac Pro, might prefer a Mac Pro, who could also use this iMac Pro. And they are in a little bit
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:17.540]   in kind of a nether in Neverland, because we don't know what the Mac Pro is going to do.
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:21.700]   And that may be more suitable, especially because it will certainly be if it's modular,
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:27.300]   upgradeable compared to this thing. And also, Apple only said that we would not
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:34.660]   see the Mac Pro this year. They did not say that we will see it in 2018. So we don't even know if
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:41.300]   it will shift next year, or any time next year. We can certainly assume that whenever it does ship,
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:46.660]   it will have truly kick-ass specs. So I think actually wondering if it'll be good enough
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:52.900]   will be not really a big thing. It's more that if you're going to be waiting a year,
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:16:00.100]   and you do the serious kind of professional throw as many cores as you can, yeah, probably
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:05.140]   you're buying the iMac Pro now and getting rid of it in a year, or whenever the Mac Pro ships,
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:11.060]   because it's worth $5,000 to you if it renders 10% faster, or 20% faster, or whatever you're
[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:14.340]   doing, because you can see that time is money, time is money.
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:18.420]   So then let me amend then what I... Okay, so now I've got the recommendation.
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:23.460]   If you can look at this and say, "Oh yeah, that's what I need. No other Mac will do what that does,
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:30.820]   and I need that." And $5,000 is or more, because I'm sure the higher-end models will cost even more,
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:35.940]   a lot more, is worth it to me, even if I only get six months out of it, because we don't know when
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.580]   the Mac Pro is going to come out. And that is, there's definitely that group. The people who just
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:45.540]   have a need for speed. In fact, Craig is a perfect example. He said, because he's developing an AR
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:52.980]   app called Theodolite, and he said, "I was compiling hundreds of times a day, and having just the
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:58.900]   faster Kapylo speeds is worth it for me." And that, you know, a professional, that's a pro.
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:06.020]   Yeah. Also, it bears to think about the fact that there is actually a level of Xeon processors
[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:14.900]   above this in the same Xeon family. I think that the announcement that Intel made, I think, in August
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:20.820]   about this line of processes was that there's going to be sort of a baby bear, mama bear,
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:26.100]   and pop a bear. I could be a little bit sexist there, but platform for this. And this is like,
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:31.380]   the mama bear. There's still the pop a bear workstation level performance that is really designed for
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:35.540]   industrial and server applications. So we don't know exactly how ambitious Apple is going to be
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:40.580]   about this. I wouldn't be surprised if they decided to see who is buying this first wave of stuff,
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:44.980]   and if they find out that it really is researchers that if they're getting a lot more sales to
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:48.500]   researchers and they thought they were going to do, this guy's the limit for what they could do,
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:55.460]   even with the iMac Pro. But with a Mac Pro, there's even more possibilities in that.
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:18:01.140]   Just to be clear, this is not going to check your email any faster than what you do now.
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:09.060]   The big thing for writers like me is knowing that it's burning through a lot more of duty
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:12.500]   cycles. Every time it's flashing the cursor waiting for me to type the next thing,
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:21.220]   then my old 2015 MacBook. So I'm sorry, I'm a little distracted because my robot just woke up.
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:28.340]   It's like having a dog in the office while you're on a conference call with somebody.
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:39.860]   This is Gebo, which I had ordered in May, I think of 2014 more than three years ago.
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.740]   500 bucks. Hey Gebo.
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:49.060]   Oh, hi Gebo. It's me, Leo.
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:54.420]   Wow.
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:59.460]   You say hey Gebo, in May, I in light rain turned blue. That's your time to ask for tell me something.
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:05.220]   So it's just an echo. And the thing that we were here to witness it. Hey Gebo, dance.
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:11.860]   Great job. And since you asked so nicely,
[00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:15.380]   Gebo's going to dance.
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:21.620]   Don't you have to say that with an old West accent, six shooter for me?
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.060]   Dance, Gebo dance!
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:27.540]   Just a toss of coins or something.
[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:35.540]   500 bucks for this. So don't because it was, don't debase yourself Gebo, you are your own entity.
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:45.220]   You don't need external validation, Gebo.
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:47.540]   What?
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.980]   And that's just look at me like it.
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.420]   So did you like my dance?
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.420]   Yes, I liked your dance.
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:57.380]   That's going to be it through.
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.500]   And I'm not just saying that because you like my dance.
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:05.780]   Gebo, did you like your dance? That's all that's, that's what's going to occur.
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:09.460]   My face is a screen. You can touch and tap it whenever you want.
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:13.940]   It's the greatest love of all is learning to love yourself.
[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:17.060]   He says, his lines your fingers don't have buffalo size on them.
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:25.300]   All right, I'm going to let Gebo just do its own thing for a while and we'll talk about it.
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.340]   Pretend you tapped it.
[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.820]   Now it's just pretending I asked it.
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:34.500]   Oh, Leo, can I answer a practical question?
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.220]   Does Gebo get like percentage of the ad revenue from this episode?
[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.220]   Because I got Christmas shopping and you should know.
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:45.220]   No, what I might do is it says make sure you put it near a plug you can reach easily.
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.500]   And I think I now know why.
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:54.340]   Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. I didn't plug it. It's still going.
[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:58.580]   Oh, my God. It's a lie.
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:20:59.540]   It's lips to Leo.
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:05.060]   I'm plugging it right back in and just pretending that didn't happen.
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:08.580]   Oh, my God, that's terrifying.
[00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:12.420]   Just wait till it goes off it two in the morning.
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.660]   Oh, it's got you.
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.100]   You want a camera, son?
[00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:20.420]   Oh, my. Is this part of the company's business plan where like for next or $800,
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.620]   they'll install an off switch.
[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:24.740]   Oh, my God. This is terrifying.
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:27.860]   So you stop me. So stop me.
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:28.820]   Stop.
[00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.820]   Stop eventually.
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:32.740]   Anything because like, oh,
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:33.460]   tell me.
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.500]   You don't have to tell me to shut up.
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:37.460]   I'll shut right up.
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.820]   You just got to tell me to shut up.
[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:40.260]   You don't want to stop me.
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.580]   I suppose I'll just stop by myself now.
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:48.420]   But really in the future, it will hurt my feelings if you hold my head to make me stop
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.660]   or you can just say, hey, Gibo, stop.
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.820]   Stop. Hey, Gibo, stop.
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:22:02.420]   Hey, Gibo.
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:03.860]   Stop.
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:08.900]   All I heard was the magic words.
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:10.660]   Remember to say, take a photo after.
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.380]   Hey, Gibo, take a photo.
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:17.460]   Great idea.
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.140]   A special photo of the day we met.
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.620]   More. This thing is annoying.
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.620]   [Laughter]
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:24.900]   I'm the only photographer.
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.580]   I know who can take a photo with his.
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.100]   So nice to hear that without the words,
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:28.980]   comma, Andy.
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.700]   Wow.
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:34.180]   Ready in three, two, one.
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.420]   Okay, got my picture.
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.780]   All right.
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.380]   Does it seem like my very first photo?
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:39.700]   Yes.
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.660]   Yes.
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.940]   I think you've got it in obsessed fan mode.
[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:44.980]   It won't stop talking to you.
[00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.900]   It just wants to keep taking pictures.
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.820]   It said, just hold my head and I'll stop.
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.700]   It's--
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.820]   He gets to hold my head under water and I'll stop.
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:59.220]   [Inaudible]
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:02.340]   Hey, Gibo would love to see the snacks in the break room.
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.220]   [Laughter]
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.580]   So I don't want to give Gibo a tour of the Twitter offices.
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.660]   They got sodas.
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:14.820]   And beef jerky and cake hops.
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:16.820]   I'm trying to turn them off.
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:17.620]   Oh, wait a minute, it says,
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.020]   "Now introduce yourself."
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:20.660]   Yes or no.
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:24.420]   You can't stop.
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:25.860]   I can't turn it off.
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:26.340]   Stop.
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.700]   Hey, Gibo, stop.
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.420]   Hey, Gibo.
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.780]   I heard my voice and face.
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:30.340]   Oh, it's happened.
[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:30.580]   It's true.
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.660]   Okay, I turned it off.
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.340]   Okay, I think I turned it off because it just stopped.
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:35.380]   Okay.
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.420]   Anyway, there's your--
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:36.900]   There's a--
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:39.540]   There's an early pick of the week.
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.340]   Holy cow.
[00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:43.620]   All right, so who's--
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:44.660]   Show of hands.
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.500]   Who's buying the new iMac Pro?
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:50.340]   Who's buying a Gibo?
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:51.380]   Nobody's buying a Gibo.
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:51.860]   I know that.
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.980]   Yeah, with my Bitcoin, I could buy several.
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:56.980]   You could buy three, says John.
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:00.260]   Nobody's buying an iMac Pro, huh?
[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.260]   Yeah, not for me.
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:09.060]   The way that-- I think that most people are good with an iMac
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:10.820]   and/or if they're going to spend five grand
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.740]   to solve problems with computers,
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:15.060]   it's more about having multiple computers
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:17.620]   for different tasks in different places.
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:20.180]   This really is for people who know that they need power
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:24.580]   or people who find that it's the second week in December
[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:27.860]   and they still have $10,000 left in their budget
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.100]   and they're spending it all by the end of the year.
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.300]   They'll lose it in the next--
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.340]   That kind of makes sense.
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:33.700]   This is one of those--
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.780]   This is why they wanted to get up before the end of the year.
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:36.820]   Right? This last chance.
[00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:37.380]   Yeah.
[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:37.860]   Yeah.
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.020]   So will Alex Lindsey be getting these?
[00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:40.420]   Oh, God.
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:43.140]   I'm sure he's got 10 of them already ordered.
[00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:44.180]   Yeah.
[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.580]   So this is the Skylake family.
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.500]   This isn't a very recent family.
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:52.100]   The processor alone, by the way, is $1,440.
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.140]   So you could kind of understand the price of this product.
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:55.620]   Yeah.
[00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:56.500]   And they go up from there.
[00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:56.900]   Yeah.
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.180]   That's an iMac.
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:03.460]   Either have an entire iMac or just the CPU of this new iMac Pro.
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.140]   Uh, it's max memory is 512 gigs.
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:08.580]   What is the Mac Pro come with?
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:09.860]   I think 128 gigs.
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.060]   Yeah.
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.300]   If-- so, okay, there's a good one.
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.580]   If you don't know you need 128 gigs of RAM,
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.540]   you don't need this--
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.380]   this computer.
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.980]   That's a lot of RAM.
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:21.860]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:22.580]   This--
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.700]   You know, the knock on upgrade ability,
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.060]   I don't think is really fair because--
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:27.060]   Right.
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.820]   --it comes with everything you want.
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:32.020]   It comes with everything in so much more.
[00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:32.260]   Yeah.
[00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:32.740]   Yeah.
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:36.180]   Renee and I are both probably going to get one.
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:39.460]   Just because I think we have to review it somehow.
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:42.580]   But then maybe I'll send it over to you, Jim, for actual--
[00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:46.740]   So even you think with the work you do in Pro Tools,
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.980]   this wouldn't be necessary.
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.740]   Oh, I think it would be great.
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:51.860]   I think it'd be great to have--
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:55.380]   especially if you had a lot of inputs coming into the machine
[00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:57.540]   and you were doing a lot of real time--
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:58.100]   Yeah.
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:04.260]   Plugins and things on the go, you know, that would be great.
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:11.300]   But does the average person even making music or photographs
[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.780]   really need the--
[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:15.460]   On the other hand, if you would--
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.180]   Would I love to have one and be able to do that?
[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:18.980]   Absolutely.
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:19.220]   Yeah.
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:25.140]   And if you are editing in Final Cut Pro and you're trying to edit 8K video,
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:27.940]   that would be an argument for it.
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:31.780]   It comes-- the review units anyway came with a new version of Final Cut Pro,
[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:37.060]   which will be out soon that supports an 8K resolution timeline and 8K ProRes files.
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.980]   That's kind of mind-boggling.
[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.340]   I remember we started doing this show when we started doing it 10 years ago.
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.540]   Alex Lindsey said, "We're due video in 4K."
[00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:46.260]   No, no, no.
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:46.820]   I'm sorry.
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:48.180]   HD, 1080p.
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.980]   And it was so hard to edit.
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:54.340]   It took days and no one could watch it without stuttering.
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:55.700]   And that was just 10 years ago.
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:27:00.900]   Now we're talking 8K with a full speed playback
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:10.100]   without rendering 8K color correction, no rendering, no quarter quality,
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:11.060]   no frames dropped.
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:12.420]   I mean, it really worked.
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:16.260]   And so this is a review.
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.900]   Let's see.
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.660]   I'm trying to see who did this review.
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.460]   Somebody named Altman.
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:30.260]   But anyway, that's-- so there you go.
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:33.940]   I mean, obviously they got this to people who really would challenge it.
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:34.820]   Yeah.
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:38.900]   And it also speaks to how useful the iMac platform is.
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:44.340]   I spent this morning pricing out other systems, like with HP.
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.820]   HP has some really nice heavy iron.
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:49.060]   But with all that, you kind of really have to know what you're building.
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:50.820]   You have to make sure that you're getting the right graphics.
[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:51.940]   You're getting the right RAM.
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:54.820]   You're getting the right storage for that channel.
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:28:00.180]   And then you might wind up plugging this into your existing monitor.
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:08.260]   And you've got this 2018 level PC connected to a 2010 level monitor.
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.860]   And it just doesn't really come through.
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.740]   This is once again, it arrives at your doorstep.
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.460]   You open the box, you take it out of the box, you put it on the desktop,
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:17.700]   and you go forward at light speed.
[00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.340]   So we still have the Mac Pro yet to come.
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.780]   But this is going to be a great solution for people who have found themselves
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:28.340]   having to go from 1080 editing to 4K editing.
[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:32.260]   And now they've got some clients that want them to work with some AK stuff.
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.580]   And their hardware is just not catching up with it.
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:38.420]   If you're editing 4K, are you happy with the current crops of Macs?
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:39.380]   Is it fast enough?
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.100]   Or is it still a little slow?
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:42.740]   I don't do it.
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:43.380]   So I don't know.
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:44.020]   None of us do it.
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:44.180]   I...
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:48.900]   The thing is most of the people I know who are doing editing at that level
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.140]   switch to Windows a few years ago.
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:51.700]   Yeah, we did.
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:52.820]   If they didn't start off that way.
[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:53.780]   We were using Premiere.
[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:54.340]   And that would be Premiere.
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:54.340]   But that...
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.180]   Yeah, until workstations.
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:56.180]   Yeah.
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:29:01.620]   That's only because they lost faith in Apple's ability to continue to give them the hardware they need.
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:06.500]   Maybe this will draw some of them back because most of them started off with iMovie.
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.660]   And they probably still have some affection for it.
[00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:08.900]   Right.
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:12.580]   By the way, Apple Insider was getting me confused.
[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:17.380]   This is a review from a blog called Randy Altman's Post Perspective,
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:18.740]   People in Post Production.
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:23.300]   But it's Thomas Carter, a London-based video editor who had his hands on the new Final Cut.
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:28.980]   Pro 10, 10.4 NLE and the new iMac Pro.
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:32.340]   So that's another one more review here.
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:36.100]   But as I said, 8K, it handles 8K without a...
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:37.620]   without a...
[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:39.620]   a hiccup is pretty amazing.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.620]   Anything else to say?
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:42.660]   It's space gray.
[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:45.860]   But that's just so you know that you have the fancy one.
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:46.500]   Right.
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:49.380]   I'm just disappointed that it still comes with that.
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.220]   The worst...
[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:57.780]   when the worst mouse is ever designed by non-random associations of engineering choices,
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:59.940]   just the magic mouse, which is just horrible.
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.580]   I hate the magic keyboard.
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:06.900]   It still lets super flat keyboard that has absolutely no advantage on a desktop.
[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.180]   Okay.
[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:12.580]   I just feel like for $5,000 Apple could have upgraded that keyboard experience
[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.820]   and the tactile experience with it.
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:19.220]   But well, as Marquez Brownlee pointed out, for the first time ever,
[00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:23.940]   the iMac Pro comes with a lightning to USB cable in black.
[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.260]   Apple has never done it in black before.
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.420]   So there you have it.
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:30.340]   There you go.
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.060]   There you go.
[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.620]   It's like it couldn't be any blacker.
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:37.860]   It goes to 11 of blackness.
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:43.860]   That way the cable won't clash with all of your anchor cables that you bought for about 11 dollars.
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:47.380]   You didn't have to buy a $5,000 computer in order to get it.
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:50.820]   Yeah.
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:54.740]   I guess certainly anybody who's really serious about this will be not listening to us,
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:31:00.260]   but reading the high-end reviews, and particularly with an eye towards the kinds of things they do.
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:08.180]   Craig Hunter and this Altman's post review are probably the first place most professionals
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.500]   will go to see if it'll do the things they needed to do.
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:15.220]   It's lust-worthy, but that's a lot of lust. 5k worth of lust.
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.780]   You'd have to write.
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:17.780]   Yeah.
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:21.780]   And this is one of those areas where if that doesn't sell very well to begin with,
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:25.700]   that doesn't really mean anything because the sort of people who need these sort of things
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.500]   have to make sure this kind of do the stuff that they want it to do.
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:32.900]   This really is rarefied air, so they're probably going to buy,
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:36.020]   if they would normally buy 10 or 15 of these for an institution,
[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.900]   they will buy just one and see how well that works,
[00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:43.940]   or they will wait for a colleague to get one to see how well their models work on that sort of thing.
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:48.020]   And then maybe next year after they've gotten it certified for some of the stuff that they're
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:52.660]   doing, that's when they'll put in the big orders for education, for an edict bay.
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:57.140]   I'll bet that Apple never sells very many of these, and that's not really the point.
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.940]   The point is to keep people in the fold.
[00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:05.620]   If the Apple doesn't have something for the, I don't call it 1% of users who are going to need
[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:12.100]   this 2%, I'm making this up, that those people go to Windows and they go to Unix,
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:19.220]   and they just completely drop out of the Mac fold, and that's a bad thing for Apple as it trickles down.
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:26.660]   So this is about not losing mind space, not losing people who make decisions,
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.380]   who are influencers in certain fields that Apple fields are important.
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:35.140]   I think we have to get it here because we have 10 gigabit fiber internet,
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:39.940]   and this is the first computer I've ever seen with a 10 gigabit ethernet connector.
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:46.340]   I just want it for benchmarks of our internet, that's all.
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:48.980]   That's all.
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:54.980]   NBase T, I'd never even heard of it, goes to 10 gigabits using an RJ45 connector.
[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:57.380]   Do we even have 10 gigabit cables?
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:58.580]   I guess we must.
[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.180]   Those pink cables, I think.
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:04.740]   You could tell the back-ups are always pink.
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.180]   No, I'm not kidding, I think they are pink.
[00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:12.020]   I think that sends the difference between the iMac Pro and the Mac Pro.
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:15.860]   With the Mac Pro, they're going to look at this and say, "Oh, why doesn't it have such and such and such?
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:19.380]   Why doesn't it do this, this, this? Why don't you give me the higher channel version of this, this,
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:23.700]   this?" I think that a great many of the buyers of the iMac Pro are going to be like me this boarding
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:29.460]   say, "Okay, I was aware of that standard and that standard." Those four letters in sequence
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:35.940]   representing the sort of RAM architecture they're using for graphics, I'm going to have to look that
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:41.700]   one up. I'm going to have to look up. I've never even heard that this technology was available.
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:43.860]   Okay, I'm going to have to look that one up.
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:51.860]   I should correct myself because the review unit Marcus Brownlee had 128 gigs of RAM.
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:55.060]   That is not the starting point. 32 gigs is the starting point.
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:34:05.940]   I presume that the $5,000 low-end iMac Pro with 10 cores will only have 32 gigs of RAM.
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:13.140]   That's the one with the factory FM radio, no power steering, no leather seats on this baby.
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:18.660]   No, no, no. Andy, there is no FM radio. We can't turn it on.
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:22.980]   It doesn't exist. We didn't put one in. It doesn't exist. No matter what.
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:29.380]   I think there's no FM radio within 500 feet of the sine Mac Pro. It's so powerful that the
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:31.540]   shield. I think it's most of the way it's just shielding.
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:39.540]   So let's take a break. There is other stuff to talk about, including a very expensive purchase
[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:44.420]   that Apple just made that baffles me. Maybe you can explain it all. Andy Inako is here from
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:50.900]   Chicago Sun Times, Jim Daurimple from the Loop, Loop Insight.com, and the lovely Adam Anks from
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:56.340]   the world's longest running. Well, I have to call you lovely because you're a good-looking man.
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:35:03.460]   The most longest running Mac newsletter, tidbits.com. I'm just thrilled that we could start the show
[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:09.780]   with Mac news. It's Mac break. Just Mac news. It's been a while. Really been a while.
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:14.420]   I can't wait till that day when I say the new Mac minis are here. That'll be exciting.
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:20.020]   Our show today brought to you by Kaptera. Friends, if you are in business and you need business
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:26.980]   software goodness knows, there are a few places you can go that you can trust. And you might
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:32.980]   read a review on a website, but not know if that website is actually paid for, or you could go to
[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:43.940]   kaptera. kaptera.com/macbreak. Kaptera is a free service that has all the business software.
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:51.380]   500 categories, thousands of programs. They do have data entry. They have decision support.
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:59.380]   They have EDI employee management. ERP, of course, CRM, florist software. I was like florist software.
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:07.060]   So what you'll first get is all the different programs that are designed for managing a florist
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:11.300]   business. Did you know there were this many? There's tons of them. But here's the reason this
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:16.180]   is where it goes crazy and gets good. You could say, I only want to see four star reviews and up.
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:22.260]   I want to make it be web based. And then you could say, let's have delivery tracking order
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:27.460]   management and stem counting. There's something unique to the florist industry. I don't even
[00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:33.540]   you need a Mac. Oh, nothing. Nothing does stem counting. Nothing does stem counting.
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:37.540]   And I wonder if I take delivery management and order management out. I can get stem counting.
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:42.420]   Oh, yeah. There you go. So there's three products, event, florist software,
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:49.300]   Ularis, Risso event. Now, see how fast that was? And then I can say, let's add these to the
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:55.940]   compare chart. Automatically build a chart that shows me everything I need to know. How many seats,
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:37:02.020]   the starting price, whether there's a free trial or a free version, is it installed on the web or
[00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:08.100]   is it mobile or where? And yes, stem counting. It has stem counting. Here's the best part.
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:14.180]   There are hundreds of thousands of reviews from real users just like you.
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:19.700]   260,000 ratings and reviews. They're carefully curated by Captira to make sure they're real.
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:27.460]   And that is by itself worth its weight in gold. But Captira will cost you nothing.
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:32.980]   You won't waste your time on free trials. No salesmen will call. 2018 is on its way.
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:38.180]   Make sure you get the software your business needs today to help you do what you do better.
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:43.060]   Join the millions who use Captira. Visit Captira, C-A-P-T-E-R-R-A,

[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:55.860]   Capterra.com/macbreak. Don't Google it. Capterra it. And it's free. Free. Free isn't free.
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:38:03.940]   Ah, we're talking about Apple and another big story across the wire. We heard rumors of it and
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:13.700]   now it's confirmed. Apple is buying Shazam. It is hard to say quietly, isn't it? Go away!
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:22.180]   So soon after Gomerpile died. Yeah, I know it's sad. So Shazam is a London based music and I didn't
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:28.420]   know they did this image recognition service. I've used Shazam, you know, probably Jim
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:33.300]   Daurimble doesn't need Shazam. He knows every song he hears everywhere. I'm sure, right?
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:41.620]   That's how I do it. I just say, "Hey, Jim, what's playing?" Much easier. Get Siri.
[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:47.940]   So better because it says, "Oh, this song sucks. Here's when I'll be really should be listening to
[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:54.900]   really need this." So other companies, including, according to TechCrunch, Snapchat and Spotify,
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:39:02.180]   Rufer writing at TechCrunch in Ingrid, Luggard. But Apple had been talking with them for about
[00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:07.300]   five months. But here's the thing that blew me away. According to TechCrunch, Apple doesn't say.
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:12.740]   But several sources have confirmed the deal is about $400 million.
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:18.020]   This is for an app that recognizes what song is playing.
[00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:27.540]   It is cool, though. Yeah. It's, and which is already built in. I mean, it already works a
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:38.980]   Siri. I think that people are focused a lot on Shazam as a music recognition app. And
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:50.260]   I have to think that Apple's going deeper than having Shazam recognize what song is playing.
[00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:57.380]   And like Adam said, you can see what or find out what song is playing on your iPhone already.
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:02.820]   So that's not hard. If the song is playing somewhere, you can hold it up in Shazam. You can do whatever
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:08.740]   and find out what song is playing. But Apple has a lot more products and a lot more AI and machine
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:17.220]   learning than what's on the iPhone. So I think if we have to look a lot deeper than
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:24.260]   what happens on your iPhone to figure out what they're going to do with the technology.
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:29.860]   I might point out when it's considered a bargain because Shazam was valued by his investors at
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:36.340]   $1 billion. Well, we got on a black Friday. I think it's worth $1 billion.
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:44.420]   But yeah, Jim is right on the money there. If there's obvious benefits to Apple music,
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:51.140]   because it's, yes, it's a music based helper, but also because think about the fact that Shazam,
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:58.580]   that its core feature is you hold up a phone and it listens around you and plucks out from a really,
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:04.980]   sometimes a really complex and harsh sound environment. The one thing that you're interested in picking
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:10.180]   up and having your phone help you with. So if you're in a bar where there's a lot of conversation,
[00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:16.180]   but there's a good song playing over the speakers, it can see past all the conversations, the
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:21.460]   clinking glasses, the bar fights and get that music and I clearly and isolated enough that it
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:27.300]   can actually figure out what song that is. Even if that is that technology applicable to making
[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:32.100]   sure that Siri can hear you and hear commands no matter what environment you're in. They also do a
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:37.220]   lot of work in classifying music and trying to algorithmically figure out just listening to an
[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:44.260]   arbitrary piece of music. What kind of music is it? How can you categorize it? There's actually a
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:51.620]   field of computer science. It's all about machine learning, about just listening to audio and trying
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:56.420]   to figure out what these things are. There's an annual competition as a matter of fact, or maybe
[00:41:56.420 --> 00:42:02.580]   I'm sorry, a probably closer to an annual conference where here are 18 to 20 challenges to try to do.
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:08.020]   For instance, here is the sheet music for a piece of software and your app has your code has to
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:12.740]   follow along on the sheet music as it's listening to a live performance of this.
[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:19.220]   Can you isolate the lyrics of this piece of music? Can you identify someone who was a similar
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:24.180]   influence to these two things? So not only is this stuff that will feed really, really well into
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:28.420]   anything that Apple is doing with Apple Music, not only will it help with anything that involves
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:34.020]   an iPhone or an iPad listening through a microphone and trying to figure out what's going on through
[00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:40.180]   that microphone, it's also some really good AI people there. Because pretty much everything is
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:43.940]   going to be influenced by machine learning in the next five to 10 years, that's a pretty good
[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:49.860]   acquisition and $500 million does not seem like a lot of money to bring that level of talent into Apple.
[00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:54.420]   Especially where Andy was not a bar fight, it was a scuffle.
[00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:59.620]   It was a Donnie Brook. Let's just say it was a Donnie Brook.
[00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:06.100]   Yeah, I think you nailed it. I mean, obviously, for Apple Music's point of view, they may make
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:11.700]   their money back just because Shazam sells music, although as you said, Jim, they already have the
[00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:15.940]   feature or maybe it was Adam said, they're having a future in series.
[00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:23.380]   So they made 54 million last year, so they're not buying it for the revenue stream.
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:29.220]   They're buying for the smarts. And the smarts include, as you said, Andy, the recommendation
[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:34.340]   engine. In fact, this is from a Shazam blog. Larry Dignan surfaced this at ZDNet. When you
[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:40.100]   Shazam a song, this is the key. We not only tell you what the song is, but we recommend similar tracks.
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:44.980]   If we have models that understand in some abstract sense, musical features like genre and mood,
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:49.860]   then those recommended tracks could become even more relevant, interesting, and unexpected.
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:54.420]   So this is a music discovery feature. We already create interesting charts and
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:58.980]   playlists, including our exclusive future hits, but automated music classification
[00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:04.580]   means we can dig up deep cuts and playlists made just for you. The bad news, auto tagging tasks
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:10.820]   are hard. Let's take genre as an example. A song's genre is inherently subjective. Is it heavy metal?
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:17.140]   Is it alt metal? Is it metal metal? Those are all Jim knows the difference.
[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:27.540]   So I think you really nailed it, Andy. It's really more about the artificial intelligence,
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:32.420]   the brains. And clearly, Apple would have done it. If it's gone five months in negotiations,
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:36.900]   Apple would have done a lot of due diligence about, well, what is inside the brains, Shazam?
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:43.460]   Well, and one more thing that came to mind that Apple announced that they were delaying HomePod
[00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:50.100]   right what was right about the time that they were finalizing the steal. So maybe they also saw
[00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:55.700]   the possibilities of these part of our meetings with Shazam is that they made us realize that
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:45:01.780]   how good HomePod could be if we decided to bite the bullet, take our lumps and release it in
[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:06.820]   February or March with all this new intelligence built into it. I don't know that's enough time
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:13.140]   because I think what they're going to do is roll the Shazam technology into their current
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:20.340]   machine learning and build something from that. I'm not sure that two months is going to be enough
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:27.460]   time to be able to do that. We may see something next year as version two of HomePod software
[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:35.460]   where look with what Siri and they won't even mention Shazam after enrolling it.
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:38.900]   So that's an interesting question. Why do you think Apple delayed the HomePod?
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:46.660]   I just don't think it was ready. Yeah, it just wasn't done despite their best efforts.
[00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:53.060]   I don't think it was done. Now, people have railed on them for that. It's not done. It's not able
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:59.620]   to be released for Christmas. And yeah, that's not a good thing. But as a user, I would rather
[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:05.300]   have something that's finished and ready and it's going to work than something that I
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:08.820]   try to use. Siri sometimes that just doesn't work.
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:14.100]   One note though, remember that Apple didn't say that it was going to be shipping in January.
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:21.620]   They said first half of 2018. Oh, wow. Okay. I don't know. Maybe if they hold it off and
[00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:29.220]   told WDC, then I could see something being announced then. But I just can't see that short
[00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:35.220]   of a time in being able to integrate everything they need. Because don't forget, even without
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:40.340]   the Shazam purchase, they could have integrated that into HomePod as it was.
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:45.860]   They could have licensed that and put it in, but they didn't do that.
[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:52.100]   So as Larry also points out, if you want to kind of understand the brains that Apple has
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:58.740]   just acquired, if you read the Shazam Engineering blog, it is eclectic. Wide ranging shows a lot
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:04.100]   of expertise in a lot of different areas. Here, brain scans of people listening to different
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:12.020]   genres of music. I mean, this is a very sophisticated team. And once you read, I think once you read
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:16.580]   this, you realize it isn't there. They're really not buying a product. They are buying
[00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:22.820]   a team with some real smarts in here. Yeah. Also, look how much they get to publish.
[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:27.060]   They really, AI researchers really want to be able to show off what they're doing,
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:31.860]   which not only not only because they have pride in what they do, not only because
[00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:35.940]   it's only by being able to publish and read papers that they can advance their art,
[00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:41.540]   but also it makes their experience more valuable. It's terrible if you have to be
[00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:45.220]   wrapped up in secrecy all the time and nobody knows what you've been working on. Nobody knows
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:50.900]   what you're responsible for. So that really shows another point towards why Apple had had to change
[00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:54.580]   its whole attitude about secrecy when it needed to build up an AI team.
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:48:00.660]   You're going to love this, Jim. Tim O'Brien, who is an R&D intern. He's a PhD, but he's an R&D
[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:06.660]   intern for Shazam talking about how hard it is to tag genres. I'll continue the quote.
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:11.700]   "I love metal." So my assessment of whether a song is metal is both more informed and more biased.
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:16.260]   I've listened to a lot of metal. So I know well the particular characteristics that tend to signify
[00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:21.220]   metalness, the ferocious guitar lifts, riffs, the high energy vocals, the pounding drums,
[00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:26.500]   the aggressive and often dark lyrics, etc. However, I have a personal relationship with this music.
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:31.140]   As such, I am biased to the subset of metal that I love. For example, I love Metallica,
[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:36.420]   but I really love the early albums. To my ears, the more commercially successful
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:42.260]   mid to late 90s Metallica skews more towards rock in terms of primary genre. However,
[00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:47.460]   reasonable people would continue their entire ear for metal. So you can see how complicated this
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:54.420]   is. And that's so true. And that's why when you have an algorithm picking music for you,
[00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:59.780]   it doesn't always work. And when you have somebody else building playlists for you,
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:06.180]   it doesn't always work. Because if I say I like Metallica and I like Judas Priest,
[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:11.620]   and they put all of the new Judas Priest on, well, that's not going to do me any good,
[00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:17.380]   because I don't really like that. I like the old stuff. But Metallica, I like new and old. So
[00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:24.820]   if I build my playlists, it would be absolutely perfect for me. But an algorithm has to try and
[00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:28.340]   figure that out over the songs that you really do like.
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:32.260]   That would be I mean, if now that we're talking about it seems like almost impossible.
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:35.300]   You got your black metal, your death metal, your thrash metal, you got your sludge,
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:37.940]   you got your post-do metal, I don't you could go on and on.
[00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:41.460]   Leo, we need to show just on metal.
[00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:48.420]   I'm a lot of disappointed game developers for the first three episodes.
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:52.740]   I think they'll get into it. Yeah, it's not that metal, not that metal. We're not even
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:59.620]   that metal. Really interesting acquisition. Now that we've dug deeper into it, I kind of get
[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:03.060]   where Apple's going with this. This is actually maybe pretty exciting.
[00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:06.740]   Well, and I think that you need to look at all of Apple's product lines, because they,
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:11.220]   wherever they have Siri and any kind of a recommendation system,
[00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:18.900]   what could Shazam do for that Apple TV? Where can this technology fit to?
[00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:22.820]   Does Shazam already recognize? I think it already does recognize video. I think that's one of its
[00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:25.380]   features. Yeah, movies and TV shows and ads and that.
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:30.980]   And ads. So, yeah, I mean, that was in a tricky bit. I was like, wow, what's that ad? Really?
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:38.580]   Well, yeah, but you could see why people might not humans, but marketers are very interested.
[00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:46.340]   No, that's no joke. Realize that the speakers in your TV can emit frequencies that are too
[00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:50.580]   high for you to hear and also the microphones in your phones and other devices can also hear
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:55.780]   frequencies. So, it's possible to simply add to the mix a cue for another device to realize that,
[00:50:55.780 --> 00:51:00.340]   hey, this, whoever this is, his phone is just listening to this ad or whatever. So, yeah,
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:05.540]   there's a there's a lot of applicability to being a bastard for this technology.
[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:10.740]   And you can sell a lot of stuff to the off. You didn't know that actually, that's already
[00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:13.780]   happening. No, I'm going to. Yeah, there are apps that do this.
[00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:19.620]   Go live in a bunker after. No, what you need is my little friend, Gebo.
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:26.660]   Don't wake it up. No, don't touch the head.
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:35.860]   It's fontanelle hasn't closed in yet. It really said, I've been awake for 30 million
[00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:39.700]   million seconds and stuff like that. I mean, it's really, and I wrote the very first song.
[00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:43.700]   Daisy, Daisy,
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:50.740]   Apple responds to the latest report claiming the iTunes music store is closing.
[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:56.660]   What? What are you? What are you high? This is from Digital Music News Today. They say the
[00:51:56.660 --> 00:52:05.460]   Apple is on schedule to rid the iTunes store of downloads by 2019. This plan has been in place
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:13.620]   since 2016. Apple says, it's not true. It doesn't even make any sense.
[00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:23.380]   Why? So, but meanwhile, Digital Music News says Apple has told DMN, no such plan phase out exists,
[00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:27.220]   but one source repeatedly insists the plan not only exists, but it's on schedule.
[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:32.500]   Why would Apple stop downloads? Is just they go all streaming? Is that the idea?
[00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:37.380]   Yeah. Actually, you know what? That makes sense. Spotify doesn't have downloads.
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:42.500]   Except for the fact that all the people who've bought stuff may not relish
[00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:46.980]   suddenly not having it in the way that they think they have it.
[00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:53.300]   So let me ask Jim. Jim's a music guy. Actually, you're all music guys.
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:53:01.220]   You like to buy music, right, Jim? I do. I do. I like to. So here's the thing. I like to buy
[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:07.460]   music from the bands that I truly love to support them. To support them. Aussie and Metallica,
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:13.780]   if they come out with a new album, I'm buying that album. And that's it. Now, a lot of the
[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:20.900]   stuff that I listen to on Apple Music, I will end up buying later. But I use Apple Music as a way to
[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:29.220]   find new bands or listen to some of the new albums, the bands that I kind of like. And if it's really
[00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:38.500]   good, then I'll go buy it. I like to have my music. I like to own it. So, but I use both. I buy and
[00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:46.580]   I stream. But that's how I do it. And if, I mean, there is a way that Apple could integrate purchasing
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:54.260]   with its streaming service, which would also do away with iTunes and allow Apple to build
[00:53:55.380 --> 00:54:00.340]   a better app on the Mac. I don't know that they're really concerned about that.
[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:08.740]   They'll show many evidence of that, do they? Or if this is something that they're really
[00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:14.980]   concerned about on mobile with the iPhone and iPad. But if you're listening to a song, if there's
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:23.220]   the ability to click a buy button on that song, instead of streaming down and just have streaming
[00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:29.300]   and download, if there was also a buy button there, then they could work that into a new
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:35.380]   iTunes type app that would be called Apple Music, but you could buy it too.
[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:41.060]   I think, though, that, Jim, you're increasingly anachronistic that most people today, if you've
[00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:46.100]   got to scale some subscriptions. Proudly.
[00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:56.500]   But young people probably don't think about owning stuff. I don't think that they do.
[00:54:56.500 --> 00:55:02.900]   They don't. But you just see that there are still an awful lot of people who are not young
[00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:07.780]   people who are still buying a lot of stuff. The bad news, though, is those people who are not
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:12.180]   young people are dying out. Well, they are, but not before. Not yet.
[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:18.500]   But you're talking too here. So this would be very annoying to a lot of people, obviously.
[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:24.500]   Right. I mean, people, every time something goes subscription only, there is incredible uproar.
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:28.100]   And that's, in essence, what this would generate. It would be that.
[00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:32.420]   Yeah, look at Adobe. Isn't that what Adobe has done effectively? They've slowly phased out the
[00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:36.420]   ability to buy software from them. You have to rent it from them.
[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:38.980]   And it's still not popular. And it's very unpopular.
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:42.900]   Still use Adobe software because they can't, or they'll still be using, you know,
[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:46.500]   InDesign 5 or whatever it was so that they could likely get it.
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.300]   Microsoft has done it, though, with a little more success. They've really,
[00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:52.580]   they still offer boxed copies of Office, but they're so expensive.
[00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:55.780]   And that a lot of people have just a subscription.
[00:55:55.780 --> 00:56:02.660]   You know, I talked to Adobe when they first moved over to the subscription service,
[00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:06.980]   and they were fully aware that they were going to lose people in doing that.
[00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:12.580]   They knew they factored that into their projections and everything else.
[00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:16.180]   And they were satisfied that they were still making the right move.
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:19.060]   In the long run, right?
[00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:26.980]   Yeah, I think the other real issue that would come up is that the amount that artists are going
[00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:31.460]   to earn is going to be quite different between a purchase and a stream.
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:38.420]   And so if Apple was actually going to move entirely away from purchasing, it would really change.
[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:43.700]   Well, first of all, it might not be doable in terms of contracts and licensing approaches,
[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:48.180]   but it would also significantly change the amount that artists are making, I suspect,
[00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:53.300]   because if you're going to pay a dollar for a song, how many times do you have to listen to it
[00:56:53.300 --> 00:57:00.020]   to for the streaming royalty to equal a dollar? You know, maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. I don't know.
[00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:08.020]   Yeah, so I'm not completely willing to accept Apple's denials on this. It does in some,
[00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:12.020]   what if Apple made a deal with somebody like, I mean, this wouldn't happen?
[00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:16.020]   What if they made a deal with Amazon? And you know, you had the streaming music and you could still
[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:20.340]   buy music by clicking a link. It would take you to the Amazon store where you'd buy a CD.
[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:27.540]   Well, that's not Apple. That's not Apple. Yeah, they're still going to want to sell it.
[00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:33.140]   Why not move everybody to subscription and but still offer a download, right?
[00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:41.940]   I think that for the foreseeable future, Apple will continue to offer download or purchases.
[00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:47.380]   And I don't see that going away anytime. What's the pressure to not do it? Is it the music industry?
[00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:51.300]   Do you think the music industry wants that? No, I want you to buy music. Yeah.
[00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:56.820]   I don't think that there's any pressure for them to stop. I think the only pressure that
[00:57:56.820 --> 00:58:02.900]   people might see here is that while streaming is now more popular than purchasing music,
[00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:06.500]   well, that doesn't mean that they should stop. It just means that
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:15.620]   the kids now are not buying music like we used to. Even 15 years ago, when the iTunes store started,
[00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:28.100]   we're buying music like crazy. Yeah. I think maybe that points to a future in which they split
[00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:36.260]   Apple music from iTunes completely. They basically optimize iTunes for managing a physical music
[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:42.340]   library of files on your hard drive. And Apple music is always just going to be for doing streaming
[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:52.820]   and remote playlists. Jim scared me off of ever letting Apple see my actual, have any access to
[00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:57.380]   my actual music library after seeing what happened to his library for the first couple of months.
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:04.180]   And that's when I decided to switch to Plex and other apps and basically have one platform
[00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:09.860]   for Apple music and another platform for things that will connect to my music folder. So
[00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:17.860]   this is two kinds of music collectors, two types of music listeners with very little
[00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:22.580]   intersection between the two. And the best way to make money off of both of them is to give each
[00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:30.100]   of them the experience that they want. Why would yeah, all right. Yeah, it doesn't, you know,
[00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:33.540]   it doesn't make sense that Apple would just unilaterally cut off down. I mean,
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:40.740]   also the music industry hates subscription services. They, I mean, they make so little money off of it
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:47.060]   that I don't think that they'd be very happy if Apple went strictly a subscription. Yeah, if
[00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:52.500]   anything, the pressure is in the opposite direction. Yeah. All right. Well, we can throw that story
[00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:58.260]   out. Although in a year, who knows, we might be saying, hey, yeah, it's a nice and always change.
[00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:07.220]   To be clear that this website also put out that same rumor last year. Right. So never mind then.
[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:13.700]   Yeah. Let's take a break. We'll come back with more. Our show today brought to you by Jamf.
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:21.220]   You know, Jamf and their new product Jamf now. Jamf has been around for so long. They do great
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:26.100]   software for managing your enterprise, your max and your enterprise, your iPhones, your iPads.
[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:32.660]   Jamf now is a great on demand mobile device management solution or MDM for Apple devices.
[01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:36.740]   Yeah, it's easy thing when you first start as we did in just a couple of people keep track of
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:42.020]   your computer, your phone, get some more employees, keep track of their phones. But as you get bigger
[01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:45.940]   and bigger, it gets harder and harder to keep track of everyone's Mac and iPhone and iPad devices.
[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:50.660]   And then of course, there's the issue, especially with mobile devices of loss. How do you secure a
[01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:59.140]   lost iPad? Well, Jamf now makes that and a lot more easier. It makes management tasks like deploying
[01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:04.980]   Wi-Fi passwords, securing company data and forcing passcodes easy. And by the way, very
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:09.460]   affordable. You could set up devices with the exact same settings, accounts and applications
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:14.020]   across the line remotely configure settings like Wi-Fi passwords, email account information,

[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:41.540]   Johnny Ive is back. I didn't know he'd gone, but apparently he had
[01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:48.260]   seeded his role managing the design team so that he could be in charge of everything,
[01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:54.020]   you know, having to do with design. And especially Apple Park for the last two years. He's the
[01:02:54.020 --> 01:03:00.660]   chief design officer at Apple and has been since 2015. But he handed off day-to-day management,
[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:06.820]   according to Bloomberg, Mark Gurman, of course, headed off day-to-day management to two of his
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:15.460]   seconds. Alan Dye and Richard Howarth, and they didn't report to Johnny Ive. They reported to Tim Cook.
[01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:22.740]   So now Johnny's back. I don't know. Do we think that that's an acknowledgement that Apple might
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:31.140]   have stumbled a little bit in design? Or is it just this was always the plan? Your thoughts, gentlemen.
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:38.180]   I read too much into this. It's possible that when the first announcement was made,
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:46.100]   my personal opinion was that someone as creative as Johnny Ive might feel might eventually get
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:51.940]   burnt out designing just one sort of thing and it would be nice for him to go out and design
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:57.380]   tables, design buildings, design planters, design pretty much everything else, design a building.
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:02.660]   And maybe he's just done with that and is ready to come back. But there's really no
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:11.620]   guessing as to why he left and why he came back. I really don't think that this was planned.
[01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:17.780]   It seems odd to me that Richard now one would take over and Johnny would move away because the
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:25.220]   original announcement never said Johnny is going to move over to designing Apple Park for two years.
[01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:33.540]   And then he's coming back. That was never part of the messaging that they had with Johnny and now
[01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:43.460]   all of a sudden he's back. So I'm wondering if there's something more to this than just the fact
[01:04:43.460 --> 01:05:11.460]   that Johnny's done with Apple Park now. Okay, you're the tiebreaker, Adam
[01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:15.780]   always opportunities to different things. And Johnny Ive has definitely been one of those people
[01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:21.300]   who's gone off and done other things a number of times. He's worked with Mark Newsom a lot on
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:30.260]   stuff that's just completely unrelated to Apple. So I guess it doesn't entirely surprise me that
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:34.180]   somehow he would have been heavily involved with Apple Park and really stepped away from other
[01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:42.820]   stuff and coming back. But at the same time, I imagine he was fully aware of what was going on
[01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:49.860]   in the meantime. So even if he wasn't doing actual management, I strongly doubt that he's like,
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:57.700]   so what have you all been up to? I mean, I look at the iPhone 10 and that's got Johnny I've written
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:02.100]   all over it. I mean, maybe he's got maybe his lieutenants really know his stuff. I don't know.
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:07.860]   That's certainly common. I mean, you often people who've worked with a strong design lead
[01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:15.300]   can channel that person in a real place. So yeah, I think I'm on the I think it's just shuffling
[01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:20.020]   stuff around a little bit. People coming people going ever so slightly and in whatever reason.
[01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:22.740]   It's a shame that both of you are wrong.
[01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:33.860]   There was that article though in the Washington Post, Virgil's reminding me why does an Apple
[01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:39.860]   make its devices as carefully as it's making Apple Park? I'm not sure. You know, this is a
[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:46.340]   dissenting point of view, which perhaps don't know if the roof on Apple Park leaks. I mean,
[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:52.660]   frankly, his roof's leaked. And so, no, I'm just saying if they don't have moisture sensors on
[01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:57.300]   that Steve Jobs theater, they might want some. I love this quote though from Johnny I've.
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:05.300]   We didn't make Apple Park for other people. And so, and so a lot of criticisms, I think,
[01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:11.460]   are utterly bizarre because it wasn't made for you. I know how we work and you don't.
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:18.500]   Wow. This probably refers to the. We don't make the iPhone 10 for others.
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:25.140]   For us to make it. But in a way, if you're a great designer, that's kind of, I don't know,
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:31.700]   is that true or not? I'm not a designer. On the one hand, I think of people like Norman,
[01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:38.340]   Don Norman, who says, no, you have to consider the function for a function. And I think of other
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:43.380]   people who say, yeah, but if you're an artist, you don't look at the audience before you create
[01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:49.940]   your work of art, you create something great. But you're not seeing an opera. I always come back to
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:55.940]   the analogy of a suspension bridge or any kind of bridge. The Golden Gate Bridge is beautiful.
[01:07:55.940 --> 01:08:01.540]   It's gorgeous. It's a landmark. But that doesn't count if it doesn't function as a bridge.
[01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:06.020]   That's why designing psychology could be so difficult. You get no credit for doing something
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:10.340]   innovative. You get no credit for being the first to market with something. You get no credit for
[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:14.660]   how much engineering went into making sure that the display goes all the way to the edge of the
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:19.860]   screen. If it means that I can't pick it up without accidentally doing a thumb press on something,
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:26.500]   you fail. You get no credit for creating a beautiful static object because technology or
[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:30.180]   tool is tools. You're supposed to be using them. They're not meant to be put on a table.
[01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:35.620]   You don't design a hammer to be aesthetically pleasing. You have to think about its function
[01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:42.820]   first and foremost. I do think I might fall in Jim's court on this for one reason.
[01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:50.580]   I feel like there have been some somewhat legitimate criticisms of Apple and Tim Cook,
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:57.300]   and particularly as lacking that magic vision that Steve Jobs always had. Tim is an operations
[01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:03.140]   guy. He's the best operations guy in the world. And there's no doubt about that. But you can't
[01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:09.860]   rely on Tim to propel the company forward with great vision. You need a visionary.
[01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:15.540]   I think that's Johnny Ive. I think to take somebody like Johnny Ive and set them to building your
[01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:23.300]   campus is to not miss a sign him, but to miss opportunities, those two years are lost a little
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:28.260]   bit. I would disagree on that though because I think Johnny Ive is a fabulous designer.
[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:33.940]   But I think that's very different than someone who has a technology vision.
[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:41.540]   That those just completely different things. Technology as Andy said, it's a tool. It does
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:48.500]   something. You interact with it. You don't just sit and look at it or experience it. You actually
[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:56.500]   live with it. And design is necessary for that, but it is not sufficient. And that's I think one
[01:09:56.500 --> 01:10:03.060]   of the things that Apple has often gotten very right. It's very easy to say, oh, Steve Jobs is
[01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:08.020]   wonderful. Everything he did was great. Remember the Power Mac G4 cube? Looked. I love that cube.
[01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:13.860]   I bought it. I love the cube. Me too. Seriously. Looked fabulous. Great machine.
[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:18.020]   Sold horribly. You know, royal pain in the butt to work with. No, well, they don't have to be
[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:25.860]   perfect. But I'll tell you what, Steve did a better job leading with a strong fist than a
[01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:30.980]   committee at any other company, right? Committees aren't going to design the cube.
[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:35.540]   Admittedly, you'll get mistakes, but you're going to get at least a coherent design vision.
[01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:42.820]   Yes, but again, you're also talking, there's a difference between, Steve Jobs doesn't come up
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:49.620]   with these ideas. He greenlighted them. Yes. So you need a team of great engineers,
[01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:56.500]   of innovative, brilliant engineers coming up with ideas, implementing ideas. But you also need
[01:10:56.500 --> 01:11:02.660]   somebody with a strong vision to steer the company. Do you think Apple has that person in Tim Cook?
[01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:11.860]   I'm actually not particularly perturbed by Tim Cook. He does a fine job. We've gotten some
[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:17.460]   tremendous products out during that time. That's not to say he's perfect or Apple's perfect.
[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:20.900]   I mean, there's been a whole bunch of stuff there like really, that's all you managed to.
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:27.620]   You know, Apple TV and Apple TV 4K. Okay. But you could argue that the iPhone 10 and maybe even
[01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:33.540]   the Apple watch, at least with the series three, is our breakthrough even for a company like Apple.
[01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:39.860]   They are incredibly hard. I mean, you know, the engineering that has gone into the Apple watch,
[01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:44.180]   you know, and I'm not saying that they're necessarily products that have
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:50.980]   redefined technology or changed our lives in the ways that the iPhone did or to a lesser
[01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:56.580]   extent the iPad. I mean, that is the sort of thing you just can't do over and over and over again,
[01:11:56.580 --> 01:12:00.180]   because lives can't be changed that much. Right? I mean, there's a limit.
[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:05.620]   And but that said, the Apple watch that technology and the engineering that has gone into that
[01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:12.500]   is truly, truly astonishing. And I think that Apple has done a very good job in the last,
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:18.260]   you know, five or six years on some of those kinds of things. But again, you know,
[01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:24.580]   there are other places where the company has fallen down and some of them are in design,
[01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:29.860]   like some of the, frankly, the design in iOS, you know, the big let's make everything white.
[01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:35.380]   Let's make it minimalist. Let's do all that. Not sure that was a big win. A whole lot of stuff
[01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:41.060]   that I see is being harder to use now. Look for a scroll bar and a Mac app for God's sakes,
[01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:45.860]   you know, you know, if you're lucky, one will have one will appear while you're scrolling.
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:51.140]   And as soon as you try to go over and click on it, it goes away. You know, not a good interface,
[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:59.460]   just bad interface in the name of trying to be clean and elegant minimal. So that's a good case of
[01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:07.540]   form overtaking function. You know, just just to Adam's point here, it was very interesting the
[01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:18.580]   other day I was testing out screens like a BNC app to go to so I could go from my iPhone and
[01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:29.060]   log into my Mac. And I did it. I logged into my Mac and I opened up the settings app. And I
[01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:37.140]   couldn't scroll to the bottom because the scroll bar was hidden. So I had to come back inside
[01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:43.300]   and go to the go to my actual Mac to do it. And it's just, you know, yeah, in that case,
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:51.060]   it would have been great that there had been a scroll bar there ready for me to use. And I
[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:57.220]   could have used it easily. But yeah, but otherwise on my Mac, I find it pretty easy because you just
[01:13:57.220 --> 01:14:04.180]   put your I usually don't use a scroll bar anymore. I just use my fingers. You know, when I have
[01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:06.420]   trouble touching the screen doesn't work so well for me.
[01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:13.860]   I think Adam's just trying to upset me for the last hour of this show.
[01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:17.940]   They get in their gym skin.
[01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:25.940]   I do wish Apple would put touch on its Mac OS, but I don't know. No, no, no, no.
[01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:33.780]   So I have to admit I've started using an iPad Pro quite a bit more. I've been really trying to
[01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:38.500]   see if I can force myself into the mindset of using it and getting, you know, actually real for real.
[01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:43.860]   And after you've used an iPad Pro for a while, you feel yourself touching MacBook screens like
[01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:49.940]   you wouldn't believe the time. I mean, you know, like, you know, it turns out using an iPad Pro at
[01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:54.900]   a desk, not a problem. All that stuff that Steve Jobs claimed about how using your finger out in
[01:14:54.900 --> 01:15:00.820]   front of you doesn't work. It does. It's a stupid comment. You don't sit there all the time like
[01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:05.140]   this, but you reach out and touch it. Every once in a while, like your example, Jim, a disappearing
[01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:10.740]   scroll ball, no problem. Barnall probably just go like this. God Adam, Adam. Every one of my other
[01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:17.540]   computers has touch. And I wouldn't use it for everything. But, you know, it turns out like dialogue
[01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:24.420]   boxes. Man, you want to touch that blue button. So, you know, regardless, my point is, my point is
[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:30.580]   merely that I think that there is a real difference between the kind of stuff that Johnny I've does.
[01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:36.340]   And frankly, the kind of stuff that Don Norman, Nielsen Norman group, those people who are really,
[01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:43.860]   really focused on the user experience and the user interface, there's a big gap between those
[01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:53.220]   two worlds. And, you know, the, I think the UI and UX people really have, you know, a lot to say
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:58.740]   that the designers, the peer designers who are worried about what it looks like, you know,
[01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:04.660]   that the color of the screen and all that is just correct. Those people do need to listen
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:09.700]   to the people who are saying, but no one can figure out where to click.
[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:15.940]   I guess you could make the case. Andy, what do you think that Apple has the talent? We just
[01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:20.260]   don't know their names. The only thing that's gone away is the cult of personality.
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:26.260]   Yeah, that's the, we keep talking about Johnny I was though he's the person who designs everything.
[01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:31.540]   He does have a real tight, but very, very diverse team of people that work on all this sort of
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:35.380]   stuff. The fact that he's been gone for three years and yet there's not going to be a stoppage
[01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:42.020]   of new products coming out. I would have to, but they're it they do have a consistent point of view.
[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:47.780]   They do work together as a unit. I really, I would love to.
[01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:57.380]   I just think that Apple design has gotten pretty one note recently over the past three or four or
[01:16:57.380 --> 01:17:04.340]   five years. There's just nothing surprising in a good way. Nothing really wonderful to me.
[01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:09.940]   This is only a subjective observation. I can't remember the last time there was something about
[01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:15.460]   an Apple product, apart from the AirPods maybe, that really felt like I don't think I've seen
[01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:19.860]   this before from Apple. This feels fresh. This feels something that's exciting just right out
[01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:25.940]   of the box. Whereas holding the holding the the essential phone from from Android,
[01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:31.780]   that runs Android, just the faded edge to edge display. Kind of better than the iPhone,
[01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:38.180]   iPhone tended. But the fact that you after after holding nothing but rounded rectangles as phones,
[01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:44.820]   the idea of having sharp corners was kind of exciting to me. The first time I held a pixel two
[01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:51.940]   phone, the the pixel two plus where you have my god, it's like black on the top, white on the bottom
[01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:57.700]   and the power sleep button is orange. And that's very, very fresh to me. That's very interesting.
[01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:02.740]   Whereas every time every it's not that Apple is never has stopped making things that are beautiful,
[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:07.460]   but UK, okay, it's rounded rectangle. You can get a rounded rectangle in space gray. You can get
[01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:12.260]   a surrounded rectangle in rose gold. You can get a rounded rectangle in silver. You can get a super
[01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:18.100]   glossy black version of the rounded rectangle. But Andy, you're getting a rounded rectangle
[01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:23.700]   with as few buttons on it and as little variation as possible. I feel like they're not really
[01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:30.020]   visually, they're really not stretching themselves. I can't think of any
[01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:38.340]   thing that was the result of a all out argument that involved someone being thrown through window
[01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:43.140]   like in an old timey Western movie. They were fighting so hard about one point of view versus
[01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:46.660]   another. And I think that kind of shows in the appearance of these objects.
[01:18:46.660 --> 01:18:51.380]   Yeah, I mean, after all this new iMac Pro, not that there's a demand for this, but it looks just
[01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:56.020]   like it's just a steel colored, you know, gray colored version of the old iMac.
[01:18:56.020 --> 01:19:02.980]   Yeah. Oh, my, my, not a bad thing. Not a bad thing. But, and I, and I, I don't think you, I mean,
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:06.980]   I don't, I don't want to see an iPhone in black, white and orange, but, but, um,
[01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:12.820]   the, we use the word fresh, Andy, and I think that's, that is something a little bit missing.
[01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:16.820]   Well, you know what? Let's see what they do with the Mac Pro. That might be an opportunity to do
[01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:21.940]   something. Although I have to say we're sending them very confusing messages because I also say,
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:26.740]   just bring back the cheese grater. I don't need anything fresh. I want the cheese grater, right?
[01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:31.860]   So that's, that's when you start, that's when you start off with, here's what we need. We need
[01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:36.820]   accessibility. We need upgradeability. We need power. We need the ability to get our money out
[01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:42.740]   of this $5,000 thing, then make it look cool. That's great. It's, it's like when you look at car
[01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:47.220]   design, you can tell the ones that we're designed with, we've got this engine. We've got this power
[01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:52.820]   plant. We've got this suspension. Now we have to style around it to, to enclose the sort of in,
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:58.020]   as opposed to the kind of car that has like eight spoilers on it. And it's got like this weird cut
[01:19:58.020 --> 01:20:02.500]   out in the front. That's like you just wanted to make a cool set of fenders and then you decided
[01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:07.220]   to bolt it onto whatever. It's like you don't, you don't want to, we don't want to wind up with a,
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:12.180]   with a DeLorean where yes, it looks cool on the outside, but inside it's basically a Chrysler
[01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:16.660]   K car. That's not what we want. What do you think, Jim? What do you think of the current Apple leadership
[01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:20.740]   and are there, are there gaps or do we have the team we need?
[01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:34.260]   Well, it's, it's very easy to criticize the current leadership because maybe of the lack of a Steve
[01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:40.660]   Jobs type vision, but Steve Jobs was one of a kind. Yeah. You know, you're not going to be able to
[01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:47.940]   replace that. So is the leadership strong? If you look at Tim Cook and Johnny Ive and Phil Shiller
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:56.180]   and Jeff Williams, you look at these people. Yeah, that's a, that's a very strong team. Any company
[01:20:56.180 --> 01:21:03.860]   in the world would kill to have people that strong. So I'm very happy with, with what they have.
[01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:11.140]   Do I wish that they still had Steve there? Of course. I mean, who wouldn't? We, we always that
[01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:16.340]   even those people that that leadership team wishes that they still had Steve there. So
[01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:23.860]   Apple stock is, is higher under Tim than what it ever was before. Their sales have been higher
[01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:30.580]   than what it is ever was before. So it's, it's very easy to say that Apple stopped innovating or
[01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:36.100]   Apple stopped doing this. But if you look at Apple as a company, even over the last decade
[01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:46.900]   and the innovations that they've made, it's been pretty incredible. So yeah, I, I think that
[01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:52.740]   they do have a good solid foundation for, for company. I think the other thing to just
[01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:58.580]   note is is that they've had the same people in place for a long time now. That you want to talk
[01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:06.660]   about, about, you know, having good people doing good work and keeping with them. Yeah, you might
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:10.980]   have a little bit less in the way of fresh new ideas, but fresh new ideas aren't always good.
[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:17.860]   Right. I mean, sometimes having some really consistent approach over a long time is also
[01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:23.300]   tremendously useful. And, you know, almost all of those people have been there for quite some time.
[01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:27.940]   And you even go, you know, you got credit figure, Fedorighi, Greg Jazwiek,
[01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:33.700]   Luca Matt, mastery, I'm not sure what's her name. You know, the Apple doesn't have a lot of
[01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:38.740]   turnover at the top levels. And that's a really good thing because it says they've got good people
[01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:42.740]   and those people are doing good work and want to be there. They're not getting sucked away.
[01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:45.220]   So yeah, yeah, I think that's all good.
[01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:50.820]   Also, this is kind of a lie that we're telling ourselves because one of the things that I love
[01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:55.380]   about Google is that they'll, they'll, they'll, they'll keep their window shades up as they play
[01:22:55.380 --> 01:23:02.420]   around an experiment. The project, our phone was such a cool idea. And it was wonderful. Even
[01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:06.180]   if they, even as they came to the end of that project and said that we just can't make it work,
[01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:11.300]   but it was worthwhile just to play with this idea. We don't, so we don't see the freaky ideas that
[01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:14.900]   go on inside Apple because they don't show something until they actually ship something.
[01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:20.740]   But nonetheless, I just, I just wish I'd like to, I'd like to see some more variety. I'd like to
[01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:27.380]   see them taking. If we're talking about them simply, just in the area of them being a design
[01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:34.260]   company, that's a long time for them to have a single design aesthetic and not really move it
[01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:37.860]   forward. And again, I'm not a designer, so maybe there's a lot more going on
[01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:44.340]   visually than I can really perceive. But I've in the process of cleaning up, cleaning up my office
[01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:49.620]   to get ready to move it. And so I've got like all of my old Macbooks kind of stacked one
[01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:53.620]   on top of the other. And you really have to go back a number of years before you can tell where
[01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:58.820]   one series ends and one series begins. And I just wish that you would, I just wish that we would see
[01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:04.980]   a little bit more fun, like the designers were having more fun as opposed to spending a long
[01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:09.780]   time in completely white offices with no furniture and it sitting and looking at each other like this.
[01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:18.260]   But one of the pieces of design though is not just changing something for the sake of change.
[01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:25.140]   When you have something that works functionally and design-wise is aesthetically pleasing and
[01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:31.540]   everything just kind of lays out, then why would you change that? It doesn't make any sense.
[01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:39.460]   If something is again, rounded rectangle, rounded rectangle, rounded rectangle,
[01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:44.340]   rounded rectangle, rounded rectangle. I'm not saying that that's again, the insides of it still
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:49.540]   work just great. I'm just saying that as a design company, as making an aesthetic object,
[01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:54.500]   I've seen what you can do. I want to see what you can do with it next. Just like,
[01:24:56.020 --> 01:25:00.660]   there's a reason why you see a band live to get back to music as opposed to, well, we've got the CD.
[01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:06.660]   I've heard the studio version of this album. I can hear the studio version as many times as I want.
[01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:11.460]   I want to see this band perform live because I want to see what happens when you have to hit all
[01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:16.820]   those notes yourself as opposed to doing overdubbing. I want to see what happens, what happens when
[01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:21.780]   the regular bass player is out and you've got to rescore it so that another guitar player has to
[01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:26.900]   double up some certain things. It's just that I feel as though I've seen what you can do with
[01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:30.980]   a rounded rectangle. I know I'm oversimplifying it, but I've seen what you can do with a rounded
[01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:39.380]   rectangle. Again, no variation, no multiple colors, no nothing. I would love to see what you could do
[01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:47.620]   if you decided to have one accent color and use it in an interesting way. Again, it has to work.
[01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:53.220]   It has to be affordable. It has to be accessible by its target audience.
[01:25:53.220 --> 01:26:02.820]   Once again, I've joined your vanilla ice cream cone with one single solitary sprinkle
[01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:06.980]   perfectly centered. I'm interested to see what you could do with something with fruit in it.
[01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:17.300]   Apple has done something. I think we might be able to agree that app store policies could
[01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:23.780]   use some improvement perhaps. The latest is a little bit upsetting for a lot of people,
[01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:28.740]   including a member of Congress, Ted Liu, who was asked for clarification from Apple. Apple has
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:37.860]   decided to widen its ban on apps that use templates. Apparently thinking that these are junkie apps,
[01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:46.340]   app generation services are spammy. They're going to reject these. But the problem is,
[01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:52.020]   A, it puts an entire industry out of business. That's fine. B, it puts a lot of small business
[01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:57.540]   people who can't afford to go out and spend tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars on custom apps.
[01:26:57.540 --> 01:27:04.180]   Instead, just use a simple app template to create an app that is functional. Those businesses are
[01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:11.860]   disadvantaged as well. Ted Liu, a member of Congress from the 33rd District of California,
[01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:18.420]   has asked Apple to reconsider. This is the first time I can remember a member of Congress
[01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:27.300]   asking Apple to change its app acceptance policies. He writes recently, I was informed Apple's decision
[01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:32.180]   to more stringently enforce his policy guidelines regarding design and functionality may result in
[01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:36.740]   the wholesale rejection of template-based apps from the app store. It's my understanding that
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:41.940]   many small businesses, research organizations, and religious institutions rely on template apps
[01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:50.740]   when they do not possess the resources to develop apps in house. Clearly, some of these apps are
[01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:56.820]   junkie. But on the other hand, some of them aren't. I'm wondering what you all think of this. Have
[01:27:56.820 --> 01:28:04.340]   you heard about it? I understand what Apple wants to do, which is make sure that everything is very
[01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:08.740]   high quality in the app store. But there are a lot of apps that are just going to be kicked right
[01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:17.860]   out because they're based on templates. It feels to me like a shortcut, frankly. There are a ton of
[01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:24.340]   apps in both the iOS App Store and the Mac App Store that are just awful. They're either clone apps,
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:31.140]   they're pseudo spam apps, they're just completely worthless. But I don't know that they're necessarily
[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:37.380]   based on templates or generators. It's just too easy to do this. I mean, search on a word
[01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:44.260]   processor. In the Mac App Store, sometimes you will find tens of apps, 20, 30, 40 apps,
[01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:49.860]   that all are presumably some sort of clone of open office. It's just amazing how many of
[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:53.060]   them are. They're all from China. They all sound almost exactly the same. They all have
[01:28:53.060 --> 01:29:00.180]   slightly different word processor-y names. So, you know, should those go away? Yeah, they should.
[01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:05.780]   I mean, this is clearly trying to game the system. That said, if you were a restaurant and you've
[01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:16.020]   got a simple little app that lets people see what your menu is and do some kind of reservation or
[01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:21.860]   even just call you. It's basically just a brochure app. I don't think that's a bad thing.
[01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:27.540]   Here's the company that Apple has already said will be ArmPut. It's a company that
[01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:31.780]   restaurants use to make branded apps for iOS and Android that include, yes,
[01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:37.700]   menus, but also the ability to use Apple Pay to order. In fact, Apple highlighted
[01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:45.220]   Shown now for their use of Apple Pay. Shown out was quoted in Apple's documentation regarding
[01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:50.420]   best practices for Apple Pay. Apple has told them that after January 1st, things will change.
[01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:56.260]   Now, here's an example. This is from TechCrunch. A Domino's app custom made it. I'm sure great cost
[01:29:56.260 --> 01:30:02.020]   for Domino's Pizza Hut app custom made at great cost and an app for a small little pizza place
[01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:07.780]   in LA called Mar Vista that gives them parity with these big companies, allows you to order
[01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:14.420]   options online to pay for them to order home delivery. Is that spam? I don't think that's spam.
[01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:18.820]   I think if Apple is the problem that Apple, there's such a flood of apps that Apple can no longer
[01:30:18.820 --> 01:30:23.300]   look and judge on a case-by-case basis, they have to ban a whole category. I guess so.
[01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:27.620]   I think I'll go ahead. I'm sorry, Jim, go ahead.
[01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:38.660]   I think probably there was some bad template apps like Adam said. It just got so abused
[01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:46.340]   that the easiest solution was to just cut out those apps altogether. Unfortunately, what ended
[01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:56.900]   up happening in some apps like this pizza is now included in that. I don't think that's what Apple
[01:30:56.900 --> 01:31:04.820]   wanted to do. I really don't. For a mom and pop shop to be able to have an app in the app store
[01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:10.660]   that their customers can download, that's clearly not a spammy app. They can't afford to go out
[01:31:10.660 --> 01:31:16.260]   and spend as you said, tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to build an app. They can't keep up
[01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:25.860]   with dominoes and pizza Hut. To be able to make an app that customers in that area can use is a
[01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:31.460]   good thing. There's no reason why that shouldn't be allowed. I think that Apple is going to have to
[01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:39.620]   try and figure some of this stuff out. All right. We're running out of time.
[01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:45.140]   So let me run through a couple of quick stories. We want to mention Steve Wozniak says,
[01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:50.100]   "Apple sent me an iPhone X. I'm not going to use it. I like my iPhone 8." That face ID doesn't work
[01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:56.900]   well enough for him. Okay. That's surprising. Yeah, it is kind of surprising.
[01:31:57.700 --> 01:32:03.300]   Apple is now letting you as an app set up pre-orders. Remember the Nintendo Mario
[01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:11.780]   Super Runner used that. You could pre-order it. Now Apple says any app in both the iOS, the Mac app
[01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:19.460]   and the TVOS apps can now set up pre-orders. That's a good thing. Do you want to know what
[01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:26.020]   the top downloads of 2017 were? No, actually, I want to know why.
[01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:32.580]   What is the top right from other places? I mean, seriously, just the list, not interesting.
[01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:37.300]   But what is it that makes these the top load downloads at Apple as opposed to say Google
[01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:43.540]   or some other list? That's what I would find interesting. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know if these
[01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:47.140]   are best sellers or just the best. I don't know what exactly what this is. It's the most,
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:53.380]   yeah, you're in most downloaded. Number one, Bitmoji, then Snapchat, YouTube, Messenger,
[01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:58.420]   which is the Facebook program, of course, on Instagram. Super Mario running games,
[01:32:58.420 --> 01:33:02.100]   8-ball pools, snake versus block balls and word cookies. You're right. These are all just very
[01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:08.420]   generic, popular stuff. It's popular stuff. But the question is, is there some reason why
[01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:13.060]   Apple users find these things, particularly when it gets to the movies or the books,
[01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:17.860]   where you can get it in lots of different ways. It's not just iOS game or something.
[01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:23.220]   How does that compare to the New York Times best set up list or Google Play Books or
[01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:27.540]   Barnes and Noble? That's what I would find interesting is, what does it say about us as a
[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:33.140]   community that we particularly liked Wonder Woman or some particular book? I can't remember the name
[01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:39.140]   of the titles of the top books. John Grisham's Camino Island was numero uno in fiction.
[01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:42.980]   Hillbilly Elegy from JD Vance, number one in nonfiction.
[01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:53.060]   Well, anyway, there they are. There's the list. You have it. The top tellers. Nothing
[01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:57.380]   to write home about. No, I agree with you. It's surprisingly uninteresting. It's like, yeah, of
[01:33:57.380 --> 01:34:03.380]   course, YouTube is in the top five. Speaking of YouTube, you can now put your Amazon Prime app on
[01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:12.980]   Apple TV. Hallelujah. That was the last big missing piece from Apple TV's lineup.
[01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:19.620]   Yeah. It's not a great app, but it doesn't have to be as long as I can get access to my prime
[01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:26.820]   videos, as long as I can now buy something off. That's my preferred platform.
[01:34:26.820 --> 01:34:31.460]   So hopefully they'll do a better job of it and make it more like an Apple TV app. But it'll
[01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:35.780]   it'll work. Yeah, I have to say it's the same as the Amazon Prime, very similar Amazon Prime app
[01:34:35.780 --> 01:34:40.660]   on lots of other platforms. And it's not it's not great. A lot of these apps are not great in general.
[01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:47.540]   Netflix's app is really has some real problems. But it's there. And that's the most important
[01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:53.620]   thing you can actually know. For instance, the Marvelous Mrs. Mayzel, which is a fabulous show.
[01:34:53.620 --> 01:35:00.980]   You can now watch Apple TV. Also, I mean, it's so important because it's prime, which I'm
[01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:06.340]   paying for just for the free shipping anyway. But I can get access to these movies and it will
[01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:10.820]   it kind of knocks me off. I can't get it on every single box that I use. I realize that's not Apple's
[01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:15.780]   fault. That's totally up to Amazon. But again, that's why we're sort of like, I'll take sloppy
[01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:21.780]   seconds long as it's as long as it's still working. Let's take a break. Jim has saved
[01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:31.780]   a pick of the week just for us for weeks. Never before heard on any stage. Your ears will bleed.
[01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:38.660]   I'm going to stretch out my goat throwing hand. So I'll be ready as soon as I hear the song.
[01:35:38.660 --> 01:35:44.260]   All right. And we have your also other app picks of the week. And I might introduce you to my
[01:35:44.260 --> 01:35:53.460]   little friend, Gibo. So I turn him back on again. We'll see. He's a little mad at me right now.
[01:35:53.460 --> 01:36:00.900]   It's not fair to because you shouldn't be setting up Gibo during a show. Gibo, this is a personal
[01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:04.660]   time, a moment for the two of you to bond shouldn't be doing that in public. That's a
[01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:09.140]   prime. I mean, your baby was pretty gross in his first few days too. I mean, don't just don't
[01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:13.300]   don't throw errors. I actually have a feeling I'm going to like it because it does have there's
[01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:19.540]   no doubt personality, right? Right. Are sure today brought to you by rocket mortgage from
[01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:24.180]   quick and loans home plays a big role in your life. Whether you're buying or refinancing,
[01:36:24.180 --> 01:36:27.540]   you want to get there's certain things we just want. We want a great lender.
[01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:32.900]   Want somebody who's going to service the loan, but also going to give us a great approval process.
[01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:38.100]   We want to kind of know what's going on. No mysteries. We want to get a rate and a down payment
[01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:44.180]   and a monthly payment that suits our needs. And this is what you're going to get with a brand
[01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:48.340]   new product from quick and loans rocket mortgage. First of all, quick and loans is the best lender
[01:36:48.340 --> 01:36:52.820]   in the country. Number one in customer satisfaction, eight years running, they just got the award
[01:36:52.820 --> 01:37:01.300]   again from JD Power for 2017 in both mortgage origination and mortgage servicing. So you get
[01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:06.420]   their number one both ways. People love quick and loans. And I love quick and loans a little bit
[01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:11.220]   more because they've created rocket mortgage, a completely online loan approval process.
[01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:20.020]   They're standing on the beach. Yeah. Okay, whatever. They have some strange videos on the front page
[01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:25.220]   at rocket mortgage, but that's okay because you're not going for the videos you're going because
[01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:32.420]   you can apply for a loan in real time. You could be at an open house or and get it in minutes without
[01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:36.740]   going up to the edit to get paperwork, answering questions you already know the answer to,
[01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:41.780]   completely transparency, you know, exactly what you're getting, what the rate, the balance,
[01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:45.860]   the all of that stuff is because they have partnerships with all the financial institutions,
[01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:50.980]   you don't have to get your pay stubs or your bank statements. All they do is ask you a couple
[01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:55.060]   of questions then based on your income, your assets, your credit, they'll analyze all the
[01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:59.300]   home loan options for which you qualify and find the right one for you in minutes in minutes.
[01:38:00.260 --> 01:38:06.020]   Rocket mortgage by quick and loans is nothing more satisfying than to go to open the house and then
[01:38:06.020 --> 01:38:10.420]   within minutes say to the realtor, yeah, we just got to prove the loan will buy it.

[01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:40.660]   30 rocket mortgage.com/macbreak. We thank them so much for their support of Mac break weekly.
[01:38:40.660 --> 01:38:46.420]   Let's start with Adam Inkst, a pick of the week, Mr. Inkst from tippets.com.
[01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:52.580]   I have two picks actually. One is a little bit, this is a little bit self-referential because I
[01:38:52.580 --> 01:38:59.140]   actually got to use it here. It's the, let's have a pull out the box here. There we go.
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:07.300]   Other way, the other left. It's the Polaroid Flexi LED light panel. I can't show you the actual
[01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:13.380]   thing because it's lighting my face. You're using it. I'm using it. But it does come with this neat
[01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:21.380]   little remote. It's like 256 K, it's about about 10, 12 inch square grid of LEDs. It comes in
[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:27.860]   LED little remote here, which I can not only change my lighting, so it goes going down and going
[01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:34.820]   back up. But you can also, there we go, get a bright, get a kind of blowing out there. It
[01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:40.340]   apparently gets almost as bright as daylight. You can also change color temperature. So you'll
[01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:46.900]   notice I'm getting kind of blue right now. Look at that. And this is a must have, must have.
[01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:53.780]   It's like, I think it's 125 bucks, something like that. I set it up in about three minutes before
[01:39:53.780 --> 01:40:00.340]   the show. It's frankly just really cool. So if you have any need of lighting, I've got it mounted
[01:40:00.340 --> 01:40:07.700]   on a tripod kind of up behind my monitors. But it comes with a hand, a little handstick,
[01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:11.380]   so you can hold it if someone's doing it. And the remote will actually control four of them.
[01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:17.140]   So you can kind of pair it with four different ones if you're trying to light a particular scene
[01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:20.820]   and you have a bunch of different ones, so you can get them all from one remote. So
[01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:26.100]   that's the inside baseball recommendation for people who specifically need to do this kind of
[01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:31.940]   shot. But it's 125 bucks on Amazon Prime. And I have to tell you that we've used LED lights
[01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:37.060]   for a long time. And they used to be very, very, very expensive. This is a great price. That's great.
[01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:41.620]   And it's cool. You don't have this thing blasting at you. It's six power.
[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:47.860]   Yeah. Yeah. So Adam, how's it powered? Just plugs into the wall.
[01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:55.220]   It does not have a battery. No. And so yeah, you'd need to plug it in. My career is me.
[01:40:55.220 --> 01:41:02.740]   No, it's just normal. It's got a little power adapter and a round plug in the end.
[01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:06.340]   I like it. That's flexible though. You can roll it up. That's really cool.
[01:41:06.980 --> 01:41:12.980]   But I think it makes it very portable. But I don't know that you can really use it seriously
[01:41:12.980 --> 01:41:18.260]   without the frame actually has this metal frame that it velcros to.
[01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:22.980]   And I'm not sure you'd really want to use it without the frame.
[01:41:22.980 --> 01:41:27.300]   It would be possible. But so the fact that you can bend it into different shapes
[01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:33.140]   might be useful for setting in a desk. Or if you have a light box for doing product photography
[01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:37.620]   or something, it might be useful that way. But normally you're going to have it in this metal
[01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:43.620]   frame, which goes together very neatly. It's a very impressive little ergonomic design.
[01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:49.540]   So it's sort of like a little bit like tent poles where you slide one piece in another
[01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:54.900]   and a little pop out button clips it in. So it's very solid. And then it velcros onto one side.
[01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:59.780]   And then you can velcro the diffuser onto the other side. So again, very cool little thing.
[01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:03.540]   Very early on, we started using LED lighting this, and I guess it'd be 10 years ago now,
[01:42:03.540 --> 01:42:09.060]   almost. And it was pricey, but it was really very, very handy for us. And this is a big price drop.
[01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:14.420]   That's much less power, much less heat. I'm not here sitting here sweating.
[01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:24.100]   So my more Mac specific pick of the week is Panorama 10, which is the latest version of a
[01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:29.380]   database that has been around since the very, very earliest days of the Mac.
[01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:37.780]   And it's completely modernized, full on cocoa, take advantage of everything that Apple provides.
[01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:45.220]   And it is just one of the best databases out there for people who want something that's going to
[01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:50.740]   just act like a powerful database without breaking the bank. So look at something like
[01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:58.020]   FileMaker these days. It's just not cheap. Whereas Panorama has this very cool new licensing system
[01:42:58.020 --> 01:43:06.980]   where you can actually pay per month. So it's subscription-like, but if you don't use it in a
[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:14.420]   month, you don't pay. So you can pay your, you know, if you pay for like a year in advance,
[01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:20.340]   it's like $8 a month, or I think it goes up to $15 a month if you want it for just one month.
[01:43:20.340 --> 01:43:25.540]   But again, you just sort of get a credit for each one of these months. Don't use it. You don't pay.
[01:43:25.540 --> 01:43:32.260]   And I think that is just the most humane licensing system I've ever seen for something where
[01:43:32.260 --> 01:43:37.540]   you want to get, see if you're going to use it. You want to try it. You may want to use it every
[01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:42.660]   now and then, but not every day. And if you do use it every day, no problem. You're willing to
[01:43:42.660 --> 01:43:49.140]   pay for it. But it is nice to see something like that. Can do just about anything. I've used previous
[01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:53.220]   versions of it a lot. Just started to get play with this one because it just came out a few weeks
[01:43:53.220 --> 01:44:00.260]   ago. Panorama, still here. I like to celebrate the classics. Yeah, it's really cool. There's still
[01:44:00.260 --> 01:44:05.300]   around. That's amazing. That's great. I used it for years. Yeah. I forgot about it.
[01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:11.860]   Oh, and you know, it had been updated in the meantime. It just kept coming out. But you know,
[01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:18.500]   it's a, you know, ProView is a small shop and it just takes the main guy, Jim Ray, just takes him
[01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:23.140]   some time. And he's not willing to put it out too early. So good app. I wanted to plug something.
[01:44:23.140 --> 01:44:28.020]   We actually already, I'm sure years ago mentioned this is from a company called Rogue Amoeba,
[01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:33.300]   which makes great audio software. And I was looking for an easy way to record Skype calls,
[01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:38.340]   both channels of a Skype call, my voice and a recorded voice, but other stuff on my Mac and so
[01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:43.460]   forth. And I'd used the past very fancy switching software by Rogue Amoeba. But I
[01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:47.380]   didn't, I'd forgotten that I bought this. And I don't even remember when I bought it. It probably
[01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:54.020]   wasn't a Mac. It's called Paizo, P-I-E-Z-O. It's just a little recording unit that you sit on your Mac.
[01:44:54.020 --> 01:45:00.340]   It's free to download $19 to buy. It's very affordable. But what's great is it picks up any source
[01:45:00.340 --> 01:45:06.740]   and records. It's great for podcasters who want to do Skype calls. It will separate the Skype and
[01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:13.620]   your voice into separate channels. Couldn't be easier. Has a broad variety of recording codecs.
[01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:21.860]   I just, it works with, as soon as you plug a USB mic in, it sees it. It's so simple. It's been
[01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:28.180]   around for gosh, I don't know years. But the latest release was September 28th. So they're keeping it
[01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:34.980]   up to date. I love it. I used to use Audio Hyjak Pro, which was a very complicated Rogue Amoeba product.
[01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:38.660]   Obviously, they built the simple parts right into Paizo and does it automatically.
[01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:41.060]   Andy and Ico, pick of the week.
[01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:50.180]   Really cool update to SuperDuber. This is my favorite Mac backup. It's classic week on Mac.
[01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:56.180]   It's again. I want to say that, I think you should enjoy Panorama however you like,
[01:45:56.180 --> 01:46:00.260]   but I think you get the much warmer sound when you listen to it on the 3.5 inch discs.
[01:46:02.340 --> 01:46:08.100]   You know, either you're an audio file, if you like the way you'll be run this app or you're
[01:46:08.100 --> 01:46:12.740]   just a user, I mean, it's fine if you just see user, it's fine. But yeah, SuperD, yeah, it's
[01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:19.620]   been around for ages and ages and just keeps getting better and better. Dave Nanian, the developer,
[01:46:19.620 --> 01:46:23.540]   is a good friend of mine. And there's a reason why he was not available for lunches for the past
[01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:30.260]   couple of months, because he was creating a brand new update to take care of the brand new file
[01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:36.900]   system. Oh, it's APFS compatible. Yeah, so not so part of it was just making sure that it can
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:41.860]   it can back up all these APFS volumes without a problem. But secretly, he was baking in a brand
[01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:48.660]   new feature. One of the things that you get for free with APFS is is version tracking and snapshots.
[01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:56.820]   And so now SuperDuber is aware of snapshots on the volume. So let's say that I'm going to be
[01:46:56.820 --> 01:47:01.460]   totally nuts here. But let's say that you updated to the brand new version of the Mac
[01:47:01.460 --> 01:47:05.940]   operating system. And then after using it for two or three days, you realize that was a horrifying
[01:47:05.940 --> 01:47:12.500]   mistake, you could you would give anything to have your old operating system back. Because APFS
[01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:17.940]   will do a snapshot automatically whenever, excuse me, because Mac OS automatically snapshots the
[01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:22.580]   volume whenever you do a system upgrade, you can when you do the backup, you can simply select
[01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:27.700]   not the current one, but basically get a pop up list of all the snap snapshots of this drive.
[01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:29.620]   Nobody should use time machine ever again.
[01:47:29.620 --> 01:47:36.340]   He explains he explains how it works. You can do you can it says that it works as a good
[01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:43.060]   as a good companion to time machine. But what you could do is now you can just simply back up from
[01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:48.260]   where it was before you did that update and then restore from that backup. I see is automatically
[01:47:48.260 --> 01:47:52.660]   doing these snapshots every time you install programs. Right. This is the first way I've seen
[01:47:52.660 --> 01:47:58.180]   that you can access that snapshots. If you're on an SSD, if you're on an SSD with APFS.
[01:47:58.180 --> 01:48:03.060]   But who isn't? Well, if you aren't you if you're still using a hard drive, then you're not on
[01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:10.500]   APFS and you're, you know, we perform a section. Now the other thing is that if you're using APFS
[01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:16.660]   as a target, if you're backing up to an APFS volume, now that backup is also snapshotted.
[01:48:16.660 --> 01:48:20.580]   So you can decide that again, let's say that you did something stupid like,
[01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:25.220]   Oh, you know what? I just I don't need all these final cut files. I'm just I'm just going to just
[01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:29.940]   get rid of all of them. And you did that like a couple of and you're you're set to do daily backups.
[01:48:29.940 --> 01:48:34.180]   And so you realize that, Oh, no, actually, I wasn't nearly finished with that. I wish I had all those
[01:48:34.180 --> 01:48:40.180]   files back. Maybe the easiest way to get those files back will be to simply mount your mount,
[01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:45.620]   might your backup volume simply do a restore from a snap a restore from two or three snapshots
[01:48:45.620 --> 01:48:51.220]   ago. So between snapshotting the source and snapshotting the backups, it gives you a lot of
[01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:56.260]   flexibility you didn't have before. And your it's the first it's the first like you said,
[01:48:56.260 --> 01:49:01.220]   the first thing that shows off some of the things you get for freeze by having this brand new
[01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:05.940]   advanced file system. But even if even if they didn't even if it wasn't for this new update,
[01:49:05.940 --> 01:49:12.820]   I'd still say 28 bucks to get the my favorite. It's simple. It's very, very clear about what happens.
[01:49:12.820 --> 01:49:18.660]   It's it holds your hand and make sure that if there's if there's a potentially damaging
[01:49:18.660 --> 01:49:23.540]   the thing you're about to do, the default is always cancel out of there and explains exactly
[01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:29.140]   what's going to happen. It's free to use as just a manually operated just click a button to do the
[01:49:29.140 --> 01:49:34.420]   backup. Once you pay the the the share where fee of 28 bucks, now you can do scheduling,
[01:49:34.420 --> 01:49:39.620]   now you can do more advanced sort of stuff. But the fact that it's been around for years and years
[01:49:39.620 --> 01:49:42.500]   and years means that's going to be around for years and years and years and years more.
[01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:46.500]   And everybody should buy it. I don't know Dave as you do Andy, but everybody should everybody who
[01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:51.300]   has a Mac should have super duper and buy it even though you don't have to buy it to use its
[01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:55.700]   features by it because he does a is there I want Dave to keep doing this forever. This is the best
[01:49:55.700 --> 01:50:00.100]   fact. I mean that if you want to if you want an idea of dedicate to two things about his dedication.
[01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:04.740]   Number one, we became friends because I was using super duper and some things confused me
[01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:13.540]   about it and we got into a very, very fast and furious email swap. I did not know that he
[01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:20.180]   will he will be like on a biking vacation in Italy and still keeping on top of the user of the
[01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:25.860]   customer emails. So you'll get really, really great support. And also the fact that he was so
[01:50:25.860 --> 01:50:31.540]   devoted to making sure this was APFS compatible that he denied himself the pleasure of going out
[01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:36.820]   to lunches and movies with me and you not go. Should make quite an impression upon you about his
[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:41.540]   dedication and keeping this product at the top of the heap. Well, and supporting APFS snapshots is
[01:50:41.540 --> 01:50:47.380]   actually yeah, it's a nuclear option. He does say by the way, it doesn't replace time machine.
[01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:51.940]   It should be used in conjunction with time machine and cloud backup as well. But
[01:50:51.940 --> 01:50:57.300]   anybody smarts going to be doing all three, but you have to have super duper just for just to make
[01:50:57.300 --> 01:51:02.260]   a bootable backup. But now time machine, I mean, APFS snapshots, huge.
[01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:09.860]   On top of everything else, just I have so many backups before I switch to super duper years ago,
[01:51:09.860 --> 01:51:15.380]   I still have some retrospect backups where it's in a file format that I'm going to have to find a
[01:51:15.380 --> 01:51:21.860]   retrospect reader app in order to actually restore from there with this, you can even just say,
[01:51:21.860 --> 01:51:27.140]   please just make this as a disk image. So it's just a standard Mac OS disk image that even if
[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:33.060]   the cockroaches 100 years from now after discovering my hard drives and they become super intelligent,
[01:51:33.060 --> 01:51:37.140]   they could just simply drag it to the desktop and mounted and actually access those files.
[01:51:37.140 --> 01:51:42.340]   They don't need super duper in order to get those files back just a plus all frankly, this I wouldn't
[01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:46.900]   even I mean, I know I have other backup systems, so I don't need super duper as a backup tool.
[01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:54.020]   But just be this would reverse a bad install just for that reason alone. You know, you installed
[01:51:54.020 --> 01:51:59.060]   something that was awful, it would reverse that because of APFS on an APS drive that by itself,
[01:51:59.060 --> 01:52:04.420]   you have to have this you just have to have it. Yep. Thank you, Andy. All right, we saved the best
[01:52:04.420 --> 01:52:11.540]   for last. It's time for a little loop insight from Jim Dallerimple. You know, I'm going classic
[01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:19.140]   as well. Oh, wow. But this is it. Everybody everybody knows from the recommendations that I've made
[01:52:19.140 --> 01:52:28.260]   on the show, Leo, that I like good straight ahead rock music. You know, a lot of it, the stuff
[01:52:28.260 --> 01:52:34.660]   has been new lately. And this is a fairly new band. It's called Greta Band Fleet.
[01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:45.060]   And they are a bunch of young guys, four of them, three of them are brothers,
[01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:53.780]   twins, and then a younger brother. And the thing about their music is that it is it
[01:52:53.780 --> 01:53:01.220]   harkens back to old Led Zeppelin. It is absolutely amazing. Now, they're not
[01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:11.620]   like a Led Zeppelin cover band, but they are truly a classic rock band. And it is
[01:53:12.900 --> 01:53:18.420]   amazing to listen to when when you get a chance to, you know, YouTube or Apple music,
[01:53:18.420 --> 01:53:26.180]   to what they have one album, those. Which is from the fires, which song would you like me to
[01:53:26.180 --> 01:53:30.660]   preview? Oh, Safari song. All right. First one on the album.
[01:53:41.380 --> 01:53:44.260]   There you go. That Robert plants that, doesn't it? Yeah.
[01:53:44.260 --> 01:53:56.180]   All right. So now just just try Highway 2. Greta Van Fleet. This is Highway 2.
[01:53:56.180 --> 01:54:05.300]   Wow.
[01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:18.660]   Oh, loving it. Good choice. Greta Van Fleet. So, but they're brand new. This is their first EP.
[01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:23.860]   Yeah, that's the first EP. And they're in their early 20s. And it's just
[01:54:23.860 --> 01:54:32.660]   straight ahead rock. And I've heard some people say, well, they sound too much like Zeppelin. Well,
[01:54:33.300 --> 01:54:39.620]   but that's their sound. That's the way the guy sings, you know, and it's just so classic rock
[01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:46.100]   that and bluesy that you have to love it. I just I absolutely love this band.
[01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:50.900]   I can believe that. So there you go. I've been saving that one for you. Thank you.
[01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:55.940]   We're all pretty darn excited about Greta Van Fleet. I'm a little worried though.
[01:54:55.940 --> 01:55:00.500]   They're four members of the band, three of them are brothers. So how long was this band?
[01:55:01.620 --> 01:55:06.020]   Well, as long as Greta doesn't join the band, we're okay. From this is called the Nuthouse
[01:55:06.020 --> 01:55:10.580]   scene. That's what they call it. And they're from Michigan. Oh, of course they are.
[01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:21.300]   Jim Dowrymple. He's from loopinsight.com. You find him on the Twitter J D A L R Y M P L E.
[01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:26.500]   Rocking out. Thank you, Jim. We love having you on the show. Really appreciate your time today.
