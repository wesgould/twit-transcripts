[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.440]   Hello Renee.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.920]   Alio, I've been waiting for you to say Mac Break Assemble since the first show.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.760]   We're all together now in the Marvel comic universe.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.360]   Alio just picked up me all near and went right to business.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.680]   Thank you for being here Renee.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.680]   Always a pleasure from the Vector Podcast.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.760]   Also from iMore, the lovely and talented Laurie Gill.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.000]   Hello, hello.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.760]   Renee and I are the Wondered Twin Powers Unite.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.760]   Unite!
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.480]   She's been in the water.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.920]   And what would Andy be?
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.800]   What superpower would Andy have?
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.360]   Well, let me just say this.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.960]   You're mistaken.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.960]   I'm not trapped in this podcast with you.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.120]   You are all trapped in this podcast with me.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.120]   He's obviously Batman.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.120]   He's not Worschach.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.960]   He wants to be Worschach but he's Batman.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.000]   We were all laughing before the show about the Morse code.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.560]   What is the Morse code for red-handed?
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.560]   Yup.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.760]   Explain Renee.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.400]   All right, so for Google has been providing lyrics for a while now.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.480]   Google does this thing that they believe is helpful and that a lot of content providers
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.600]   believe is predatory where they take the best answer and they provide it for you right
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.240]   on the Google page so you don't have to click through.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.640]   And it's true when you're searching if it just pops up there.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.640]   It's great.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.560]   But for publishers, it's better if you actually click through and go to the publisher's website.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.400]   And Google was doing this for lyrics and the company Genius, which is painstakingly put
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.800]   together lyrics from all these songs, started thinking, "I wonder where Google is getting
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.800]   those from?"
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.760]   But they couldn't prove anything.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.320]   So what they did was pure genius.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:27.040]   They took the Ampersands or the apostrophes and they made straight ones and curved ones
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.680]   throughout every song.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.880]   And when you put them together, they spelled out the Morse code for red-handed.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.000]   And then lo and behold, Google started reflecting these in their search results thereby letting
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.200]   genius say they caught them red-handed.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.400]   Oh my God.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.600]   So map makers have done this for centuries, put fake streets or fake landmarks in their
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.520]   maps because apparently there is a brisk business and stealing map data.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.480]   This is incredible.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.960]   So the patterns, I don't understand though, I mean these apostrophes go with the text.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.320]   How does that, I mean, wouldn't you have to put an apostrophe there and there and there
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.320]   and there?
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.320]   Yeah, but straight versus curved.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.720]   And when you read out the straight versus curved ones, smart quotes versus curly quotes.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.400]   Oh my God, that's brilliant.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.360]   Holy cow.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.080]   And here's an animation that will make it make it all clear.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.360]   Straight apostrophe curly.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.760]   This is a PC magazine, but this is genius's video.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.640]   So right here in this lyric, the red ones are are smart apostrophes.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.800]   They really should have done a deep fake video of Peter Falk as Colombo in the last act.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.480]   Look at this.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.480]   So they busted them.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.480]   I don't know how you're going to spread hand it now.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.080]   Notice at the bottom of the Google listing, it says lyrics copyright.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.000]   Oh man, that is that is wicked genius.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.520]   Yeah, that's pretty genius.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.680]   Google, the last I heard Google was saying it's the fault of a Canadian company that
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.440]   they licensed them from in the Canadian company.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.440]   In Canada.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.800]   But you figure if there's any company that can sort of do do diligence and de duplicate
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.760]   the results of lyrics, you know, they know we put up duplicative content on two websites.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.520]   There's no way they're not going to know that there's every single lyric in your match
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.520]   is genius.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.000]   The company that does that did this lyric find disputes the allegations.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.320]   Liric find says we have a whole content team devoted to compiling song lyrics from numerous
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.160]   sources, which can include getting in the directly from the artists and songwriter as
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.760]   well as other websites.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.760]   Mm hmm.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.200]   Oh, some some.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.880]   Some time ago, Ben gross from genius noted.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.240]   This is a quote from lyric find.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.400]   Some time ago, Ben gross from genius notified lyric find.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.000]   They believed are they were seeing genius lyrics and lyric finds databases occurred to
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.520]   see to genius.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.880]   Our content team was instructed not to consult genius as a source.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.240]   They recently raised the issue again, provided a few examples.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.320]   All of those examples were also available.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.000]   Oh, here's the problem on other lyric sites and services raising the possibility our team
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.720]   unknowingly sourced genius lyrics from the location.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.720]   This is the problem.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.560]   This is so good that other sites use scrape genius.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.880]   Google scrapes the other sites.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.960]   Red hand is all the way down.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.200]   Scrapers all the way down.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.560]   You know, this actually is a big deal for Google because of course, they're accused of
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.400]   this kind of thing.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.120]   And they're in big trouble in Europe with it.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.880]   And I think this is something Google really doesn't.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.880]   This is bad timing.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:37.320]   >> Go ahead, Renee.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.560]   >> I was going to say it's easy to dismiss this as saying it's an accident.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.040]   But Google has a history of doing things like scanning a bunch of books, which makes the
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.960]   authors guild really unhappy.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.280]   And that ultimately, I believe it was decided that Google has the right to scan all these
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.320]   books for index and accessibility.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.080]   But how do you separate that from just making them available via search?
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.280]   And it's this huge complex tension between indexing all the world's information and not
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.520]   necessarily having the rights to all the information you're indexing.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.400]   And I don't know how you solve it, but it feels like Google's a big enough rich enough
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.080]   company that it could license a lot of this stuff and thereby neatly avoid having to scrape
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.080]   most of it.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.960]   >> Well, Google says we license lyric contents from music publishers, the right-flowing
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.520]   earl lyrics, and from lyric find.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:25.720]   So I think part of the problem is that it's like you were talking about before, where
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.920]   you buy and license these catalogs of data of information.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.920]   But this catalog wasn't just some scholar working laboriously for two years to produce
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.200]   it all on his or her own.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:44.000]   This is like a big stew, a big soup of stuff that's been had things dumped into it.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.840]   And it must be, if I'm going to give Google the benefit of the doubt, which I do just
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.800]   for the sake of argument, it's possible that they thought that, okay, well, we were licensing
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.560]   this database, this should be perfectly fine.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.160]   Not knowing that whoever built this database incorporated stuff from other sources.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.040]   But like Renee said, although that's a nice devil's argument to make, they have the, this
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.160]   isn't some fly by night organization.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:15.360]   They have the resources to just, let's compile a list of the 10 biggest sources of lyrics
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.360]   on the internet.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.720]   And let's just compare the data that we've quote, license, unquote, against that data.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.840]   So you don't above a certain size, you just don't get that excuse anymore.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.640]   So I hope they write a big check to Genius because Genius is, it's Genius.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.760]   It's one of those resources that has been necessary on the internet for ages and they
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.760]   do so well.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:42.080]   But to be fair, I don't know if they still do it for years, Genius was crowd sourced lyrics.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.680]   So it's not like, I mean, I believe Genius took them from us.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.440]   Well, that's crowd sourcing.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.920]   That's me deciding that I've had it with a, I would happily crowd source every single
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.160]   map that says that, oh, here you are.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.560]   And this picture was taken the middle of Boston Commons.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.720]   And I will happily donate my time to fix every one of those say there is no place in Boston
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.720]   called Boston Commons.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.040]   There is a place called Boston Common.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.360]   That's been around since the 1600s that maybe over the past 400 years you could get the name
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.360]   right.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:23.520]   But it's great when this crowd source data becomes literally public data.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.520]   When the public has decided, just like Wikipedia, there is no one team, a person that could
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.720]   have asked all this data.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:35.800]   But there is probably one person who knows so much about the character Dazzler from Marvel
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.760]   Comics that they can write an entire piece and keep it up to date.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.320]   And they're willing to do that so that anytime anybody wants to know what the deal is with
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.760]   Dazzler isn't just this really stupid 70s disco character.
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:53.760]   Okay, well, first of all, disco is just one facet of Allison's personality and her talent,
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.000]   you know, so genius themselves on their on their about page says the genius community
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.920]   has grown into an influential force of over two million, two million contributors, editors
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.680]   and musicians who sign up to discuss and deconstruct their favorite songs.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:14.040]   So admittedly, yeah, but admittedly genius.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.280]   So, you know, co-lated it.
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.280]   But this is, I think this kind of points to a larger issue, the problem with intellectual
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.040]   property rights in the digital age.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.440]   It becomes also just consent.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.600]   Like maybe I'm happy to be on genius, but I don't like Google or I don't like Facebook
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.600]   or I don't like Apple.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.600]   And I just want more.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.400]   I said I want to put them.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.160]   It's a really good, it is a good, really good topic.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:38.120]   And part, I'm glad that Rainn brought up the library project of scanning books where I
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:46.000]   I feel as though this is Google being a really, really good observer of what a canon can't
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   do.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.480]   At the time, there wasn't any rules against it because it was such an esoteric impossible
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.120]   to do at any time before they started doing it.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.040]   And it was never a question of we're going to be, we're going to be taking all this copyright
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.080]   and material and just simply publishing it.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.360]   We just want to make it findable so that if you wrote a book in 1988 that's still in
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.000]   print that maybe someone will see that, oh, the thing I'm looking for the information
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.280]   I'm looking for is in this book.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.880]   I use it all the time in my little research project.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:19.560]   I bought shelves full of books I've bought simply because Google Book Search told me that
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:23.680]   here is one paragraph that at least shows you the context of where we found this.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:28.160]   To say nothing of all of the stuff that's in the public domain that would be just dead
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.840]   and lost, if not for the fact that Google goes through every single library that gets
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:38.800]   the strike a deal with and if the copyright has expired, it suddenly becomes available
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.120]   to everybody.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.840]   So I think that they are definitely doing something for the greater good there.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:49.280]   However, it is something where they could not have done it had they gone, had in hand
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:54.280]   and asked, "Place that, we promise we're not going to do anything fishy with this.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.520]   We're just going to touch the little children, the little nippers."
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:04.040]   Sometimes you do, I don't like Facebook's version of move fast, break things, but sometimes
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:08.920]   when something is not specifically illegal, but it seems like a good thing, you kind of
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:13.320]   got to go ahead and let the courts sort it out later.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:17.160]   Although this is not a genius thing, this is no, that's their content.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.640]   Someone was really naughty.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.680]   I remember how much trouble Google got in with publishers who did not like that book
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.680]   scanning thing.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.360]   They lost in court, but they...
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.360]   They won-ish.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.360]   They won-ish.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.360]   I mean, that's another topic.
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.600]   The thing that benefits people, again, getting access to public domain stuff that was just
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.280]   a book and a library, plus the ability to search stuff that's in copyright.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.520]   But I think that's a bit of an positive.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.000]   This is really an issue with intellectual property rights in a digital age.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.400]   It really becomes very, very complicated and difficult.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.480]   I don't know if the laws and the courts have kept up this in other cases.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:58.200]   What Google should do is just license from genius, just fix that mistake, just buy your
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.840]   lyric line and hire genius.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.200]   Write a check to genius.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.840]   Although it may not be possible.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.840]   I wonder if genius deals with its contributors, two million contributors.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.400]   As they point it out, maybe that concludes that.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.480]   We promise we'll never let Google have this.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.640]   I don't know.
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.640]   I don't know.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.640]   But you're right.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:17.640]   A check would help.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.640]   God knows Google.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:24.960]   Even just a direct link to the site where it was originally sourced solves that problem.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.760]   The website just wants people to visit them.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.200]   They don't want to tell Google stop using our lyrics.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.360]   They just want Google to tell people where they got the lyrics.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.160]   That was done wrong.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:41.520]   The original company, Lyric, find they're the ones who seems to have not properly identified
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.160]   where they were getting their sources.
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.680]   I think that that's also a small problem with...
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.680]   Sorry.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.680]   No.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.440]   Sorry with the truncation versus...
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.960]   In the original, and Laurie knows this as well as I do, but Google would start putting
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.360]   those snippets on top of web search results.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.920]   If they put a snippet that was truncated, man was that a traffic bonanza because everybody
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.520]   would click through to get the rest of that article, the rest of those instructions, the
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.280]   rest of whatever you're writing about.
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.240]   But then they started doing full excerpts that had no truncation.
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:13.280]   Then nobody clicked through and that same article went from tons and tons of use to
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.280]   none.
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.640]   It's nice that they're making it more convenient.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:21.400]   If that's your income or your livelihood, it just destroys it at the same time.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.880]   It'd be nice if Google recognized that yes, we can make it all apparent.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.880]   But if people want more, they should really click through to support the site.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.840]   I think that's probably why there isn't a deal with RapGenius because...
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.680]   That's really RapGenius's problems is Google's provide...
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.680]   If I do a search for a Taylor Swift lyric, I get the whole lyric from Google.
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.480]   I don't have to go anywhere else.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.480]   That's should probably...
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.480]   Maybe like the first third.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.480]   That's not how you click through.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:47.560]   Google does that, of course, with snippets and that's where they're in trouble in Europe
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.080]   with the use of snippets in their search results.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.880]   Publishers now saying Google should pay us for snippets.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:58.640]   But if Google said, "Well, instead of paying, how about we don't list you at all?"
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.880]   That was publishers who lose a significant amount of traffic.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.400]   It's very challenging.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.280]   I'm looking here at no point...
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:11.000]   Maybe this is Taylor Swift lyric.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.600]   Now maybe they did get this from lyric find and maybe they did get it from...
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.280]   Actually, what was the one that they...
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:22.200]   The lyrics that they showed in their demo video, do you remember?
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:27.600]   Because that would be the one to look at and see if Google does give a link back.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.600]   On the Taylor Swift, they actually give credit to the music publisher as if they got it from
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.600]   the music publisher.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.120]   It's Not Today by Alessia Cara.
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.120]   Okay.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:44.720]   Let's see, not today, lyrics.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.240]   I don't know if that's it.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.000]   Let's see, Cara.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.640]   Yeah, here it is by Alessia Cara.
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:54.440]   Let me expand it because here's the full...
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.240]   By the way, the next link is the Genius page.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.920]   But at no point here does it say Genius.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.520]   I'm just seeing if it still has a smart quotes, no, they're gone.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.840]   But that's an easy...
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:09.840]   That's an easy...
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:10.840]   Yeah, Grep.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.840]   I'm sure.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:16.080]   That's the first thing Google did is say all smart quotes replace them with standard.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.080]   But it's interesting.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.920]   You see, if you're right, if they said courtesy, rap, genius, would that drive traffic to Genius?
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:23.920]   I don't know.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.920]   Or if they just gave a...
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:26.920]   Just do a...
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:27.920]   A portion of the first verse.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:28.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.560]   And then say second verse, same as the first.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.520]   It's also kind of interesting to...
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:41.080]   It's a debate, but the problem between information and content, where if I tell you the box score
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:45.280]   of the Red Sox game last night, that's just information.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.640]   Whereas if I write up a synopsis, even just not terribly creative, just a synopsis of
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.800]   what went on, that is something that I originally created.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:59.320]   So I think a lot of what Google does is is there information or is this content?
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:03.640]   If this is a statistic about the height of a mountain, we can certainly pull out that
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.720]   one thing because they're looking for that answer.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:11.560]   But to Renee's point, that is sometimes what people want is I want to find out how do I
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:17.400]   reset my Apple AirPods so that I can pair it with a new device.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:22.520]   And it would be much given that I more puts so much time and effort to coming up with a
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:26.920]   really good detailed rundown on how to do this with videos, with explanations.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:31.440]   Yes, you can summarize it as step one, step two, step three, step four.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:36.200]   But pulling that out of an I-more article has got to make I-more feel minest and stolen
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.200]   from it.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.640]   So in a side story, Pandora is being sued.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.840]   They use lyric find for lyrics when you play Pandora music.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.640]   The music publishing company for Tom Petty Rage Against the Machine in Weezer is suing
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:52.680]   Pandora, saying they don't have a license to show the lyrics.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:57.680]   They just settled a big lawsuit against Spotify for the same thing.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:02.040]   Now this is actually an Apple story because Apple has announced they announced the WWDC
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:07.920]   that they would start showing lyrics in iTunes when you play a song back.
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.000]   Yeah, I wonder who they are licensing from, how they're doing that.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.520]   Hopefully it's not lyric find because that's going to be a real problem.
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.320]   You've been Apple's relationships and the labels.
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.400]   I think they've always had lyrics.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.600]   It's just these are in time with the music now is the big breakthrough.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:20.600]   So you can get your carry on.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.360]   Laurie and I can get our carry on.
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.360]   Yes.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.920]   So that's an interesting question.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:29.240]   Somebody in the show saying they think that Apple does get their lyrics from Genius.
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:37.080]   Yeah, so I think in reality what we're talking about is the people that own the lyrics are
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.080]   either the record producers or the song producers originally.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.080]   Not Genius.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.080]   Not Genius.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.080]   Not Genius.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.080]   Not Lyrics find it.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.080]   So you know, you know, you know, you know, you hear it.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.880]   How does Elisa Cara fear about this?
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.880]   Feel about this, right?
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:53.560]   So it's, you know, once it's out in the open, you know, you can't stop people from writing
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.560]   down the lyric.
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.160]   I mean, I literally used to do that as a kid.
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:01.760]   I would whip out a piece of paper and listen to my tapes and try to get the words and then,
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.560]   you know, memorize the lyrics from it.
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.880]   So you know, you can't stop people from doing that.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:11.440]   But at the same time, there is that weird sort of who does own like, how do you, how
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:16.080]   do you own the right to share this information publicly?
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.120]   You know, just do you have to get a license from a record producer or a songwriter or
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:25.720]   since it's sort of open information that anybody could find themselves, is it okay to
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:30.320]   just put up these lyrics and give it, let people sing along to it?
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.160]   When does it become that point where like, for example, using a karaoke style way of
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.160]   presenting the lyrics, does that suddenly become something that people could monetize
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.460]   and profit from?
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:45.160]   In that case, then is that a point where the original song maker or the record can be
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:51.400]   that owns the lyrics, should they then get some sort of, you know, financial, you know,
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:56.640]   backup for it or, you know, it does get a little, a little weird when you start thinking
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.880]   about who originally owned those lyrics.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.680]   So Apple announced the lyrics thing.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.320]   Last year said it's from Genius.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.320]   Yeah.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.280]   Now Amazon's Echo Show has done this since it was released.
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:14.620]   When you listen to a song on the Echo Show, it does karaoke style follow the bouncing
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.360]   ball lyrics.
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:22.560]   So, wait, what a mess, what a tangled web we have woven here.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:29.520]   I don't know, I'm looking to see if there's information about where Amazon gets its lyrics.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.560]   I don't see it anywhere, but you know, if you're not licensing it from the publisher,
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.560]   I think that that's a problem.
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.960]   You should get it from the publisher.
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:42.400]   And let's remember the problem of crowd sourced lyrics is that you get what the crowd thinks
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.480]   the lyrics are.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.240]   You don't get what the original creator thinks it is.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.400]   What's the name called the other things that they are?
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.840]   Yeah, I tell this listener it's called.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:55.400]   So the creator might have a stake in saying, look, I don't, I know that I just basically
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.640]   mumbled nonsense, but they're all English words that I chose.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.040]   I want to make sure that the nonsense is transcribed correctly.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.800]   They call those Monda Greens.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.160]   You know that probably.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.840]   My favorite Pepperidge Farm cookie.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.680]   I wish they could.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.920]   I can't eat just three of them.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.480]   It has to be the entire section of the entire bag.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:24.280]   If you look it up on Wikipedia, it comes from American writer Sylvia Wright, who coined
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:30.040]   the term in 1954, writing that as a girl, she misheard the lyric and laid him on the
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:36.120]   green in a Scottish ballad as and Lady Monda green.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.360]   And there's quite a few of these.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.360]   I'm sure.
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.360]   And I got it.
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.360]   Yeah.
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:44.000]   In gladly the cross eyed bear.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Remember him?
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:52.080]   Or there's a bathroom on the right or my favorite from Jimmy Hendricks.
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.440]   Excuse me while I kiss this guy.
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.440]   Those are all Monda Greens.
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.240]   Make closer, Tony Danza.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.240]   Tony Danza.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:08.720]   There's a lot of I saw Elton John's live a couple of months ago, and there's a lot of
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:09.720]   lyrics.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.720]   I don't know.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.720]   Rocket man.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.720]   Still don't know.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.720]   I'm not a man.
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.720]   I'm not a man.
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.720]   I'm only recently.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:25.600]   I only recently discovered that the title of that song from Chicago is 25 or 64.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.600]   Yes.
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.600]   Okay.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:33.120]   Now I've got to look up Rocket Man.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.200]   I'm not the man.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.680]   They think I am at home.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.680]   Oh, no.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.240]   And I think it's going to be a long until touchdown brings me round again to find.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.240]   I'm not the man.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:44.640]   I think I knew that one, but there's some lines in there that I just, I just.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.680]   Is that from the something that I there and thought.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.680]   Yeah, Bernie top.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.240]   And this of course comes from Google.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.600]   Oh, look, Google now put data from lyric find.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:01.800]   So maybe they're starting to cop to the and then send and then if this got smart apostrophes,
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.880]   it's not my fault.
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.640]   Check with their fine.
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:10.960]   You know that there were a lot of grip scripts replacing smart quotes flying across the internet.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:11.960]   BB ed.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.400]   It got to work out that.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.400]   That's right.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.640]   Let's take a little break.
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:21.000]   There is actually a lot of Apple news, including I think Ming Chi quote has another rumor and
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:28.360]   I wasn't going to credit it until it seems maybe there is going to be a 16 inch MacBook
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.360]   Pro.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.920]   Could it be?
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.560]   Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.280]   Story coming up, both those stories coming up in just a second.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:42.040]   But first, a word from our sponsor and Lori Gill, you can cover your ears because this
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.480]   is for the guys in the audience.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.480]   We're terrible.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.480]   We're taught this, right?
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.720]   You get hurt on the on the baseball field rubs some dirt in it, right?
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.280]   We don't go to the doctor.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:56.640]   We take care of our health by rubbing dirt in effect, whether it's a knee injury, a bad
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.360]   back or something worse.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:05.160]   The last thing, in fact, that's why men who have wives or spouses or significant others
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:09.360]   are in better health because the significant other says go to the doctor now.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.160]   I don't want to go to the doctor.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.720]   Go to the doctor now.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:17.680]   Well, the same thing happens for ED and I bet you there are a few spouses, a few significant
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:22.400]   others who are saying, dude, you got to do something about it.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:27.600]   70% according to studies, 70% of guys who experience ED and guys of all ages from all
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:31.720]   walks of life experience it from time to time, don't get treated for it.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.720]   Roman is the answer.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:37.720]   Roman created a simple, secure, private way to get checked out by an actual doctor in
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:43.680]   your state board certified from your state and get treated online for ED.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:48.240]   It's a one stop shop you can chat with a licensed US physician who can treat it and
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:52.200]   will check, of course, all the other conditions to make sure it's safe and appropriate.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:57.240]   Once approved, this medication shipped right to your door and as they used to say, a plain
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.240]   brown wrapper.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.160]   Actually, I don't know if it's brown, but it is plain.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:06.040]   With Roman, there are no waiting rooms, no awkward face-to-face conversations, no uncomfortable
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.920]   trips to the drugstore.
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.280]   I'd like to get a price check on this ED, Amazon over here.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.520]   You can handle everything discreetly online.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:21.400]   All you have to do is visit getroman G E T R O M A N dot com slash Mac break.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.840]   The online visit is quick.

[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.960]   You'll chat with a doctor licensed in your state.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.160]   If the doctor says, yes, it's safe and appropriate.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:33.600]   They will ship genuine medication right to your door, discreet, unmarked packaging.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.560]   So don't rub some dirt into it because you know what?
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.360]   It doesn't work.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.800]   You're not going to walk around with a toothache.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.960]   You go to a dentist.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:46.000]   So if ED has been a problem in your life, go to Roman with Roman.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.040]   It's easy and fast.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.640]   Get Roman dot com slash Mac break.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:53.280]   We're going to even make this better for you because if you go to get Roman dot com slash

[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:14.640]   And we do that as a public service to all the significant others out there.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.600]   We're going, you're rut did what I'm doing.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:27.280]   So Apple might have dropped a little hint about a new Mac book, not a 16 inch Mac book
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:35.400]   Pro, but there are seven model numbers designated by Apple as portable.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.400]   They do this.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.480]   This happens from time to time when they file with the FCC or the in this case is the
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:42.560]   EEC, the Eurasian economic commission.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:48.520]   A to one four one seven to one five eight five nine seven nine eight two.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:53.720]   And that's a lot of model number seven new model numbers.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.200]   Probably not all the new errors.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.200]   We need all the new 12.
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:00.320]   Maybe the 12 the 12 inches are still on KB Lake.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.400]   I think we need coffee lake.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:07.480]   If not coffee lake refresh for the Mac book errors, the Mac mini still needs this coffee
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.120]   lake or coffee lake refresh.
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:12.280]   They have a bunch of computers they announced last October that should get updates this
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.280]   year.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.400]   What about the Mac book escape?
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:20.720]   I think that was so there was a pro Apple could not make an updated Mac book air.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.880]   They just could not make a retina Mac book air.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:26.720]   They tried for years and Intel was just not giving them the silicon they needed to make
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.480]   the machine they wanted to make.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.720]   And so I think is like a desperation slash holdover move.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:35.640]   They made the Mac book escape and they tried to pitch it as everyone who loves the Mac book
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.640]   air.
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.480]   We think you'll love this trip down version.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.640]   We call them escape because it doesn't have a touch bar and has an actual escape.
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.280]   And yeah, and some people loved it for that.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:47.360]   But it was as my understanding is it wasn't the most popular of the Mac book pros.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:51.440]   And so when Apple could make a Mac book air sort of all the impetus behind the Mac book
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.640]   is Mac book pro escape kind of about.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.640]   I love my Mac book.
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.640]   And Lisa loves her Mac book or Mac book nothing.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:57.640]   Yeah.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.480]   I would love to now hasn't been updated for a couple of years.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.920]   That would be really nice to see updates on both of those although didn't the Mac Mac
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.440]   book here is not even a year old yet.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.520]   October, they came out October, but these could come out in October.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.760]   Like we don't know when these will come up.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:11.760]   Is there.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.360]   And the update doesn't mean, you know, a complete design change.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.240]   It could just mean that they're getting new processor chips, which is kind of the way
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.640]   things are going now.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.240]   Yeah.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:25.480]   This is completely fantasizing, but Chris Welch and the Verge said it sure would be nice
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:29.400]   if they made Mac books with LTE.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:32.560]   Given that they've buried the hatchet with Qualcomm, maybe that's possible.
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:33.560]   I don't know.
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:37.640]   Well, they had opportunities to do that a long time ago and they haven't.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:42.880]   I feel as though that they think that our LTE chip is your tethered iPhone nearby.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:43.880]   Yeah.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.360]   And it does that so transparently.
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.360]   Yeah.
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:51.560]   Like, and Mac OS like they there's no evidence that Mac OS has been given any sort of LTE
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:52.560]   awareness.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:56.040]   Like when you think about everything an iPhone doesn't do when it's connected to a cellular
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:00.180]   network compared to a Wi-Fi network and some of the costs that incur when you just tether
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.180]   all the time.
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:05.300]   And my bill go up and up and up and up because Mac OS is just doing all sorts of stuff that
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.340]   it wants to do when it's online.
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:12.460]   And until we see Apple sort of build out the not just power efficiency, which they'd need
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:17.140]   for LTE, but the data efficiency, I think that would be our big clue that Apple's getting
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.140]   ready.
[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.140]   Yeah.
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.140]   And API for metered connections.
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:21.140]   Yeah.
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:26.020]   The number of times where like, Oh, look, you shot 630 pictures while you're on away
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:27.020]   for the weekend.
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:28.020]   Great.
[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.420]   Thank you for tethering to your phone now.
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:36.700]   No, no, I think that the idea of the LTE experience on a laptop computer just I don't think that's
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:37.700]   a right now.
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.380]   It just doesn't seem like a good idea.
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:45.340]   It seems like we'd be expecting our laptops to do more than they do.
[00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.940]   I use LTE my laptop all the time.
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:48.940]   And I use it.
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.500]   I think Windows is aware.
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:51.500]   Yeah.
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.700]   And more of the point, my iPad.
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.180]   There's my iPad pro.
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:56.660]   I mean, yes, I have an iPhone.
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.780]   It manages the hell out of that connection though.
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:02.620]   Like it does network coalescence and it does all sorts of things to make sure you use the
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.940]   least amount of data possible when you're connected.
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:05.940]   Right.
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:12.180]   I have to say that when I got rid of my iPad data plan because it was just I realized how
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:16.460]   many how many people I was paying for for mobile data.
[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:20.620]   And it was fine, but I really do miss the idea of a device where you turn it on and it
[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:23.340]   has internet as opposed to you turn it on.
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:25.260]   You make sure that your hotspot is turned on.
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.260]   You make sure this connected.
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.260]   Yeah.
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:32.940]   If Apple did decide to create a model that had LTE built in, I would be so up for that.
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:33.940]   Yeah.
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.380]   Well, maybe they're waiting for 5G.
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:39.780]   I know this is the other rumor before I go to that though.
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:45.020]   Ming Chiquo in his digit times report.
[00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:46.620]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:47.700]   He's not digit times anymore.
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:51.540]   He has a new TNF international securities.
[00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:55.860]   A few months ago said a 16 inch MacBook Pro, which did not materialize.
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:31:01.540]   Is that because that would have been a redesign and none of the new MacBook Pro's are redesigns?
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:02.940]   That's the next one.
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:04.340]   My understanding is that's the next one.
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:07.420]   Like they do their cadence is like three to four years.
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:09.460]   And what they did now is they got it.
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:13.340]   I mean, they get in trouble for doing anything, but they were getting in trouble for not updating
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.540]   when Intel did.
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:17.820]   And for some people, they just always want the fastest ships when they want them like
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:20.420]   you know, Alex Lindsey, for example.
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.700]   And those people just they wanted the new Vega cards when they came out.
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:24.220]   They wanted coffee lake refresh.
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:25.220]   And so Apple's doing that one.
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:28.860]   And new chip is out and Intel has the specific version that Apple needs ready.
[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.660]   Apple's going to push those out.
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:34.300]   But then it has the new design cycles coming as well.
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:35.740]   So what would that cycle be?
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:36.740]   When would that be?
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:37.740]   Would it be this year?
[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:38.740]   2016.
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:39.740]   Yeah.
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:40.740]   2016 was the first year.
[00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:41.740]   2016 was a large one.
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:45.340]   So yeah, I think we're ready.
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:46.340]   Okay.
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:52.420]   October, March, I think a small bezel 16 inch and a 15 inch body would be very desirable,
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:53.420]   especially keyboard.
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:55.420]   It's like T and Briti.
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:56.420]   T arrows.
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:03.020]   Yeah, if Apple finally gives up and gives it to the switches.
[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:08.300]   So the other rumor from Ming Chi quote and his TF's international securities is that
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.140]   there will be three iPhones.
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:14.140]   This actually does match up with rumors we've heard before.
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:20.100]   All OLED, no more LCDs, at least not in the new models.
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:25.620]   A five points, four inch and a six point seven inch high end and then an XR equivalent
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:30.100]   with a six point one inch, but this time with OLED.
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.340]   And this was the surprise to me.
[00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:35.980]   The high ends will have a 5G capability built in.
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:37.820]   I thought we weren't going to see 5G this year.
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:39.700]   Oh, no, these are these are 2020 iPhones.
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:40.700]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.500]   Oh, never mind.
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.980]   I don't know what year it is.
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:47.060]   So this two years ahead in rumors now.
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.500]   Oh, that's ridiculous.
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:49.500]   Oh, screw it.
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.260]   I don't want to read 2020 rumors.
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.100]   Okay, I get it now.
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.100]   All right.
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.100]   Never mind.
[00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.100]   You're living in the future.
[00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:57.100]   I really.
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:00.300]   I should have living in a time where Google leaks their own pixel for Leo.
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:05.260]   Like you think Apple would ever do that.
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.300]   I don't think they would have done that already.
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:08.300]   Yeah.
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:13.780]   Well, that was the question when we talked about that earlier on the tweet on Sunday,
[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:15.100]   the chatroom said, well, Apple does it.
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:16.340]   They just don't do it officially.
[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:17.580]   They tell the Wall Street Journal.
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:19.140]   Do you think Apple does that, Laurie?
[00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.380]   They don't do designs.
[00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:22.380]   You never know.
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:26.940]   We're supposed to believe that these are all just insider sources that let this come
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:27.940]   out.
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:29.180]   But you just don't know.
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:36.100]   You can't trust these big companies to be like, oh, my accidental picture of my--
[00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:37.100]   Yes.
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.100]   Yeah.
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:42.540]   It could be that they legitimately are trying to hide this stuff.
[00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:47.940]   We are talking about Apple right now because they keep everything as secret and then suddenly
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:48.940]   things leak.
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:54.340]   It helps them by letting us get excited about these leaks that happen.
[00:33:54.340 --> 00:34:00.060]   So if they have somebody on the back end, they've hired somebody to just make sure some
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:03.580]   information goes slicked out, I wouldn't be surprised by that.
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:04.580]   Yeah.
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:09.340]   That's why I think that overall everybody, of course, us included, need to be very, very
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:15.540]   aware of how on point the PR game is.
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:19.740]   Apple particularly, but every single other large tech company that it really-- I don't
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:25.260]   think it was an accident that Project Titan got, quote, leaked, unquote, at a time when
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:30.620]   Apple was also getting interviews of their highest executives on the cover of mainstream
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:32.140]   magazines.
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:36.740]   I think that this was a time-- it was an opportune time for everybody to start talking about
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:37.740]   Apple.
[00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:42.220]   I think it was a time where it was-- if Apple felt as though the information was going to
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:46.580]   get out at some point, let's time it so that we can take full advantage of it.
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:54.620]   And that's why I really lost my case for talking about rumors because if we found out
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:59.620]   about a rumor, are we actually playing a game that Apple has set up for us?
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:00.620]   It's a good point.
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:02.300]   I don't want to fall prey to that.
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.300]   Yeah.
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:09.860]   I'm still pretty much OK with getting hardware early and signing an NDA saying you're not
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:13.980]   going to write about it until such a point because I do think that at the time when people
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:18.580]   are considering whether to hit that buy button, it's nice that they get reviews that are based
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:23.420]   on a week's worth or two weeks of hands-on real-world experience as opposed to five minutes
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:24.620]   in a demo room.
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:30.180]   However, once again, I think everyone who reads about tech reviews should understand
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:34.260]   that there is a negotiation and there is a deal that's being made.
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:38.460]   As long as people are informed, I don't think it's a problem, but I do think that we have
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:44.660]   to make sure that a free and independent press requires transparency at all steps.
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:45.660]   Yeah.
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:46.660]   There's a couple of things that are unique.
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:50.500]   I mean, Google, this wasn't a Google's Twitter account tweeted that picture.
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:54.300]   It wasn't like EV leaks or on leaks or--
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.740]   Well, it was leaked originally by one of--
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:57.740]   Yes.
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:35:58.740]   --I don't know who it was, but some of its--
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:35:59.740]   Unbox Therapy had a mid--
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:04.700]   But it would look like a CNC milled mock-up of what case makers were going to be based
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:05.700]   on.
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:06.700]   And on leaks had the renders.
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:10.140]   It wasn't like @apple tweeted out any pictures of the new mine.
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:11.140]   No, but made substantial.
[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:12.140]   But then made by Google did.
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:15.500]   Actually, I thought it was genius because they didn't show anything.
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:17.220]   They added no information.
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:18.220]   They didn't show the face.
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:19.460]   They didn't show the bottom.
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:22.900]   All they did was show the camera bump and they basically confirmed it.
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:23.900]   I think it's smart.
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:24.900]   And it keeps--
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:26.900]   So it's cycles going, keeps people interested.
[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:30.300]   Apple typically won't leak-- Apple will sometimes talk to someone like Andy or me or
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:35.060]   the Wall Street Journal and say, you know, we're only talking about software at WWDC.
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:36.900]   And you'll say, do you want to talk about hardware too?
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.860]   We're only talking about software.
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:39.860]   That means no hardware.
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:41.540]   We're only talking about software.
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:43.540]   They'll do stuff like that.
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:47.540]   But they are petrified about the Osborne effect.
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:52.220]   All these leaks you see is deleterious to Apple selling current generation phones.
[00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:54.700]   And they get lividly angry.
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:59.340]   You can hear Tim Cook sometimes or Steve Jobs talk about how the rumors hurt their quarter
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:00.780]   to quarter business.
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:05.020]   So they don't even let their-- The PR team, never mind the PR team not leaking like design
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:06.020]   lines.
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:07.020]   They don't even get to see them.
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.780]   They get angry to the point that the marketing team won't give it to them.
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:13.420]   So I think there's like-- But I think one of the indicators here is that Google had--
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:17.900]   didn't have anything left to give for the Osborne effect when it came to the Pixel 4.
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:19.540]   It's like whatever.
[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:20.740]   It was interesting though.
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:25.540]   In addition to the cameras, you also see that normally on the back of a Pixel phone, there
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:30.220]   is a fingerprint scanner and there is no-- There doesn't seem to be one on the back of
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:31.220]   this phone.
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:34.980]   You see it from top to bottom, which allows people to speculate that maybe they're using
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:40.380]   their own version of Face ID or maybe they've put Touch ID inside the screen, which is something
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:45.020]   that no one has really managed to crack satisfactorily yet.
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:47.860]   But the Osborne effect is a real thing.
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:54.420]   And yeah, I've also talked to executives that get really, really upset about it.
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:38:00.740]   As in, this is a career limiting thing if you decided to even mention at a party to somebody
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:03.100]   that something is in the works.
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:07.060]   However, phones are a different thing.
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:13.460]   It's not a question of would Apple still ship a new iPhone in September if a meteor were
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:14.460]   to strike campus?
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:18.860]   It would be a question of, well, how big a meteor are we talking about?
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:22.140]   How big would it be so that they would fail to ship something in September?
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:26.700]   So it's not-- Apple certainly can't make the case that we don't want people to know that
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:27.700]   we're shipping.
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.700]   So there's going to be a new phone in September.
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:35.140]   Anybody who really cares about this sort of stuff, even even consumers knows that if they
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:39.740]   drop their phone in the toilet in August, let's not go right out and replace it.
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:41.900]   Let's wait to see what happens in a month or two.
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:45.940]   However, there are people that are just, oh, I broke my phone, let's get a new one today.
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:46.940]   They don't care.
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:50.820]   >> If they cratered, remember Blackberry was super paranoid back in the day.
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:53.820]   And then eventually it's like, please come look at an undisclosed Blackberry that we
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:55.820]   went so next year.
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:56.820]   >> Exactly.
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:03.580]   >> I saw their new multi-touch platform like two years before they actually shipped it.
[00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:07.980]   And it was like nothing like what they actually shipped or excuse me, nothing like what they
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:09.700]   showed me a year later.
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:14.260]   So yeah, this is what you can do when you know that you've got several hundred billion
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.020]   dollars in the bank.
[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:22.940]   You don't need to be quite as nice and open to the press or the public as you once were.
[00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:28.340]   >> Apple store design changes.
[00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:33.980]   Now I don't know if this is making too big a deal out of this 9 to 5 Mac, says new Apple
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:39.420]   store design changes prioritize a straightforward shopping experience.
[00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:46.300]   And as an example, they use this mat that's sitting under the iPhones that has very clear
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:50.380]   pricing and features.
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:51.980]   Is that something new, huh?
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:52.980]   This is from San Francisco.
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:57.220]   >> People are really good at watching Apple retail.
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:59.020]   So I think that this is a nice feature.
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:00.420]   I don't think there's anything wrong with this.
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:04.380]   I could see it's the kind of thing that Steve Jobs or Angela Arens might have said, oh,
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:05.380]   that's ugly.
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:08.940]   All that fine print on our nice clean table.
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.860]   >> It's really not about the price.
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:14.820]   It's about the emotions that weaken and still.
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:16.340]   >> They used to have iPads, right?
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:19.780]   Like there'd be an iPad next to every table that would tell you everything about it, but
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:22.500]   it became a single point of congestion, I think.
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:23.500]   >> Renee will like this.
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:28.780]   The Apple Watch tables have been redesigned to streamline the process of exploring and
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:31.780]   trying on watch bands.
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:33.180]   I think Renee doesn't really do that.
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.780]   He just orders them, right?
[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:35.780]   >> I just buy them.
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:36.780]   >> He doesn't buy them.
[00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:37.780]   He just buys them.
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:38.780]   >> That's true.
[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:43.700]   >> There's a sunken display cabinet with LED lighting and rows of watches that you can't
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:44.700]   touch.
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:46.180]   They're under a glass panel.
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:51.980]   But then there's another table with leather mats for trying them on, which is there you
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:52.980]   go.
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:54.180]   You can see the watches in the face.
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:55.180]   >> Jewelry looking thing.
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:59.260]   >> Yeah, it is kind of like going to a fancy jewelry store.
[00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:03.980]   But you could see the issue this was raised because you could easily pocket that watch.
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.580]   >> I'm sure they don't leave those out.
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:08.420]   Well, actually those are just left out.
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:10.340]   >> It looks like they're sitting out.
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:16.100]   >> Part of the magic of Apple, I mean this seriously, not as a joke, from the corporate
[00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:22.020]   campus to the stores, is that you don't see the beefy, lying backers, type guys in the
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:25.180]   black polo shirts until they are very much needed.
[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:29.660]   In which case, then you find out exactly how much you are being watched in the parking
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:32.260]   lot, how much you're being watched in the store.
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.020]   I'm sure they have a plan for this.
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:35.020]   >> I'm looking for somebody.
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:36.020]   I don't see them.
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.020]   But yeah, you're right.
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.980]   I mean, obviously there's cameras on you.
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:42.540]   But I think this is actually a great thing because you now have a standalone watch you
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:44.380]   could try the different bands with.
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:48.820]   >> That's a more interactive experience I think for sure.
[00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:53.420]   People who either have never even bought an Apple watch can actually put one on the wrist
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:54.420]   easily.
[00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:57.220]   They don't have to wait around for somebody to come talk to them.
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:01.180]   Or if you have one of those three colors, you can say, well, what does this watch band
[00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:03.900]   look with this case?
[00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:06.140]   And what does that look like on my wrist?
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:10.900]   >> Lisa and I went in the Apple store some months ago because she doesn't like bands that
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:12.420]   bother her wrist.
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:15.820]   And she was concerned, she didn't like the sport band because she felt like the edges
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:16.820]   bothered her.
[00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.500]   So I said, well, I think you'd like the Velcro.
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.540]   I'm sorry, the hook and loops.
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:22.620]   And she said, well, I want to try them first.
[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:24.860]   And this would make it much easier to do.
[00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:27.380]   It was not easy to do it in the old stands.
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:31.620]   >> That's also very, very savvy in terms of dealing with humans.
[00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:37.460]   Some of the humans, they really don't like having to talk to strangers even in a retail
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:38.460]   environment.
[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:41.700]   If they can simply play with a phone and say, okay, that's $5.99.
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:42.940]   That's less expensive than I thought.
[00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:46.620]   Or if they can try on a watch without having to have a conversation, but saying, how about
[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:47.620]   that one?
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:49.900]   Can you take that out of the box for me?
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:55.940]   And it's just another case of greasing the rails from entering the store to making a
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:56.940]   purchase.
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:06.540]   >> So the new display mats for the phones were spotted at the Apple San Francisco store.
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:11.580]   It may be that this new watch stand, which is currently only at the Apple Park Visitor
[00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:15.380]   Center, might be something that's Visitor Center only because of the security concerns.
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:16.380]   I don't know.
[00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:17.380]   >> Yeah.
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:23.380]   >> And then there's one more change that they write about at 9 to 5 Mac, which is easels
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:28.660]   popping up at some stores across the US and Canada denoting an express checkout zone to
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:29.660]   pay for accessories.
[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:34.220]   >> That's got to be for people who are confused when they walk through the door as to who
[00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:35.540]   to talk to to buy something.
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:41.060]   >> Well, also if you just want to buy a cheap cable, it's kind of a elaborate process.
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:44.740]   You don't want to have to go through the same process it would be to buy a $3,000 laptop.
[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:47.900]   So having a quick check out for accessories is not a bad.
[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:48.900]   I think that's a very bad thing.
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:51.420]   >> I think they hoped that we would all do that ourselves and it never really panned
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:52.420]   out.
[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:54.420]   Like remember there was like several waves of self-checkouts.
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:55.420]   >> Yeah.
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:56.420]   >> Yeah.
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:57.420]   >> And it seems to catch on.
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:02.940]   >> If you're not just like a regular in the Apple store, you're going to walk in that
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:06.980]   door, if you just want to buy a case for your phone or a cable, you're going to walk in
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:11.780]   that door and have no idea how to pay for this thing that you just pulled off the shelf.
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:17.020]   And I, you know, easel with even with a stanchion, it looked like they had those rope and stanchion
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:20.780]   over there to sort of direct those people.
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:23.860]   This is where you go if you just want to pay for this thing real quick.
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:27.300]   The staff there are doing the same thing they've always done.
[00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:34.340]   It's just now there's a place for people who don't really understand that sort of free
[00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:38.860]   Apple purchase thing to go to and not be confused and angry.
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:42.820]   And you know, that is something that I've heard about when people, you know, just on
[00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.300]   the Twitters and stuff like that.
[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:45.860]   Well, like Apple stores are really dumb.
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:49.060]   You can't figure out who to talk to to pay for anything.
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:54.340]   That makes that easier for people who are confused about where to go next.
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:45:03.660]   Hanhai Precision Industry Company, aka Foxconn, says, if we had to, we could make all the
[00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:08.060]   US Apple iPhones outside of mainland China.
[00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:10.060]   Sorry, Canada.
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:15.100]   Yeah, you're out of the way, but we could do the US phones.
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:21.580]   This is of course due to trade, the trade war raging between the US and China right now.
[00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:27.140]   And your executive at Hanhai, which I didn't know this, Hanhai, Foxconn is owned, is a Taiwanese
[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:28.140]   company.
[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:34.020]   They just use Chinese factories to make the phones, said that they have enough capacity
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:38.700]   to make all the iPhones bound for the US outside of China, if necessary.
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:42.460]   25% of our production capacity is outside of China.
[00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:44.860]   We can help Apple respond to its needs in the US market.
[00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:49.420]   See, you would still get them in Canada from China because you're not in a trade war.
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:53.460]   Well, I don't know, Leo, we're not in their best graces anymore after.
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:55.460]   Oh, okay, after that arrest.
[00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:56.460]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:57.460]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:58.460]   Yeah.
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:00.740]   While we, CFO was arrested in Canada.
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:01.740]   Yeah.
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:03.780]   Out of US warrant, thanks.
[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:04.780]   Thanks, America.
[00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:07.940]   And then they arrested a Canadian in Beijing.
[00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:13.780]   So Apple has not given Hanhai instructions to move production out of China, according
[00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:15.900]   to this article in Bloomberg.
[00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:19.180]   But it could, according to customer needs.
[00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:23.300]   The company will respond swiftly and rely on localized manufacture in response to the
[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:29.500]   trade war, just as it foresaw the need to build a base in the US state of Wisconsin two
[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:30.500]   years ago.
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:35.620]   The need was, you know, President Trump saying they ought to and the billions of dollars
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:36.620]   the state offered them.
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:40.780]   As far as I know, no, no facility has been begun in Wisconsin.
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:42.940]   Yeah, but it's possible.
[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:45.980]   It's certainly possible that they bought it to hedge their bets.
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:46.980]   Yes.
[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:52.100]   And it's such a volatile situation in China right now, where the government is really
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:59.580]   gone from, it's whatever their five step plan is, they've definitely gone from step
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:05.420]   X to step X plus one in terms of surveillance, in terms of their relation, the government's
[00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:13.740]   relationship to the citizenry, in terms of how they deal with other countries.
[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:20.700]   I believe that there are a number of companies that do have that sort of red three ring
[00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:26.580]   binder on a shelf somewhere saying that what happens if we have to get out of China completely,
[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:27.580]   do we have a plan?
[00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:31.020]   How long would it take for us to move our manufacturing to Korea?
[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:34.700]   How long would it take for us to get our offices closed there?
[00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:42.300]   And is it a good idea for us to invest part of our future in expanding the Chinese market,
[00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:48.740]   knowing that the government has so many controls over how a company has to operate in there
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:54.020]   that they might suddenly, there might suddenly be a change in 2022 that negates our entire
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:55.220]   business plan.
[00:47:55.220 --> 00:48:03.540]   So I do think that it's a little bit weird that of course they leapt at all this investment
[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:10.220]   that the Wisconsin government paid for, that taxpayers paid for that got diverted from
[00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:12.460]   other social services and programs.
[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:17.580]   However, it is a really weird situation in dealing with with with with China these days.
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:23.580]   We do have picture drawings of the proposed Foxconn million square foot Foxconn plant,
[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:28.300]   beautiful images of the plant, which they say never tell it the verge keeps tilting
[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.820]   at the story and never finds anything there.
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:31.820]   Never.
[00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:35.620]   Well, they actually had to submit this to the planning commission in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin.
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:39.140]   So this this looks it looks like it looks like one of those party stores.
[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:40.140]   It used to be a circuit city.
[00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:41.140]   They're not falling anybody.
[00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:42.140]   Does doesn't it?
[00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:49.300]   I don't know why it says high tech carrier out front, but it does Foxconn says that the
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:55.620]   facility, which was originally going to do high end LCD displays now is intended to
[00:48:55.620 --> 00:49:02.980]   do all kinds of LCD servers, networking products and thank goodness, automotive central controls.
[00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:06.220]   So that's that's that's the plan anyway.
[00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:11.220]   I think you're right.
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:16.220]   They could probably repurpose it to iPhones if they had to if they were required to.
[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:18.140]   Let's see.
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:19.220]   Are you going to buy a Mac Pro?
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:20.620]   I never asked you Renee.
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:23.940]   We're going to by the way, very exciting programming note.
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:28.580]   Alex Lindsey will join the panel next week because we know he's going to buy a Mac Pro.
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:29.580]   He's got the question.
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:33.580]   He's going to buy a six pack or a dozen.
[00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:38.740]   We have wanted to hear what what Alex has to say about the newly designed Mac Pro.
[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:39.740]   But I don't remember Renee.
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:43.300]   Did you are you going to get permission from the boss to pick one up?
[00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:44.940]   So it's no there's no way.
[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:48.980]   If I buy this, I'm going to have to buy this myself.
[00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:50.140]   I told him no.
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:55.500]   And that's like and that's a debate like I have inside my head because like would I buy
[00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:58.580]   it and then would I buy the real cheap one knowing that it's just a real cheap one and
[00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:02.540]   I wouldn't do anything I want it would I get the sweet like 12 core version but then the
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:05.620]   extra cost that comes with and then it's the same conversation.
[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:10.100]   I'm sure you're going to have Leo is just like you and I spent thousands of dollars
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:14.580]   on the I Mac Pro because we felt like we have to have this.
[00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:19.260]   But now that I have a 10 core I Mac Pro, I just don't see the justification.
[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:20.260]   I want it.
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:21.260]   But it's new and shiny, right?
[00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:22.260]   It's new and shiny.
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:23.260]   Very shiny.
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:24.260]   It's so shiny.
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:25.260]   I really want it.
[00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:27.540]   But of course I have no reason to buy it.
[00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:34.260]   Maybe I could Hey, Carson, do the editors need this?
[00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:37.620]   The producers do producers don't get it.
[00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:42.540]   The producers get a my old laptop when I'm through.
[00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:47.220]   I'm concerned about the lack of bandwidth on the Mac that I have in the office used for
[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:48.220]   streaming.
[00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:50.580]   I just want to make sure that you were.
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:54.220]   What what you do what like is always the smartest thing to do whenever Apple comes up
[00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:59.380]   with a great new design, wait six to eight months, then go to aliexpress.com, buy for
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:05.140]   like $80 and enclosure that looks exactly like this, the new Mac Pro and then put like
[00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:07.500]   an Intel nook in it or something.
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:08.500]   Yeah.
[00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:10.260]   Running Linux.
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:11.260]   Yeah.
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:12.260]   Yeah.
[00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:15.980]   But the but the but the full Ubuntu not not the Linux Mint.
[00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:16.980]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:17.980]   I get all that power.
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:18.980]   I know.
[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:23.980]   No, no exobuntu for me, man.
[00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:27.500]   Celebrate says don't get all excited about the privacy in your iPhone.
[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:32.740]   Celebrate the Israeli company that is famous for unlocking phones says, Oh, yeah.
[00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:38.580]   Now we don't have any proof of this, but they tweeted, celebrate is proud to introduce
[00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:44.860]   you fed premium and exclusive solution for law enforcement to unlock and extract data
[00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:51.020]   from all iOS and high-end Android devices.
[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:57.140]   So they're not too worried about iOS locking them out.
[00:51:57.140 --> 00:52:01.020]   I don't know if you know, the problem is these companies always boast about it, but they
[00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:02.140]   don't give you a demo.
[00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:03.140]   So I don't know.
[00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:04.140]   Yeah.
[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:08.380]   As a as a science writer, friend of mine often says, mega curth baker when I've aged
[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:09.540]   these, she's really wonderful.
[00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:10.540]   I stole a line from her.
[00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:11.540]   He's all the time.
[00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:12.540]   Interesting.
[00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:13.540]   If true.
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:14.540]   Interesting, if true.
[00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:15.540]   Very good.
[00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:16.540]   Yeah.
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:17.540]   It's also.
[00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:19.500]   It's also sort of important.
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:24.620]   Well, that's right, because 13 would probably block every way they have getting in, but celebrate
[00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:27.620]   is saying all the way up to 12.3.
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:28.620]   Yeah.
[00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:30.620]   And then we'll be cutting mouse.
[00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:33.460]   I was under.
[00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:37.380]   I was kind of under the assumption that there's a lot of companies out there, you know, especially
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:40.660]   kind of funded by the government that are, they're all doing that.
[00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:43.820]   They're all getting to that point where they can crack into phones and stuff.
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:47.980]   But what's weird about this particular one is they're sort of publicly bragging about
[00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:48.980]   it.
[00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:52.740]   It's not something that they're kind of keeping behind, you know, the away from the public
[00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:56.060]   eye, but just only talking to police or governments about it.
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:57.500]   But they're saying, guess what?
[00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:00.860]   Everybody in the public world, your phone is not protected anymore.
[00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:04.260]   And the government and the police are going to be able to access it.
[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:08.820]   That's the thing that seems a little like, Oh, I mean, we, I assumed it was happening,
[00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:14.260]   but being sort of bragging about it is the part that's like different to me.
[00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:16.980]   It also feels like throwing down the gauntlet to Apple.
[00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:17.820]   Right.
[00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:18.820]   Yeah.
[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:19.820]   Fix this.
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:22.740]   This isn't the NSA.
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:27.060]   They are, they are advertising for for sales and services.
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:28.700]   So I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:32.060]   And also this is, this is, this is kind of like the boasting they did the last time where
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:34.620]   they said that, Oh, it doesn't even matter what happens.
[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:38.380]   We can just, any time we can introduce USB into this, we can actually get this correct.
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:43.300]   And it turned out to be maybe true, not really, but depends on how it's configured, depends
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:45.180]   on what update that someone has.
[00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:51.060]   But although it's, it's, it's once again, it's a, Laurie is, I, I, I'm sure absolutely
[00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:55.820]   right that there are always people who are in governments that have the ability to get
[00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:57.260]   into a phone.
[00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:02.500]   And this is why I, again, I really wish that Apple would at least put like a little light
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:08.140]   gray asterisk on a white bass background when they say that our privacy is absolute and
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:14.020]   total and secure because it's, that's not going to be the case.
[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:15.580]   Let's take a little break more to come.
[00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:18.420]   Andy Inako from Boston Public Radio WGBH.
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:23.300]   She's in the library again today, but I love it how you're mixing up your backdrops.
[00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:25.460]   So it's always a new thing.
[00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:29.460]   See, again, there's a, there's a lake, a pond behind me.
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:31.420]   There's like birds flitting in about.
[00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:36.700]   It's like, it's, I think it makes a nice change of pace from my paper screen that I put up
[00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:39.540]   because you don't see how horrible my actual writing tables.
[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:43.860]   Jerry Seinfeld might creep up behind you and from the bushes and knock on the window.
[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:44.860]   I don't know why.
[00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:48.700]   No, no, we should do it like the today show where like the windows in the world.
[00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:50.100]   I'm kind of hold up.
[00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:55.300]   Hey, it's my grandma's hundredth birthday or, you know, also, right.
[00:54:55.300 --> 00:55:00.660]   Gil is here of the fabulous band, sick burn managing.
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:02.340]   That's your top credit managing editor.
[00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:04.540]   And I'm more always a pleasure.
[00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:05.540]   Lori.
[00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:06.540]   Thank you for being here.
[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:07.540]   Happy to be here.
[00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:08.540]   Renee Richie.
[00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:14.340]   Apparently Lori's employee at I'm worth talking about.
[00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:16.260]   He, please, he runs, he runs.
[00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:18.220]   He runs I'm more and vector has almost no budget.
[00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:20.220]   So I got to be on my.
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:22.060]   Yeah, vector the podcast.
[00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:24.300]   That's the, that's the place to see the.
[00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:27.060]   I get to decide on that just with very little funding.
[00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:28.060]   Yes.
[00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:31.100]   You get all the budget, all $10 a month.
[00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:32.100]   Yep.
[00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:33.100]   Yep.
[00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:34.100]   I'm more.com slash vector.
[00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:36.100]   I showed a go ahead.
[00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:39.540]   There's so many advantages to having Lori on the show.
[00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:43.900]   Part of it is that sort of like back talk between like, you know, I know, of course,
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:46.020]   I do this thing for no budget whatsoever.
[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:48.420]   And all I want was one new computer.
[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:50.820]   I didn't miss that sub tweet between the two of you, by the way.
[00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:51.820]   I didn't miss that.
[00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:52.820]   I saw.
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:55.380]   Lori, Lori's got a like, she's got like, I don't know, a dozen people.
[00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:57.300]   She's got to make sure they're doing stuff with.
[00:55:57.300 --> 00:56:01.540]   I don't envy that sort of grand central just back.
[00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:02.860]   She has to go through every day.
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:03.860]   We're just thrilled.
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:04.860]   Damn it.
[00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:07.660]   I'm trying to stir some stuff up and get a audience up.
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:11.300]   Oh, well, I'm getting my Mac pro, Lori.
[00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:12.300]   It's mine.
[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:13.300]   Oh, mine.
[00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:14.300]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:15.540]   I think go to your room.
[00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:18.540]   No, there's no way we're buying it because, I mean, we don't know yet what it'll cost
[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:22.140]   in September, but no way you want the base model.
[00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:27.580]   So it's if you get that in the monitor, it's $12,000 out the door for the base model.
[00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:28.580]   Right.
[00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:29.580]   It's going to be.
[00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:30.580]   But then I can replace the base.
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:31.580]   Yeah, I know.
[00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:32.580]   I know.
[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:33.580]   I know.
[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:35.580]   It's an awful lot of money.
[00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:37.340]   I think you need a timeout.
[00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:41.540]   Maybe I should assign you to the Bluetooth speaker beat for the next three months.
[00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:44.420]   Oh, that would be punishment.
[00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:46.420]   That would be good.
[00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:49.180]   Are you sure they brought to you by Atlassian?
[00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:52.540]   Actually, it's brought to you by our fabulous IT team.
[00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:58.580]   They're brought to you by Atlassian, the collaboration software that powers IT teams all around the
[00:56:58.580 --> 00:56:59.580]   world.
[00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:03.500]   Everybody I think knows about Atlassian's JIRA, which is a fantastic tool.
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:05.660]   But I think people think it's just for developers.
[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:09.420]   It's the company behind the tool that agile uses.
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:13.300]   But Atlassian's really more about collaboration than anything else.
[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:17.740]   JIRA and all the Atlassian tools are not just for developers.
[00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:24.060]   They help power IT teams all over the world because IT is the center of almost all modern
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:31.780]   businesses, certainly ours, but any business, if you're in the cloud, if you deliver content
[00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:37.380]   as we do or products using the internet, you've got to have an IT team that can plan and
[00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:40.420]   execute faster than ever.
[00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:44.420]   Applications are more complex than ever, so our configurations, incidents require open,
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:49.980]   agile, and smart cooperation between ops and software development teams.
[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:54.500]   The expectations are high, the stakes are high, and it's IT at the center.
[00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:57.900]   Falling short of business critical work closes, just not an option.
[00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:01.740]   That's why Atlassian is such an important tool for us.
[00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:06.140]   Atlassian's tools are designed to manage complex collaboration.
[00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:13.220]   In every possible team of all sizes, from DevOps to Agile to IT apps to ops to ITSM,
[00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:18.220]   and whatever's next for your organization, you can plan, service, and support the kind
[00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:20.140]   of change that propels the business.
[00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:24.420]   We use JIRA to keep track of projects who's responsible, who's doing it, what stage the
[00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:25.620]   projects in.
[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:30.260]   But also for me, very important is documentation, and that's where confluence is fabulous.
[00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:35.460]   It's been our goal for years to get everybody, our IT teams, to keep track of everything
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:36.660]   they do to document it.
[00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:43.980]   So when somebody else comes in to take a job, Alex just left, Jeff's new.
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:49.580]   It's nice that he can go to confluence and see what's going on, how things work.
[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:52.420]   If you've got a code base, you need Bitbucket.
[00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:57.460]   With Ops Genie and Status Page, your team can better detect incidents, coordinate response
[00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:01.660]   efforts to resolve issues faster and to keep customers and stakeholders up to date.
[00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:02.660]   That's important.
[00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:03.660]   I'm a stakeholder.
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:04.660]   The boss is a stakeholder.
[00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:06.700]   I want to know what's going on.
[00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:10.740]   Your team can choose the tool that's right for your current framework and trust.
[00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:14.700]   Look at all those Atlassian apps that as you grow Atlassian will have something just for
[00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:16.940]   you and it can grow with you.
[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:21.220]   And of course, because it all integrates seamlessly, you don't have to ever leave any program.
[00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:24.700]   You don't have to bounce from platform to platform, and teams like that too.
[00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:25.700]   It's efficient.
[00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:26.700]   It gets the job done.
[00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:30.020]   The tool for your IT team is easy and free to try.
[00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:37.020]   Go to Atlassian.com/teams/it and find out which Atlassian offering is right for your team.
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:43.420]   Atlassian.com/teams/it.
[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:47.860]   Atlassian makes tools for the future of IT and the present too.
[00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:51.820]   We thank them for their support, for helping our team work more efficiently, more effectively.
[00:59:51.820 --> 01:00:01.980]   We encourage you to visit them.
[01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:05.340]   Are you using the beta of iOS 13 anybody here?
[01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.300]   I can't wait for the public beta.
[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:08.300]   What do you think?
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:11.740]   I don't recommend it.
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:14.340]   You don't recommend it and Laurie loves it.
[01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:18.780]   I know it's great, but I love it.
[01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:19.780]   It's fantastic.
[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:24.700]   Last year, there was so much effort put into optimizing everything.
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:25.900]   It was part of the big messaging.
[01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:28.260]   It was the flagship number one feature.
[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:30.700]   It was going to run so much better on everything.
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:35.260]   That beta was really solid from the first day of WWDC on.
[01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:37.500]   This is not that.
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:42.340]   I would strenuously recommend people wait for the public beta, but the features themselves
[01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:43.340]   are really, really cool.
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:44.340]   When is the public beta?
[01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:45.340]   Is it next month?
[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:46.340]   They said July.
[01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:47.340]   That's the only wording we got.
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:48.340]   Sometime.
[01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:49.340]   They said next month.
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:52.020]   I can't wait to put it on my iPad Pro.
[01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:57.500]   Slowly, as people use the developer beta, we're getting new information about tips that
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:01.940]   Apple did not talk about at WWDC.
[01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:03.540]   This is from Apple.
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:08.140]   I'm sorry, from Mac Rumors, new Wi-Fi options in the control center.
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:12.260]   This has always been a pet peeve of mine is that I opened the control center and I want
[01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:15.900]   a long press on my Wi-Fi to get to the settings.
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:22.140]   Now, you can, you couldn't before, we just turn it off, but it was not what I was looking
[01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:23.140]   for.
[01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:27.980]   Same thing with Bluetooth, a long press or a force touch on the Bluetooth icon will give
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:34.700]   you paired devices and then a quick jump to the Bluetooth settings if you want.
[01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:40.580]   Locations access is getting scaled back in iOS 13, but there's also a new option that
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:46.300]   says the app, I think this is brilliant, we'll have to ask every time.
[01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:52.700]   You may not want that, but this is a more refined between never allow access, only allow
[01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:54.700]   one using the app.
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:57.420]   Actually, did they get rid of, always allow?
[01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:58.980]   I don't see that here.
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:00.420]   Yeah, because there's just...
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:06.180]   There's APIs for apps that really need like for turn-by-turn directions that really need
[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:10.260]   to have constant background access, but almost every app really only needs it when it's active.
[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:13.420]   So this is a privacy control, absolutely.
[01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:14.420]   And ask...
[01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:18.020]   The best thing about it, and I'm sure that's in the MacRumors list is if an app has been
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:20.860]   using a location in the background, I think we're going to talk about it, it pops up
[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:25.420]   not just a request, but a map showing every point on the map that it's recorded your location
[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:29.060]   so that you can make a very visual, very educated decision about it.
[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:33.500]   Yeah, that's what we need, because honestly, I don't like all the pop-ups, I just usually
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.660]   say, "Yeah, let it have it, I don't care."
[01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:39.140]   But it would be nice to know what it's keeping track of, absolutely.
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:40.140]   There's now a new switch...
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:42.140]   And also remind you...
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:43.140]   Yes, yeah.
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:47.820]   But also to remind you, if you're not really using an app anymore, "Oh, that's right, I
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:51.940]   tested this out, I didn't like it," and it's still collecting all this data on me, I should
[01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:53.780]   go shut that off.
[01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:54.780]   Yep.
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:58.860]   Here's a switch to ignore blocks, senders, and email.
[01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:04.340]   So email now has kind of the same features you've had in your phone and contacts.
[01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:05.340]   You can mute threads.
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:09.100]   Look at that mute button, I like that.
[01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:11.660]   You can set a reading goal in iBooks.
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:14.980]   The Books app has a reading goal feature that keeps track of how long you've read every
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:15.980]   day.
[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:17.900]   I want to do that, I like that idea.
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:22.660]   I'm trying to build up the number of minutes I spend reading every day.
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:25.260]   I just wish it was additive to your day and not subtract...
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:27.100]   Like if you could just add that extra time to every day.
[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:28.100]   Would that be nice.
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:29.100]   Not have to spend the rest of the day.
[01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:30.100]   That's what audio books are for, right?
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:31.100]   That's what audio books are for.
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:32.100]   Yep.
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:37.140]   Silence Unknown Callers, this is a really good solution for robo calls.
[01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:41.680]   I presume when they say Unknown Callers, it's not Callers Without Call or ID, but it's
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.340]   Callers that are not in your contact list.
[01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:47.340]   I would hope it's that because all spam calls have caller ID.
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:48.340]   It's just spurious.
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:52.980]   It'd be nice to say, "Hey, if that person's not in my contact list, I don't want to...
[01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:53.980]   Don't ring the phone.
[01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.340]   Just send them straight to voicemail."
[01:03:56.340 --> 01:04:02.060]   There's a low data mode that lets you reduce your network data use if you get down to the
[01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:05.940]   last few megabytes of your data plan.
[01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:06.940]   Message search.
[01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:09.180]   Oh, but asking me this is a long time.
[01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:11.100]   So good.
[01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:13.580]   So what's different in message search?
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:14.580]   I mean, it works.
[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:16.820]   Oh, that's a big change.
[01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:21.620]   So like today, I work with a bunch of different people and there's the version of Laurie for
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:24.340]   Windows Central as Al and Al was asking me a question.
[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:27.860]   And I knew that Laurie and I had talked about it in iMessage and that we'd mentioned our
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:28.860]   overall boss, Kevin.
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:32.460]   So I just typed in Kevin, chose the Laurie thread, but right to that message, I read
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:33.460]   exactly what I needed.
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:35.380]   I pasted it in and it was good.
[01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:36.900]   That's really huge.
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:43.500]   That's the kind of thing programs like Slack really make their name on and stuff like that.
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:49.380]   The theory is that these conversations we have in messages are permanent and we want
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:52.140]   to be able to access them because they're a resource.
[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:55.380]   So there's some that you want to delete immediately if not sooner and others that you want to
[01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:58.940]   keep forever and the ones that you want to keep forever should be available to you rapidly
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:04:59.940]   when you want them.
[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:00.940]   Exactly.
[01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:01.940]   Yeah, there's...
[01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:06.340]   You went over to a friend's house a year ago and they gave you their address and you've
[01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:10.580]   chatted with them for the last year and then you go back over to their house and you're
[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:12.940]   like, "Ugh, now I have to ask them for their address."
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:14.740]   Just scroll all the way up to the top.
[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:15.740]   Yeah.
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:16.740]   I do that a lot.
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:19.340]   And then it reloads, which at the bottom again.
[01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:20.340]   Oh, it's going.
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:21.340]   Yeah.
[01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:22.340]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:23.340]   Yeah.
[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:24.340]   Oh.
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:30.300]   There'll be folder management built into notes, including renaming and moving the folders.
[01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:32.140]   That's great.
[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:34.540]   They mentioned Xbox and PS4 controllers.
[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:35.540]   Here's how you manage it.
[01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:37.940]   You'll be able to...
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:39.940]   That's nice that they're going to feature a new Animoji.
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:44.860]   Look, there's a mouse, a squid and a cow.
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:45.860]   New memeoji.
[01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:47.860]   Okay, it's a creepy.
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:48.860]   Actually, I'm sorry.
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:49.860]   That's not a squid.
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:50.860]   It's an octopus.
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:52.460]   If you just count the arms, Leo, you'd know.
[01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:53.460]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:55.100]   There's only six arms.
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:56.100]   Yeah.
[01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:57.860]   There's a couple of hidden ones in there.
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:05:58.860]   Okay.
[01:05:58.860 --> 01:05:59.860]   Yeah.
[01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:02.180]   Separate emoji and globe keys.
[01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:04.740]   So in the past, you've had to scroll, go through.
[01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:08.500]   If you have a bunch of keyboards, keep hitting that globe key.
[01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.980]   But the emoji key now is right up here next to the...
[01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:11.980]   I'm still doing it wrong.
[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:15.180]   I keep hitting the globe key to get the emoji and then I go, "Dah!"
[01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:16.180]   No.
[01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:19.860]   Clearly, this is something useful for you, Renee.
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:21.780]   Automatic tab closing in Safari.
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:22.780]   That's a really nice idea.
[01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:25.460]   So many nerds got so anxious about this.
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:27.060]   They're like, "Oh, my tabs!"
[01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:28.500]   But you can choose it.
[01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:29.500]   It's not on by default.
[01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:30.500]   They're not going to take your tabs on the internet.
[01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:33.540]   Oh, but I love this idea because I actually don't want all those tabs.
[01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:38.500]   And I'm always shocked when I hit the tab button in my Safari on iOS.
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:39.500]   And I go, "What?"
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:40.980]   Oh, all those tabs are...
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:43.380]   They don't take a lot of memory, I'm sure, but still.
[01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:44.380]   I don't like that.
[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:46.140]   It's just cleaning up.
[01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:47.140]   Cleaning up.
[01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:49.980]   Attachment some calendars.
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:50.980]   What's that for?
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:52.820]   Adding attention to the calendar.
[01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:53.820]   Do I have stuff in the calendar?
[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:54.820]   Oh, okay.
[01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:55.820]   Good idea.
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:59.860]   So, like, if you have a meeting, you can put the meeting notes in as an attachment.
[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:02.380]   They'll be right there.
[01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:08.940]   To update apps in iOS 13, you open up the App Store, tap on your profile, and choose
[01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:12.860]   apps from the Pending Updates section.
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:13.860]   So they've taken...
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:14.860]   I don't know if I like this.
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:18.060]   They took the App Date tab out of the App Store.
[01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:19.060]   Yep.
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:20.060]   For arcade.
[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:24.620]   You know, I think they already do it like that on the Mac App Store.
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:30.340]   So I could see what their thinking is to just kind of redirect you to your profile.
[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:32.260]   That's where kind of your personal things are.
[01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:34.900]   But what if I don't want arcade?
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:36.700]   Also, Julie's Memoji is good.
[01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:37.700]   I'm just going to put that out there.
[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:38.700]   Julie is a bit over.
[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:41.220]   I have a cute emoji with pink hair.
[01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:43.700]   Kind of looks like you a little bit, Laurie.
[01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:44.700]   You can't find it.
[01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:45.700]   Go ahead.
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:46.700]   Press the right button.
[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:47.700]   There we go.
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:49.700]   There it is.
[01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:50.700]   Safari screenshots.
[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:54.580]   When you take a screenshot and Safari, there's an image.
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:56.460]   The new option to save it is a full page.
[01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:57.460]   I love this so much.
[01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:00.620]   Oh my God, which exports the entire web page as a PDF.
[01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:01.620]   Yep.
[01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:02.620]   It's not on Mac yet.
[01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:05.860]   I'd love it on Mac just for Final Cut Pro, but it is available on iPad as well.
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:06.860]   So I've been using it there.
[01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:08.340]   I don't want a screenshot.
[01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:10.220]   I want the page.
[01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:11.460]   Now I can get it.
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:12.460]   Yep.
[01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:18.820]   It's particularly given that A, there's some important stuff that you forget to screenshot
[01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:19.820]   or capture.
[01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:24.540]   And also, sometimes the data that you need a year later has been removed from the internet.
[01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:27.980]   You need an ability to actually keep it as a PDF.
[01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:32.140]   I've got a huge, huge folder of nothing but PDFs of things that I don't even know if there's
[01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:36.380]   any chance whatsoever that this will be here in a month, let alone a year.
[01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:37.740]   So yeah, that's such a good thing.
[01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:42.820]   Especially on a phone where it's like the thing you need is here is a list of all of
[01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:47.180]   the ways that you can get a cab in this foreign airport you know nothing about.
[01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:50.700]   And then of course, as soon as you land for some reason, you can't connect to the internet
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:51.700]   or something.
[01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:53.700]   Yes, this is such a big thing.
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:58.060]   I can't, I'm not installing anything until we get to the public beta stage, but I have
[01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:04.060]   never been so excited about putting a beta on my iPad and my, so many new features.
[01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:07.020]   This one that a lot of people have been talking about optimize battery charging.
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:11.700]   It knows if your battery is getting old, it gives you a switch that says, don't charge
[01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:13.300]   it up all the way.
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:15.540]   Don't charge it up all the way.
[01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:16.540]   This is what I do.
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:19.460]   Actually, most cars with batteries do this.
[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:25.620]   My Tesla and our Bolt, it's generally not considered a good idea to charge the battery
[01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:27.260]   up all the way.
[01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:28.700]   They rotate charging.
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:33.220]   So it's, you charge it to 80% unless you need that extra juice.
[01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:35.620]   And that's, that's exactly what this switch will do.
[01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:40.300]   The iPhone will learn from your daily routine so you can wait to finish charging past 80%
[01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:42.220]   until you have to.
[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:43.220]   That's a great idea.
[01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:45.980]   Improvements in the home kit.
[01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:47.740]   We talked a little bit about that on iOS today.
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:49.100]   My cusargent was on.
[01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:51.100]   He's a home kit expert.
[01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:57.180]   We talked a little bit about the new iOS 13 home kit features, including the new, you
[01:09:57.180 --> 01:10:00.980]   know, camera features, which will be great.
[01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:01.980]   Photos zoom.
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:05.540]   You can photo zoom in and out of your photos tab.
[01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:07.500]   Zoom in and out with a pinch gesture.
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:10.540]   These are little minor ones now.
[01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:12.020]   Time synced lyrics and Apple music.
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:13.660]   We talked about that.
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:14.660]   Yep.
[01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:20.500]   Up next in Apple music, voice memos, a new pinch to zoom in the voice memo so you can
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:21.700]   zoom in on the waveform.
[01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:22.700]   That's nice.
[01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:24.740]   That's a good thing for editing waveforms.
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:31.380]   Do not disturb while driving will activate on iOS 13 while you're using public transit.
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:32.380]   That's a good idea.
[01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:35.500]   Don't want to take calls in the middle of a bus ride.
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.980]   There's quite a few at most.
[01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:41.540]   There'll be at most playback.
[01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:43.420]   Popular Wi-Fi networks.
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:46.660]   Your phone will detect which Wi-Fi networks are being used and let you know if one is
[01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:50.020]   available.
[01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:53.420]   I like this delete Facebook command.
[01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:55.700]   You can delete apps.
[01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:58.220]   Doesn't delete Libra along with it.
[01:10:58.220 --> 01:10:59.220]   That would be nice.
[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:03.900]   You could swipe right on the updates page and delete directly from there, which is a great
[01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:04.900]   thing.
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:06.340]   Because often I see that's still updating.
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:11.140]   I didn't want that in the first place and that's a good place to delete it.
[01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:12.140]   Timer's been up to a point.
[01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:14.060]   There's a lot of stuff in here.
[01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:15.060]   This is funny.
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:20.060]   This NFC tags, which is pretty funny, people said, "You can now scan your passport using
[01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:22.340]   the NFC reader."
[01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:27.380]   That's something Apple has in the past locked out, but most other phones with NFC, near
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:29.900]   field communication readers who were able to do that.
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:35.300]   iPhones will be able to read Japanese national identity cards.
[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:38.380]   That's the big deal.
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:45.260]   NFC is now way too important not to support an API because it is really being used for
[01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:46.260]   border control.
[01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:51.820]   It's being used at kiosks, being used in public transportation.
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:55.780]   That's a good way for Apple to be left behind if they don't let developers get access to
[01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:57.340]   the NFC chip.
[01:11:57.340 --> 01:12:01.540]   If you update to beta 2 of 13, which has just come out, did you guys get beta 2?
[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:04.460]   I haven't done it yet.
[01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:10.460]   You might like this, you can unsubscribe when you uninstall an app with a paid subscription.
[01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:11.820]   Oh, hallelujah.
[01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:16.180]   This is something that bothers me because we're always showing apps.
[01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:22.260]   I install a lot of apps, pay for subscriptions, and then forget about it.
[01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:27.020]   Even if you try that two-week period, I think a lot of people will be more likely to try
[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:33.340]   out that two-week period for something, knowing that it will be really easy to just automatically
[01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:38.300]   unsubscribe if they don't like it instead of never even subscribing in the first place
[01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:42.860]   because they're afraid they'll forget to unsubscribe in two weeks or a month or whenever
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:43.860]   they're a subscription.
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:45.900]   It's a really great way to...
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:47.460]   It's good for everyone.
[01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:51.460]   It is good for developers who have subscriptions because more people will be more likely to
[01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:53.460]   try it out.
[01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:56.860]   When you delete the app, it'll say, "Hey, you have an active subscription on this app.
[01:12:56.860 --> 01:12:58.860]   You think you should delete it?"
[01:12:58.860 --> 01:12:59.860]   Yes.
[01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:03.020]   They also added the new photography in yesterday's beta.
[01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:05.420]   Oh, this is the new studio lighting.
[01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:06.420]   Yeah.
[01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:07.620]   That's pretty good.
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:08.620]   Wow.
[01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:09.620]   It's really nice.
[01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:10.620]   I didn't even try for this.
[01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:12.420]   I just literally turned it on, turned it towards me and pressed the button above.
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:15.660]   Do you move the light source around just arbitrarily?
[01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:16.660]   No.
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:18.060]   It works the same as the previous one.
[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:21.100]   It just gives you a white background instead of a black background and does a bunch of
[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:25.020]   other adjustments to make it look good on those background.
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:28.540]   I had a whole living room behind me just removed that company.
[01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:29.540]   That's sweet.
[01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:35.020]   Can we just start calling that the Steve Jobs, Walter, I just added the book cover filter
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:37.020]   and just make sure that that becomes the kind of--
[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:38.700]   Or just the Johnny, the Johnny for sure.
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:39.700]   For sure.
[01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:40.700]   Johnny filter.
[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:41.700]   Yeah.
[01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:42.700]   It really looks better to me.
[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:44.500]   It looks better than the black background.
[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.460]   It smooths it out better.
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:51.220]   So it really looks like just a nicer, cleaner image.
[01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:54.900]   The black background always seems a little bit jarring to me.
[01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:59.380]   And often times it's because the technology--
[01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:02.060]   There's like your hair gets cut off weird or something like that.
[01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:08.100]   And the white one just seems to be just better at hiding mistakes and letting your eyes sort
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:11.100]   of like agree with what it's looking at.
[01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:16.260]   By the way, somebody in the chat room is pointing out that now that there's an NFC
[01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:21.020]   API that LastPass can use a Yuba key through NFC on your iPhone.
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:22.020]   That's great.
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:23.020]   What were you showing us Renee?
[01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:24.020]   That was--
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:25.100]   Oh, you can edit them.
[01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:28.020]   So you pull it, you press a button and just like the depth control, you can--
[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:29.020]   Oh, you can see it's fine.
[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:30.020]   You can edit the amount of the effect.
[01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:31.020]   Nice.
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:32.020]   Yeah.
[01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:33.020]   That's really cool.
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:35.820]   Button focus, but you can control how much of the effect is applied.
[01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:37.500]   That's just really nice.
[01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:41.420]   So the rest of the world will get that either if you're brave and use the public beta or
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:43.620]   you wait till September.
[01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:46.980]   Apple TV also getting an update.
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:50.660]   The TVOS will have picture in picture mode.
[01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:54.940]   So you could-- now I figured out today why you would want that.
[01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:59.820]   So that you could continue to watch TV while you're playing a game on your Apple TV.
[01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:00.820]   How about that?
[01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:06.060]   Crossy Road while I got the ball game right in the background.
[01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:07.060]   Nice.
[01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:12.860]   Speaking of Apple TV, we're hearing more about Apple's content ambitions.
[01:15:12.860 --> 01:15:22.940]   They didn't get J.J. Abrams production studio, a major upset, Hollywood Reporter and Deadliner
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:28.700]   saying that the AT&T owned Warner media is closing a half billion dollar deal with bad
[01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:29.700]   robot.
[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:33.620]   J.J. Abrams production company.
[01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:42.060]   Bad robot was taking bids from Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Tipsters, said that Apple was close
[01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:44.620]   to landing the deal.
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:48.220]   But apparently, Warner media's victory came down to the breadth of what it could offer.
[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:51.140]   This is according to John Fingus in writing in the--
[01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:52.900]   It feels like the way it is.
[01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:56.700]   I mean, there was another story about Apple's Oscar ambitions and then putting like 30 million
[01:15:56.700 --> 01:15:59.380]   towards Oscar movies, which is a drop in the bucket.
[01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:01.220]   30 million, that's been 30 billion.
[01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:02.220]   Yeah, it's maybe.
[01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:07.140]   Yeah, but it feels like this is like the best of all worlds for Apple at least because
[01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:11.700]   they already have a J.J. Abrams show and J.J. Abrams production company makes projects
[01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:14.460]   for all sorts of different networks and films and companies.
[01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:18.180]   So they can just get the ones they want if they're willing to pay for them and let J.J.
[01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:22.020]   do everything else for Warner's and other companies, Tom Cruise and whoever else he's
[01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:23.020]   producing is that for?
[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:28.580]   I mean, I'm not an expert on what it costs to make a movie, but these are basically small
[01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:30.540]   budget movies.
[01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:37.140]   According to the New York Post, Apple wants to spend between $5 and $30 million on elevated
[01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:38.140]   movies.
[01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:39.140]   Hi, Oscar winners.
[01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:40.140]   Oscar winners.
[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:44.180]   That's also a really smart investment there.
[01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:51.980]   You can get names that you couldn't get otherwise because if someone who has made 100 million
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:57.620]   dollars as an actor, if they don't have an Oscar, they still really want that Oscar.
[01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:02.700]   And so if you if you if they have a project that no one will touch because oh my God,
[01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:05.380]   she's an actor who is above the age of 30.
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:09.500]   And plus it's based on a book that was published 80 years ago.
[01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:15.060]   And suddenly Apple says that we will not only give you the money for that movie and
[01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:19.660]   approve like all of your casting for it, but we will also put $4 million into an Oscar
[01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:21.860]   campaign for it, which is just as important.
[01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:28.260]   So that's such it's such an interesting chess game trying to try to launch a content catalogs,
[01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:32.980]   not just about how much for the how much for the entire Beverly Hill Belize three series.
[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:33.980]   Great.
[01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:35.700]   Okay, we'll take the Beverly Belverly Oak Belize.
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:40.860]   It really is you have to you're dealing with personalities as as well as content where you
[01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:46.940]   have to make sure that this person who is so power who can basically keep making machines
[01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:49.000]   that make money for you.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:54.040]   Make sure they're happy and sometimes it really is about by my by my boat that I've been trying
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:56.040]   to sell for the past four years.
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:18:00.520]   And sometimes it is help me to get an Oscar for somebody who really needs deserves an
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:01.520]   Oscar.
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:10.080]   JJ Abrams said that bad robot was going to go to Warner because of the distribution.
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:11.080]   And that makes sense.
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:14.840]   That's the one thing we thought that Apple might not be a have a level playing field
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:17.480]   because it sounds like a billion pockets.
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:19.480]   A billion pockets, y'all.
[01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:20.840]   That's a lot of people.
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:25.440]   But maybe for JJ, you want it to be on a screen, a big screen, not on a little scale.
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:27.440]   I don't know.
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:34.520]   It's really interesting to me to see how much coverage is popping up about Apple's content
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:41.680]   for movies and TV that, you know, Netflix and Hulu and Amazon have did they didn't have
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:48.080]   any sort of advanced content or information popping up about, oh, guess what?
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:51.520]   They're going to spend this much money on this, at least not that we were paying attention
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:52.520]   to.
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:56.400]   And Apple hasn't even released anything.
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:00.280]   And we're already talking about the Oscars that they're going to try to make sure get
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:01.280]   one.
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:05.480]   It's such an interesting thing to watch play out.
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:12.840]   It's a content service that has never existed before being Apple making this content and
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:18.600]   watching the way they're planning ahead of time for the future of it.
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:23.200]   It's definitely an interesting thing to be paying attention to right now.
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:29.280]   It's something that nobody would have even thought possible until Amazon won for Moonlight
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:34.680]   and Manchester by the Sea and Netflix won for Roma.
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:39.680]   Then all of a sudden it's like, oh, you don't have to, you know, Steven Spielberg notwithstanding,
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:46.960]   you don't have to be a, you know, big screen movie company to make to win awards, major
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:47.960]   awards.
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:52.640]   So I think that's Apple's benefiting a little bit from the pioneers who've gone ahead and
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:53.960]   do done that.
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:57.680]   I wonder, I have to wonder, now this is just me trying to stir up trouble.
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:03.400]   But JJ is already doing two shows for Apple, right?
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:08.360]   He's, I think he's doing at least one or two.
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:13.200]   I wonder if the also the experience of doing that may be made JJ think, I want to go with
[01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:19.200]   somebody who's not going to take the crucifixes out of the Apple worshiping scene.
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:20.680]   I wonder, I mean, I don't know.
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:26.200]   But when the bidding for you come, like, when the bidding for you, I think that with Warner
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:27.720]   is he can make stuff for anybody.
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:29.480]   And with Apple, he probably has to make stuff for Apple.
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:30.920]   I don't think they have a studio system.
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:31.920]   That's right.
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:32.920]   That's exactly right.
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:33.920]   Yeah.
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:34.920]   Yeah.
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:38.480]   Also, when the bidding for your production company is up to $500 million, that's, that's,
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:41.720]   that's Mike, that's the Leonardo da Vinci money.
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:45.720]   That's when you get to see, that's when you get to say that, well, you know what, you
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:51.720]   don't get to tell me that that someone has to say, gosh darn it instead of, right, right,
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:57.680]   it's, it's, it's Apple, it's, it's, it's so much stuff about so many aspects of this
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:20:59.440]   is so interesting to me.
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:03.000]   And interesting, I'm sure to all people who've been following Apple for a while, that the
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:10.720]   ability to say that we are not going to micromanage anything about these creative people.
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:14.200]   We are not going to tell them that they're not going to make them go to Apple University
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:17.640]   and teach them how to be Apple filmmakers.
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:22.720]   We just simply have to let them do what they want to do because otherwise they will take
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:26.560]   their very, very, very profitable brain to another company.
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:27.560]   Yeah.
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:32.400]   I think the guy from W CW who's making all the arrow and flash shows Greg, I'm going to
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:34.040]   mess up his last name, Berlin Nettie.
[01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:35.720]   He got 400 million the other day.
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:39.480]   So like those deals are just falling, falling into place right now.
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:41.800]   It is by the way, not an acquisition.
[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:45.720]   It's a partnership, you know, they, they, they, and it's not clear for how many years
[01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:48.400]   or how many products productions.
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:54.560]   But yeah, that's, it's, I don't, I have to say, I don't think Apple lost much by not,
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:55.560]   not acquiring that.
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:22:00.400]   Do you think Apple's still in the market to make that kind of deal with some big name?
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:01.400]   Like a spoiler.
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:02.400]   I think they're happy the way they are.
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:05.360]   I think they really want to get like they, they don't want to make the most, I think
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:07.160]   I think you said this, they don't want to make the most content.
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:11.280]   They want to be super selective in their content and pick just a bunch of shows they're really
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:13.440]   happy with and put those out there.
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:16.600]   But I do hope that JJ being at Warner's means they're going to, they're going to give him
[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:17.600]   Justice League.
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.240]   So we can get some good DC movies.
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:21.240]   Yeah.
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:27.120]   It's a, one, one of the great things about streaming is that it's not based on how, what
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:29.840]   was the audience for the first week and the second week?
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:32.600]   And then it doesn't matter that they've already put 13 episodes in the can.
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:34.720]   They're not going to air the remaining seven.
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:38.960]   The idea that they can do a show like Doom Patrol, which is that we are guaranteeing you
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:39.960]   exactly.
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:44.480]   And it's so absolutely wonderfully weird and it is so quiet.
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:45.480]   It's so quiet.
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:46.480]   And it's on TV.
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:47.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:52.840]   And if the flips, the only flip side to that is that like I'm really disappointed that one
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:55.720]   day at a time on Netflix is not being renewed after three seasons.
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:23:00.760]   It seems as though Netflix, Netflix for instance, the size of okay, we've got three seasons,
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:03.200]   we've got enough product with this label on it.
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:07.360]   We don't have to make this into a series that goes as long as the creators want to want
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:08.800]   for it to happen.
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:10.840]   But the ability to simply say, guess what?
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:13.720]   You get 12 episodes, they will definitely all be produced.
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:15.760]   They will definitely all be available.
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:21.840]   So don't feel as though you have to either get the entire audience in one episode or
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:23.120]   you're canceled.
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:30.080]   And that is again, Doom Patrol when my I can't think of a superhero, even movie that I'm
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:32.320]   enjoying more than Doom Patrol.
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.320]   >> It's like Legion.
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:36.360]   >> It's like the time off you've seen Legion, but Legion and Doom Patrol are the two like
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:38.560]   riskiest, I think on TV right now.
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:43.080]   >> Yeah, it might also be the streaming service.
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:48.280]   The on demand streaming service existence has really benefited a lot of creative people
[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:52.800]   out there because it used to be that if you wanted to make a TV show, it had to appeal
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:54.280]   to the broadest audience.
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:56.600]   Therefore, you couldn't get weird with it.
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:24:01.720]   And now that companies like Netflix and Hulu and Amazon are, they're just throwing
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:05.560]   some money at some stuff and seeing what sticks and they're willing to take those risks and
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:11.360]   they're willing to let these creative people sort of get a little weird and see what happens
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:15.560]   and it's okay that if it doesn't hit the top charts of the Nailsense rating, it's okay
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:18.920]   if only a couple million people watch it.
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:23.560]   I think that some of the best shows that have come out at all have come out because of the
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:30.440]   ability to watch things on demand so that you're not worried about the viewership.
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:35.040]   It's less important about how many people watch to that show and more important how many people
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:37.400]   are just subscribing to your service.
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:41.520]   And of course, Abrams has been with Warner's TV since 2006.
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:43.760]   He did fringe there.
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:50.400]   According to the Hollywood Reporter, part of the issue was the Warner's CEO who was replaced.
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:53.880]   They called it a values issue.
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:25:00.040]   So maybe Warner's was getting some pressure from Bad Robot to replace this former CEO.
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:01.040]   They did.
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:02.800]   And maybe that was part of it.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:07.040]   There are three Bad Robot deals with Apple.
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:13.480]   A Stephen King adaptation, Lisi's story starring Julianne Moore, Sarah Bareilles' little voice
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:15.040]   and a Jennifer Garner vehicle.
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:19.760]   My glory was I had such friends all produced by Warner's Brothers TV.
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:22.280]   So Warner still is in the mix there.
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:28.720]   I think for Apple, half a billion dollars, it's nice to get a brand name like this, but
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:31.000]   variety might be a better long term.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.920]   I'm still hoping that Jennifer Garner thing is a secret alias reboot.
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:36.200]   I'm going to stick with that until the first episode.
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:37.200]   Yeah.
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:38.200]   Yeah.
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:39.200]   Yeah.
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:40.200]   Yeah.
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:41.200]   That robot created aliens as well.
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:44.840]   Even if they did it like the prisoner was technically a sequel to Secret Agent Man, but
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:50.240]   they couldn't they just couldn't call Patrick McGoone by his original name that I love it
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:52.100]   when creators do that.
[01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:56.080]   There's been some things in comics that have been like that where like Steve Englehart
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:01.400]   had a character he created for Marvel that has technically also appeared in his DC books
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:03.160]   and then back in Marvel again.
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:08.240]   All he has to do is not mention the name and we can make it a crossover.
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:14.720]   This is again, I like that kind of crazy and I hope that the situation will create more
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:17.560]   opportunities for crazy.
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:23.040]   Tim Cooks gave the commencement address at a little school up the road a piece from Apple
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:28.000]   Computer that called Stanford.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.260]   He's not a Stanford graduate, but I suppose he probably got an honorary degree.
[01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:35.560]   He talked about privacy.
[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:39.200]   He said if we accept his normal and unavoidable that everything in our lives could be aggregated
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:43.400]   sold or even leaked in the event of a hack and we lose so much more than data.
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:46.760]   We lose the freedom to be human.
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:49.800]   I think that's actually very accurate.
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:54.120]   I've been reading a lot lately about the idea of like little privacy, the idea that you
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:57.720]   should be able to do some things in your life, simple things that are relatively anonymous
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:01.800]   and as fewer and fewer things that you do even just going down to the store to buy a
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:04.680]   pack of Sigs becomes public.
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:09.040]   It changes how we are as human beings.
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:11.040]   Everything you, he says, think about what's at stake.
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:15.680]   Everything you write, everything you say, every topic of curiosity, every stray thought,
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:20.440]   every impulse purchase, every moment of frustration or weakness, gripe or complaint, every secret
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:23.520]   shared in confidence in a world without digital privacy.
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:28.680]   Even if you've done nothing wrong other than think differently, you begin to censor yourself.
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:33.120]   Not entirely at first, just a little bit by bit to risk less, to hope less, to imagine
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:34.600]   less to dare less.
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:36.960]   I think this is so true.
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:39.800]   He says, we deserve better.
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:41.200]   You deserve better.
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:44.280]   I think a good message to the graduates at Stanford.
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:47.480]   We also encourage them to be builders.
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:55.480]   He mentioned Steve Jobs, of course, because Jobs gave the Commensator desk 14 years earlier.
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:03.880]   He said, Cook related the story of his conviction that Jobs would recover from his cancer even
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:07.440]   as he handled the reins of Apple over to Cook.
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:10.400]   Drawing from what he learned in those dark days, Cook emphasized, "Your mentors may leave
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:12.720]   you unprepared, but they can't leave you.
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:17.800]   They leave you prepared, but they can't leave you ready."
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:22.200]   He called it the loneliness I've ever felt in my life.
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:25.960]   He said, eventually he realized he needed to be the best version of himself and that
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:30.320]   led those around him and their expectations dictate his life.
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:35.200]   Graduates, the fact is when your time comes and it will, you'll never be ready, but you're
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:37.120]   not supposed to be.
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:38.320]   Find the hope and the unexpected.
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:39.840]   Find the courage and the challenge.
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:41.400]   Find your vision in the solitary road.
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:43.200]   Don't get distracted.
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:44.920]   Very nice speech.
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:51.000]   I think he also did Tulane last month.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.880]   He spoke at Duke last year, MIT in 2017.
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:59.120]   He's not unfamiliar with these kinds of speeches.
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:00.120]   I like that.
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:03.320]   I think that a lot of the headlines that came from this commencement speech kind of hit
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:07.520]   on the, "Oh, here he is talking against Google and Facebook once again."
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:13.040]   The speech itself was very appropriate for the event.
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:19.520]   It wasn't as though he exploited a very important and expensive day in hundreds of graduates'
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:23.680]   lives and their families to talk about Apple propaganda.
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:30.240]   It really is larger issues about particularly talking to kids who grew up with the internet
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:37.040]   and grew up with a mobile device in their pockets that wouldn't prohibit them or
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:42.120]   to share anything that they wanted to share the moment it occurred to them to share it,
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:45.800]   even if five minutes later it occurred to them that maybe they shouldn't have done that.
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:49.040]   So I thought that there was a lot of cool stuff in that commencement address.
[01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:51.160]   It was heavy on the philosophy and light on the...
[01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:52.160]   Right, exactly.
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:53.640]   ...the promotion, I think that's right.
[01:29:53.640 --> 01:30:01.080]   I don't like it when you get a commencement address that is telling, inspiring all of these
[01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:06.000]   wonderful graduates about the importance of tariffs in our economic structure to make
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:12.840]   sure it's like, "Okay, I'm $250,000 in debt and I'm starting my uncle's lumberyard next
[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:19.440]   week, but I'll keep that in mind about making sure that the GNP..."
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:27.000]   And Project Catalyst gets a very important user, shall we say?
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:31.900]   Twitter has said, "We're coming back to the Mac and we're going to do it with Project
[01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:36.260]   Catalyst, Apple's formerly known as Monda Green."
[01:30:36.260 --> 01:30:37.260]   No, "Marts-a-pon."
[01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:38.260]   "Marts-a-pon."
[01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:39.260]   "Montague."
[01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:41.260]   "Montague."
[01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:48.580]   Twitter says it's going to be able to do pretty much everything that it was able to do with
[01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:55.060]   other, you know, on the iOS codebase and add native Mac features on top of it.
[01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:58.980]   The new Twitter for Mac Apple use our existing iOS codebase rather than being built from
[01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:04.020]   a separate codebase by supporting key Mac specific behaviors on top of iOS code we'll
[01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:10.020]   be able to maintain feature parity across our iOS and Mac apps with relatively low long-term
[01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:11.020]   maintenance costs.
[01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:12.820]   That's the promise of Catalyst, right, for people who have iOS apps.
[01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:15.620]   It was amazing to see the reaction to this because there were a bunch of people who were
[01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:19.700]   like, "Yes, finally, we understand that Twitter doesn't want to do both, but we're finally
[01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:20.700]   going to get a native Twitter..."
[01:31:20.700 --> 01:31:26.420]   And then a bunch of real veteran, gnarly, salty Apple developers going, "Oh, really?
[01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:27.420]   Oh, really?
[01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:28.420]   You'll have scrolling.
[01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:30.380]   You'll have windows in your app.
[01:31:30.380 --> 01:31:34.100]   If the bar were any lower, I would trip over it.
[01:31:34.100 --> 01:31:35.100]   Thank you, Twitter."
[01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:37.060]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:31:37.060 --> 01:31:38.060]   When they're...
[01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:40.140]   How are they going to take advantage of the desktop?
[01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:45.940]   It'll be nice to be able to have the advantages of a windowing manager inside Twitter where
[01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:52.540]   I can park a Twitter window off to the side and not have to create a browser window and
[01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:56.260]   then turn off the bookmarks bar, turn off the address bar, turn off all this stuff.
[01:31:56.260 --> 01:32:00.900]   But I hope that they decide to do something like TweetDeck where they figure out that
[01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:01.900]   maybe...
[01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:05.820]   Sometimes you are going to bed at 3 a.m. and you want to post something at 9 a.m.
[01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:09.340]   and you're not entirely sure you'll be awake at that time.
[01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:13.420]   I hope that they do things that actually make it worthwhile as opposed to another app that
[01:32:13.420 --> 01:32:18.420]   I have to install, another permission I have to give as opposed to just another tab and
[01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:19.420]   another browser window.
[01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:20.420]   Yeah.
[01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:22.700]   I do like TweetDeck a lot.
[01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:28.220]   Of course, there's still a large number of excellent Mac clients like TweetBot.
[01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:30.620]   Tweet, what do you use Renee?
[01:32:30.620 --> 01:32:31.620]   Anything in particular?
[01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:33.860]   I use TweetBot, but I use the multi-column functionality.
[01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:37.420]   I have the main window for my timeline, a window for my mentions and then a window just
[01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:40.420]   for vlogging blog news that's going by all day.
[01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:41.420]   Yeah.
[01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:43.020]   Laurie, do you use the web or do you...
[01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:44.020]   See, part of this is Twitter not...
[01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:45.020]   Are you Twitter-ific?
[01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:47.260]   Twitter does not want you to use Twitter-ific, right?
[01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:49.500]   Because they want to control the experience fully.
[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:50.500]   Yeah.
[01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:53.940]   Twitter-ific and I love their menu bar app.
[01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:56.700]   I think I've mentioned this multiple times to multiple people.
[01:32:56.700 --> 01:32:59.180]   I love a good menu bar app.
[01:32:59.180 --> 01:33:01.460]   Your menu bar must be so full.
[01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:02.460]   It's packed.
[01:33:02.460 --> 01:33:03.460]   It's ridiculous.
[01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:05.180]   It almost scrolls across the entire screen.
[01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:06.180]   But I love it.
[01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:07.540]   I love those little widgets.
[01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:09.940]   They just make everything so much nicer.
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:14.700]   I love i-stat menu and I have every possible part of i-stat menu turned on, which means
[01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:17.460]   it is about six inches across the top of the screen.
[01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:19.820]   Oh, Mark Edwards would love you so much.
[01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:20.820]   No, it's great.
[01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:21.820]   Even has weather.
[01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:23.180]   I use their weather everything.
[01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:24.180]   It's good.
[01:33:24.180 --> 01:33:26.780]   I love it all in there.
[01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:30.540]   Andy, I guess I should ask you if you use anything for Twitter.
[01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:31.540]   I use...
[01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:37.340]   I normally use the basic Twitter client for basic three meals a day, but I use TweetDeck
[01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:39.740]   also in the web browser.
[01:33:39.740 --> 01:33:43.180]   When it's something is going on, I want to keep track of lots of things at the same time
[01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:44.740]   or if I want to schedule something.
[01:33:44.740 --> 01:33:45.740]   Yeah.
[01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:47.060]   TweetDeck's very handy for that.
[01:33:47.060 --> 01:33:49.980]   I'm watching the Tony's for instance.
[01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:53.940]   Well, actually I didn't do it for the Tony's because it wasn't live.
[01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:54.940]   So we didn't really...
[01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:56.700]   When you're watching the Raptors.
[01:33:56.700 --> 01:33:58.540]   The Raptors, shut up.
[01:33:58.540 --> 01:33:59.540]   Congratulations.
[01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:01.740]   I have to give you congratulations.
[01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:02.820]   Well, you don't care though.
[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:03.820]   You're not a sport ball.
[01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:05.140]   No, I heard about it when they won.
[01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:06.140]   I heard about it.
[01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:09.940]   People were like, "Oh, Canada's going to have the world's most peaceful celebration ever."
[01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:12.060]   And I'm like, "Did you ever see any of our hockey champions?"
[01:34:12.060 --> 01:34:13.060]   Oh my God.
[01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:14.060]   How did it go?
[01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:15.060]   It was yesterday, right?
[01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:16.060]   It was a great game.
[01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:18.780]   Every time we win something, Canada comes like, "What's that?
[01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:19.780]   The purge?
[01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:21.300]   It comes like the purge for 24 hours."
[01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:22.300]   Yeah.
[01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:23.580]   Okay, but don't be so modest.
[01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:28.780]   You still have your fan riots, but nobody gets bankrupted because they fell off of a
[01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:30.780]   light stand and hit the street.
[01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:31.780]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:35.860]   The socialized medicine after a rumble is a very good thing.
[01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:36.860]   Fair.
[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:40.620]   Yeah, I use TweetDeck everywhere just because it's in my browser.
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:41.980]   It's easy to do.
[01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:44.780]   And I love being able to customize the columns for news stories.
[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:48.580]   And we're covering an Apple event or a keynote from Google or something.
[01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:51.500]   Having that extra column running.
[01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:52.660]   And I love live update.
[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:54.540]   I guess everybody does live update now.
[01:34:54.540 --> 01:34:55.540]   They can't.
[01:34:55.540 --> 01:35:00.100]   I mean, the new APIs made it so that TweetDeck, TweetBot and TweetOut sort of can't do live
[01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:01.100]   updates.
[01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:02.300]   And I forget, and notifications either.
[01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:04.260]   Oh, that's terrible.
[01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:06.620]   Twitter kept it for themselves because TweetDecked up.
[01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:07.620]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:08.620]   Hell yeah.
[01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:09.620]   Those guys can't though.
[01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:10.620]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:35:10.620 --> 01:35:14.380]   I guess that's what everyone would start talking about is whether or not Twitter has
[01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:20.780]   a monopoly or an antitrust when they start telling people that they can't do their, they
[01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:24.380]   can't, you know, like other people can't make third party clients that do the things
[01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:25.380]   that they do.
[01:35:25.380 --> 01:35:29.380]   I mean, isn't that kind of the same thing as people claiming that Apple has a monopoly
[01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:34.620]   because they want to keep the app store the way they want it to be.
[01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:41.180]   It's pretty funny that lately, not only does the president, but pretty much every government
[01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:46.020]   agency and every company in America makes announcements now on Twitter.
[01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:49.300]   That's become the place to put your press releases.
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:52.500]   People who learn what's happened to them in their lives on Twitter, not through direct
[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:53.500]   communication.
[01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:54.500]   Oh, I was fired.
[01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:55.500]   Oh, I was hired.
[01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:56.500]   Oh, I won this.
[01:35:56.500 --> 01:35:57.500]   Oh, I lost this.
[01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:02.020]   Oh, no, I think it's even funnier that oftentimes you have government agencies talking to each
[01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:06.380]   other via Twitter, or you have it for each general saying Pentagon says, no way we're doing
[01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:07.380]   that.
[01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:08.380]   Yeah.
[01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:09.380]   Oh, my God.
[01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:14.900]   I don't have to tweet this, but here is the law basically saying the thing that the president
[01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:16.140]   thinks he can do legally.
[01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:17.620]   He can't do legally.
[01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:18.620]   It's amazing.
[01:36:18.620 --> 01:36:22.340]   I didn't didn't didn't didn't the border control basically tweet out that.
[01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:23.980]   Yeah, we didn't know.
[01:36:23.980 --> 01:36:28.180]   We weren't aware that the White House was going to tell everybody about our secret operation
[01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:30.820]   to round people up next week.
[01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:34.940]   Oh, man.
[01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:35.940]   Let's take a little break.
[01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:38.620]   We'll come back with our picks of the week.
[01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:39.620]   Would you like to do that?
[01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:40.620]   I got a pick for you right now.
[01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:42.620]   We did it the other day.
[01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:44.300]   We were coming home from Las Vegas.
[01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:46.340]   It was so great.
[01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:49.980]   There was a long line at the airport really long line at the security.
[01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:53.140]   Lisa and I looked at each other and said, Oh, no, we're going to be late.
[01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:55.140]   And then we went, Oh, wait a minute.
[01:36:55.140 --> 01:37:02.220]   We have clear clear is the best way to go through airport security use your irises or
[01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:05.420]   your fingerprints instead of traditional ID documents.
[01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:09.340]   The clear ambassador standing at the kiosks will help you go through it the first time
[01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:12.300]   and you'll get through security so quickly.
[01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:13.740]   It's just awesome.
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:19.260]   In fact, clear now is that major ballparks and concert venues too.
[01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:23.660]   The Oakland Coliseum, I can use clear to get into the Warriors games.
[01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:27.740]   Oh, never mind clear use uses.
[01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:29.660]   I guess I'll have it at the new stadium though.
[01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:32.820]   Don't want to clear get you through security with the tap of a finger so you can get to
[01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:35.620]   your gate faster, reduce pre flight stress.
[01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:38.660]   No physical ID card needed.
[01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:42.500]   You're the best ID out there because they've got your irises and they've got here's all
[01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:45.540]   the airports that clear supports all the concert venues.
[01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:47.340]   It's very easy to sign up.
[01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:52.580]   The way we did it, we signed up online and then you go to the clear kiosk the next time
[01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:53.580]   you're there.
[01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:55.780]   The clear ambassador helps you finish the process.
[01:37:55.780 --> 01:37:57.020]   They scan your irises.
[01:37:57.020 --> 01:38:01.780]   They scan your fingerprints and it's really actually kind of a fun process.
[01:38:01.780 --> 01:38:05.260]   And then you're immediately able to use clear that very first time.
[01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:07.900]   I love it too that there's a family plan.
[01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:10.700]   So you can have up to three adult family members at a discounted rate.
[01:38:10.700 --> 01:38:13.740]   So I'm Lisa is on my account and kids under 18 are free.
[01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:16.580]   So Michael is absolutely free.
[01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:22.220]   Clear now is at 50 plus airports and Stadia across the country with more being added every
[01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:23.540]   day.
[01:38:23.540 --> 01:38:26.260]   It is just great.

[01:39:03.980 --> 01:39:08.820]   And the not code time for a pick of the week.
[01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:10.540]   My pick is because pretty cool.
[01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:11.540]   This is not the pick.
[01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:18.260]   This is the my numeric keypad from my Apple adjustable keyboard, which I still really,
[01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:19.260]   really like.
[01:39:19.260 --> 01:39:20.700]   I still think it's really, really cool.
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:25.660]   Unfortunately, it's not really, really useful because it uses the Apple desktop bus.
[01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:32.220]   However, someone on Twitter whose name I unfortunately, not record set me wise to this.
[01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:40.140]   This is called the the ADB USB wombat from the company Big Mess of Wires.
[01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:45.740]   And it is just simply that it is an Apple desktop bus to USB converter and it will work
[01:39:45.740 --> 01:39:46.740]   either way.
[01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:51.260]   You have like a favorite old US Apple desktop bus keyboard.
[01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:57.460]   It will allow you to use it with any machine Mac PC Linux that uses USB.
[01:39:57.460 --> 01:40:04.580]   If you've got a vintage Mac that it's very easy to find a classic Mac at a flea market.
[01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:09.780]   It's not so easy to find an ADB the ADB keyboard you need or the ADB mouse you need.
[01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:14.700]   With this one, you can just plug in a USB hub and use whatever USB peripherals that you
[01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:15.780]   want to use with it.
[01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:19.140]   And it really is beautifully done.
[01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:22.740]   This is the device itself is.
[01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:24.900]   That was my mistake.
[01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:25.900]   Too excited.
[01:40:25.900 --> 01:40:27.820]   I got too excited.
[01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:34.260]   So the device itself is 50 bucks.
[01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:39.620]   You're beautiful like a laser printed laser cut case that you signed yourself is 10 bucks
[01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:40.620]   more.
[01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:46.100]   But it's not just some sort of breadboarded sort of thing that works off of an Arduino
[01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:47.460]   or whatever.
[01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:49.140]   It is just you simply plug it in.
[01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:50.300]   You don't need drivers.
[01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:55.340]   You don't need to adjust firmware as far as whatever computer you're plugging this into
[01:40:55.340 --> 01:40:56.340]   is concerned.
[01:40:56.340 --> 01:40:57.340]   It is the keyboard.
[01:40:57.340 --> 01:40:58.340]   It is the mouse.
[01:40:58.340 --> 01:41:00.940]   It is the USB device that it wants to see.
[01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:06.300]   So it's a self powered is a required external power.
[01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:08.220]   I'm really, really happy with it.
[01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:12.580]   Again, particularly because I don't I stopped being a real collector of computers when I
[01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:17.940]   realized how much money I was spending a month to store my collection.
[01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:21.100]   But I do have a couple of old Macs that I like to kick around with.
[01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:25.940]   And it just takes all the pain of the butt out of using these things on top of all that
[01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:30.740]   big mess of wires also has other stuff that will help you out if you're if you're using
[01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:37.540]   a classic Max, including a a floppy drive emulator that lets you stick in a seat an SD
[01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:38.540]   card.
[01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:40.020]   So you'll be able to boot off of SD.
[01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:44.820]   You'll be able to download like classic max software off of like archive software sites
[01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:50.820]   and then just run everything you want off of off of what would have been an unfathomably
[01:41:50.820 --> 01:41:53.980]   immense scuzzy drive back in the day.
[01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:59.860]   But of course, it's just the the the SD could be 16 gig SD card you took out of your camera
[01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:03.460]   three years ago when you upgraded to 32 and 64 gigs.
[01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:06.660]   So again, high recommendation is just it really is just plug and play.
[01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:07.660]   It just works.
[01:42:07.660 --> 01:42:11.940]   It is as good as I would have hoped a device like this to work.
[01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:12.940]   Nice.
[01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:19.660]   Great Twitter conversation you had with a fellow who said I use my mom uses the iPod
[01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:22.380]   touch to control and planted medical device.
[01:42:22.380 --> 01:42:24.380]   Yeah, that was running.
[01:42:24.380 --> 01:42:25.380]   Okay.
[01:42:25.380 --> 01:42:26.380]   Yeah.
[01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:29.180]   You wait to both of us and I added in.
[01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:30.180]   Yeah.
[01:42:30.180 --> 01:42:33.500]   Isn't it that I had to reply that every time I've seen like an external controller for an
[01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:38.420]   implanted device, it's usually your basic two line back illuminated LCD and a couple
[01:42:38.420 --> 01:42:39.420]   of clicky buttons.
[01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:45.100]   It's so cool that so that someone gets to who relies on this for their life gets to
[01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:50.500]   interact with it with a real cool easy to use friendly device that also plays movies.
[01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:51.500]   Yeah.
[01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:52.500]   Yeah.
[01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:53.500]   Yeah.
[01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:58.500]   The bippy the bippy tweeted this a maker of the horns down stickers in the app store
[01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:05.020]   programmer and Texas A&M fan apparently, but that's really that's really cool.
[01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:06.020]   Yeah.
[01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:07.020]   Yeah.
[01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:08.820]   Very really interesting use actually of a.
[01:43:08.820 --> 01:43:16.220]   I forget that there's the stuff that 95% of the people use a certain Apple product for,
[01:43:16.220 --> 01:43:21.900]   but within that 5% there are a thousand different individual cases that are shocking and surprising
[01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:22.980]   and really make you happy.
[01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:26.540]   We had the other day somebody in from Oracle he said what you missed in that conversation
[01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:34.620]   was how many people use embedded iPod touches in the sleds he makes he makes apparently
[01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:39.260]   makes a software for Oracle mobility software in stores for inventory.
[01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:40.260]   Yeah.
[01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:45.100]   It's very very popular in hospitals and he said one of the reasons that Apple can't change
[01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:49.380]   the form factor is because these sleds that they embed them in there are very expensive
[01:43:49.380 --> 01:43:53.500]   and so it has to fit in if you get a new one, but it's got to fit exactly in the place
[01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:55.060]   the one did.
[01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:59.020]   It's fascinating every time I've gotten the tour of like a facility at NASA or government
[01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:01.620]   facility or like an industrial facility.
[01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:07.780]   I'll see like, oh wow, here's like again, here is five of the new $10,000, $20,000 Mac
[01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:11.180]   pros and here's a custom huge display they made for it.
[01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:14.420]   And then wow, there's a commerce 64 like over there.
[01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:15.420]   And what's that for?
[01:44:15.420 --> 01:44:18.740]   Well, that's that that monitors and controls a valve system.
[01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:24.380]   It was installed in 1982 and it continues to work, but it would cost way too much money
[01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:28.380]   to take it out and replace it with a system that would only work just as well.
[01:44:28.380 --> 01:44:34.260]   So we just keep so we have a closet full of commerce 64 as we buy on eBay just to control
[01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:35.260]   this valve.
[01:44:35.260 --> 01:44:43.620]   It's like, wow, my blown Lori Gil, pick of the week.
[01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:51.580]   So I went camping this weekend and it reminded me that I whipped up my bio light camp stove.
[01:44:51.580 --> 01:44:52.580]   You use that?
[01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:53.580]   Are you kidding me?
[01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:57.060]   Yeah, this thing is a great little like a joke go getter.
[01:44:57.060 --> 01:44:58.060]   Oh no.
[01:44:58.060 --> 01:45:02.460]   This is the stove that generates USB power for your phone.
[01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:04.460]   Yeah, it's pretty great.
[01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:08.820]   So what's great about it is that you don't have to, you know, have a big old pro, you
[01:45:08.820 --> 01:45:10.620]   know, like a propane stove or something like that.
[01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:14.180]   If you want to cook something small or if you want to heat up, I use it for heating up hot
[01:45:14.180 --> 01:45:22.240]   water so that I can either wash dishes or making coffee and that little canister really
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:23.760]   gets hot.
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:26.020]   And so it really gives you the flame that you need.
[01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:28.400]   It's all condensed in one tiny little spot.
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:31.620]   And while you're at it, you can charge it just, it's not much.
[01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:35.880]   It's a little, you know, it's not like a three watt charge or something like that.
[01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:39.680]   But you know, if you're almost out of energy on your phone and you kind of just need to
[01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:43.000]   juice it up for a minute, you just plug right in and it gives you a little stuff.
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.000]   I love the bio light.
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.000]   It's a fun little thing.
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.040]   Do you have the camp stove too or the original?
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:48.040]   I do.
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:49.040]   That's the bundle.
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:50.040]   I have the bundle, the camp stove too.
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:51.040]   The bundle's cool.
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:53.000]   You could do so many things with it.
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.080]   This is really, very neat.
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:56.080]   Yeah.
[01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:57.080]   Yeah.
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:45:58.080]   And it really does work.
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:45:59.080]   It's no joke.
[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:03.080]   The only thing that I'm not in love with is how small that grill is.
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:04.080]   Yeah.
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:06.240]   You can't really put a pot or a pan on it.
[01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:09.600]   You can cook stuff directly on it, which gets messy.
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:12.960]   Or you can have like small canisters off to the sides.
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:15.760]   Like if you're going to cook some beans or something like that right on the can.
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:16.760]   Right.
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:21.000]   But when it comes to using like a big pot or pan, it just doesn't fit on that stone.
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.000]   Right.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.440]   Can you fit a fish on it?
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:24.840]   That's all I care about.
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:25.840]   A small one.
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:26.840]   Yeah.
[01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:27.840]   I get my trout on there.
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:28.840]   Yeah.
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:29.840]   Yeah.
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:30.840]   Yeah.
[01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:34.040]   Do you use the just the local wood just lying around or do you bring pellets?
[01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:35.200]   Yeah, because you can't.
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:37.600]   Yeah, you could buy the pellets, but I don't.
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:40.760]   And you know, you're not using entire pieces of wood.
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:46.240]   So I just grab, you know, little trees, twigs and things that have fallen on the ground.
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:48.760]   And you just kind of start throwing them in there.
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:51.560]   And you know, they catch on each other and they get, you know, hot.
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:57.800]   There's a fan underneath it that like blows the it like he keeps the air moving so that
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:00.080]   the fire will get hotter faster.
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:05.080]   So it's just it's this condensed little machine of heat that you don't have to use chemicals
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:06.080]   for.
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:08.200]   You don't use propane or any of that kind of stuff.
[01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:09.360]   It's all natural.
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:15.380]   And a portion of their proceeds go to they have a program where they're trying to bring
[01:47:15.380 --> 01:47:20.480]   electricity and cleaner cooking to sub Saharan Africa.
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:24.280]   So you know, they're also trying to do some good while they're selling us fun gadgets
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:25.280]   that we can do.
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:27.380]   This would be so great to have.
[01:47:27.380 --> 01:47:32.580]   I think you put this in your survival kit for when the power grid goes out for five days.
[01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:33.580]   Mm hmm.
[01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:34.580]   Yeah.
[01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:38.660]   All you do is heat up some, you know, just to have a fire and then you can, you know,
[01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:39.740]   have a little bit of electricity.
[01:47:39.740 --> 01:47:42.340]   You know, food for one person.
[01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:48.700]   Well, if all it does is give you enough power to be able to make a phone call to tell people
[01:47:48.700 --> 01:47:49.980]   where the bear left you.
[01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:50.980]   Right.
[01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:51.980]   That's definitely worth it.
[01:47:51.980 --> 01:47:53.340]   It doesn't have to power a TV.
[01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:54.340]   Right.
[01:47:54.340 --> 01:47:55.340]   Right.
[01:47:55.340 --> 01:47:58.700]   The camps toe of two bundle with all of those doohickey's is 200 bucks and you can get a
[01:47:58.700 --> 01:48:03.500]   we actually have a review of the bio light one, I think father Robert did a little cookout
[01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:05.820]   on the lawn out here.
[01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:08.420]   You really, you really liked it.
[01:48:08.420 --> 01:48:11.580]   I think this is, you know, I have to put together, I'm going to put together a kit for the end
[01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:15.460]   of times because I feel like, I don't know.
[01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:20.620]   I just, if, if nothing else, being able to boil water, you know, that's, it's a great,
[01:48:20.620 --> 01:48:25.420]   you know, and again, like I said, like you don't need anything, but a little bit of twigs
[01:48:25.420 --> 01:48:30.460]   and stuff and you can create a really hot fire with just the stuff that you'd find out
[01:48:30.460 --> 01:48:31.460]   in your front yard.
[01:48:31.460 --> 01:48:32.460]   Yeah.
[01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:34.420]   We're overdue for another Carrington event.
[01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:37.460]   So, you know, yeah, it's going to be laughing then.
[01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:46.620]   It's, it's the bio light camp stove from bio light energy.com B I O L I T E and I didn't
[01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:49.940]   give out the wombat information either actually for you Andy.
[01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:51.780]   I should give that out for people want it from big.
[01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:54.420]   I mainly because I love the URL big mess.
[01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:57.580]   Oh wires.com big mess.
[01:48:57.580 --> 01:49:01.860]   Oh, why they must sell other great stuff than besides the USB wombat again there.
[01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:06.340]   The entire the entire size worth taking a look at and I want to assure you again, the
[01:49:06.340 --> 01:49:08.620]   thing that they will send you is not a big mess.
[01:49:08.620 --> 01:49:12.140]   Oh, why I believe they're just, they're just being self deprecating there.
[01:49:12.140 --> 01:49:14.740]   It is actually a very nicely produced custom board.
[01:49:14.740 --> 01:49:20.240]   I think I want to buy the floppy emu disk emulator for vintage Apple to Macintosh and
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:21.880]   Lisa.
[01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:22.880]   That's hysterical.
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:23.880]   Yeah.
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:29.780]   I I bought the floppy, I bought the the wombat as soon as I heard about it because I knew
[01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:31.900]   it would change my life in a positive way.
[01:49:31.900 --> 01:49:36.300]   But I think the next thing is going to be the the emu because I'm so glad that the
[01:49:36.300 --> 01:49:41.180]   things that you're doing this work that makes it's you really have to love a classic Mac
[01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:45.940]   in order to do everything you have to do to actually make it work and do stuff other
[01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:47.700]   than look pretty on a shelf.
[01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:52.340]   But if you have if you if you can simply buy an adapter that will make let you use your
[01:49:52.340 --> 01:49:57.500]   USB keyboard with it and you can also buy another adapter that will let you use SD cards
[01:49:57.500 --> 01:49:58.500]   with it.
[01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:02.380]   That's all you got to worry about now is the fly back transformer carboning out on you and
[01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:03.380]   that's it.
[01:50:03.380 --> 01:50:08.980]   So he's really they're they're really letting people in on the fun of a classic Max now.
[01:50:08.980 --> 01:50:09.980]   I love this.
[01:50:09.980 --> 01:50:11.220]   I think we have a show title.
[01:50:11.220 --> 01:50:16.260]   All you have to worry about is the fly back transformer carboning out on you.
[01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:17.260]   Renee Richard.
[01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:20.220]   How's your fly back transformer?
[01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:25.500]   Uh, Autobots transforming rollout.
[01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:27.220]   It's fully enabled.
[01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:28.940]   I had a different complete different pick of the week.
[01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:32.100]   But I'm going to save that for next week because Lori reminded us at the beginning of
[01:50:32.100 --> 01:50:34.900]   the show that it was episode 666.
[01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:39.620]   Oh, in honor of that, I wanted to pick Lucifer season four.
[01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:40.620]   Now on Netflix.
[01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:44.700]   This is a good show because I'm so tempted because it looks cool.
[01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:49.180]   It's based on Neil Gaiman's Lucifer character from the Sandman comic book series, which was
[01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:50.180]   brilliant.
[01:50:50.180 --> 01:50:51.740]   The first season is really good.
[01:50:51.740 --> 01:50:53.100]   The second season is really good.
[01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:58.880]   The third season they gave them 22 episodes, which I think was like 20, maybe like 15 episodes
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:02.840]   too many because previously they'd had these short tight seasons.
[01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:05.720]   But the Netflix season goes back to that.
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:10.960]   So basically Lucifer is Lucifer Morningstar, the fallen angel who was cast down into hell,
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:12.840]   but then decides he's had enough of that.
[01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:15.480]   He doesn't think he deserves his father's punishment.
[01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:18.040]   He's going to go on vacation to Los Angeles.
[01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:22.580]   And so he renounces, he renounces hell, leaves it unguarded, goes to Los Angeles and ends
[01:51:22.580 --> 01:51:28.360]   up becoming the partner to a detective where he finds life boring.
[01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:29.360]   And it's so well done.
[01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:32.640]   He literally like, this no, this is also boring.
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:34.280]   I want to get back to real excited.
[01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:35.280]   >> That's the story.
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:40.160]   >> Every episode he goes to therapy and every lesson the therapist tells him he misunderstands
[01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:42.120]   as being what he wants and not what he needs.
[01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:43.800]   >> Well, he's the devil, of course.
[01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:46.280]   >> But he doesn't punish people.
[01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:50.680]   The whole thing that's interesting about it is that he thinks he gets blamed for everything
[01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:52.440]   bad that happens to us.
[01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:55.400]   And he feels just as laid upon as the rest of us.
[01:51:55.400 --> 01:52:00.400]   So it's fun watching him try to come to terms with humanity every season.
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:02.040]   >> Another show I got to watch.
[01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:05.080]   All right, Lucifer season four is out.
[01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:09.480]   And this was episode 666 of Mac break weekly.
[01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:12.640]   >> And in that scene, you see Eve who's come to meet him there because he was her first
[01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:15.360]   boyfriend and she just wants to get things back the way they were.
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:17.920]   >> Yeah, he told her about the apple and you know.
[01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:19.480]   >> She says it wasn't an apple.
[01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:22.920]   It was more like a banana, but I'm not going to go there on public TV.
[01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:29.400]   >> Actually, that reminds me of Neil Stevenson's new book, which I just finished called Dodge.
[01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:32.680]   I'm sorry, fall or dodge in hell.
[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:39.880]   And there is a little bit of a devilish twist to it all, including an apple and a worm and
[01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:41.080]   Adam and Eve.
[01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:43.720]   So that was actually quite a good book.
[01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:47.960]   If you have time for 888 pages, I recommend that.
[01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:53.040]   We are out of time though for this show, Renee Richie and Laurie Giller at iMore.com.
[01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:55.800]   Renee does the vector podcast there, little project.
[01:52:55.800 --> 01:52:57.960]   He's got a little small budget project.
[01:52:57.960 --> 01:52:58.960]   He's got going there.
[01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:01.800]   iMore.com/vector.
[01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:05.320]   Laurie Gill is managing editor of all of the above.
[01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:08.280]   She's also a rock and roll star.
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:12.200]   Their band, Sick Burn at alcoholic on the Twitter.
[01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:16.200]   And I know when are you going to be on WGBH this week?
[01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:19.240]   >> I did a double header last week, so I'm taking the week off.
[01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:23.960]   I'm leaving the next week will be on Wednesday, probably at the Boston Public Library again.
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:25.000]   Check out my Twitter.
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:26.920]   That's usually where I post the time and date.
[01:53:26.920 --> 01:53:31.320]   >> And your Twitter is @ihnateako.
[01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:34.200]   We remember how to spell that by starting the first three letters.
[01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:37.160]   I have no idea how to spell the rest of the name.
[01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:37.680]   >> Yes.
[01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:40.600]   >> I have no @co.
[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:45.240]   We do Mac Break Weekly every Tuesday, round about 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern Time,
[01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:47.560]   1800 UTC if you want to stop by.
[01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:48.760]   Or is it 17?
[01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:51.560]   I guess it's 1800 UTC.
[01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:57.400]   If you want to stop by, you can watch it or listen to it live at our website, twit.tv/live.

[01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:09.400]   Join the folks who are all watching live.
[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:12.040]   And right now we're working hard to think of show titles.
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:14.360]   That's part of the responsibility of the chatroom.
[01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:17.000]   They come up with some good ones, I got to say.
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:22.280]   You can also get on-demand versions of every episode we do at our website, twit.tv/mbw.
[01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:24.800]   Or subscribe.
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:27.120]   Your favorite podcatcher will certainly have Mac Break Weekly.
[01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:31.880]   And if you subscribe, you'll have it in plenty of time for your Wednesday morning commute.
[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:36.280]   You can also ask your favorite voice assistant to play Mac Break Weekly.
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:40.040]   Usually it'll play the most recent episode of the show.
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:41.040]   But you never know.
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:42.600]   That's the fun thing about voice assistants.
[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:44.600]   Anything can happen.
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:45.960]   Thanks for joining us again.
[01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:50.360]   Alex Lindsey makes his triumphant brief triumphant return next week.
[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:52.520]   We'll have a big panel of five people.
[01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:53.480]   It should be interesting.
[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:55.800]   I've got to ask him what his plans are with the Mac Pro.
[01:54:55.800 --> 01:54:57.880]   So that's next week on Mac Break Weekly.
[01:54:57.880 --> 01:55:01.400]   Meanwhile, for the rest of you, time to get back to work because...
[01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:03.640]   Break time is over.
[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:04.440]   See you later.
