[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Renee Richie's back Andy Inacos here, so is Alex Lindsey.
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:13.260]   And of course, we're going to be talking about the new M1 Max and Pro. In fact, Renee's got an M1 Max 14-inch laptop.
[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:20.000]   He'll give us his thoughts, his reviews. We'll talk about the detailed information from a non-tech about the system on a chip.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.460]   And why I'm not so sad that I got a small M1 Pro instead of the Max?
[00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.220]   Turns out it wasn't such a bad choice. After all, we'll take a look at a Mac OS Monterey, which comes out this week.
[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.620]   Actually, I think today, right? And iOS 15.1.
[00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.360]   It's a jam-packed show coming up next for you. Mac Break Weekly is next.

[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:33.100]   And oh boy, this is going to be a jam-packed day Renee Richie is back from his mysterious briefings or something.
[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.100]   Hello Renee.
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.300]   I brought toys, but by the way, Renee is not named Christina Warren.
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.500]   We're going to see your toys in a second. We're going to have to fix that.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.500]   But I wish.
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.100]   I wish.
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.300]   Thanks to Christina for filling in for you, by the way.
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.900]   It was nice to have her.
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.100]   Were you as hard as her on her worst day?
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.700]   I'd be happy.
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.700]   Did you have to leave town to get those toys or?
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.300]   No.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.900]   No, luckily they figured out international.
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:56.900]   They know how to do it.
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.700]   That was a weird date.
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.900]   And so good.
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.300]   Do you have all the toys?
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.100]   I got the AirPods and I've got the--
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.300]   We're not even going to mention the AirPods today.
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.900]   So too busy.
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.500]   We're too busy.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.500]   We'll put those somewhere.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.100]   Oh, the sun doesn't shine.
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.700]   And you got a 14 and a 16.
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.500]   Just the 14.
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.500]   Just the 14.
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.000]   OK.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.500]   Well, I can't wait to talk about that.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.700]   The reason it's a big day is not only are those starting to arrive.
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.500]   We also now have all the reviews, including a non-text breakdown on the SOC.
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.500]   But we also have Mac OS Monterey, which came yesterday.
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.900]   And iOS 15.1, which came.
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.100]   So we got a lot to talk about.
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.100]   Andy and Akko, Andy and Akko.
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.100]   Andy and Akko really quickly.
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.700]   Really quickly.
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.700]   We had in Bargo's for the MacBook Pro, for the AirPods, for Monterey, for iOS.
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.900]   And Pixel phone.
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.500]   And they released a Sony camera.
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.300]   I don't want to hear anybody say about a slow news date.
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.900]   Crazy.
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.500]   I know.
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.100]   Cray-cray.
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.100]   Andy and Akko's here.
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.700]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.500]   Hello.
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.900]   Did you get your Pixel?
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.300]   It is on its way.
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.500]   It will probably arrive, unfortunately.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.900]   Like during the 48 hours that I'm out of the house, but it'll do.
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:03.900]   Yeah.
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.700]   Mine's going to arrive during these seven days I'm out of the house, which is bummer.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.100]   But I think Jason Howell is letting me take his Pixel 6 Pro to Mexico.
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.500]   Because I'm leaving tomorrow morning bright and early.
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.500]   So if I can bring it, that'll be a great chance to test it out.
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.500]   Yeah.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.500]   This is probably the only time we'll talk about it.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.500]   But the reviews are very, very reassuring to someone who pre-ordered one.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.500]   Yeah.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.500]   But it falls in line with what was expected given how much we knew about it beforehand.
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.500]   It's pretty exciting.
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.500]   I will-- I do not have a 13, but Lisa has a 13 Pro Max.
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.500]   So I will endeavor to get her to take pictures of exactly the same things.
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.500]   So you're just going to have to make a date trip back to Mexico just to do the comparison photos.
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.500]   The consensus seems to be the Pixel wins photography.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.500]   The iPhone still wins video.
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.500]   But there's a mashup in between all of that.
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.500]   That sounds about right.
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.500]   Everybody gets a great phone.
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.500]   That's what I'm thinking.
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.500]   When you look at the images, Wall Street Journal had a piece where they compared images from the Pixel 6 Pro,
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.500]   the Samsung S21 Ultra, and the iPhone 13 Pro Max.
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.500]   And particularly, they were looking at skin tones with people of color.
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.500]   And I have to say, they were different.
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.500]   There's no question.
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.500]   I don't know which was better because unfortunately, I don't know the people.
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.500]   So I don't know which was more accurate.
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.500]   But they asked the people which do you like.
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.500]   And the results were varied as one might expect.
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.500]   But all three looked great.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.500]   I think that's the point.
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.500]   They all are doing a good job now.
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.500]   We're at the point where we're fighting between Nikon, Canon, and Sony again.
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.500]   It's great.
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.500]   Yeah.
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.500]   I think Canon might have won this round, but I don't know.
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.500]   We'll have to defer to people like Alex Lindsey of Office Hours.Global.
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.500]   Oh, look.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.500]   Oh, and I know.media.
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.500]   It's good to be here.
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.500]   You're a black magic, probably.
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.500]   You don't care about any of this Sony, Canon, Nikon stuff.
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.500]   I'm really interested in the R5 I have to admit because of the new lens.
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.500]   The dual 180 has me like, ah.
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.500]   It's finally put all the things.
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:10.500]   For those of us who have been doing some version of 180 or stereo or something for a long time,
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:16.500]   kind of the Holy Grail was, can we just have an SLR style or whatever that puts two of those lenses together?
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.500]   And I'm very close to that.
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.500]   And I also, you know, we've done a lot of, when we do photogrammetry, my choices are actually the Sony.
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.500]   So I do a lot of, you know, when we shoot photogrammetry with the car for the resolution.
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.500]   I have a Nikon, but I don't use it very much anymore.
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.500]   Yeah.
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.500]   So laptops are arriving.
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.500]   A number of people in our discord have said theirs has come.
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:45.500]   John was telling me they're in the stores, so some people are canceling their order and running to the store.
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.500]   By the way, usually that's a morning thing to do.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:55.500]   Like, right when the store opens, it appears that often times there's a couple of things that are sold out all the time.
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.500]   You know that are in the stores or a lot of the stores get them in certain days.
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.500]   And so that's an experience.
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:05.500]   Do we know if that's the case this time? Do we know what the status is in the stores?
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:10.500]   I'll have to look at the various by store, but they seem to have all the stock options right now going up to, I think, for a terrible,
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.500]   if you want like high capacity, anything built order options, you still have to order.
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.500]   But if you want any of the base units, they're all there.
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.500]   Okay.
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:22.500]   We have a maxed out 16. The only thing I didn't max was the hard drive, but we have a maxed out.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.500]   I think I put it to terabyte and instead of an eight.
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.500]   Eight.
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.500]   That's insane.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.500]   You shouldn't put eight on your laptop.
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.500]   I mean, there's so much data on your laptop to lose.
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.500]   You know, if you lose your laptop.
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.500]   You're ordering eight.
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.500]   Did you order eight?
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.500]   Really?
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.500]   So much so much.
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.500]   I have to because, you don't have to.
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.500]   I only keep, I don't want to use external, but like,
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.500]   I take it off fast too.
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.500]   I just don't want to edit with things hanging off my computer ever.
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.500]   So if I can have like a two days or three days worth of really big projects on there, I'm
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.500]   super happy and I'll take them off as soon as I'm done.
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.500]   And we have, you know, in the past it's been, thanks to Thunderbolt, that external drives
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.500]   are pretty much as fast as internal drives.
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.500]   That's not the case on these because they have such huge bandwidth.
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.500]   Yeah.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.500]   You really do want to use it.
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.500]   There's half to the old RAM.
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.500]   Yeah.
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.500]   Yeah.
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.500]   You want it.
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.500]   Yeah.
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:15.500]   I'm still, the jury's still a little bit out on with the longevity of integrated memories,
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.500]   integrated storage is going to be.
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.500]   That's the only thing that still worries me about this SOC procedure.
[00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:26.500]   Now you have a lot of things that go wrong and now you really do have to replace an entire
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.500]   motherboard to fix what used to be basic things.
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.500]   But at least now we're a generation ago.
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:39.500]   It used to be, well, thank you for not allowing me to be able to replace my SSD internally
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.500]   when it breaks on me.
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:45.500]   And I've had a computer go south simply because the SSD went south.
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.500]   But at least now you actually get a performance enhancement by the fact that that's all integrated.
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.500]   So at least there's a benefit to the consumer.
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.500]   Renee, you fully maxed the 16.
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.500]   Like you got the $6,000.
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.500]   Yeah.
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.500]   Well, I mean, that's American.
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.500]   I had to pay for it in Canadian dollars.
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.500]   So it's $18,000.
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.500]   So you got 64.
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.500]   I only buy them every few years.
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.500]   I don't know.
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.500]   I don't know.
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.500]   This is so attractive.
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:13.900]   I have to say, I'm starting to feel like since effectively Apple doubled performance in many
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:19.900]   areas over the M1 one year ago that we might be able to see this kind of doubling every
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:20.900]   year for a little while.
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:21.900]   This might be--
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:26.500]   We might be going back to that thing where we kind of want a new laptop every year.
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.420]   Well, no, because this is really tricky.
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.860]   Like the stuff they did, well, first, like to Andy's earlier point, the way they designed
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:32.860]   this is super interesting.
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.860]   They are massive, massive SOCs.
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.340]   So they have a lot of redundancy because they basically engineered it so that if something
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.940]   goes wrong with like there's like two of the neural engine blocks, so something goes
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.100]   wrong with one of them on a max chip, they just ship that as a pro.
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.220]   You know, if something goes wrong with some of the GPU, that's a 24 GPU.
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.740]   Like the way that they built up the top block on this--
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.420]   But they call it really clever.
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:54.980]   But they call it binning, right?
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:55.980]   They're--
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:56.980]   Yes.
[00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:57.980]   They're testing--
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.140]   Making all maxes, testing them and then shipping them whether they're pro or max.
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.380]   This is a long standing tradition until always does this too.
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:09.140]   Because when the chip gets that big, defects multiply, obviously.
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.140]   The more--
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.460]   57 billion transistors bake in this case, which is like bigger than an ampere.
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.420]   In a video ampere in terms of transistors.
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.420]   So--
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.860]   Yeah, so I don't think it's going to change because one of the things here is we-- this
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.340]   is based on the A14 still, like the A14 and the M1 and the M1 pro and max are all the
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.980]   same generation architecture.
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:32.780]   So these are ice storm efficiency cores, fire storm performance cores, G13 graphics
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:33.780]   cores.
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.700]   The big changes here is how well they've made them scale.
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.220]   They scale almost linearly thanks to the fabrics and everything that they're using
[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.220]   in there.
[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.980]   But the other part of this is the engines that they've added to it.
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.140]   A lot of the big improvement gains, it's so ridiculous.
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.540]   It's basically a little Mac Pro that they've managed to put into a MacBook Pro.
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:55.140]   But that's because they have an afterburner card, literally an afterburner card.
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.180]   On the max, they've got four of those right on the die.
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:03.500]   And that took my ProRes renders down from like 25, 30 minutes to three to five minutes.
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.500]   Is that--
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:10.780]   Dude, it's throughput, I/O throughput from the SSDs or the RAM or both?
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:11.780]   It's everything.
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.380]   Usually, the ProRes is CPU bound.
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.380]   Yeah.
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.700]   And like this is being offset, like it's being set to dedicated render blocks.
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:22.380]   And the same thing with other like audio signals, H.264, HEVC, all of that is being done off
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.620]   the main cores.
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.220]   And then you have so many of the GPU cores.
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.980]   And A15 isn't that much faster.
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.220]   The efficiency cores are 30% faster.
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.700]   But the main core is the performance cores aren't, they're just cooler.
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:38.580]   So if anything, I think Apple is playing around a lot more with the off core feature sets on
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:39.900]   these chips.
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.700]   And we should see steady progress over the next few years.
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.780]   Like we might see a lot more dedicated stuff, but I think we'll see steady progress.
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:50.580]   So the idea of this doubling occurring every year, don't count on that.
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.860]   We should-- I'm going to explain a little bit.
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:53.860]   Renee's as--
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:54.860]   Renee's as--
[00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:55.860]   Sorry.
[00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.860]   Start up as his MacBook is spent.
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:57.860]   He is also--
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:58.860]   I apologize.
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:11:59.860]   I've been living this for a week.
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.860]   I'm so excited.
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:01.860]   And you're full of knowledge.
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.100]   We want to get every drip of it out.
[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.740]   But I think it's important to underline something you said, which is interesting.
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:11.700]   And this is confirmed, by the way, and on-tech did a very good-- their usual excellent
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.500]   analysis of what these SOCs are.
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:21.580]   And they also pointed out the CPU instructions, the core, the way the performance cores and
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:25.580]   the efficiency cores work is essentially the same.
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:31.180]   But most of the gains here are, as you said, from things external to the CPU.
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:32.940]   Is that fair to say?
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:33.940]   Yeah.
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.180]   The mix is slightly different.
[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:38.380]   On M1, you have four efficiency cores, four performance cores.
[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:42.460]   On this one, you have two and six or two and eight on the 10 core version.
[00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:46.340]   And the thing I love about a non-tech is Andre is not-- like he's the opposite of an
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:47.340]   Apple fan.
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:50.460]   He is way happier with Samsung and PCs and things like that.
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.820]   But he's really good at his job.
[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:56.660]   And in his conclusion, he says, this is undreamt of performance for a laptop.
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:00.380]   You'd expect this from server hardware, which is, I think, those enthusiasts that I've
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.380]   ever heard on.
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.740]   That's a good, simple sentence to summarize all this.
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:05.740]   This is always my problem.
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:12.580]   My same problem with the Pixel 6 and the Max is a lot of the blogs are fan blogs.
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:17.060]   And so they're a little less trustworthy.
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:21.540]   And then there seems to be, with the Verge and some of the other big ones, the necessity
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.540]   of fine flaws.
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.300]   Like, we can't just say, this is great.
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.060]   So I kind of throw those out too.
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:32.700]   But what I really like-- and I turned to-- I was so glad an on-tech came out with their
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.980]   report so quickly-- is just, let's get down to the numbers.
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.220]   Let's get in an e-gritty how it works.
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.180]   Apple does not completely explain how it works.
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:45.980]   Some of what an on-tech, what Andre does is look at pictures, believe it or not, of
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.820]   the cores to kind of understand what's going on.
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:54.780]   So this is still a work in progress.
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.220]   But you also got briefings from Apple.
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.860]   So you've got the Apple side of the story too.
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.100]   I mean, we have to remember that this chip was probably designed three or four years ago.
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:08.140]   And so I still don't think that they would release chips that they couldn't maintain
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.460]   the pace for at least three to five years.
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.900]   You know, like I think that they-- that what we see here--
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.900]   It feels like they are titrating it, doesn't it?
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:21.980]   Like they did last-- a year ago they did low-end, which was essentially what we'd already seen
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.340]   in the iPhone and the iPad.
[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:25.340]   Right.
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:26.340]   Slight difference.
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:31.580]   Now we're doing the laptops, so they're still focusing on total power consumption.
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.460]   But they did-- I thought they went a lot farther than I expected.
[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.620]   They look at all the GPU cores, for instance, on the Macs.
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.700]   So they kind of flexed a little there.
[00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.900]   But I think there is another shoe to drop.
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:46.660]   And you correct me, anybody who thinks this is different, and especially Renee, because
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.180]   you're informed by Apple.
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:52.900]   I feel like there is something else we're going to see when we get to desktops.
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:58.940]   When you don't have to worry about the TPU, when you can kind of say, let's see what
[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.420]   we can do when we've got fans and power supplies.
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.060]   And-- Well you saw Mark's report, right?
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:07.100]   40 CPUs and 128 GPUs for the next month.
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.500]   That's the rumor.
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.660]   And that sounds right to me.
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.900]   In other words, it sounds like Apple is not--
[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:16.380]   And again, it's probably going to still be the M1 processors, right?
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:17.380]   And what extreme?
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:18.380]   Yeah.
[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:19.380]   You know what?
[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:20.380]   Maybe it is extreme.
[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.380]   Lad the brain.
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:25.220]   Because-- and this will be for the-- and I was a little disappointed we didn't see
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.860]   a new Mac mini, but I guess now I understand laptops.
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:33.900]   Desktops are coming Mac mini, iMac Pro, 32 inch, and of course the Mac Pro.
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:37.740]   And again, remember that they're sharing the memory, which is a big deal.
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.300]   When you're putting that kind of memory into it, because you're looking at, you know,
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:46.900]   a VRAM of, you know, 8 gigabytes or 16 gigabytes on a lot of these cards.
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:50.700]   And now you have the GPU having access to all of it.
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.700]   You know if they need it.
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.340]   All of it is not used by anything else.
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.340]   By the CPU.
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:58.100]   But if you have a 64 gig Mac, suddenly you effectively have a graphics card with 64
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.100]   gig of VRAM.
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.100]   Exactly.
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.100]   Exactly.
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:04.460]   And again, this is the first-- you know, this is the first couple tries.
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.460]   Right.
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:11.140]   And so the thing-- and so while that kind of return has-- is starting to be harder and
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.420]   harder and harder for even Nvidia and others to do it.
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:16.180]   Nvidia is going to have a faster card coming out soon.
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:19.820]   You know, then, you know, push forward past this a little bit.
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:25.460]   But remember that there's more work on their end to keep on moving at that pace, where
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.620]   this is at the beginning of the hockey stick rather than the end of the hockey stick.
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:33.980]   And so I think that Apple has a lot of opportunity to keep moving down this path pretty radically.
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.100]   Kind of my thinking too.
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.940]   They really-- they flexed with this one.
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.940]   They said you ain't seen nothing.
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.940]   You know, the scary version--
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:43.940]   It maintains unlocked.
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.020]   The scary version is they didn't flex.
[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.020]   Like, this is just--
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.020]   They're just beginning.
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:52.220]   This wasn't-- this was just an incremental step for them.
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.220]   I mean, that's the scary version for me.
[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.660]   It doesn't feel like you're doubling the approval of it.
[00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:56.660]   It doesn't.
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:00.260]   But if they keep on adding those processes, remember that-- and we want to go back to
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:05.500]   the investor call where they said, you know, we're still dealing with legacy components.
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.940]   Anyone starts saying legacy.
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.580]   They start languaging legacy.
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:14.420]   It means that the chip is not the only thing they're about to keep on updating.
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:18.660]   So the rest of the machine still has a lot of external components.
[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:22.940]   And they can start-- they can continue to increase efficiencies there by taking over
[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.260]   some of those things and internalizing them.
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:30.740]   That's kind of what some have said is that Apple is now a silicon company.
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:35.580]   That this is really where they're showing some kind of impressive expertise.
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.300]   They're a whole product company.
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.300]   They want to do silicon--
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.300]   They want to do it all.
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.300]   They want to do hardware.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.620]   They want to make the product that they want to make without the constraints of other dependencies.
[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:44.620]   Right.
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:48.260]   The other thing is, you know, when I ordered, I ordered a maxed out one, not as Max's
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.460]   your name, but close.
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.420]   Sorry.
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:55.660]   And actually, Anthony Nielsen, our editor is going to get that because he does a lot
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.340]   of motion graphics and stuff for us.
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.540]   But we'll test it first.
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.140]   That's coming in a week.
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:05.700]   But I also-- at first, it was just so I'd get it before I left.
[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:10.660]   But today, I'm getting the base model 14-inch because that one was the only one.
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:15.060]   All the BTOs were out a week or two.
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.540]   But now I'm thinking, I might keep this one.
[00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:22.660]   It might be just enough because it strikes me-- correct me if I'm wrong-- the real difference
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:27.380]   in the M1 Pro-- and this kind of is what Andres says at an on-tech too-- and the M1
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.860]   Max is all about GPU.
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:32.900]   GPU and those media units.
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:36.900]   So if you're doing anything with ProRes, they basically doubled the media renderers in the
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.660]   Max version, and they doubled the RAM, and they doubled the GPU.
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:46.420]   And if you get the 16-inch Max, very unappled, they have a high power mode, where if you flip
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:51.460]   that, they just turn the fans up, let the temperature get higher for combined CPU/GPU
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.460]   sustained loads.
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:55.620]   So they really want to show off their thermal envelopes.
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:19:00.020]   This is for people like you and Alex, where you're rendering ProRes.
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:04.180]   I mean, the numbers that Renee just put out had me go, I might have to buy one just to
[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.180]   just work.
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.180]   You don't like it like I just--
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.180]   There's not just me.
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.180]   Everybody's getting those numbers.
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.180]   But at the same time--
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.180]   But at the same time--
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:14.740]   The next Mini and the next Mac Pro and the next iMac might be waiting for--
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:15.740]   I'm just trying to hold.
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.220]   --is that's not more than a few months off, right?
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.220]   It's completely out.
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.060]   That's what I'm trying to hang on.
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.620]   I'm trying to hang on and not buy the laptop.
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:23.620]   I'll just wait for the Mini.
[00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:24.620]   I can't, though.
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.500]   You have six months of laptop balance.
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.980]   I have so many computers right now.
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:29.980]   And so I feel like--
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.340]   I could go asking you for photogrammetry tests from you, Alex.
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.700]   Where's Alex's photogrammetry test coming out?
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.460]   Well, Alex is going to send it--
[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:37.460]   I can buy that.
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:41.020]   You're going to send it something, right, to max out the 16.
[00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.180]   I got to find someone to put it.
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.980]   It's a lot of data.
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.460]   So if I make it public--
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:48.180]   No, I can put it somewhere for you guys to download it.
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.980]   Just mail me a USB key or something.
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:51.980]   Yeah.
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:52.980]   Yeah.
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:53.980]   So they--
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:54.980]   They'll be a hard drive.
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:55.980]   Right.
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:56.980]   Yeah.
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:57.980]   So it's a--
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:59.980]   A little tear about is I only--
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.660]   because it's a base model, I've got 512 gigs of storage, which
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.740]   is kind of pathetic.
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:08.660]   But I'm not going to be doing all of the things I would want
[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:11.700]   the 16 or the max 4.
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.660]   By the way, you can max out a 14, which is also really cool,
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:15.660]   right?
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:16.660]   Yes.
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:17.660]   I love that.
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:18.660]   You can't turn on that high performance mode.
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:19.660]   Is that the only difference?
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:20.660]   Yeah, the thermal envelope's not big enough for it.
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:21.660]   Yeah.
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.260]   On the 14, but that's gravy at this point,
[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.700]   like with performance you're getting from the max.
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.780]   So you're getting a 14 desktop replacement that is just--
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:31.500]   and with battery life up the wazoo.
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.300]   Have you had it long enough to really confirm Apple's battery life?
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.300]   Yeah.
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.100]   So I mean, the battery life that they give you, the number,
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.820]   the 21 hours, that's if you're watching--
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.180]   Just sitting there watching video.
[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.180]   Yeah.
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.740]   Streaming video, which is handled off-core by those
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:45.860]   encodicoed engines too.
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.420]   So that's highly optimal.
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.100]   But in my stress test, I basically took my iPhone review,
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.700]   which is 19 minutes of mixed footage.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.340]   It's got 10-bit XF AVC.
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.780]   It's got Dolby Vision, iPhone footage.
[00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.420]   It's got some 8K Canon in it.
[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.500]   Just a bunch of gnarly codecs.
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:05.100]   And I output it to H.264, and I output it to ProRes.
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.540]   And it was just draw-dropping at first because of the numbers.
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.820]   Like it was just four times faster, I think, with H.264.
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.700]   Then with ProRes, it was 10 times faster,
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.580]   like literally 10 times faster.
[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:18.100]   But the battery life on the Intel max,
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.580]   I tested 14 and 16 Intel, and the 14 M1,
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.340]   and then the 14 M1 max.
[00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:24.860]   The Intel boxes went down.
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.380]   They lost 75% battery life.
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.100]   They went down a 25% battery life,
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:29.540]   finishing all those renders.
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:33.700]   The M1 MacBook Pro from last year was down to 80%.
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.940]   And the M1 max from this year was down to 90%,
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.380]   just because the ProRes was so fast on it.
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.700]   - So how many hours if you're really working on that load,
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.660]   you're thinking maybe six, seven?
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.260]   - Five, six hours?
[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:47.100]   - Yeah, but that began.
[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.220]   I'm never gonna be rendering for that one.
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.260]   - Yeah, that's working really hard.
[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:52.100]   I'd be afraid of it for--
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.260]   - I figure like six hours, six to eight hours,
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:59.260]   like full speed use too, because the PC laptops famously,
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.140]   if you have a big GPU in it, when you unplug them,
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:03.580]   they go down to one quarter power.
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.940]   So you can't even race to sleep on them.
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.740]   - And for the work, a lot of other people do.
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:10.020]   Like me, I'm encoding and things like that.
[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:12.340]   I think honestly, the Pro is fine.
[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:16.220]   You don't need it unless you're doing
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.860]   that kind of graphics work or video rendering
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:21.260]   or video playback, that kind of thing, right?
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.260]   That's kind of my general question.
[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.180]   - 3D, silly, too.
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:24.020]   - 3D.
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:26.620]   - I'm glad to see Octane and Cinema 4D test.
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.020]   Like, it sounds so dumb.
[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.940]   I liken this to when the wedge-shaped MacBook Air came out,
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.900]   when it redefined what your expectations were
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.580]   from an ultra portable.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.580]   This to me is redefining what my expectations are
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.980]   from a Pro laptop, because it's literally doing
[00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.940]   what it took a medium to high-end Mac Pro to do
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:44.260]   just two years ago.
[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.300]   But like you see a lot of,
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.740]   like I was watching Tyler Stalman's video
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.540]   and he's doing seven streams of 8K with a really bad,
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:53.340]   I think R5 codec, I mean bad by that's a gnarly codec.
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.020]   While he's editing in Lightroom,
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.420]   while he's running like a bunch of other applications,
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:00.420]   and the playback is going, not skipping a frame.
[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.260]   - Yeah.
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.260]   - And you just, you see,
[00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:03.100]   nobody's gonna do that though.
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:03.940]   - Nobody's gonna do that though.
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:05.580]   - So it's nice, it's impressive,
[00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.460]   but honestly nobody's gonna do that.
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.260]   - But you couldn't do that,
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:11.060]   the point is that you couldn't do that on a laptop
[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:13.140]   before you had to do that on a Mac Pro,
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.980]   and people putting everything on an Octane
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:16.380]   and spinning it around in real time,
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.140]   and you forget what real time is like
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.020]   until it's suddenly given back to you,
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.220]   and then you let it in as a laptop,
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.220]   and it's like, I can work anywhere now.
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.060]   And a lot of the stuff,
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:24.940]   I mean one of the things we're seeing
[00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.180]   a lot of performance on is USDZ as well,
[00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.700]   which is something I'm spending a lot of time using right now.
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.420]   And that makes a big difference
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.140]   as you look at where Apple's going in the future,
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:36.820]   and being able to open a really high end model in preview.
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.220]   Like literally I'm opening this in Apple's preview,
[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.700]   I just double click on the model,
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:41.740]   and boom, it's open.
[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:42.580]   (laughs)
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.180]   I'm able to rotate it around and look at it,
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.780]   and it looks, it's photoreal,
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.420]   and you definitely see the performance change
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.100]   when you switch over to the M1,
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.820]   even the little M1s that I have.
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.140]   So let's step back a little bit,
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:57.660]   and since you've got one in hand, Renee,
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:02.660]   talk about the weight, the size, the appearance,
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:07.100]   Gruber said it feels kind of retro, like a titanium.
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.220]   - It is so retro.
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.060]   - Yeah.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:09.900]   - It's like a power book,
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.540]   it's like a love letter to power books.
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:12.940]   It's got that whole vibe about it,
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.260]   and it's even got like this little artistic statement
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.100]   on the back.
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.980]   - They etch it in, instead of,
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.140]   and they also took the labeling off on the screen,
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:21.980]   which is great,
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.980]   it's just etched into the bottom now that says MacBook Pro.
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:25.900]   - They took away the, yeah,
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:26.780]   and they gave you a notch,
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.220]   which like, it's kind of like in your face,
[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.300]   but you stopped noticing it after a few minutes too.
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.820]   But the screen is, if you've seen the iPad Pro screen,
[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.140]   the screen is ridiculously good too.
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:38.580]   It's like full HDR, really bright, really vibrant.
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.180]   - I keep forgetting to be,
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.860]   I read about the notch, I'm sorry.
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.700]   (laughs)
[00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.460]   I think what happens is just forget about the notch
[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.060]   after a while and live with it.
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.060]   - The menu bar takes, the menu bar leaves your screen
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:50.900]   and goes into the notch,
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:52.780]   like a normal sized MacBook screen
[00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:53.780]   without having the menu bar.
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:54.620]   - Honestly.
[00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:55.460]   - It's really nice.
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:56.740]   - The stuff I work with full screen,
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.900]   like e-mex, probably I'll see the notch
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.340]   'cause it's kind of there,
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:01.740]   I'm using it full screen,
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.180]   but I will gladly trade the notch
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.860]   for full size function keys and an escape key
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:06.700]   that I can actually get.
[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:07.820]   - Well also, when you go full screen,
[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.780]   you don't see the notch because it blacks out the top,
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.540]   the top is out of the 16 by nine window for full screen.
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.900]   - Some programs put stuff kind of in the middle there,
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.500]   like that. - Oh maybe, yeah.
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:17.340]   - It's all right.
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.740]   I'll survive.
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:19.900]   - We'll get over it.
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:20.740]   - I'll get over it.
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.140]   - I wish you could pin notes under the notch,
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.820]   like just let us pin our little notes under the notch
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:26.660]   and it'd be like a bulletin board, it'd be great.
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.500]   - Do you notice that it's a little heavier?
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:29.500]   What is it, a half a pound heavier?
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.980]   - Yeah, yeah, it's like going back from baby Yoda
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.700]   to full size Yoda, like we used to have in 2050
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.260]   and then previously,
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.620]   but like at the 60 inch also,
[00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.620]   it's like four and a half, four point something pounds,
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:41.820]   which is not insignificant,
[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:43.580]   but I think like that's where you should differentiate.
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.340]   Apple's, one of the biggest issues with the previous pros
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.860]   is that Apple tried to make them like MacBook Pro Airs.
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.980]   Which a lot of new generation,
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.100]   I'm flying everywhere, I'm a founder, I'm a coder,
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.540]   I'm gonna wanna use this thing on a Boeing 747.
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.180]   They love that, they bought that in droves,
[00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.660]   but the people who were traditional pros are like,
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.380]   "No, no, no, that's a MacBook Air,
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.660]   "I need an actual MacBook Pro."
[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.540]   And that's what Apple's doing back here.
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:06.980]   They're not making the MacBook Pro
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.980]   have to be an Air anymore.
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.680]   - Yeah, how's the sound, how's the music?
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:16.060]   - It's like the 16 inch MacBook Pro Intel model
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.620]   from 2019 was ridiculously good for a laptop.
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.740]   Like I think industry leading still to this day.
[00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.140]   And this is just a little bit better.
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:23.900]   Like they've just made every component
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.140]   a little bit better in it.
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.060]   So it's like a little bit wider,
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:27.660]   a little bit more vibrant, a little bit better bass,
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.100]   a little brighter.
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.660]   I was just, I was watching just like as a demo
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.780]   and Georgia came in and it was that little laptop.
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:35.460]   She thought I was watching it on the TV surround
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:37.380]   so it's really loud.
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.460]   And it really sounds, watching the Eternals trailer
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:40.540]   because I'm into that sort of thing.
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.060]   And it sounds like you'll be fooled
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.140]   if you didn't know that it was a laptop.
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.260]   - dwindle has, as we've been talking,
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.500]   received his 16 inch and is open,
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.380]   didn't even booting it and I'm watching it
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.340]   in our chat rooms, slowly go through the steps.
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.100]   He says, oh, I can't wait to try the speakers.
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.220]   He's waiting for Mac OS update to finish.
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:01.260]   You have an OS update immediately, huh?
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.660]   You already have, it comes with a lot of Ray, but.
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:08.540]   - And I think Final Cut updated some of the components
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.020]   as well. - Maybe Xcode too.
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.380]   - When it started. - Yeah.
[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:15.020]   What else?
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:15.860]   - I'll ask, are you--
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.740]   - There was some controversy with the HDMI and the SD card
[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:21.340]   because the HDMI is HDMI 2.0, not 2.1,
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:24.900]   and the SD card is UHS 2, not 3.
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:25.740]   - Two is fine. - And when you look at
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.260]   the sky, it's the least. - It's like,
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:28.820]   two is pretty fast, right?
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:30.660]   - Yeah, except some people are like,
[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.580]   this is a Mac, it's got out of the best of everything.
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:33.660]   But when you look at the schematic,
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.580]   it's got three Thunderbolt buses now, three USB buses,
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.540]   up from two previously, and there's just no bandwidth left.
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.620]   Like they'd have to add another bus to get bandwidth to make.
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.420]   And the benefits are uncertain because
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:49.580]   HDMI 2.1 is great, but it's like 8K, 120 Hertz,
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:51.900]   you know, variable rate HDR, great,
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:52.980]   and you're not outputting that.
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.140]   Like Apple, like the Mac can't output that right now,
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.540]   so it's a bit of a, a bit of a balancing act.
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:02.700]   - Yeah, I thought I did think it was odd
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.580]   that it we didn't get 2.1.
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:05.660]   That was a little bit of a--
[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:07.100]   - It just didn't have the bandwidth for it.
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:07.940]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's like double--
[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.220]   - That's what I figured, your HDMI 2.0.
[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.220]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:11.860]   - What's the speed difference?
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.020]   - A couple hundred megabytes a second.
[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:15.860]   - A lot.
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:16.700]   - Is it's a lot?
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.540]   - No, it's a lot. - Okay, it's a lot.
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.900]   - I think it's double, but I don't want to say that.
[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:23.460]   - Yeah, it's a lot, it's a lot more overhead,
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.100]   you know, for that, absolutely.
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:30.620]   This just in, Dune Part Two has been green lit.
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:31.940]   - Okay, thank goodness.
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:33.140]   (laughing)
[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:35.300]   - I think that happened two or three weeks ago.
[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.980]   Maybe just 22 minutes ago.
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:39.740]   - Yeah, everyone was nervous, like,
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:40.580]   why would you do that?
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.580]   Why wouldn't you have the second line green
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:43.420]   when you made the first one?
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.340]   - Just, I mean, we're gonna break anyway,
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.460]   so all, 'cause we just have much more to talk about,
[00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:51.060]   but since that came in, I thought I better mention it.
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.780]   Fantastic movie, but it ends in the middle.
[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:54.620]   - It's good.
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.300]   - And it does, it was like, there's not,
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:58.140]   it's not like we did one and then we think we're gonna do it.
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:59.820]   I mean, it was, it was really like not to do it.
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:01.700]   - And they had not yet green lit.
[00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.500]   - Yeah, it was like, because normally,
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.100]   as they did with Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit,
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.500]   you would shoot all of it, you've got the sets,
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.700]   you've got the actors, I'm a little nervous.
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.900]   - Now they gotta reassemble all the actors
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.900]   and get back to work.
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.900]   - Location, Mommola, happens new Aquaman body,
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.740]   we don't know now. - We don't know now.
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:19.580]   - Right, yeah.
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:20.580]   - Was it good though, Leo, I'd be happy
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:21.660]   because I've not seen it. - You have not seen it.
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:22.820]   - I'm gonna do it every year.
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.740]   I was gonna watch this weekend, but I had like four embargoes.
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:26.580]   - Yeah.
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.100]   - My reaction, and I'll let you guys talk
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.780]   and contradict me if you want,
[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:33.060]   but best movie I've seen in a long time,
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:35.340]   probably the movie of the year,
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:39.660]   and absolutely what Dune deserves.
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:42.780]   Drawbacks, of course, it's two and a half hours.
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.980]   So even though he only did the first half of the novel,
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.980]   there's a lot of stuff left out.
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:48.980]   Shout out Mapes has one line.
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.540]   I mean, there's a lot of things that you never meet
[00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:54.700]   the spacers, the space guild, yet.
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.140]   That's why they have to do a second one.
[00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:59.500]   I gotta see what they do with the space guild.
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:03.820]   So there's some weird missing stuff,
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.860]   but everything that they do is very much in the spirit
[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:09.980]   of an I thought very beautifully rendered.
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:10.820]   - Awesome.
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:11.660]   - I thought it was very, very good.
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:16.380]   You guys, I'm still trying to rehabilitate
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.020]   after having seen Dune like in the original theaters
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:19.900]   like back of the kid.
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:23.940]   It was the only, yeah, I mean, it was,
[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:27.540]   I swear to God, it was the only movie I've ever walked out on.
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:28.860]   It was so bad.
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:32.540]   It was just nothing but, you know, nothing but.
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.220]   (screaming)
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.540]   But then the spice.
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:37.380]   - Oh, it was terrible.
[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.660]   - The spice and then like.
[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:40.740]   - It's campy. - It's campy.
[00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:44.340]   - Campy and popular for that reason.
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.940]   'Cause it's David Lynch, but no, this is the real thing.
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.380]   And I think you will not be disappointed in me.
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.420]   - Can I ask you one question?
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:53.060]   Does it feel like you've seen an entire move?
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:55.060]   The thing that really scares me about your comment
[00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.780]   is that if I spend money, whether pay per view
[00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:01.260]   or in the theater, give me a movie with a beginning
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:04.060]   and a middle and an end, even if it's just the first chapter
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.380]   of something. - No, no, no, no.
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.220]   - You fall off of it. - I would say.
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:07.060]   - I'm dubbed.
[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:07.980]   - I don't want to support that.
[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:08.820]   - I would say.
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:12.900]   - I would say it's similar to end of empire.
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.140]   Empire Strikes Back.
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.100]   You know, like we knew that there was going to be another one.
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:16.940]   (laughing)
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:17.780]   - At the end of it.
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:19.140]   I mean, Han Solo's in carbonite.
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:19.980]   - Yeah.
[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:20.980]   - You know, so I think that-
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:21.980]   - You know what I mean.
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:23.340]   - Yeah, it was good.
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:26.460]   - I felt, it was the best movie I've seen in a long time.
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.940]   - Me too. - Like it's just really
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.140]   just incredibly well done.
[00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:29.980]   I mean, just an amazing movie.
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:33.180]   - You know what's amazing is Han Zimmer's soundtrack.
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:35.220]   - Yeah. - You gotta see a good sound.
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.060]   - It is.
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:36.900]   - Oh good. - It is.
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:39.580]   - I have a 7- - I have a 7-ly, amazing.
[00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:42.020]   - I have a 7-1 and just they really used it up.
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:44.500]   You know, like and they made a lot of great choices.
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.540]   And the only thing, my only complaint about it,
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:47.980]   we were talking about earlier in office hours,
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:51.420]   is that I do think that there's a style now
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:55.780]   of mixing the dialogue into the sound,
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.540]   you know, like down into the sound.
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:00.060]   And there are definitely points where as,
[00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:02.300]   you know, as a family who hasn't read the books,
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:03.820]   (laughing)
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:05.180]   we couldn't understand what they were saying.
[00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:07.100]   - You know, and so a lot of people said that,
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.180]   I listen to stereo speakers.
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:10.860]   - Yeah, so I can hear everything.
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:11.700]   (laughing)
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.580]   - Right, yeah, so, and I don't know whether it's the
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.580]   surround mix or how it's, you know,
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:19.820]   I'm one of the people that knows that I know that my system
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.500]   is, I have my own channel checkers,
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.060]   so I know that my system is accurate.
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.060]   - I'm sure you're a, no, I'm sure you're a looker.
[00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:26.820]   - I roll my own standard, yeah.
[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:30.540]   - So, so I'm pretty sure that my system is doing
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.260]   what it's supposed to, but it was just really hard
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:34.540]   to hear some of the dialogue, and so we ended up turning
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:36.020]   the other couple of places where we went like,
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:37.300]   okay, we gotta go back and figure out what happened.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:38.780]   - Well, there's a huge dynamic,
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:40.860]   one of the things is there's a huge dynamic range
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:41.700]   in the movie.
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.460]   There's a lot of very quiet dialogue,
[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:45.900]   and then there's a lot of very, very loud,
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.060]   like maximally loud stuff.
[00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:51.140]   So I was, I was writing the levels.
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:52.300]   - We didn't have that problem as much,
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:54.540]   but we just had a problem understanding intelligibility,
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:56.500]   which has been come, it's becoming a problem,
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:57.500]   I think, in the art industry.
[00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:58.340]   - Absolutely.
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:32:59.660]   - Is that, is that, I think the tenant,
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.100]   well, tenant was, we just, we literally watched tenant,
[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:03.460]   and then went back and watched it a week later
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:04.860]   with the dialogue, and we were like,
[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:06.580]   "Oh, that's what that meant."
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:07.940]   - I'm glad you're complaining about this,
[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:10.180]   'cause you're young, rich.
[00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:14.540]   A lot of people like me and Scott Wilkinson are old-ish,
[00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.100]   and people just go, "Oh, you're too old, you can't hear it."
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.900]   - My, my, my, my kids, my kids,
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.180]   who doesn't hear it, couldn't understand it.
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:23.260]   - You know, it's not, this isn't a,
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.860]   I actually routinely on my five, one,
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.940]   turn up the center channel about 5 dB,
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:30.060]   just so I can, 'cause that happens so much now.
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:31.380]   - Leo, they had an interview with Nolan
[00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:33.300]   when he said that he saw that in some old movies
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.420]   where the dialogue just became part of the overall
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:36.940]   soundscape, and he loved that idea.
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:38.620]   - Robert Altman was famous for that.
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:42.020]   If you watch any Robert Altman's movies, "Mash,"
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:43.540]   or McCabe and Mrs. Millie,
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.140]   there's huge amounts of dialogue,
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:47.660]   unintelligible mixed in, or overlapping,
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:50.180]   and that's, that, that's exactly why Altman did it.
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.380]   He wanted to be natural,
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:52.540]   like, 'cause that's real life, right?
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.220]   And the people don't, like that.
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:56.860]   - It is, yeah, it's just, it's, it's,
[00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.580]   I will say that it keeps us,
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:01.220]   it is a problem for theaters,
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.500]   because as this starts to happen, I go,
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:04.740]   I look at a, I look at a film,
[00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:05.980]   and I'm starting to, like, pay attention
[00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:07.060]   to who the sound designers are,
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.620]   and go, "Whoa, that's one I want to watch at home."
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:12.460]   Like, 'cause I'm gonna turn the title on,
[00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:13.740]   you know, 'cause I'm, you know, and like,
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:14.580]   like Christopher Nolan,
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.140]   I won't go to see in a big screen anymore,
[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:18.220]   because I know that I'm gonna have to turn the title,
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:19.060]   the subtitles.
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:21.420]   - I do want to see Doon again on iMacs.
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.260]   - I'm gonna go see it.
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:23.100]   Here's the funny thing about that,
[00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:25.700]   is that there was a lot, the director was very upset,
[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:28.540]   obviously, about the fact that this was going to HBO Max,
[00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:30.860]   which is what we watched it on.
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:35.860]   Watching Doon in HBO Max has me want to go see it on iMacs.
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:36.940]   You know, like, because I was like,
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:38.660]   "This is something I need to see on other shows."
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:42.420]   - Yeah, although I watched it on a good 4K 70-inch HDR screen,
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:43.740]   and I was only, at least an hour,
[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:45.180]   maybe five or six feet away.
[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.740]   So it was a good experience,
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:49.220]   it was probably like a regular movie theater experience.
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:50.060]   - Right.
[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:51.340]   - But I think that it deserves iMacs,
[00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:53.100]   especially those iMacs. - The iMacs are goldy.
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:56.300]   - They flip aspect ratio throughout the movie,
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.540]   which annoys me, not all of it was shot in iMacs,
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:01.180]   a lot of it was shot in 16, in wide screen.
[00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:02.620]   So they-- - Not 16, but price.
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:03.860]   - Whatever it is, they're third five.
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.180]   - Yeah, so they go back and forth, I hear,
[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:07.420]   and some people didn't like that.
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:09.060]   Scott Wilkins said it didn't bother him,
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.380]   but maybe I don't think--
[00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:13.060]   - I don't think I know how it's 10 at iMacs.
[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:14.300]   - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.580]   - You know, what was it?
[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:19.020]   10 at does that, I think,
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:20.900]   and I think Christopher Nolan does that with iMacs,
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:22.300]   where he swaps back and forth.
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:23.140]   - Yeah, I don't like that.
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:25.300]   - And I haven't found that it affects me.
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.140]   - Okay.
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:27.700]   - You know, I just, I don't notice it.
[00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:29.540]   - It makes me think I'm watching a movie,
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:33.100]   which I feel like I don't wanna really think that.
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.140]   - I think you see them from the piano.
[00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:36.900]   - I wanna see on tune, man.
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.900]   I'm on Erika's right now.
[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.940]   - Someone does a lot of research on 120 frames per second,
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.780]   24 frames per second makes me feel like I'm watching it.
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:44.620]   - Yeah, I know.
[00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:45.460]   - All the time.
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:46.780]   - You're always watching a movie.
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:47.620]   - Very slow, yeah.
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:51.580]   - So the announcement, they greenlit it October 2023.
[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:53.660]   They had already begun work, some work on it,
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:56.300]   but they have to rebuild the sets.
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.940]   - He really pisses me off.
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:58.860]   - That really is unusual.
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.020]   - You had it all, man.
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:01.020]   - Super inefficient.
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:01.860]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:02.700]   - You had it.
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:05.340]   - That's also because now you get the actors,
[00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:07.460]   opt to say, "Oh, well, here's how much money you made,
[00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:09.740]   and now here's much, unless you wanna recast me,
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:11.740]   or you CGI to make me look like me."
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.180]   - If James Brolin sh--
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:16.460]   - Shaves his beard between now and then I'm gonna be pissed.
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:17.300]   - All right.
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.580]   - I think James Brolin beard has its own like,
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:21.700]   its own like age and representation at this point.
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:24.180]   So that makes you even more complicated.
[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:26.900]   - You will love the portrayal of Granny Hallack
[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.340]   and Duncan Idaho.
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:31.300]   Admittedly, Jason Momoa is an action character,
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:34.180]   but nevertheless, it's appropriate in that role.
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:40.380]   They make kinds, the planetary biologist, a female,
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:42.380]   instead of a male, but she's great.
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:46.420]   I think everybody is cast perfectly.
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:50.580]   The Lady Jessica, Rebecca Ferguson is perfect in that role.
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:54.100]   She has the most to do emotionally.
[00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:55.260]   Everybody else, you know.
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:59.580]   And Timmy Shammelay is a perfect emo 15 year old.
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.260]   (laughing)
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:04.060]   When we were watching it, Lisa said,
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.220]   how old is he supposed to be?
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.500]   I said he's supposed to be 15.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.780]   He's a little, obviously a little older than that,
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:12.900]   but he's acting like a 15 year old, it's good.
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:15.980]   - He played a Henry V.
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:17.260]   - Oh, he's a great actor.
[00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:18.580]   - And he did it.
[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:21.100]   - He feels very similar in that process.
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:22.100]   - He's a little moody.
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:23.300]   You know, he's a little good at that.
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.300]   You know, he's just got that,
[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:26.900]   and the hair is always in his eyes moody,
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:28.300]   but you have to remember, he's a teenager.
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:29.220]   So it's cast well.
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.020]   - Yeah, he's well-coused perfectly cast,
[00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:34.340]   especially because I'm hoping there will be 20 of these
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:38.620]   and he will die in old age having made number 19
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:39.900]   and they could just keep on going.
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:42.340]   And I'm sure that's what surprises me.
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:45.420]   The legendary didn't say, this is a franchise.
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.500]   - Well, the question really is,
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.220]   is whether they, when you talk about that,
[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:51.220]   whether they shift gears at some point,
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:53.380]   like foundation to a series.
[00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:54.260]   Like you do the first two-
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:54.820]   - It would have been so much-
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:55.820]   - Really big series.
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:56.660]   - I would have-
[00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:59.660]   - It's launched gonna HBO Maxx soon.
[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:00.780]   I think it's the Ben A. Jezzeret.
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:01.620]   I forget the exact time that he's doing-
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:03.100]   - Oh, they're doing spinoffs and stuff.
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:04.100]   - Spinoffs, yeah.
[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:06.900]   But I think that you may see two big feature films,
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:09.460]   but I could imagine it shifting gears into a-
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:10.780]   - I have mixed feelings actually.
[00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:12.580]   - I was gonna ask you about this, Alex,
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:14.140]   because the budgets, I guess, for features
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:16.340]   are much, much, much higher, right?
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.420]   So the feature could-
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:19.060]   - It's not in foundation.
[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:19.900]   (laughing)
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:20.900]   - Yeah, but you know what?
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.540]   We went back then to watch foundation,
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.220]   and it was a little more like watching Star Trek.
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:28.020]   It was like, it's just a notch below.
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:28.860]   - It is.
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.380]   I mean, it's probably, I mean,
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:31.300]   I don't know what the numbers are,
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.500]   but it's probably 30 to $50 million in episode though.
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.700]   I mean, it's a lot of money for episode.
[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:36.540]   - Oh, it's still expensive, right?
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.780]   - For that amount of time, it's still like a $100 million film.
[00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:41.140]   It's not like a $250 million film.
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:46.060]   But it's still pretty grand for a series.
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:47.620]   - But I think that what's nice about it is,
[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:49.860]   is we get to really do a lot of character development.
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:51.500]   You know, we get to see something, you know,
[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:52.660]   and really build it out.
[00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:54.020]   There's so many movies that you feel like,
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.860]   oh, we skipped over half the, you know,
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:57.780]   the people you were talking about.
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:01.500]   - All things in the world, Dune should be 20 episodes.
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.340]   It should not be-
[00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.340]   - Or four hours.
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:06.540]   - Or you could also chew on it a lot.
[00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:07.780]   If you imagine Harry Potter, I mean,
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:08.620]   they could have done that.
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:09.700]   They could have started it 2001
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.660]   and still be doing Harry Potter, you know,
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:14.220]   and covering it in the details of the fans wanted to cover it.
[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.260]   - And the same thing with Dune or the Rings.
[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:18.260]   The book Dune is filled with exposition.
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:20.580]   It's filled with little side scenes,
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:22.580]   all of which are completely missing.
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:24.700]   And without sting is Baron Harkon,
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.860]   and I just don't know how you can make a movie.
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.860]   (laughing)
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:29.860]   - You should have brought him back.
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:31.460]   - You will, by the way,
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.180]   - That's caught peace and emotion.
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:36.420]   - You will love their choices with Baron Harkon.
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:37.980]   Much, much, much better.
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.300]   - I couldn't find, I couldn't find an exact number
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.780]   for a foundation, but they say it costs as much as a movie
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.620]   for every two episodes and they're working 80 episodes.
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:46.460]   - It's like 50.
[00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:47.300]   - So 80's of 10 episodes.
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:48.140]   - I think it's probably 50.
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:48.980]   - Yeah.
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:52.660]   - But can I just quickly say that sometimes
[00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:55.300]   the book is the book, you've got the book.
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.220]   The book is there, the book is safe.
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:59.740]   Sometimes the opportunity of making a movie is saying,
[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:02.700]   well, what if we kind of simplify this
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.740]   so that we get to the essence of the story
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:06.380]   and get it moving faster?
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:08.500]   Sometimes that can actually be good.
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.980]   It's, I think that one of the problems
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:13.220]   with a lot of the ways that they're doing
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:14.900]   like Marvel movies these days is that
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:16.220]   - I'm stretching out too much.
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:17.060]   - I really don't.
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:19.380]   - Well, that, I really don't need to know
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:21.860]   this like 1800 issue backstory.
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:22.700]   - Right.
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:23.740]   - And this connection to this other character.
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.380]   Sometimes it really is all about here is a character.
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:28.140]   I can explain him in two sentences
[00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:30.340]   and we're gonna give him or her some challenges
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:31.580]   that they're gonna have to work through through
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:33.340]   which we're gonna learn about the character.
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:36.100]   So that's why, sometimes I think that Lord of the Rings
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.940]   being compressed into three movies
[00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:39.980]   is actually a really, really good thing.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:42.660]   'Cause it does get people interested in thinking that,
[00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:43.900]   wow, I love this story.
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:44.740]   Now I wanna read this a bit.
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:45.660]   - I think you'll like that.
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:49.580]   'Cause I think Dune, I think Dune, the movie
[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:52.100]   gets the main message very well
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:54.020]   and it's emotionally very similar.
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:55.900]   So I think you get that exact feeling like
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:59.740]   they hit the high points, but it is kind of like a high loss.
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:03.140]   - So it's less, it's less, it's less than 83%
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:05.500]   interior monologue, it'll be better than you originally.
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:06.340]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:07.180]   - I don't know.
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:11.020]   - I stand corrected, he played Fade, right?
[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.940]   The nephew of the Baron.
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:13.780]   - Fade Rasa.
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:14.660]   - Yeah, Fade Rasa.
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:17.340]   And David Baptiste to place a Fade very,
[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:20.420]   I think it's Dave Baptiste, place Fade very well.
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:21.740]   - Caught piece.
[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:23.660]   - Not since our cause that we see involved.
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:26.580]   - More technical, more better tactical use
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:27.580]   of limited.
[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:29.820]   - The beast Rabban, pardon me.
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:32.060]   Well, who's, do we even see Fade?
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.260]   We haven't even seen Fade, so we don't know.
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:35.180]   Never mind.
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:36.820]   - Maybe it'll be staying.
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.620]   - It could be staying, that would be hysterical.
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:39.620]   - That would be great.
[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:41.980]   (laughing)
[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:43.860]   - As long as it's not Ed Sheeran.
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:45.500]   - I'll find him up here with it.
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:46.860]   - Anyway, I did not mean to make this
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:48.220]   doon break weekly, I start.
[00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:50.620]   I totally apologize, I just wanted to give you the,
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:52.700]   no, no, it's not your fault.
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.540]   We like to work on our first sponsor, Dune.
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:57.820]   I've been wanting to talk about this since I saw the movie,
[00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:01.340]   and I knew you guys were the ones to talk about it with.
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.940]   - So yeah, it was just the first half.
[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:04.780]   - Anyway, first.
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:07.940]   - The answer is yes, you should go watch it.
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:10.540]   It is an amazing film, and you're gonna wanna watch it
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.820]   in a big screen at least once.
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:14.020]   I mean, I actually am glad I watched it at home,
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:15.140]   so I could turn on the subtitles.
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:16.860]   But I'm now going to go and enjoy it
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:19.380]   on a giant screen because it's that good.
[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:20.220]   - I'm gonna see it several times too.
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:21.060]   - It's that good.
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:24.060]   They made three different soundtrack albums.
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:25.980]   And I'm gonna buy all of them.
[00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:28.140]   'Cause Hans has been amazing.
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:30.300]   - Well, what's interesting is you don't hear it
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:31.140]   and say, "Oh, Hans Zimmer."
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:32.660]   Sometimes you do, right?
[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:35.060]   There's some Zimmer, you kinda know it's a Hans Zimmer,
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:37.220]   just like John Williams, you know it's John Williams.
[00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:40.220]   This, I was saying, who is the composer?
[00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:43.500]   This is really good, really interesting.
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.940]   So I think you'll like it.
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:48.380]   And the sand is very realistic.
[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:50.180]   I don't think it's CGI.
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:51.380]   They cast a sand well.
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:52.220]   - Some, some.
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:53.140]   - Some of them's casting.
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:55.540]   - Maybe, yeah, I guess when the worms come.
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:57.660]   - You'll love the worms, Andy.
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:58.900]   You'll love the sand worms.
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:00.800]   They do make an appearance.
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:03.260]   - All right, enough.
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:05.060]   - Only if they're overtly sexual, I hope,
[00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:06.620]   just like in the David Lynch version.
[00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:10.300]   - They are not overtly sexual, but they are terrifying.
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:11.140]   - Oh, good.
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:13.380]   (laughing)
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:16.420]   - Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.900]   We'll get back to the, there's so much Apple stuff.
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:20.380]   I don't know, I apologize.
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.060]   - We're testing the faithful.
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:24.100]   - Yeah, there's people sitting there going,
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.220]   boom, what about the M1 Max?
[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:29.100]   Our show today brought, we'll get to that in a second.
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:31.620]   We got the, we got the goods, promise you.
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:33.740]   Renee, Andy, Alex, they're all here today.
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:38.020]   Mac Break Weekly brought to you by our sponsor, Melissa.
[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:41.660]   You know, if your business, your customer address data
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:44.060]   is absolutely, you know, vital.
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:45.620]   It's how you reach your customers.
[00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:47.220]   Actually, it's not just address,
[00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:50.260]   it's emails, phone numbers, names.
[00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:51.580]   Melissa does it all.
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:54.460]   Did you know that 36 million address changes
[00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:56.980]   were processed by the Postal Service last year?
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:58.780]   36 million.
[00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:00.740]   I bet you some of those were your customers.
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:02.780]   Customers who will no longer get your mailings,
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:07.620]   your catalogs, 30% on average of customer data
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:09.100]   goes bad every year.
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.940]   Melissa's job, make your data current and accurate.
[00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:14.100]   That's why they're called the address experts.
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:17.260]   They've been so for 35 years.
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:20.420]   People love them, 10,000 businesses trust the address experts.
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:24.700]   In fact, Melissa's renewal rate is over 92%.
[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:26.140]   That is very high.
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:28.900]   It means people love Melissa and need it and use it
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:30.540]   and you will too.
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:34.820]   Verify everything with their global address verification service.
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:38.260]   It works in 240 plus countries and territories.
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:40.980]   And you can even do it as the data is being entered.
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.100]   I'll explain that in a second.
[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:44.820]   Address is emails, phone numbers, names.
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:47.060]   Get rid of duplicates with Melissa's data matching.
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:48.860]   You can eliminate clutter and duplicates,
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:50.820]   increase the accuracy of the database.
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:52.500]   You do not want to mail multiple catalogs
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:54.420]   the same person, that's crazy.
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:57.460]   You'll reduce your mailing costs, your postage.
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.940]   You can also enhance your customer profiles
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:02.420]   with demographic information, public information,
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:05.580]   like marital status, social media handles.
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:07.540]   Now, let me explain how you can deploy it
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:09.100]   because this is super flexible.
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:11.180]   They've really gone the extra mile here.
[00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:13.660]   Yes, there's an on-prem version.
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:16.060]   But you can also use Melissa as a web service.
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:18.780]   They have an FTP site so you can do a secure FTP
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:19.900]   upload and download.
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:23.500]   There's a software as a service delivery options.
[00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:25.740]   There's a new lookups app, in fact,
[00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:28.900]   that's on iOS and Android, which lets you search names,
[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:31.700]   addresses, and more at your fingertips for one time only.
[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:33.460]   And they have a very complete API,
[00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:38.180]   which a lot of companies use in their customer service software.
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:42.580]   Or in their shopping carts.
[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:44.900]   'Cause, you know, it happens, customer service,
[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:48.260]   even customers accidentally swap numbers
[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:50.820]   or get something wrong and Melissa will actually fix it.
[00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:53.420]   You can probably use Melissa in a shopping cart
[00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:55.340]   when it fills it in and says, "You mean this?"
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:56.960]   Yes.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.900]   By the way, Melissa treats your data like it's, you know,
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:04.920]   gold, they continually undergo independent security audits.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:08.340]   They are committed to your data security, your privacy,
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:12.520]   and they're fully compliant, SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR,
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:14.960]   so you can use it with confidence.
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:17.480]   The best support to sign up for a service level agreement.
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:20.320]   You'll get 24/7 world famous support
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:22.760]   from the Melissa's Global Support Center.
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.680]   And the pandemic's not over.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.640]   Melissa is still supporting communities
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:31.120]   and qualifying essential workers during COVID-19.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.440]   You may qualify for six months of free service

[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:38.880]   Congrats to Melissa, just named a leader
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.240]   in address verification and data quality software
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:43.920]   by G2 Crowds Fall 2021 report.
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:46.340]   So you know they're meeting the diverse needs
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:48.640]   of their customers, well done, Melissa.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:51.280]   I think I hope I've convinced you you need it.
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.920]   Make sure your customer contact data is up to date.
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:56.400]   You could try the API right now in the developer portal.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.480]   It's easy to log on, sign up,

[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:03.320]   get started today, 1000 records clean for free.
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.800]   Melissa.com/twit,
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:10.800]   M-E-L-I-S-S-A, Melissa.com/twit.
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.480]   We thank you so much for supporting MacBreak Weekly
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:15.320]   and we thank you for supporting us
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:17.640]   by using that special address.
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.280]   That way you get the 1000 records too.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:20.400]   So there's a benefit to you,
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:25.040]   from Melissa.com/twit.
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:31.320]   All right, how are you doing with your M1 setup?
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:35.000]   Did you get the everything downloaded now?
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.880]   Dwindel and actually he said
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:39.400]   I was enjoying the Dune conversation.
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:40.480]   Okay, fine.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.740]   (laughing)
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:45.640]   Okay, first of all, when you're linking
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:46.920]   in with rendezvous with Rama,
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:48.480]   that's the one that you really said.
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.800]   Stop, stop, stop.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.080]   Sorry, okay.
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:52.680]   Stop.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:54.720]   I was just gonna get interested.
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:55.720]   So,
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:56.720]   Andrew III.
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:58.360]   Again, I'm gonna encourage people
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:47:59.880]   who wanna know more about the SOC
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:03.200]   to read the amazing anon tech write up.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.000]   Really, really, really detailed.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.600]   But there are lots of reviews.
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:09.960]   I have not seen one negative yet.
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.000]   There are a couple of people who mocked the HDMI port
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   and the SD card port.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.600]   And then there were even more people who said,
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:18.560]   "The good days are back."
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:19.760]   (laughing)
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:21.360]   Yep, there's a certain nostalgia.
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:22.200]   Alleluia.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.040]   Alleluia.
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:24.400]   I will using that SD card
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.240]   'cause a slot on my trip,
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:30.240]   I'm taking my new 14 inch to Mexico,
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.000]   starting in the morning.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:32.920]   Some people pointed out,
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:34.360]   even if you don't care about SD for camera,
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:35.320]   just stick an SD card in there
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:36.880]   and use it to back up your system every night.
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.040]   Like, there's a lot of things you can do with that.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.600]   Although, it's pretty slow.
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:42.040]   I mean, I'd prefer to use it for--
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:42.880]   Overnight board.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:43.720]   Like, running so.
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:44.560]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:46.040]   I'm just so glad that--
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.680]   I'm eager to hand it off to Renee,
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:50.400]   but all I really have to say is that thank goodness
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:52.920]   that Apple is reclaiming the pro designation,
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:54.680]   making it really easy something.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:56.400]   Just like you said earlier,
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:59.000]   was it you or Renee who said that there used to be
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.400]   just such an overlap between the MacBook Pro
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:02.720]   and the MacBook Air,
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:05.480]   even before the transition to M1 last year?
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:06.920]   And now it's like, no, there is a,
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:11.360]   if you walk in with $1,500, $2,000 to spend on a Mac,
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:13.320]   there are people who will come out with a MacBook Air
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:15.600]   and $800 more in their pocket.
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:18.280]   There are people who will come out with a MacBook Pro
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:21.720]   and spend $800 more than they wanted to spend,
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:24.000]   but because they saw exactly the machine
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.720]   that they needed, not one that, well,
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:28.280]   let me not like last year when I thought that,
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:30.120]   well, I'll buy the MacBook Pro,
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.280]   but only because I want the extra storage
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:34.800]   and I want the cooling fans.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:35.960]   And that was the only reason why
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:37.200]   I bought the Pro instead of the Air.
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:42.200]   John Groover nailed it in his review of the MacBook Pro.
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:44.280]   He explained it now that I think about it,
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.640]   he's absolutely right.
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:48.640]   Apple uses Pro two different ways.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.240]   So when you talk about the AirPods Pro,
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:55.280]   Pro means something he says more like nicer or deluxe,
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:57.760]   a Kooth euphemism for premium.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:59.280]   - Right, it's John.
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.480]   - And yeah, the touch bar MacBook Pros
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:04.640]   were undeniably nice, so they were Pro in that context.
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:07.520]   But Apple, he says, is revisited what the Pro
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:10.320]   and MacBook Pro means.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.040]   It means professional.
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:15.920]   And this is Apple kind of retrenching from,
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:19.320]   oh, it's premium to professionals.
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:21.040]   I guess the MacBook Pro 13-inch
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:24.440]   that I bought is really the premium version of Pro,
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.080]   but these, there is no question.
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.000]   These are professional.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.800]   - And you saw that in the messaging as well.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.440]   So when you looked at the keynote,
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:33.800]   they're really talking about it as a Pro.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:36.760]   They're talking about Pro apps doing Pro things.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.480]   And I think that for a lot of folks,
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.760]   I think what's exciting for Mac users
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:42.880]   is for a long time, maybe the last decade,
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:44.720]   we've been like, well, it's not as fast,
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.640]   but we really like the operating system
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.280]   and the convenience of it and everything else.
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:49.600]   I mean, if we were in real power,
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.800]   we know we have to go somewhere else,
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:53.920]   but we really like the operating system.
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:56.360]   And Apple is now giving us both.
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:58.160]   And I think that's gonna be, that's gonna be really,
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.680]   that's exciting for next year too.
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:03.160]   - 120 Hertz refresh rate.
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.680]   Looks pretty good.
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:08.000]   - Yeah, I had a quibble with it.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.400]   Like he put it under a low,
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.440]   like a high speed camera turned on dark mode
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:12.960]   and then started moving it back and forth.
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:15.160]   They said it doesn't refresh as fast as he wants it to.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:16.840]   I haven't been able to reproduce that,
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:17.760]   but that's very personal.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.480]   Like some people can see dropped frames
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:20.600]   at 120 frames per second.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:21.440]   I cannot.
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.240]   I can see colors where other people don't care
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:24.520]   about differences in colors.
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:26.360]   So that's gonna be very personal.
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:27.680]   But like you can nitpick,
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:29.200]   if you find a display technology,
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.560]   I can tell you how to hurt it.
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:31.960]   So it just depends on how you wanna hurt
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:33.720]   your particular display technology.
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:35.400]   - Also, he does point out,
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:37.280]   under points out again and on tech,
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:38.800]   not all apps use 60 Hertz.
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:41.200]   So a number of people were complaining about Twitter,
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:42.560]   but I use 120 Hertz,
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:44.760]   but Twitter is still back at 16 Hertz.
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:45.840]   And so that's it.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:47.360]   - The more you use the native stuff,
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.360]   the more you'll benefit from this,
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.560]   the more that you've done custom stuff
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.360]   is more gonna take them time to update that.
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.560]   - Yeah, and this is a shot across the bow
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.280]   for most developers is you just have to use
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:57.000]   the libraries that they're handing you
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.120]   'cause they're now, we're an un,
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:02.120]   you know, the territory now is all apples.
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:03.320]   Like it really is something
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.240]   that if you're gonna try to write your own,
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.760]   you're now, I've seen in the last,
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:09.640]   like audio right now is just a disaster,
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:12.360]   you know, on M1 and in Monterey
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:14.440]   because the plugin manufacturers
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:17.720]   have all these creative ways that they have done this stuff
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:20.280]   for the last decade or more.
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:22.240]   And, you know, now trying to keep up,
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.760]   they can't, you know, they can't get it out.
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:25.920]   They can't get the new updates out
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:28.280]   because they're not able to keep up with it.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:30.720]   So you really have to rely on apples,
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:33.200]   which for good or for better or for worse,
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:34.840]   now that things are starting to accelerate,
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:36.720]   you have to rely on apples libraries
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.680]   or you're gonna have trouble keeping up.
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:39.520]   - Yeah.
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:45.320]   - They, go ahead.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:47.240]   - No, just a button,
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:50.040]   but what Alex was saying, yeah,
[00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:53.040]   that's always been one of apples problems,
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:55.280]   many problems with dealing with developers.
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:58.040]   They'll often say you are required to use this library,
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:52:59.360]   but then when they say, well, this library
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:01.480]   is completely inadequate for what my program,
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:04.680]   what my app does, they will say tough darts,
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.520]   which is bad enough, but then they will say,
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:07.920]   well, well, how come my competitor,
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.400]   how come this other app gets to use it?
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:11.800]   So well, we've given them an exclusion exception
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:12.800]   that you're not entitled to,
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:14.440]   well, why am I not entitled to that?
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:15.600]   And then radio silence.
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.600]   And this is why there's a lot of bad blood
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:19.160]   between Apple and the developers.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.480]   They're not, they're requiring them to use tools
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:22.960]   that are inadequate for purpose
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:26.560]   and not really explaining why they're applying this,
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:29.720]   not unfairly across the different developers.
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:31.920]   - I think that what I'm talking about specifically
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:33.760]   is not so much a requirements as, you know,
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.800]   the developers can write their own solutions
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:38.080]   for some of these things, but they're just gonna get crushed
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:40.320]   by the folks that are sitting on top of the libraries
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:42.200]   that Apple makes because Apple is, you know,
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:44.080]   they're just making all of those super efficient,
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:47.120]   you know, people who ignored the metal, you know,
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:50.480]   and Apple and WWC was talking about metal for years,
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:53.200]   going, you really wanna move over, you know,
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:55.440]   like this is not, you know, and they kept,
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:58.520]   that gave them lots of time to think about it
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:53:59.640]   and the folks that ignored that
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:01.560]   are really paying the price now.
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:02.400]   - Yeah.
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:04.200]   - So related to that also is single threaded
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:06.120]   versus multi threaded.
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:06.960]   - Yeah.
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:09.600]   - And in fact, according to Anand,
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:13.800]   to Andre Frumasano who wrote the article,
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:17.200]   the single threaded performance is not massively changed
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:19.360]   from the M1, but on the other hand--
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:20.200]   - Same chorus.
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:22.400]   - Same chorus, but on the other hand,
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:24.880]   let me give you his quote from the next page,
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:28.480]   "The multi threaded performance, a real monster."
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:29.320]   - Yeah.
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:31.600]   - So that means you really wanna use apps
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:34.480]   that are written using Apple libraries,
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:37.480]   written native to the hardware
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:40.160]   and are multi threaded if possible, if they need to be.
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:42.520]   I mean obviously my Emacs doesn't need to be multi threaded,
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:45.680]   but this will be the best or worst for everybody.
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:48.080]   Like what Apple's done here is also made a single target
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:49.280]   for developers, like before,
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:50.480]   but developers have to worry about,
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:51.480]   like I have to write to the CPU,
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.800]   I have to write to what could be in the PC world,
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:56.480]   what could be in AMD or Nvidia or IORIS Pro
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:58.320]   or like whatever, different kinds of graphics.
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:54:59.760]   They have to handle all of this.
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.680]   Right now, if you're starting to write for,
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.440]   and your target is Apple Silicon,
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:04.800]   you're writing for one thing,
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:07.720]   like Metal will handle anything GPU related,
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:09.560]   all the different programming frameworks will handle,
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:11.760]   all of that, you're just writing your code.
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.640]   It means that code is much more dependent
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:15.040]   on everything that Apple's doing,
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:17.200]   but you have a much smaller job to do
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:18.960]   if you wanna write highly optimized code
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:22.280]   that works really well with Apple's customer base.
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:23.760]   - Yeah.
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:26.760]   And it does put companies that are trying
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.120]   to write cross platform,
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:29.840]   it does put them at a disadvantage.
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:31.520]   You know, like it's just harder for them to do this
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:33.320]   because they went to libraries.
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:35.600]   - Playing a tailored suit versus off the rack, you know,
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:38.520]   if you, or supporting a console versus supporting a PC,
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:39.920]   like if you wanna write for next,
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:40.840]   like it's basically next,
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:42.240]   like if we look at the PlayStation 5
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:45.160]   and the Xbox Series X, those are AMD SOCs, you know,
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:48.200]   like that a lot of products are moving in that direction
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:50.040]   because they have, they don't have all the benefits,
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:51.080]   they have massive trade-offs,
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:52.840]   but they do have some tangible benefits.
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:54.240]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:56.160]   So ideally you're gonna use software,
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:58.240]   I have to say I'm very impressed over the year
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:00.680]   that I've been using the M1.
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:04.600]   I don't have any more Intel processes running.
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:08.380]   Does Rosetta 2 benefit on these newer chips in any way?
[00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:13.880]   - You have the same X86 reorder sequencing
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:16.000]   for optimizing the translation layer,
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.280]   and if you wrote for metal,
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:19.080]   you get all of that GPU performance,
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:21.360]   so there's still gonna be apps that paradoxically
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:24.520]   work better on, like through emulation on M1
[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:25.440]   than they did natively,
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:26.960]   just because they're writing for metal and metal
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:29.240]   is so much more accelerated,
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:31.040]   and then you have like those eight performance cores
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:32.800]   versus the four performance cores on M1,
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.400]   so just anything that's multi-core aware
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.760]   is gonna be faster.
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:39.200]   - And what's is impressive in all the benchmarks,
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:42.000]   and I hate benchmarks 'cause they're so synthetic,
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   but what is impressive is that in many cases,
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.960]   these machines are running as well as the very best
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:53.080]   top of the line desktop machines with no power constraints.
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:54.400]   So-- - Even on battery,
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:56.520]   we can't, we can't, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:59.240]   We really can't underscore that enough,
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:02.560]   that this is what it can do when you're still limited
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:04.680]   by die size, you're still limited by thermals,
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:06.360]   you're still limited by powers,
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:11.280]   that this is why I'm resisting the urge to like saying,
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:14.160]   but we have money for one of these new laptops,
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:17.040]   and remember last year's laptop was more of a MacBook Air,
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:20.800]   like no, wait, as impressive as this year's gonna be,
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:23.440]   if you want a Mac mini, you are going to get the,
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:28.080]   the mini with the capital, meh, it's gonna be so powerful.
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:30.760]   - Really interesting explanation in the review
[00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:34.160]   where he talks about Apple being forced to use
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:36.880]   Intel's motherboard graphics, their highest end,
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:41.760]   Iris motherboard graphics, but really keeping that,
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:45.080]   a lid on what Apple could do with the GPU,
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:48.520]   that has all changed.
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:52.000]   And so things have, that is, he says,
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.960]   the arguably the star of the show for Apple's,
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:57.560]   Mac SOCs is the GPU.
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:00.560]   - 'Cause I keep on adding something more.
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:02.920]   - You were worried about discrete GPU,
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:04.840]   you know, missing a discrete GPU.
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:09.160]   Iris was never quite enough for what Apple would like to do
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:12.000]   for their largest 15, 16 inch MacBook Pros.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.360]   Apple has been able to turn to discrete GPUs
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:15.200]   to make up with the difference,
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:18.920]   but the lack of space and power for a GPU
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:20.800]   in the 13 inch MacBook Pro form factor
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:23.360]   has been a bit more constraining.
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:28.360]   However, now, because the GPU is a part of the SOC,
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:32.500]   those constraints are effectively gone.
[00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:35.720]   - And in a laptop, it's an implementation detail,
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:37.120]   like in a big desktop tower,
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:39.640]   you're gonna maybe wanna take the GPU output in your GPU in,
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:41.800]   but no one's really swapping GPUs in a laptop,
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:43.360]   it's not feasible, so.
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:45.200]   - Well, I remember we bought that when we were not.
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:48.600]   - When I bought that 16 inch or I bought the EGPU unit,
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:50.880]   you know, the little tower thing,
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:53.640]   and that, I guess, made some difference,
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:56.400]   but this is gonna be ideal, obviously.
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:57.880]   - Also, this is gonna be more important
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:59.360]   for homogeneous computing,
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:02.920]   that this is everything that Apple's able to achieve
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:07.920]   on the iPhone is now spreading across, not just Max,
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:10.800]   but also, again, Pixel phones,
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:12.880]   other desktops, other laptops,
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:14.640]   the idea that you have all these GPUs,
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:16.960]   you have all these other core components on the die,
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:19.240]   that aren't just there to say, oh, well, GPU,
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:21.360]   well, that's gonna be great for graphics performance.
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:23.340]   No, because they're gonna be throwing so much
[00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:25.640]   like artificial intelligence stuff on the GPU,
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:27.800]   so many other calculations on the GPU.
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:31.440]   It's, it really is, this is why the benchmarks
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:33.400]   aren't really terribly useful.
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:35.360]   You really need somebody who's gonna tear it apart
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:39.360]   and say, here is what an app does in 2021, 2022,
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:41.200]   and here is how it's gonna use the stuff
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:42.840]   that you see on the CPU,
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:44.720]   because by the time you get a number,
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:47.000]   and you can, an independent lab can prove
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.040]   that this number is higher than this other number,
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:51.400]   but it doesn't really affect how fast is it gonna take
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:52.280]   for you to take a picture,
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:54.560]   how fast is it gonna take for you to compile an app?
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:57.040]   - So, and that takes us to the biggest difference,
[00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:00.800]   as I mentioned, the Pro and the Max is a GPU,
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:04.340]   the M1 Pro has half the GPU clusters,
[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:08.280]   half system level cache, half of memory bandwidth,
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.280]   but aside from those three things,
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:12.080]   in every other respect is the same.
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.080]   So that makes it a smaller chip easier
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.400]   to make less expensive.
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:19.160]   - So you can get bin down versions on the 14,
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.120]   like if you wanna save some money
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.560]   and you don't think you'll be needing all the cores,
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:24.520]   you can get like the 24 core GPU and the 8 core CPU
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:25.360]   to save a little bit extra.
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:26.600]   - Right, right, yeah.
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:28.680]   - So I spent the minimum amount of money,
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:32.160]   $2,000 to get this, which is still the cheap one.
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:34.440]   - In fact, no air conditioning in the back scenario.
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:37.600]   - I pay it, it's still expensive,
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:43.520]   but it's not out of the reach of kind of a high end,
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.720]   Intel laptop, it's, you know,
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:47.040]   it's got a high end Dell sometime
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.080]   and it recalibrates how expensive you think out.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:53.000]   - Yeah, and I often do buy those i7 based Dell's
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.680]   with lots of RAM and lots of storage,
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:57.320]   and yeah, they're $2,000, or Lenovo's,
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.280]   it's not out of the question at all,
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.320]   so it's kind of in there.
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:04.440]   And good news, Apple still offers the MacBook Air,
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:07.840]   you know, you could still get a $1,000 laptop,
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:10.560]   so there's now a really nice range,
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.920]   and we're just waiting for this next level of high,
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.640]   high end stuff to come along.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:20.240]   - What else should we talk about?
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:22.440]   - Yes, there's still a headphone jack.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:23.880]   - They fixed the camera.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.040]   - The camera, how do you like that?
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.640]   - He didn't's headphone jack.
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.400]   The camera's really, really good.
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:32.960]   I spoiler alert, I'm did a macOS Monterey review
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.680]   with friend of the show, John Gruber,
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:36.400]   and I'm on my camera like you see me now,
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:39.920]   and he's on the Mac Pro camera.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.640]   He looks terrific, like we could literally
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:43.440]   have not have done that, he'd have to have used it.
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:45.280]   Like previously, the last time he used his iPhone
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:46.440]   to record it because the Mac camera
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:47.800]   was nowhere nearly good enough,
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.280]   and it looks really good because you're getting
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:52.640]   an essentially a 1080p camera like the new iMac,
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:53.760]   it's got a much bigger sensor,
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:57.240]   and it's got the basically the iPhone 12 image signal processor
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:59.360]   layered on top of that for white balance
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:01.600]   and color grading and all of those things.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.240]   So it spits out completely,
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.240]   and this is not damning with the same praise,
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:08.360]   but like it spits out a very competent image
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.600]   that you could use for Zoom for FaceTime
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:11.760]   for all of these things.
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:12.760]   - Where is that video?
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:13.600]   - Where is that video?
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:15.120]   I wanna show it, is it on your YouTube?
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.320]   - It's not up yet, I'm sorry.
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.280]   - Awesome, we're gonna do a quick 15 minutes chat,
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.880]   and like an hour later, I'm still editing.
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:23.840]   - Yeah, are you doing any, what I'd love to see
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.080]   is a head to head with it in a Brio,
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.160]   you know, Logitech Brio?
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.680]   - I have, so in my review, I have the Brio,
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.240]   I have the Logitech 920, I have an Apple,
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.240]   most of their previous MacBook Pros.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:37.160]   I'll let you know with it as if you've done it.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.920]   - Yeah, it's night and day, I mean like you can see
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:43.520]   the camera's getting better with the iMac Pro from 2017,
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.640]   'cause that was 1080p, and then the iMac camera
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:47.480]   is even better than that, and then this is just better
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:49.200]   than any camera they've had before.
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.200]   - And how would you compare it to the Brio?
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:54.760]   - I like the color better, like I find the Brio's color
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:56.240]   a little, like it's really,
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.280]   Logitech has always been a little warm and rosy for me,
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:00.200]   like a little magenta shifted for me.
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:01.880]   I think Apple does a better job on the colors,
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.240]   but they also, Apple tends to show everything,
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.680]   so like the Brio looks a little bit more natural
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:08.000]   in terms of darks and lights where Apple exposes
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.920]   more of the shadows, which some people hate.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:10.920]   - What do you think of the resolution?
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.840]   Is it, it doesn't feel like it's,
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.480]   'cause the Brio's coming 4K down to 1080.
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:16.880]   - Yes, no, it looks really good,
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.400]   'cause again, you've got the silicon behind it.
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.120]   - I would use the real Brio-
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.300]   - Here's the video in your Pro review.
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:25.940]   Here's the 1080p video, it does look good.
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:28.320]   - Yeah. - That's the old one.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.200]   - I did not include the 480p for this
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:31.480]   as well earlier, I was.
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:32.480]   (laughing)
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:35.080]   - Okay, so this is fun, you're going, Mac,
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:36.520]   this is actually great,
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:37.960]   comparing head to head.
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:43.240]   It really, actually that's the best one, the iMac, right?
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:45.240]   That was the 2020 iMac, pretty good.
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:47.560]   - That was the old, yeah, that was the old.
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:49.840]   - So you got them all, here's a 720p.
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:54.720]   From the 2020 M1, gosh, that's terrible.
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:55.560]   - I actually finished off again.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.360]   There's a like, 9.20.
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:58.680]   - Yeah.
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.600]   - I bet that there's the Brio.
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:01.640]   - Yeah.
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:03.640]   - Yeah, you're right, the Brio's a little rosy.
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.480]   - Yeah.
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:07.040]   - And the way's been a little bit, a little bit gentle for me.
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.800]   - And the issue, one of the issues that we have is that,
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.680]   yeah, I mean, the problem is, can you adjust the color?
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:14.320]   Like, so with the tools that we use to adjust the Brio,
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.920]   if we turn those on, we can't see the Mac,
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.040]   you know, the security goes on and we can't, the Mac,
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.160]   literally the camera turns off, you know,
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.000]   the internal camera.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.120]   - All the really matters, frankly,
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:26.440]   'cause you're not gonna use this for making your next
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:27.920]   feature film.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:31.720]   Is that you look okay in a Zoom call,
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.760]   and that's clearly you do.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.600]   - Yeah, one more.
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.440]   - Yeah.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:38.120]   - I imagine that the department that's in charge
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:41.640]   of internal cameras got a whole bunch of more money,
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.280]   a whole bunch of more time last year,
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.080]   'cause I would love to see the timeline
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:47.120]   of the design of this machine when they say that,
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.120]   okay, guess what, we're now gonna make sure
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:51.200]   that the adequate is no longer adequate.
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.360]   Now it has to be exceptional because,
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:57.520]   not because we thought that 720p was a really great solution,
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.720]   but because now people are going to notice this,
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:02.000]   people are going to, this is gonna be a differentiator
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.400]   between our laptop and the other one.
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.600]   - We're on camera.
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:07.320]   - Well, and also FaceTime is more and more important
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.160]   to Apple.
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.920]   I mean, I think FaceTime is really coming to its own
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.360]   or just having-- - Or just having a Leo.
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:12.800]   It's not out yet.
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:14.840]   But it's out for the iOS, for iOS,
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:16.240]   you can do FaceTime with Spatial Audio now,
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:18.560]   it's not out for the Mac yet, but it got to try a demo.
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:20.000]   It sounds really good, like you could,
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.560]   like it would be like Alex is over here,
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:23.520]   and Andy's over here, and Leo's there,
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.880]   and it makes it much easier to figure out
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:27.200]   who's talking as well, because they're naturally
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.280]   where you position them, and this computer is great
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:31.600]   for that because it's got the Spatial Audio speakers,
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.920]   and it's got the FaceTime, the much higher quality camera,
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:36.200]   so you're getting more of a virtual conference room,
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:37.640]   if that makes sense. - Nice.
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:39.000]   Well, that's great.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   - Yeah. - Yeah, and I think that,
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.240]   I think it is important that the camera looks good
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:44.720]   because in meetings, what's happened is,
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.880]   is that we went from being informal to the fact
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.320]   that we're having lots and lots of meetings.
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:49.880]   People are working from home, they're not going back,
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:52.160]   it's not going back to the before times.
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:56.400]   And if you look and sound better in a meeting,
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.760]   it changes the level of authority you have.
[01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:01.440]   So for executives who are using these laptops,
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:04.440]   being able to open it up and look better
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:09.280]   is not just something that is just okay, isn't okay anymore.
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:11.400]   You know, for a lot of them. - Yeah.
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.320]   Well, pros, good news.
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:18.320]   You finally got some hardware worthy of the name from Apple.
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:23.240]   How do you like the black background keyboard, by the way?
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:25.920]   Some people are not liking that. - I have mixed feelings
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.160]   on it, like it looks really nice,
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:30.000]   but I do worry that for people with lower vision.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.920]   - Yeah, it's going to be a little bit less contrast.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:34.720]   - Harder to see, yeah. - Harder to pick out
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:35.760]   the individual characters.
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.520]   - The keycaps are lit though.
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:40.120]   I kind of like it. - Yeah, except for the touch ID.
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:43.640]   - Okay, there's a touch ID in the upper right hand corner.
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:45.320]   It just looks like a blank key.
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:47.560]   Look at the size of that escape key.
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:48.960]   God bless you.
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:52.600]   All the VIM users in the world are going, thank you Apple.
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:56.680]   - It's good. - Cool, it actually feels like
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.760]   they're being a little petulant, it's like fine.
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:02.520]   - Hey, we're not going to give you your damn escape key back.
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:03.920]   We're going to give you one so,
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.440]   it wasn't even a room for a one key
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.760]   because we made your escape key so big.
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:08.600]   (laughing)
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:10.600]   Now just, don't, you're using lowercase L,
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:13.440]   just like an old typewriter if you want to use the number one.
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:19.200]   - Great playback with ProRes, ProRes, Apple.
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:22.560]   Now really ProRes is finally,
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:25.400]   and the iPhone just came out, we'll talk about that.
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:27.080]   Apple's really does it. - And the two resolve too,
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:28.000]   not just Final Cut.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.440]   Like the VINCHI resolve is amazing.
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.280]   - Yeah. - The VM1.
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.520]   - Everybody's doubling data.
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:35.240]   I think this is, Alex, do you think ProRes is going to become,
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:37.520]   I mean, obviously it's still a proprietary format,
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:40.960]   but is it going to become the default format, Alex?
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.640]   - It's a pretty popular format right now.
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:44.480]   (laughing)
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:46.400]   Like it's like, you know, generally when we're working
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:47.760]   with folks and we say we want ProRes,
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.520]   that's what almost everybody that we work with wants.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:51.160]   At this point, it's ProRes or DNx,
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:53.440]   or the ones that we get the most.
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:57.640]   And so ProRes is probably one of the most popular
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:00.520]   formats already when it comes to post-production.
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:03.200]   And so I think that it's already doing well,
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:05.440]   but with an accelerator and the ability to do all of this,
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:07.800]   I think it's really for media professionals,
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.600]   it's going to be hard to, like especially if you're going
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:10.840]   on the road, if you're a reporter,
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:13.360]   or you're doing stuff for YouTube,
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:14.520]   or doing other things like that,
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.840]   and you're on the road a lot doing work,
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:18.160]   it's going to be really hard to buy anything
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.080]   other than this computer,
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:21.760]   because those render times that Renee is showing,
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.200]   other people are showing,
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:26.200]   that's not like just more convenient.
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:27.920]   This is like I gathered something,
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:30.120]   and especially now that I,
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:33.080]   you really could do news gathering with an iPhone
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:34.720]   and this computer,
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:36.640]   and really turn it around fast,
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:39.240]   where you're able to gather something in Apple ProRes
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.400]   on your phone with a great camera,
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:42.280]   put it on the computer,
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:44.880]   edit it down and export it really, really fast.
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.680]   And so I think the one soft point there
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:49.960]   is the amount of time it takes to get from the phone
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:50.800]   to the computer,
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:53.840]   which is the limitation of the lightning connection.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.600]   So I think that that's going to be something
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.080]   that as we move towards pro models,
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.160]   quote unquote, pro models of phones,
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.160]   I think that transport has to get a lot faster.
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:03.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.240]   There's no throttling in this, right?
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:11.440]   I mean, one of the problems with the 16 inch I9,
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:12.560]   as you may remember,
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.400]   the YouTuber who put it in a freezer,
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:17.280]   was that you just never,
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:20.200]   and I think it's true of all Intel laptops,
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:22.960]   you really never get to see the full benefit of that.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.560]   >> You don't see-- >> Intel changed their marketing
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:26.840]   definition to account for that.
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:28.960]   They changed what Turbo basically meant,
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:31.240]   what Intel computer to account for that.
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:33.160]   >> And I should, by the way, I should point out,
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:39.360]   I saw some early benchmarks from the Alder Lake,
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:43.640]   which is the next Intel mobile platform coming out next year.
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:48.440]   And I was surprised, I don't think it's time yet,
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:49.680]   WCC Tech had this,
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:53.840]   I don't think it's time yet to call it CCF Tech.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.440]   >> To call it for Apple that Intel,
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:58.320]   and this is good, by the way.
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.200]   Intel has said-- >> EME too.
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:01.440]   >> An AMD.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:03.960]   Okay, okay, what can we do here?
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.960]   And so that's pretty encouraging,
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:09.280]   the early benchmarks from WCCF Tech,
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:11.720]   for I don't know how they got all their benchmarks,
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:14.860]   and it is very early, but it looks pretty good.
[01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:17.080]   >> It does look good, the question--
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:18.280]   >> It's like the big difference with--
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:19.960]   >> Sorry, Andy, Alex, go ahead, Alex,
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:20.800]   and then we'll be-- >> All I was gonna say
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:22.320]   is that the hard part is, is that Intel,
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:27.320]   is in a mature platform, and Apple is in a new platform.
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.840]   And so it's one thing for the first,
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:32.520]   for Intel to keep up with the first update,
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:33.760]   the question really will be,
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:35.480]   and we won't know this for another year,
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.880]   can they keep up with update number,
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:39.240]   next fall and the fall after?
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:42.240]   2022, 2023 is where we're gonna see whether
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.240]   Apple can continue at this pace, if they do,
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.760]   then you have laptops that are faster than Enterprise.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:47.600]   >> Yeah.
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:49.800]   >> And the incentives are different too,
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:50.960]   like Intel and AMD,
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:52.600]   their bread and butter really is servers,
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:53.680]   that's where they make most of their money,
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:54.800]   their Enterprise clients,
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.800]   and they continually work to bring that,
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.040]   that's what pays for their technology,
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:59.480]   and they work to bring that down
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:01.280]   into smaller and smaller form factors,
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.040]   and they can't get into mobile,
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.320]   like that's just a brick wall for them,
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:06.320]   and laptops is iffy sometimes,
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:07.480]   where Apple is the opposite,
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:09.160]   like the iPhone is our bread and butter,
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:11.200]   they live in small thermal envelopes,
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:12.640]   and so scaling to them is like,
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.240]   oh, we have room to breathe now,
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.880]   and their question is, can they scale up to this,
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:19.440]   probably can't scale up to the server side,
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:22.280]   like Zions and big AMD Atholons, all those chips,
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.240]   maybe like who knows,
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:25.680]   but they're gonna live in laptops for a while,
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:27.120]   and it's gonna be desktops,
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.720]   it's gonna go back and forth, I think a lot,
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:32.200]   but I think laptops are gonna favor Apple for a while still.
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:33.520]   >> Except for gaming, right?
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:36.960]   Still not quite the gaming platform.
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:40.720]   >> I still think Apple has to build some kind of--
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:41.800]   >> Engine.
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:42.640]   >> Well, they have to,
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:43.560]   I don't think they could build an engine,
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:44.600]   I think they have to build a game,
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.520]   they put the money into it,
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.920]   like a hundred million dollars into a game
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:50.960]   that really takes full advantage of the platform,
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:53.320]   that is really competitive,
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.840]   I mean, they just have to put it all in,
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.760]   I think that Apple Arcade gives them the data
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:57.920]   that they probably need,
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.400]   and their understanding of the game industry
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:01.160]   to some degree to figure that out,
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:04.600]   but I think that some kind of big game
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:06.640]   that is heavily graphics,
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:10.560]   laden and really pushes beyond what,
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:13.040]   that what we've seen with other games,
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:15.560]   and then runs across, of course, all the platforms.
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:17.160]   I think it's something that is very hard to do,
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.800]   but I think that if Apple could crack that,
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.280]   if they started three years ago,
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:21.520]   we should see it any day now.
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:22.360]   >> It takes a while.
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:23.280]   >> I'll just paint studios,
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.280]   a fortune to port them,
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:25.120]   Microsoft would solve it,
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:26.040]   I don't think it has to,
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:27.680]   it has to be a fortune to port.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:29.400]   >> I think that the fundamental opportunity for Apple
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:30.880]   is to build something a little simpler,
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:33.440]   to be honest, I think that there's a market
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:35.920]   that's the casual game market is bigger than most
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.240]   of these other game markets,
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:38.800]   but I think that there are,
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.640]   one of the problems with a lot of these games is that
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:42.160]   you really have to play them a lot
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:44.120]   to get to understand what's going on,
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:46.360]   and so I think that--
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:47.880]   >> They're for serious games.
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:49.480]   >> But you only do that for the same reason
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:50.720]   you do it for video editors,
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:54.400]   because those people are influential to other people.
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:56.440]   You're right, it's a smaller market.
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:58.240]   >> But I think that you could build something that's--
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:00.800]   >> I mean, one of the reasons that we play,
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:02.920]   you know, we watch soccer, or we watch football,
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:04.800]   or we watch baseball is that those games are actually
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:08.120]   pretty simple to understand what's actually happening.
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:10.080]   We just don't see video games like that.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:11.440]   We know, not very many of them,
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:13.560]   that are really aggressive,
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:15.680]   and that aggressive as far as holographics look,
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:18.040]   as soon as they start getting aggressive with the graphics,
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:20.160]   what we end up with is a really complex game
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:21.920]   that you really have to be a gamer to understand.
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:23.520]   And I think that Apple has the opportunity
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:25.440]   to do something probably a little bit more straightforward.
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.280]   I don't know if they will,
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:28.600]   but I think that's where the soft point in the market is.
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:31.600]   >> Games like Final Fantasy with a low barrier to entry.
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:32.920]   There's games--
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:34.080]   >> That's still a gamers game.
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:36.600]   I mean, it's not a mass game.
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:39.520]   It's a mass gamers game, you know, Final Fantasy,
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.400]   but it's not like I think that, you know,
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:45.440]   something more arena-based would be better.
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:47.960]   >> So especially now that streaming platforms
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:49.680]   are becoming more serious,
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:51.960]   it's like, so long as Apple just aggressively
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.240]   make sure that whatever platform
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:54.680]   this is going to be streaming games,
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:56.560]   we will support it aggressively.
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:58.480]   They can solve all the problems that they're already having.
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:01.200]   I'm not sure if it's worthwhile for them to do
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:04.120]   all of the sweat equity that we require to turn the Mac
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:07.040]   into a desirable AAA game platform.
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:08.760]   I'm not even sure if they can at this point.
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.080]   >> Right.
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:12.800]   Give that, go to Amazon, give them a couple hundred million
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:16.120]   dollars to put new world on the Mac,
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.880]   and we'll be happy.
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:18.720]   But--
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:19.920]   >> Can I run crisis?
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:21.680]   (laughing)
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:24.640]   No one cares anymore, that's the good news.
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:25.480]   Let's take a break.
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:28.840]   I do want to talk about Monterey, iOS 15.1,
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:30.040]   SharePlays here.
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.800]   There's lots more to talk about.
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:34.520]   Renee Richie, Andy Inako, Alex Lindsey.
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:38.800]   The Mac Break Weekly team is in the house.
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:43.240]   Our show today brought to you by AT&T Active Armor.
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:46.000]   Man, we live on our phones these days, don't we?
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.120]   Whether it's live streaming content, you know?
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:52.640]   Catch, you could watch doing it on iPhone, you can.
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:55.920]   Catching up with family on weekly video calls,
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:58.640]   watching your favorite podcast.
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:00.160]   The last thing you want in the middle of all,
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:02.400]   that is a fraudulent phone call.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:06.720]   One of those car warranty ads, I don't need that.
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:11.440]   I don't, that's why thankfully AT&T
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.600]   makes customer security a priority
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:15.560]   and helps block those pesky calls.
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:19.720]   It's not complicated, it's AT&T Active Armor.
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:24.720]   24/7, proactive network security and fraud call blocking
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:29.160]   to help start threats at no extra charge, like that.
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.160]   Compatible devices service required,
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:36.160]   visit att.com/activearmour for details.
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:41.160]   Anything I should be aware of,
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:46.160]   I'm taking my shiny new MacBook to Mexico.
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:48.160]   I don't think power is an issue,
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:51.160]   but I'm gonna love that battery life.
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:54.160]   You need the magsafe if you wanna charge,
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:56.160]   like the quick charge, the cash charge.
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:58.160]   How do you like that, man?
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:03.160]   It's fine, I'm not as devout to magsafe as Alex says.
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:04.160]   I like to be able to plug into any port.
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:06.160]   - But you still can, I find that event.
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.160]   Yeah, I still can.
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:09.360]   And I like that I have magsafe as an option now too.
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:11.600]   It's great, charge is fast, it's really magnetic,
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.160]   like it's strong magnetic.
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.880]   And I would have preferred an ethernet
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:15.960]   on the power port.
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:16.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:18.360]   - But break block.
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:20.320]   But I don't know, is every time get what I want.
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:25.320]   - Well, Lisa saw that I have that little anchor dock
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:27.600]   with ethernet on it and she said,
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:30.760]   can I upgrade to Monterey on your dock?
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:33.440]   So it's faster and I said, yes, be my guest.
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:35.760]   So I think I might be buying a few more docks
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:39.080]   with ethernet ports on them to spread around the house.
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:44.080]   Monterey on our laptops was more than 12 gigabytes.
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:48.200]   Nice hefty download.
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:50.160]   We did wanna do it before we left the country.
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:51.640]   I mean, it's better to do it at home
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:54.120]   and try to do it on airport Wi-Fi.
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:54.960]   What do we know?
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:56.640]   - For some people would say wait 'til you came home, Leo.
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.640]   I mean, I think like, I'm not a good people.
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.040]   - Yeah, no, that's a good point.
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:02.160]   It's, wait a minute, now it's pretty reliable, right?
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:04.240]   - Those people are drips, don't listen to them.
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:08.480]   - Totally, but I mean, like still, like if by chance,
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:10.120]   like there was anything that just wasn't compatible,
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:11.600]   you didn't check for it right away.
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:13.200]   - Oh, good.
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:16.520]   Same thing with iOS 15.1, even the watch got updated.
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:17.360]   I'm--
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.200]   - Like if you're hassle-blending--
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:19.040]   - Living on the edge.
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:19.880]   - With it all of a sudden or something.
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:22.280]   - Yeah, living on the edge, that would be bad.
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:27.600]   Monterey does not, besides wallpaper,
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:30.160]   does not seem dramatically different.
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:32.800]   Some of the features that would have made a difference,
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:36.600]   the ability to control every Apple device,
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:38.720]   you know, with the keyboard and mouse,
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.040]   would have been nice.
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.480]   Shareplay is in there, but I don't, I mean, for me,
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:45.040]   I don't know, some people, I guess if you're a grandparent
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:47.920]   that FaceTiming a kid and watching Phineas and for--
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:48.760]   - To get--
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:52.120]   - Leo, tech support, like our lives are gonna be so much,
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:54.840]   like just, well I guess it's not a big deal on macOS.
[01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:55.680]   You're gonna go back to us now,
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:58.360]   but just in general, like being able to share play
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:00.560]   your family through tech support stuff to me
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:02.000]   is gonna save no less trips.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.560]   - Oh, so it doesn't just have to be Netflix,
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:04.880]   you could do it with the--
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:07.200]   - Actually not Netflix, I think Netflix is the only thing--
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:08.360]   - Well it doesn't work with Netflix,
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:09.200]   it doesn't work with that.
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.840]   - And some are coming later, like Disney Plus
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:12.480]   is coming later and some of the other stuff's coming later,
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:13.960]   but also like just sharing photo, like you can do,
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:15.720]   like remember when you came home from a trip
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:16.920]   and you could show everyone your slides?
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:20.120]   - Oh, you could pour them remotely now.
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:20.960]   - That's exciting.
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:23.640]   - Yeah, I think that, I think it's gonna be hard running,
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:25.920]   I'm hoping that it's the first step down this path
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:28.000]   and not the final step because it's,
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.400]   I feel like it's such a lost opportunity
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:33.520]   to really scale that up a little bit.
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:34.960]   I think that we can share play it,
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:37.040]   but one of the things that would be really interesting
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:40.440]   is a much larger experience than 32 people.
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.800]   I think about a lot of things that would be fun
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.800]   to be able to basically do that.
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.040]   And it might have to be a little bit more closed down,
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:49.200]   but you should be able to just subscribe and say,
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.040]   "I wanna watch it."
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:52.560]   We all wanna watch at the same time
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:55.600]   and let a thousand people watch it together,
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.200]   watch something together.
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:59.160]   And I think that those things would get,
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.320]   I think those actually would be easier to do in some ways
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:04.640]   because you could have real movie premieres
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:06.120]   that everyone's watching at the same time,
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:07.560]   they're tweeting, people are following.
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:09.840]   There's a whole bunch of things that could happen.
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:11.960]   Lining people back up again time-wise
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:15.280]   could be really, really interesting from acceptance.
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.680]   I think getting, watching this with my friends
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:19.480]   when the audio goes down on people talk
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:21.960]   is probably something I will almost never do.
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:23.280]   - Yeah.
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:25.360]   - But the question, but the question you could say to them,
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:26.480]   what did you just say?
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.360]   Why did you just say, "Who's that?"
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.280]   - I know, that's exactly why I won't do it.
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:31.560]   I have enough trouble with that,
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:33.680]   I'm like, "How's it right now?"
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:35.040]   - It's gonna be terrible in one way
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:37.480]   because it is so, like the latency is really good,
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:39.800]   the responsiveness, they automatically duck audio
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:41.360]   if you start talking.
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:42.200]   - That's a fucking route, like that's bad.
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.760]   - And also, like anybody who can control it.
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:44.600]   - No.
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:45.600]   - So, like it's gonna be,
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:47.160]   but that's what happens to be in the living room now,
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:48.760]   like especially when you have the extended family over,
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:50.360]   it's like, "Why are you talking over everything?
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:52.120]   Who's got the remote? Why are you doing that?"
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.440]   And now that's gonna happen every time we watch.
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:56.960]   - You're so funny, you're like me, Renee.
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:59.840]   I'm sitting, I'm watching the movie, I'm paying attention.
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:01.880]   Then all of a sudden, I hear TikTok audio
[01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:03.800]   coming from Lisa's iPhone.
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:05.120]   She's called it a flute.
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.240]   - The funny thing is like, my God kids will actually ask
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:08.200]   to have the subtitles put on
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:10.720]   because they can't stand us talking over the TV.
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:12.600]   - Stop talking, I'm watching.
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:13.440]   - Yeah.
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:14.600]   - Yeah, so, yeah.
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:16.600]   - I'm more like you in that respect.
[01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:18.840]   - There's a huge opportunity because we have all these,
[01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:20.120]   the reason that I'm really interested in it
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:21.400]   is we have all these copyright issues,
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:23.760]   we can't stream a movie, right?
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:26.640]   And I'll talk about it and have a discussion or whatever.
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:29.520]   Maybe either even before or after or middle.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:32.080]   So the ability to cue everybody is something
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:33.960]   that would be uniquely something that Apple TV
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:36.520]   could do across the entire system of saying,
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:38.400]   "We all wanna watch something at the same time."
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.000]   And the thing that could be kind of interesting
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.480]   is that could be a director's commentary during it
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:47.480]   that's alive while you're watching it if you're all timed.
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:51.320]   Or just people being able to tweet back and forth
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:53.080]   while they're watching a premiere
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:55.240]   or text back and forth while they're doing it.
[01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:58.000]   It doesn't have to be them all being able to talk to each other.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.720]   And I just think that you'd end up with more people
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:01.200]   actually using it than what it is here
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:03.640]   because the way it's implemented as we said before is,
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:05.880]   I'm like, I don't think I'd wanna watch it that way.
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:08.040]   And then you have to tie everybody in.
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:09.960]   I think that it's gonna be a,
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:11.080]   it's a really difficult thing.
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:13.200]   And in general, FaceTime is not,
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.160]   I mean, I love FaceTime audio, which I use all the time,
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:18.480]   but the FaceTime interface and process for video
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:20.360]   is not something that I love Apple,
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:22.040]   but not that part.
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:24.480]   - But it's a great resource.
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:27.320]   It's one of those great features where you put it out there
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:28.960]   and see how people take advantage of it.
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:30.440]   'Cause this is, as Renee said,
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:34.200]   well, the first thing I think I thought of was not necessarily
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:37.560]   fly by wire, helping my family and friends
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:40.520]   through tech support, but that's something you can do with it.
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:43.560]   And also, I like your suggestion of having like a communal
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:45.920]   watch event, even if it's not like,
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:48.520]   even if it's just like everybody is watching at the same time.
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:51.600]   So they're still commenting live via Twitter.
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:53.240]   They're still commenting, whatever.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:57.200]   But that's probably something that's best left for a third party.
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:58.920]   It's probably not an OS level sort of thing.
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:00.640]   - But the thing is, is that the problem is,
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:01.760]   if you leave it to a third party,
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:05.120]   you can't get to the shows because of the copyright issues.
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:08.000]   And so what you wanna do is you wanna have that something
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.520]   that's accessible by HBO Max.
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:14.000]   Like if we did that or Justine did this
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.960]   or Marquez Brownling did this or Renee did this or Andy,
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:20.440]   if any one of us did this at different levels,
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:23.160]   we'd end up with hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:26.360]   of people wanting to watch it all at the same time.
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:28.800]   And then suddenly everybody would be using that product.
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:32.320]   And I think that, but I just think they'd be really interesting
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:35.640]   and it has to be done at the OS level, in TVOS level,
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:38.440]   to make that actually work because then any app that's inside
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:42.480]   of it could then be queued to start at a certain time.
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:46.040]   - I hear you, but if Apple's gonna take on the responsibility
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:50.080]   of coordinating and serving that kind of data for free,
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:53.080]   and I acknowledge that it's not about serving necessarily
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:54.920]   serving the streams themselves that could be
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:56.680]   just doing synchronization data.
[01:22:56.680 --> 01:23:00.560]   But if they're gonna bring us messages for Android,
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.240]   like that's usually the reason why,
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:04.560]   in addition to anti-competitive reasons,
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:08.760]   the reason why Apple is given a pass for not supporting,
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:10.760]   not porting messages to Android,
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:13.800]   because then they'll also have to support all the traffic
[01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:16.240]   and someone really has to kind of pay for that.
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:20.360]   - I don't know, a million people watching something.
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:22.400]   A million people watching it wouldn't be a big traffic thing
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:23.440]   for Apple though.
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:26.120]   You know, 'cause it's just queued, it's not a live stream.
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:29.280]   - It says the person doesn't have to pay for it
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:30.360]   at Apple, it's like--
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:33.120]   - Well, no, no, but I mean, I understand your knowledge.
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:35.600]   I'm just saying that I'm not sure that it would be
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:38.560]   a perfect thing for Apple to try to attempt.
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.120]   - Well, they're already, I mean, you're already down,
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:41.480]   it's not like it's streaming live.
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:43.240]   It's not a live stream off of Akamai.
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:46.000]   This is a, you know, basically you're queuing everybody up
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.160]   to start watching it the way they,
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:52.160]   if they were all watching the thing of foundation or whatever.
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:53.440]   The big thing it would do is,
[01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:54.960]   and of course I don't think Apple would do anything
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:57.000]   with Android because I think that this would,
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.280]   this would have a lot of people want to get an Apple TV.
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:02.720]   If the Apple TV support, if all the Apple devices did this,
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:05.200]   it would be, you know, and you started having the director
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:08.600]   of Dune, you know, is going to be on there right afterwards
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:10.720]   to talk about it or we can tweet, you know,
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:13.600]   whatever that is, there'd be an incredible amount
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:17.480]   of pressure in some cases to, you know, jump in
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:19.400]   and buy hardware.
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:22.080]   - So, you know, because I think that, so.
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:25.080]   - Renee, you talked about the spatial audio sounding good.
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:28.200]   How does the voice isolation sound?
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:29.200]   Does that work okay?
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:31.000]   Have you tried that?
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.200]   - Yeah, I mean, that's more, as far as I understand it,
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:36.120]   that's, those are like the inverse features of the AirPods.
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:37.800]   Like the AirPods have noise canceling
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:39.800]   and they have transparency mode.
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:41.320]   And what this does is either let,
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:43.440]   like you want to share the party with everybody.
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:45.320]   So, we want to make sure you don't miss like everyone
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:46.160]   in the room.
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:47.920]   This will let it really get like wide audio.
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:50.000]   And then if you want to isolate on just you,
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.600]   it'll cancel out as much of the background as possible.
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:54.760]   It's hard for me to test because I don't know what it sounds
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:56.920]   like to other side and I'm not talking to people who are.
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:57.760]   - Right.
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:58.600]   - Right.
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:00.080]   - That tuned into it.
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:00.920]   - Right.
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:03.440]   - But it radically cuts down the noise at least.
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:06.080]   - We don't use FaceTime on our show, so I guess we won't know.
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:09.400]   But that's a nice feature of other products
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:12.200]   and I think it could be Apple could probably do it very well.
[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:16.040]   Another controversial feature, Safari,
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:18.320]   they kind of backed down on a lot of the Safari changes,
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:20.200]   didn't they or no?
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:22.080]   - Yeah, they, well they gave you an option.
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:23.840]   So right now you have, in the latest versions,
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:24.680]   you have two options.
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:27.560]   One is basically as shown at WWDC
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:29.520]   where they have that new compact layout
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:32.000]   and your tabs are indistinguishable from a dress bars.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.800]   And basically everything that some people like cosmetically,
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:37.480]   but I really do not like functionally.
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:38.720]   And then you have the other option,
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:40.680]   which is to go back to the previous version of Safari,
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:44.000]   basically, where the tabs look like blessed tabs.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.160]   - Is the compact tab bar the default?
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:47.960]   Am I gonna wanna go immediately?
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:50.120]   - I don't know because I switched to me.
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:50.960]   - Yeah.
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:51.800]   - It would turn it off right away.
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:52.920]   - I don't know what they're gonna ship with.
[01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:53.760]   - Yeah.
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:54.840]   - So I'll let you know.
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:56.080]   - Hopefully you'll preserve your settings.
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:57.080]   Like I don't want to,
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:58.280]   nobody should be surprised by that.
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:25:59.120]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:02.160]   - But what a great illustration of the problems of innovation
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:05.840]   that sometimes, I get, I and a lot of other people
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:07.600]   give Apple crap for saying,
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:08.760]   "Hey, at least give us options."
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:11.000]   But I wonder if we would have found out
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.120]   that this menu bar change was actually better,
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:18.160]   if they simply said, "No, you don't get an option.
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:19.640]   "You can't turn it off if you want."
[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:23.160]   Because you see it, it doesn't work for you
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:24.720]   for the first 10 or 15 minutes.
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:28.080]   You turn it off and then you never think about it again.
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:29.080]   - No, I do think so.
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:30.440]   - I do think it's the wrong choice.
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:31.600]   - Because it's semantic.
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:33.280]   - You wanna make a semantic distinction
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:35.320]   between controls that are part of the software
[01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:37.360]   using controls that are part of the web page.
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:39.560]   And what this does is it blends the two together.
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:41.480]   So you just don't know,
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:43.480]   it's, if you look at it right now,
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:44.400]   John, show my screen.
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:46.000]   If you look at it right now,
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.480]   the idea is that this heaps and wood screen
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:53.400]   is the look and feel is spread throughout.
[01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:56.120]   You kinda know that these tabs are not part of it,
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:57.720]   but that's not always the case.
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:59.200]   - But if you have two tabs, hold on.
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:00.760]   I can't tell what the active tab is still.
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:02.720]   I've been using it for three months
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:03.800]   and I still can't tell the active,
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:04.960]   and it's still all the time.
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:06.440]   I think it's a fun tab and type.
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:09.480]   - It's a fundamental flaw because we do need to make
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:11.880]   the distinction between controls that are part of the
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:13.760]   browser and the website.
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:15.960]   And so I think, you know, that's the--
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:17.960]   - No, no, I'm 100% with you.
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:20.720]   Also the web browser, it's an app canvas.
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:22.200]   It's not a web browser at this point.
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:23.040]   - That's exactly right.
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:24.200]   - You're absolutely right.
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:27.400]   But what makes me think sometimes is that,
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:28.760]   let's say that-- - Oh, I understand.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:31.120]   - No, I'm saying that-- - Giving people a choice.
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:31.960]   - Right, I understand.
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:33.640]   - Well, at the very beginning,
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:35.560]   that when they designed them,
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:36.960]   Matthew said, "No, we're not even gonna give you
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:38.360]   "a control keys or function keys."
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:39.200]   - Right.
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:40.160]   - 'Cause if we put function keys to the keyboard,
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:41.400]   then programmers would say,
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:43.680]   "We're not gonna bother to learn how to program for a mouse.
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:45.040]   "Users would say, "We're not even gonna bother
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:46.160]   "to learn how to use a mouse.
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:49.200]   "We're gonna go with control slash whatever
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:50.680]   "to both face something."
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:54.160]   It's just, it's as much crap as I and other people
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:55.920]   sometimes give Apple for, you know,
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:59.000]   making, not giving people options for change.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.760]   Sometimes it's like, "Well, at least give it a chance."
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:05.120]   Before we retreat with our tail tuck
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:06.840]   between our legs, but at least, you know,
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:08.840]   allow us to abuse our market ability
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:10.200]   to at least get you thinking about,
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:12.600]   maybe this is a better way to doing things.
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:13.440]   - So-- - I think they panic.
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:14.920]   Like, I think they legitimately panicked
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:16.560]   and thought they were gonna lose a lot of users
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:19.400]   if they shipped it with that as the new default.
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:20.960]   Like, my understanding is that there were two camps
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:23.200]   when people, like, H.I. proposed this idea
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:24.040]   and there were some people like,
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:27.000]   "Yes, like the browser market is ripe for innovation."
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.520]   And other people are like, "It is absolutely,
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:32.200]   "but it can't violate every law in our own human interface
[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:33.600]   "kyline while you're innovating.
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:34.760]   "You gotta innovate forward,
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:37.400]   "not innovate, like Safari's whole motto,
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:38.640]   "with zero regression."
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:41.320]   And then my guess is they saw the pushback
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:43.640]   and the executives at Apple do like to test the beta
[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:46.480]   as somebody called and said, "Where are my tabs?"
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:47.320]   And they said, "Well, sir,
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:49.360]   "why aren't you on a plane yet?"
[01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:50.960]   (laughing)
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:52.480]   - So I-- - You've got to think about that.
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:55.000]   - I'm using Firefox on Linux right now,
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.600]   but if I hit F11, I can expose all the Firefox controls.
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:01.440]   And if I hit it again, I can go full screen.
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:03.360]   Now, this is what Apple's kind of offering you
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:06.960]   is this idea that the web page is all.
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:09.280]   And I think this is a better way of doing it.
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:12.520]   So if I want the very clearly different controls
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:14.400]   from the browser, I can have them.
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:15.600]   But when I'm showing you the page,
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:16.440]   I don't wanna see them anyway.
[01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:17.760]   - You can't look through tabs.
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:20.000]   - Focus is here.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000]   First thing Lisa said is, "What the hell is this?"
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:22.920]   And I don't wanna.
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:25.360]   (laughing)
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.720]   - She'd probably like it actually.
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:28.560]   - I said it's the same as on your phone.
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:31.160]   And so maybe that helps, I guess.
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:32.760]   - Well, it's gonna be like, there's gonna be people,
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:34.640]   like there are certain people who like to do apps.
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:36.520]   They like lists, they like being organized.
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:37.600]   And they're gonna love the ability
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:38.720]   to have all these different modes
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:40.440]   with different homes, greens, different apps,
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:42.120]   different people that can contact us.
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:43.320]   I know some people who are like,
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:44.560]   "I hate people in my family.
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:45.880]   "I don't want them to know that."
[01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:47.440]   But I made a whole mode just called,
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:50.000]   like it was a bad family.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.040]   And they just can't get through to me on a daily basis.
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:54.640]   Which I'm not supporting, but I'm saying I understand.
[01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:55.480]   (laughing)
[01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:56.440]   And then you're gonna have people like me
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:59.000]   who are like, "These are basically gym memberships.
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.880]   "You feel good about yourself because you have them,
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:02.400]   "but there's so much to set up
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:04.440]   "and so much to manage, they become an extra job.
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:06.120]   "And I already feel like I have too many jobs.
[01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:07.920]   "So I'm okay with like binary to secure."
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:09.280]   - Yeah, I like to do not disturb.
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:10.440]   - I just turn on, do not disturb.
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:11.920]   And I do like D&D.
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:13.400]   I think that's really nice to have.
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:15.080]   This is just like on the phone.
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:17.760]   So if you've used iOS 15, you're familiar with it.
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:21.400]   You can have different kinds of focus modes.
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:24.920]   You can have them, I presume, tied to time of day,
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:27.000]   or what you're doing and that kind of things,
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.360]   where you are, so forth.
[01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:33.520]   - So I think my notifications are all set too.
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:35.160]   They can happen any time between nine,
[01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:36.480]   59 and 10 o'clock at night.
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:37.320]   - Yes, me too.
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:38.320]   (laughing)
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:39.720]   - No, my notifications are--
[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:40.560]   - Me too.
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:43.000]   - If I'm actually up, I feel like the computer's like,
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.440]   "Oh my gosh, I don't tell you."
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:46.920]   We're like, "Look how all these things happen today."
[01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:49.360]   And I always know when it's time to get out of bed
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:51.480]   because my phone starts honking at me
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:54.200]   all the notifications for the night have come in.
[01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:57.160]   - Alex, just a question that I'm entering
[01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:58.000]   without judgment.
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.640]   Like if part of the house were on fire,
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:02.040]   would your wife decide, "You know what?
[01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:04.080]   I need to go into the office hours livestream
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:05.520]   in order to make sure he knows
[01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:07.800]   that the house is on fire."
[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:10.320]   - The house on fire is really the only thing
[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:11.200]   that I'm okay with.
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:12.800]   You know, like, usually you're like a bit--
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:14.160]   - There's a feature for that.
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:18.400]   Because you can now turn on status in messages.
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:21.680]   So it'll say, "Alex has his notifications silenced."
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:24.440]   And there is a way for truly urgent messages
[01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:26.960]   to get through that, just as there is on the phone.
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:29.040]   - You could turn that off too, if you want.
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:30.640]   - My phone is a little bit more,
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.520]   like if you're a contact, you can usually,
[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.680]   at least it'll, at least see your name pop up.
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:36.360]   If you're not contact, I don't see it at all.
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:37.680]   I don't even know what you call them.
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:42.680]   But if the, but my mom and my wife and my kids can,
[01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:45.800]   they have a pretty direct route to me.
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:46.920]   But that's about it.
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:48.880]   - Yeah, so the kind of cool thing is,
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:51.480]   so I can see on my phone that I'm in work mode.
[01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:54.000]   I have a little work notification popped up
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.400]   'cause that's the work focus.
[01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:58.720]   Now that will automatically right Renee go to all my devices,
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:00.320]   including my Mac.
[01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:02.240]   So everything will be in work mode,
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:04.240]   which may or may not be your desired effect,
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:07.360]   but that's the idea.
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:09.160]   If you're in work mode, you're in whatever.
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:10.840]   - It's an ecosystem. - It's an ecosystem.
[01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:11.680]   - Yeah.
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:12.840]   - Quick notes is here.
[01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:16.120]   We've had it on the iPad and the, I've loved it.
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:17.920]   It's now here on the Mac as well.
[01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:20.680]   How do you, I tried dragging up from the left screen
[01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:22.600]   and I realized, oh, it's not a touch device.
[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:24.680]   How do you activate?
[01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:26.040]   - My pencil doesn't work on it either.
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:28.160]   - When I tried, yeah, I tried and I tried and I thought,
[01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:31.320]   oh crap, it's not like a pencil feature.
[01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:32.760]   Like it's just so organic to pencil,
[01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:33.880]   but I'm like, I like it, it's there.
[01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:37.040]   Like I almost do all my note taking on the iPad now
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:38.560]   because it's just so organic with the pencil
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:39.600]   and typing and everything.
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:40.840]   But then I like that it's on the iPhone
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:42.880]   so I can quickly triage things on the go.
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:44.040]   And then I like that it's on the Mac
[01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:46.280]   because the Mac is still best for mass data entry.
[01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:47.680]   So if I have to sit there and take a ton of notes,
[01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:49.480]   I'm still gonna wanna do that on a Mac.
[01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:51.920]   There's a hot corner, like the bottom right is a hot corner.
[01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:53.240]   So you can remove the mouse down there.
[01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:55.240]   - You can see a little edge. - But you have to turn that
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:56.440]   to pops up. - Looks like you have to turn that on.
[01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:57.880]   It's not on by default.
[01:32:57.880 --> 01:32:59.320]   Mine just showed up, but I don't know.
[01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:00.800]   - Okay. - Mine started working.
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:04.200]   - Okay, so I'll look at my hot corners.
[01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:06.760]   And what's nice is they're attached to the app that you use.
[01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:09.240]   So they're, that's kind of cool.
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:11.200]   - For as long as apples around our notes will persist.
[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:13.360]   - As long as apples interested in making notes,
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:14.680]   our notes will persist.
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:16.960]   - They spend, I think that they,
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:18.720]   they spend a lot of effort on notes.
[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:20.880]   You know, like it's constantly progressing.
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:23.360]   It's not a, it's a pretty powerful app
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:24.440]   that's kind of just hidden in there.
[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:26.160]   I use it all day every day.
[01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:28.920]   So it's like, where I literally write my articles and notes
[01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:31.200]   because it means that any device that I have have,
[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:33.880]   you know, stuff in it and I'm cutting and pasting stuff to it
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:35.680]   and I have folders and process.
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:37.520]   And so when you start actually taking advantage of notes,
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:39.960]   there's an enormous amount of tools.
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:40.800]   They're in it.
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:43.600]   My biggest complaint is mostly that I can't draw
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:44.960]   over top of text.
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:46.960]   It's modal. - I can now.
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:47.800]   - On your iPad.
[01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:50.080]   Can you? 'Cause I couldn't, I thought I tested it
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:51.840]   at least at least. - I think that's one of the new features.
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:53.840]   - Okay, that, I'm not to try it.
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:54.680]   - Yeah, try that.
[01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:57.480]   'Cause that's been my number one thing when notes is just that
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:59.720]   I start typing something and I want them to live in the same,
[01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:03.480]   I want my drawing on the iPad to be in the same place
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:05.960]   as my text, not in a window above the law.
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:07.240]   - I want my text mode.
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:09.080]   - I don't like being able to press a button and get plain text.
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:14.080]   - Frederico Vitici in his review of shortcuts on Mac Stories
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:17.200]   says it's still rough around the edges.
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:18.240]   But that's interesting.
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:19.880]   I think that's kind of common.
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:23.960]   - I mean, rough around the edges is common for the .1.2 release
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:25.440]   of a new OS.
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:28.640]   Apple, I feel like Apple never gets into it stride until,
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:31.520]   this is why I tend to be very slow about the upgrades,
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:33.400]   is that I feel like Apple gets into it stride
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:35.640]   around February, 'cause that's when they stop thinking about
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:37.640]   and they're thinking about the next thing.
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:39.360]   So like February they're like, okay, we're done with that one.
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:41.960]   Now they're now completely thinking about the next version.
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:43.760]   We're not gonna add anything to this one yet.
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:44.760]   - We're done.
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:46.400]   Universal control's still not here.
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:47.360]   They have to add that.
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:49.840]   Do we have any idea that they tell you Renee?
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:52.520]   - Later this year, later this year is all they were saying.
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:54.920]   - It says available later this fall.
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:56.440]   - That was fall, okay.
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:58.960]   - That goes through December 21st of December.
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:00.440]   - Yeah, right.
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:02.240]   - Now is that all devices?
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:03.400]   Like if you had like three Macs,
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:06.640]   could you run it across the mall or is it just the--
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:08.400]   - Yeah, as long as you have more than one Mac.
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:12.880]   - It's a single keyboard and mouse or trackpad.
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:15.120]   Now we're seeinglessly between your Mac and iPad.
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:17.920]   They'll even connect to more than one Mac or iPad.
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:19.560]   Move your cursor from your Mac to your iPad.
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:20.400]   - One Mac.
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:22.640]   - You can't do just iPad and you can't start with an iPad.
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:23.640]   It has to start with a Mac.
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:25.760]   So the Mac is like the control hub
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:27.320]   and then you can add one or two other Macs,
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:28.160]   one or two other iPad.
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:29.000]   - The console.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:29.840]   - One Mac and one iPad.
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:30.680]   - That's pretty cool.
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:35.120]   My situation is I have four Macs in my office
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:36.640]   and I kind of do want to just go over it
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:38.640]   and I've been thinking about getting synergy for it.
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:40.000]   But I kept on feeling like,
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.600]   well, if this is really gonna work across all of them,
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:42.600]   I might just wait.
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:43.440]   - Yeah.
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:45.080]   - That was a big disappointment for me.
[01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:47.600]   That's why I didn't rush to upgrade just yet.
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:49.320]   I'm gonna do it like after this show.
[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:54.320]   But like that, I actually already have like an iPad Pro stand
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:56.160]   like on my desk waiting for it
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:58.720]   because I do anticipate that being like a game changer.
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:02.640]   It was actually one of the reasons why I bought the,
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:05.880]   I paid extra money for a big iPad Pro to begin with.
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:09.000]   I don't think that that feature hadn't been announced yet
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.640]   but the idea of using this as a complimentary display
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:14.360]   for my Mac seem like it would make perfect sense
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:16.320]   particularly given the quality of the display.
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:19.240]   So yeah, that's the one feature that I'm hoping
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.480]   that Apple really delivers on
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:23.080]   'cause that could be, I wouldn't say a game changer
[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:25.400]   but that is one of the things,
[01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:27.320]   one of the reasons why you buy Apple products
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:29.600]   and why sometimes you buy Apple products
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:31.960]   even when they're competing products by other makers.
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:34.320]   It's like, I know that this is gonna cost a lot of money
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:37.720]   for this iPad but I know that the value is going to increase
[01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:40.920]   as Apple continues to come up with new ways
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:43.160]   to integrate it with other stuff that I'm using.
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:45.280]   - If you have good speakers on your Mac,
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:47.080]   you might be glad to know you can use your Mac now
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:51.280]   as an AirPlay speaker or you can AirPlay content
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:53.240]   to your Mac's, your Mac is just like a TV.
[01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:56.200]   - You just imagine, like you have your new MacBook Pro
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:59.720]   with its XDR display and then right next to that
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:03.120]   over control or over Sidecar,
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:06.080]   you have your iPad Pro with an XDR display
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:08.520]   and now all of a sudden we've got commercialized
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:12.360]   pro level color grading and pipeline work and everything
[01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:14.160]   just sitting there on your travel table.
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:16.720]   - Yeah, that's cool.
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:19.440]   Live text and photos, that's neat.
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:22.400]   So even photos I've taken in the past,
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:26.560]   I can now interact with the text in the photo, click links.
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:27.920]   - And all those image layer PDFs,
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:29.160]   like the PDFs where they were too lazy
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:30.560]   to use an actual text layer which is
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:31.400]   - Oh, I love that.
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:33.360]   - can scan the document, all of that text is unlocked
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:35.400]   without you paying a fortune for no CR app
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:36.840]   and running it through and wasting all your time.
[01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:38.200]   - Nice.
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:41.480]   I hope that we do start seeing some shortcuts
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:43.280]   stuff happening by the way.
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:44.120]   - Absolutely.
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:46.440]   - So this integration with a number of apps,
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:49.800]   Vitechi has 27 apps that are already shortcut enabled
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:51.640]   on the Mac, so that's good.
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:52.480]   That's good.
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:54.720]   - Every time we talk about shortcuts,
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:57.720]   I just wanna say all I want is shortcuts with nodes.
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:59.320]   You know that you can just sit there and I want this all.
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:00.160]   I want all these things.
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:01.600]   I just wanna tie all these things together
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:03.000]   and just build a nodal infrastructure
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:03.840]   of what that looked like.
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:05.520]   - There's no reason somebody couldn't write that
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:07.080]   as a third party app, I think.
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:07.920]   - Yeah.
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:10.800]   - It could, it just would be harder.
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:12.640]   I mean, you like to do, I mean, you could do it with shortcuts.
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:15.400]   What I want is really something that sits between shortcuts
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:19.160]   and Swift, you know, where you're basically programming
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:22.280]   and you can make it an app and you could really turn it
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:23.120]   into something.
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:24.520]   I think that there's a huge opportunity for people
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:26.880]   to solve problems without having to write code.
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:29.840]   - I was gonna say that was one of the big evolutions
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:33.560]   of AppleScript where they basically allowed you to use
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:36.600]   Xcode interface tools to interface builder
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:40.640]   to create interfaces and then wire it into your Apple scripts
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:44.800]   that if, also 'cause the shortcuts are a wonderful
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:46.480]   gateway drug to programming.
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:49.960]   And the exact right way to get someone introduced
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:52.760]   to programming is not, oh, well, here is this wonderful,
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:56.880]   wonderful 18 part course in how to do Fortran.
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:38:59.520]   It's all about what do you, I really wish there were
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:00.680]   a simpler way to do this.
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:03.080]   Oh wait, I've been meaning to try out shortcuts.
[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:05.920]   Hey look, I've done this really simple thing that fixes it
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:08.800]   and then two months later, you've made it so complicated,
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:11.720]   gloriously complicated that it's collapsed 25 minutes
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:13.480]   with the work into one button press.
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:17.360]   And now the ability to simply feed that shortcut
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:20.000]   with fields, with pop-ups, with a modern interface
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.560]   would just absolutely turn people into commercial developers
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:26.440]   and really make great stuff for companies,
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:28.000]   great works for communities.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.880]   - And I think from a monetary perspective,
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:33.680]   from a market perspective, you could have the ability
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:36.400]   to compile all these things into an app that you could sell
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:38.440]   in the app store with a nodal compositor
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:41.040]   that's really building, you're really programming an app.
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:42.200]   You know, like this is what it is.
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:44.000]   - It's kind of a playground that's doing, right?
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.360]   - Kind of, but being able to have, but playgrounds again
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:47.720]   is still like too much typing.
[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:50.400]   You know, the thing is is that they're typing
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:54.200]   the shortcuts into Swift and that's not necessarily
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:55.440]   necessary.
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:58.360]   - Well, yeah, I mean, the thing is you could be typing,
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:00.800]   you could be building a nodal, we did this back
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:03.440]   in shape days, you would build a whole bunch of things
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:05.040]   and you basically, and even with motion,
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:07.440]   you build something really complex, then you say,
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:09.880]   "These are the attributes I'm going to expose
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:11.760]   "to the user to use, these are the dials
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:13.120]   "or whatever I want to put in there."
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:14.960]   And then you compile it into one thing.
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:17.600]   And that could be something that you could turn into an app
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:19.320]   and then literally sell it on the app store.
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:21.120]   Now on the other end of that, you could have people
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:23.880]   developing nodes that you could use.
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:25.400]   You could buy those nodes, you know,
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:27.880]   and put them into your apps and so on and so forth.
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:29.960]   And so there's a lot of places that you could, you know,
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:32.440]   let people really, 'cause there's a lot of people
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:35.920]   that have ideas that aren't programmers,
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:39.080]   but could think logically and shortcuts is a great
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:41.080]   can't wait of that, but there's a huge gap
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:44.000]   between shortcuts and Swift and that gap could be filled
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:47.400]   by something that's like a visual programmer,
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:49.040]   programming interface.
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:52.440]   New globe, Apple has Sherlocked Replocal.
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:57.720]   You have a globe, okay, new transit features,
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:01.160]   new map features, privacy, blah, blah, blah,
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:04.760]   iCloud plus, wait a minute, we didn't have that before?
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:07.200]   We had that before, right?
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:08.040]   Or maybe not?
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:09.960]   Plus technology, yeah.
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:11.080]   iCloud private relay,
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:13.000]   - High-Destry brand. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:18.240]   But I think we had that already and so much more,
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:19.200]   so much more.
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:20.800]   - Basically, you used to pay for extra storage,
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:22.520]   like you had iCloud and you could pay for extra storage.
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:23.760]   Now when you play for extra storage,
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:25.600]   you also get private relay and the other features
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:27.400]   and they just bundled that together as iCloud.
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:29.360]   - Yeah, but that's not new with your own array.
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:31.280]   Haven't I had that all along or?
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:32.640]   - Private relay is new with Monterey.
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:34.240]   - Oh, it is, okay, oh good.
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:35.840]   - Yeah, I was like getting it on iOS?
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:36.680]   - That's where the user goes.
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:37.520]   - That's where the user goes.
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:38.360]   - The intermediary servers, yes.
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:39.920]   - I was, okay, so this is the first one.
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:41.880]   - Well, I would know iOS 15, it's new this year,
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:44.200]   like private relay announced at a WWDC of this year.
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:47.640]   - Right, and now it's available on the desktop
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:50.320]   as well as on mobile, okay.
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:52.040]   - That's their answer to app tracking transparency
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:53.960]   for the internet because app transparency is bound
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:55.440]   to your device and to the apps,
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:56.920]   but they can still follow you around the internet
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:58.520]   and this is like, well I would rather you don't follow me
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:00.400]   around the internet, either, thank you.
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:03.600]   - Right, so turn that on, I guess,
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:08.360]   in your settings, I'm sure it's not on by default
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:10.000]   or is it, maybe it is.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.880]   - But if you turn it on, Mark might change
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:13.960]   the name of Facebook, so just think about the consequences.
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:16.040]   - That's gonna happen whether you turn it on or not,
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:17.560]   I'm sorry.
[01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:20.960]   There was a, we read it on Twitter on Sunday,
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:25.960]   there was a great article featuring like 20 possible names
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:30.920]   for Facebook, like Facebook MacFacy or something like that.
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:31.760]   But--
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:32.600]   - Did you hear him last night?
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:34.440]   - Facebook is, they're losing kids,
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:35.880]   they're losing the kids, Leo,
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:37.800]   and they're gonna make a massive portion of Facebook
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:39.240]   and do a more youth-friendly product.
[01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:40.600]   - Jesus.
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:41.680]   - Nobody knows what that means yet,
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:44.360]   but they're down with the youths.
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:45.520]   - Apparently. - Oh yes.
[01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:46.440]   Hello fellow kids.
[01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:47.880]   - The TikTok is just compelling.
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:50.240]   - Welcome to your new social network.
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:52.320]   - Henry's not making cooking videos on Facebook, Leo.
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:53.160]   That's the problem. - No, he's not,
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:54.680]   isn't that interesting, you're right.
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:55.840]   - Yeah.
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:57.120]   - Well he's making them on Instagram,
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:59.320]   so they kinda get them that way.
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:01.000]   - Well, 'cause Reels is the answer, that's what he said.
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.920]   He said, like, you're stealing Snap,
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:05.080]   you're stealing TikTok, and he's like,
[01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:07.240]   we think there are several compelling formats
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:09.240]   in the social space stories was one of them,
[01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:12.560]   and we think Reels is gonna be another one of those.
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:15.280]   - He's gotta be steamed that now that it's almost impossible
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:18.800]   to simply acquire audiences
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:20.920]   that they weren't able to cultivate on their own,
[01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:22.880]   'cause the next time they try to buy something,
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:25.480]   it just ain't gonna happen, Chief.
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:29.160]   - 15, one is out, it is pretty much mostly
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:32.080]   to get SharePlay working across the board,
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:35.920]   that's why I came out day in date with Matt Monterey, right?
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:37.800]   Is there anything else, 15, one?
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:39.640]   I'm sure there's some security updates.
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:42.760]   - It looks like some small video components as well.
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:44.120]   - What does that do?
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:46.440]   - I don't know, I saw it when I hit update,
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:49.000]   I saw like some pro video or pro-
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:49.840]   - Oh yeah, pro-res.
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:52.440]   Oh it adds, oh, I forgot, you're 13.
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:54.800]   I'm just holding up my 12 as if I had one.
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:57.360]   You're 13, this is 13, you're 13.
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:43:58.200]   - You're 24 right now.
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:00.280]   - I had pro-res video capture support,
[01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:02.960]   so that was that thing we talked about,
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:04.840]   but wasn't out yet, now it's in.
[01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:07.960]   - So yeah, I would expect you immediately
[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:10.880]   to go out and shoot a feature film, Alex.
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:12.400]   - That's my big plan, yeah, absolutely.
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:15.240]   - Can I suggest, no firearms?
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:16.080]   Seems like a bad idea.
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:17.720]   - Do you do too, because it'll be faster
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:19.360]   than waiting for legendary?
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:21.520]   What do you, you probably have some experience
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:23.400]   with firearms on set, right, Alex?
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:24.720]   Or no?
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:26.560]   - I have some experience.
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:29.120]   - Yeah, 'cause I know you love guns.
[01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:30.120]   - Fuck.
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:30.960]   - You love them.
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:32.280]   - You love them, you love them.
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:35.080]   - No, he has some experience with firearms.
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:37.360]   - I grew up in rural Pennsylvania.
[01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:38.880]   - We have experience with firearms.
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:41.320]   That's kind of like growing up,
[01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:42.400]   that's just when we got to today.
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:43.840]   - You haven't used them in production, have you?
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:45.280]   - We have, we have, absolutely.
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:47.160]   Yeah, so there's a lot of protocols
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:48.600]   that look like they weren't followed.
[01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:49.440]   - Yeah.
[01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:50.800]   - You know, during that, you know, so.
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:52.720]   - But you normally have a armor,
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:55.400]   on set, a prop master, an AD assistant director.
[01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:56.240]   - Everybody checks it.
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:58.440]   - All of which who are very careful.
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:00.640]   - I think that, I didn't realize how careful they were.
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:02.160]   They're super careful with this.
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:03.960]   - Well, it's the thing, that's their job.
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:04.920]   That's their only job.
[01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:06.840]   Like, this is your job, is you have one job
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:08.120]   and that's to keep people from, you know,
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:09.640]   hurting each other with the weapons, you know?
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:10.960]   And so, you know, so the,
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:14.720]   and so there's a lot of things that are done
[01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:16.600]   even without a film set,
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:18.000]   that when you hand someone a gun,
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.640]   you show them that it's empty.
[01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:20.480]   - Right.
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:23.040]   - You know, like literally, you know, in general,
[01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:25.920]   you know, again, I grew up in the country.
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:28.080]   When you hand someone a gun, it's empty.
[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:29.880]   Like, you know, like you show it to them, like,
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:30.720]   nothing, you know?
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:31.560]   - Yeah, nothing.
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:32.760]   - And so, like there's nothing in it.
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:34.720]   You can put, you let them load the gun, you know?
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:36.440]   And so, the fact that, you know,
[01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:38.200]   the idea that you would hand someone a gun
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:39.200]   and say it's cold,
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:40.040]   - And it's not.
[01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:40.880]   - would be that it's.
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:41.720]   - Terrific.
[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:43.240]   - Crazy, like, the fact that, you know,
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:45.720]   and I've seen on set where the armor says that,
[01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:46.720]   and then the AD says that.
[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:47.560]   - That's right.
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:48.400]   - Like, and the looks at it.
[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:50.240]   Like, there's a whole bunch of layers of,
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:51.080]   - I am.
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:52.080]   - that's, I mean, it's everyone missed.
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:53.800]   It should be maybe one person misses it,
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:55.480]   but it doesn't get to the actor without that.
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:57.920]   And it sounds like now that, I guess, the rumor,
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:45:59.280]   and we're talking about rumors right now,
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:01.320]   that I guess they were out, what they call plinking.
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:02.840]   You know, they're out shooting the actual gun.
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:04.560]   - Oh, at lunch, during lunch.
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:06.640]   - Before, before the, a couple hours before,
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:08.640]   which is, I don't even know how that's,
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:09.480]   I don't,
[01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:11.240]   - They're supposed to be locked up.
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:13.880]   - Well, yeah, no one's supposed to, you know, like,
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:15.640]   anyway, so I don't, I don't want to say anything else,
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:17.240]   'cause I don't, we don't know enough about it.
[01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:18.440]   - It's a terrible tragedy, but.
[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:19.280]   - Yeah.
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:21.800]   - Well, for me, as a complete naive,
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:25.240]   I just assumed, oh, they have blanks.
[01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:26.240]   They're just throwing them around.
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:27.240]   - They're just throwing them at sex now.
[01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:28.240]   - That's not even with blanks.
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:29.720]   I thought everything was done, CJ.
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:30.720]   - Yeah, but those are,
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:31.560]   - The problem.
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:34.400]   - They're real firearms firing real blanks, one hopes.
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:36.120]   And even then, that's dangerous.
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:38.080]   - Well, people have gotten hurt.
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:39.840]   - You still have to hold the powder in there.
[01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:42.040]   So there's a cap, you know, there's a cap in the bullet
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:44.160]   that holds the powder in, and it's gonna come out at,
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:45.320]   now there's ways of doing it.
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:49.040]   The problem with not using a gun that has blanks
[01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:50.680]   is there's no recoil.
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:52.560]   So it just, it looks, you know,
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:54.560]   when you're trying, you can try to do, you know,
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:56.360]   to do the movement, but it's not the same.
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:58.600]   And so people who want that kind of realistic look,
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:00.460]   want the blank because it's gonna force the gun to
[01:47:00.460 --> 01:47:04.000]   - The famous film set accident where blank actually killed
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.160]   an actor 'cause he was fooling around with it.
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:08.640]   So it's not, it's, yeah, but there's such a,
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:12.600]   I didn't realize how there was a number of good posts,
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:14.920]   Reddit had an excellent post from an armor talking about
[01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:16.600]   all of the procedure.
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:19.200]   And I had no idea how careful people were.
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:21.360]   - Absolutely, this, I'm glad to hear it.
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:22.880]   - It was the same post that I read.
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:25.920]   Even when there are blanks, I weigh all the blanks
[01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:26.760]   to find out.
[01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:30.240]   - He weighs this one, this one, this one has a larger
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:32.440]   chart than the other, so we're only gonna use it for
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:33.280]   - Put it aside.
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:34.440]   - The blanks fired in the off in the distance.
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:36.720]   Here's the one that is, yeah, it's, yeah.
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:39.960]   You like to see that kind of, you like to see that kind of,
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:42.280]   I am the God on the set when it comes to guns.
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:44.320]   You will not, there's no greater authority
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:46.600]   when it comes to this gun than I, the armor
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:48.040]   who was responsible for people's lives.
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:50.600]   - He also said, and most of the actors are liberals,
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:52.360]   so they are scared of guns anyway.
[01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:53.560]   (laughs)
[01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:56.200]   - I thought that was kind of a funny side.
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:57.800]   (laughs)
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:47:59.120]   - No.
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:03.080]   - Just, well, we spent so much time talking about Dune,
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:06.280]   but there was, one of the things that makes me really,
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:08.760]   gets me really interested in live performances,
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:10.720]   things like safety that's on stage,
[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:13.880]   that cannot be apps, cannot be in any way visible
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:16.960]   to the audience, that the way that,
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:19.960]   I know people who have been doing productions on Broadway,
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:23.360]   and they walk me through exactly how much communication
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:27.120]   there is between the person who has to,
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:29.400]   has to take a step off a high platform
[01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:31.240]   while they're clipped into wires,
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:33.760]   and how much communication there is between the backstage,
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:36.320]   that person who is on stage all the while,
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:38.760]   that and that person and the rest of the show,
[01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:41.160]   if there are six or seven failure points,
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:43.160]   or rather go or no-go points
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:44.280]   that are built into this,
[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:46.360]   all the way to the point where, okay,
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:47.920]   the person who's on that platform
[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:49.360]   believes that they are clipped in,
[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:51.000]   but they still have to,
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.560]   they're still the ones who decide to step off or not,
[01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:56.560]   so they can signal in a way that no one in the audience
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:58.680]   would ever see that, okay, I don't like this,
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:01.440]   we're not doing this, we go to Plan B of the staging,
[01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:03.720]   where I don't actually jump off the platform.
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:06.920]   It's amazing, the level of detail that goes into this,
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:08.720]   and how they manage to pull it off
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:11.280]   without anybody being aware of how much conversation
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:12.120]   is going on.
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:17.120]   Yeah, Reddit/r/bestof, if you wanna read that post,
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:20.200]   it was quite eye opening.
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:25.840]   iOS 15.1 then, SharePlay, Pro-Ez Video Capture,
[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:26.920]   we've said it all.
[01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:28.480]   (laughs)
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:30.000]   And I'm sure there's some other stuff.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:33.040]   I guess, and I guess you probably want it.
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:36.600]   Oh, there is one other thing I did want,
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:37.680]   and used immediately,
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:41.520]   I put my vaccination card in my Apple Wallet.
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:42.360]   Yay.
[01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:44.680]   So, and it worked beautifully.
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:46.000]   I guess I shouldn't, I don't know,
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.760]   should I not hold, I'll put my finger over the QR code.
[01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:51.240]   But it's cool, it's red,
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:53.080]   and I presume that that's gonna be,
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:55.760]   I can use that because of the QR code,
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:49:59.000]   if going through a gated and airport,
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.200]   or at a concert or whatever,
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:02.760]   so if that's great, that's in your wallet.
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:05.240]   In the state of California,
[01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:08.560]   you actually go to a website, you get the QR code,
[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:10.160]   and then it was interesting.
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:12.240]   It's set on the actual webpage,
[01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:13.920]   add this to your Apple Wallet,
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:15.560]   so they knew immediately, that's good.
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:16.720]   That's a big deal.
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:21.520]   I'm going to see my first live performance since pre-COVID,
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:23.720]   and unfortunately, my Android phone
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:25.600]   doesn't have that kind of capability.
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:26.640]   And also in the state of New York,
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:28.040]   they don't honor that.
[01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:30.000]   That's the other thing, they have to honor it, yeah.
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.320]   Yeah, you have to be a state resident to participate,
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:34.360]   and they're like state-wide passport program.
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:36.200]   So you have to, I had to download the Clear app,
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:39.320]   the same one they use for passport control,
[01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:41.320]   speediness through airports,
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:44.240]   and it really does make you think about
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:45.280]   how we're going to have to need
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:47.960]   this sort of infrastructure going forward.
[01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:49.680]   It also kind of makes you think a little bit
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:54.680]   about why people's concerns about the ostracization,
[01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:59.960]   possibilities of such a passport
[01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:02.400]   that it could have an effect on society,
[01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:05.200]   that if it becomes really, really easy for a gatekeeper
[01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:08.160]   to say, you have to have these following vaccinations,
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:10.360]   and you have to have these following papers
[01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:14.040]   in order to be allowed in attendance into this venue.
[01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:17.400]   It might be, in the future, two or three years from now,
[01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:19.600]   it might be, well, you don't have a flu vaccination,
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:22.120]   and for that reason, our insurance people
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:23.960]   have required us to install this app
[01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:26.480]   and make sure that only vaccinated people have entered.
[01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:30.960]   So as always, when you make something easy to do,
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:32.920]   you also make it easier for bad people
[01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:34.160]   to do bad things with it.
[01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:36.480]   So it kind of gives me a little bit
[01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:38.520]   of philosophical, beard stroking moment,
[01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:39.960]   even as I'm thinking, thank God,
[01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:42.120]   I don't have to produce an ID,
[01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:45.480]   and this piece of paper in my wallet,
[01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:47.880]   thank God, I can just, as usual, just flash QR code
[01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:49.240]   and be flashed right through.
[01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:54.080]   - Apple doesn't specifically mention any security updates
[01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:59.520]   for 15.1, but I'm gonna guess there are some.
[01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:01.840]   There are some bug fixes.
[01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:03.920]   There's new shortcut abilities,
[01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:06.080]   a new collection of games that lets you pass
[01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:08.120]   the time with Siri.
[01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:10.000]   I can't wait to find out what that is.
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.960]   - Would you like to play a game?
[01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:15.320]   - I'm a Jew like 20 questions.
[01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:16.160]   - 20 questions.
[01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:19.440]   - Support for live text in the camera app on the iPad.
[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:20.320]   That's nice.
[01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:23.720]   So there are a lot of new features in 15.1.
[01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:28.320]   Have we covered what was a very big day today?
[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:30.440]   I think we had a lot to talk about,
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:32.360]   except the AirPods, you put the AirPods out of the game.
[01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:35.400]   I'm not talking about those, don't buy those.
[01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:36.240]   - Well, do you like them?
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:39.200]   I mean, I guess it's somewhere in between the AirPods
[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:40.360]   and the AirPods Pro, right?
[01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:41.200]   It's.
[01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:43.600]   - Yeah, almost exactly in between.
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:44.920]   And that's important for some people,
[01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:47.280]   because I love the little Silicon tips,
[01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:49.120]   because my ears, they're mangled.
[01:52:49.120 --> 01:52:51.240]   Stuff doesn't stay in, but other people really hate them
[01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:53.200]   because they don't like anything in their ear canal
[01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:55.440]   or they find it really painful to have Silicon tips.
[01:52:55.440 --> 01:52:57.960]   So these have the OG ear pods.
[01:52:57.960 --> 01:53:00.600]   Johnny I've measured 3 billion ears to find
[01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:03.320]   the Platacian ideal for 80% of humanity,
[01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:05.120]   that some people actually legitimately prefer.
[01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:07.880]   So you get that, you don't get noise canceling
[01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:10.600]   or transparency mode or the voice assist feature,
[01:53:10.600 --> 01:53:11.880]   but you do get spatial audio,
[01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:13.920]   which I think is a big part of Apple's plans,
[01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:16.280]   especially for audio augmented reality.
[01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:20.880]   And you get that dynamic EQ system for like 180 bucks,
[01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:22.760]   which is cheaper than the AirPods Pro.
[01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:24.440]   And they kept the second generation AirPods
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:27.160]   around for 130 bucks, so the cheapest AirPods ever.
[01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:30.040]   I think it's just, it's a good solid update to Apple's line.
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:33.600]   - Not a fan, so I'm not gonna talk about it.
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:35.400]   - But I'm glad you. (laughs)
[01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:36.880]   - I'll throw them out the window, right?
[01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:39.360]   - I just, I had 179 bucks, so expensive in there.
[01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:43.400]   Very credible choices at a lower price.
[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:45.840]   - The thing is like, yeah, for music,
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:47.320]   like not worth it at all.
[01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:48.800]   Like you can get Anchor,
[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:49.880]   there's a whole bunch of brands that offer
[01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:51.240]   really good music experiences.
[01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:53.480]   Apple is just, they wanna put all this technology,
[01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:55.400]   like they wanna pay for an H1 core,
[01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:56.840]   like, you have loads of everyone
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:53:58.360]   and all the sensors and everything.
[01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:00.640]   - And down the road, that might really be a big deal.
[01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:05.000]   I mean, we've talked about OTC hearing aids.
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.440]   Apparently, President Biden is gonna really put the screws
[01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:10.440]   to the FDA to stop delaying this.
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:12.200]   That will be a big deal.
[01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:13.880]   When you get hearing aids over the counter,
[01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:17.000]   I think the AirPods would make an excellent choice
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:17.840]   for a lot of people.
[01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:20.680]   They already have sort of, have that capability.
[01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:23.880]   But also, AR, you know?
[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:25.240]   Audio AR. - These are not just optical,
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:27.560]   so like the traditional AirPods were optical,
[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:29.080]   like, we're probably were proximity based.
[01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:31.040]   And you would know when it was in your ear.
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:31.880]   Now they're optical,
[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:33.920]   so they can actually differentiate skin tones
[01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:34.760]   from other things,
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:36.360]   so they'll really know they're in your ear.
[01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:37.720]   And not just like, you put them on a table,
[01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:39.080]   and all of a sudden it's playing music again,
[01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:40.440]   which is super annoying.
[01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:41.280]   - Yeah.
[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:44.720]   Let's take a little break and get your pics of the week.
[01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:46.000]   Fellers? - Yeah.
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:47.080]   - How about that?
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:48.400]   What do you say?
[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:49.440]   We were talking-- - I'm up for it.
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:50.640]   - Oh yeah, you ready?
[01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:52.920]   Yeah, ready? - I'm really keen for this.
[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:55.920]   - We were talking about streaming
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:58.720]   a million people watching your FaceTime.
[01:54:59.040 --> 01:54:59.920]   Video.
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:01.920]   Actually, there is a way to do that,
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:04.640]   affordably and easily with cash fly.
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:07.400]   Cash fly is our CDN.
[01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:10.200]   They've been innovating content delivery since 1999.
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:12.280]   We've been using for over a decade.
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:13.920]   Matt Levine, one of the founders of Cash Fly
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:15.640]   came to me early on,
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:17.640]   like when we were first struggling
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:20.120]   with how to get these podcasts to you.
[01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:22.760]   Before we even do a video, when it was just audio,
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:24.200]   and he said, "Let me help."
[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:26.040]   And we've been using Cash Fly ever since.
[01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:26.880]   When we came to him and said,
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:28.400]   "Hey, get ready, we're gonna be,
[01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:29.280]   we're gonna be doing video."
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:30.520]   They said, "We're ready and man,
[01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:32.440]   it's been a great relationship."
[01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:35.440]   No 3 a.m. phone calls saying the CDN is down,
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:36.280]   nothing like that.
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:40.840]   And you may not notice it as a listener or a viewer,
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:43.160]   but there's never an issue getting our content
[01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:45.760]   'cause Cash Fly's servers are close to you.
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:48.960]   They're the fastest CDN for global throughput
[01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:51.000]   with over 50 points of presence.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.440]   Now they're doing ultra low-latency streaming,
[01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:55.320]   and this is very cool.
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:57.320]   We're not talking the webRTC solution
[01:55:57.320 --> 01:56:01.200]   but let you down in the past stream delays less than one second.
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:03.000]   They have a great HTML5 player.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.080]   You can embed anywhere with a really nice SDK,
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:10.480]   websites, applications, mobile devices, any other platform.
[01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:12.760]   Their low latency network means your video streams
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:15.720]   will come quickly to your endpoint,
[01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:16.880]   no matter where you have viewers,
[01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:19.120]   regardless of what continent they're on.
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:22.320]   And you can with Cash Fly's ultra low latency video platform
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:25.400]   deliver to more than a million users concurrently,
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:28.480]   as well as suggest thousands of synchronous streams.
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:33.480]   RTMP, RTMPS, SRT, ultra low latency, SLDP and HLS.
[01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:36.560]   There's a solution waiting for you.
[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:41.040]   Go to twit.cash fly.com, bring your usage trends
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:42.560]   and you're a CDN bill.
[01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:44.480]   And let Cash Fly show you how they could save you
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:47.720]   as much as 20% and give you a better performance.
[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:50.400]   And by the way, the best support I can vouch for this.
[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:54.480]   24/7, 365 day a year, priority support.
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:56.160]   They're always there when we need them.
[01:56:56.160 --> 01:57:01.160]   A 100% SLA and up to five times faster than other CDNs.
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:03.960]   Cash Fly's just the best.
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:06.760]   We thank them so much for supporting what we do here
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:08.520]   and we invite you to give them a try.
[01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:11.960]   Find out more, no pressure, no sales, just information.
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:16.960]   Twit.cash fly.com, thank you Cash Fly, thank you, thank you.
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:18.440]   Thank you.
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:21.480]   All right, Renee Richie,
[01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:24.440]   why don't you kick things off with your pick of the week?
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:28.560]   So this is a little homage to the anniversary of the iPods,
[01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:30.280]   which I think is 20 years.
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:33.880]   It was 20 years, October 25th, 2001.
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:37.880]   - It was in 2016, 20 Fidel, you know, Steve Jobs,
[01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:40.240]   everyone get together and put a thousand pockets.
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:43.680]   - A thousand songs in your pocket, baby.
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:45.040]   I got it right here.
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:47.600]   - I have restored condition, baby.
[01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:48.920]   - We all got it.
[01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:51.880]   - But we all know that the greatest innovation
[01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:54.840]   of the iPod generation was really iPod socks
[01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:56.560]   and that Apple has done nothing,
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:57:58.640]   has done nothing to bring that innovation forward.
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:57:59.480]   - Oh, that's hysterical.
[01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:00.320]   - People got a cleaning cloth.
[01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:01.960]   You can get a 20 dollar cleaning cloth
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:03.880]   if you really want to, but you can't get socks.
[01:58:03.880 --> 01:58:04.960]   Well, where's the Hermes?
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:06.560]   - This one has been solved by the aftermark.
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:08.480]   Yeah, here's my LMS sock.
[01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:12.320]   - And that's the leather sock, yes, just what you need.
[01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:14.960]   - I'm gonna break, but you can now get AirPod,
[01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:17.080]   not socks, but you can get AirPod beanies.
[01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:18.560]   We call it a tuke.
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:19.560]   - I think Canada.
[01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:22.400]   (laughing)
[01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:25.480]   - Little beanies, little socks for your AirPods.
[01:58:25.480 --> 01:58:27.440]   They are so cute, they are adorable.
[01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:30.640]   I saw it, it popped up on Twitter this morning.
[01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:31.880]   I'm blanking on the vendor's name.
[01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:33.680]   I have it in front of me here.
[01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:35.800]   - I will pull it up for you, 'cause I got it on the,
[01:58:35.800 --> 01:58:36.920]   I have your link.
[01:58:36.920 --> 01:58:37.920]   - Native Union.
[01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:38.760]   - Native Union.
[01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:39.600]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:40.440]   - Yeah, Native Union.
[01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:42.440]   It is, there's so adorable Leo,
[01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:44.440]   like in all the colors that Apple refuses
[01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:46.080]   to give us for AirPods, you know.
[01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:46.920]   - Oh.
[01:58:46.920 --> 01:58:48.800]   - For some reason, every consumer Apple product,
[01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:50.840]   the colors are all at the consumer end,
[01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:53.000]   and the pros get your choice of black or white.
[01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.200]   But for AirPods, only the max have colors.
[01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:57.920]   Everything else is just that one iconic white color,
[01:58:57.920 --> 01:58:58.800]   but they're saying nay.
[01:58:58.800 --> 01:59:00.360]   They're saying literally nay to Apple,
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:03.320]   and they're giving us, like you can get your gray options
[01:59:03.320 --> 01:59:04.520]   if you wanna keep, like there's the gray
[01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:06.880]   and the black option, the silver and the space black.
[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:07.720]   There's also orange green.
[01:59:07.720 --> 01:59:10.040]   - For the AirPod pros, yes, yes.
[01:59:10.040 --> 01:59:11.400]   - Yeah, so for Micah Sergeant,
[01:59:11.400 --> 01:59:15.040]   if you need a really green AirPod beanie,
[01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:17.000]   you can get that now, and they're knit.
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:19.960]   - Yeah, and I just love this kind of stuff.
[01:59:19.960 --> 01:59:21.600]   This to me is the innovation that we've been missing
[01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:23.400]   for the last two decades at Apple.
[01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:26.880]   - AirPod beanies or Tukes,
[01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:29.360]   as they're known north of the 49th parallel,
[01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:33.840]   you can get them for 1999 from native union.com,
[01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:36.960]   although it looks like they're sold out right now.
[01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:37.840]   - I blame Stephen Hackett.
[01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:39.320]   He was way too promotional than this morning.
[01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:42.560]   - Oh man, we only knitted 5,000.
[01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:43.520]   We didn't know.
[01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:45.760]   Oh yeah, Micah's definitely gonna want this green.
[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:47.120]   This is a beautiful,
[01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:50.360]   - Can I say that I'm just happy to be living in a world
[01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:52.040]   in which this product sells out,
[01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:54.760]   I would be disappointed if this didn't sell out.
[01:59:54.760 --> 01:59:59.080]   - Well, they've got all of the ladies in the Newfoundland
[01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:01.360]   are knitting as fast as they can.
[02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:02.200]   So that really-- - The church,
[02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:03.720]   and I'm sure it'll pop up all over Eti.
[02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:05.240]   Like I'm not telling you to go to Eti for these,
[02:00:05.240 --> 02:00:06.840]   but I'm sure they're gonna pop up all over Eti.
[02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:08.400]   - Yeah, hey, native union, if you can't--
[02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:09.240]   - It's just too cute.
[02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:12.320]   - Keep them in stock, we're just gonna have to go somewhere else.
[02:00:12.320 --> 02:00:15.760]   Oh, wait a minute, you get four of them for $20.
[02:00:15.760 --> 02:00:17.840]   - Oh, oh. - Oh.
[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:19.440]   - You don't change your socks every day?
[02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:20.280]   Come on, man.
[02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:22.040]   (laughing)
[02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:23.760]   You don't have Day of the Week AirPod socks Leo.
[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:28.040]   - Glacier, Peach, Indigo, and Sage.
[02:00:28.040 --> 02:00:28.880]   - Beautiful.
[02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:33.760]   Let's get our pick of the week from Mr. Andy Maco, Andy.
[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:37.520]   - Monterey has fixed a couple of things
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:41.160]   about windowing, windowing management on the Mac.
[02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:43.960]   It's still meaning that now if you have windows arranged
[02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:46.760]   and you actually go to sleep and then you wake it up again,
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:49.280]   you won't, excuse me, when you disconnect from a monitor
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:52.040]   and reconnect again, it doesn't just totally screw everything up.
[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:53.600]   Okay, so that's a step in the right direction.
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:56.080]   It still doesn't have one of the most basic features
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:59.840]   that I always use whenever I'm using Linux and Android.
[02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:03.520]   Rectangle is an app, free app, go to rectangleapp.com
[02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:04.480]   that fixes this.
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:07.760]   All it does is if you drag the title bar of a window
[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:09.600]   to the right end to the screen,
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:12.560]   it will resize it to take up half the screen.
[02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:13.400]   - Perfect.
[02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:15.120]   - If you drag it to the top of the screen,
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:17.400]   it'll resize it to do the full width of the screen
[02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:18.720]   by the top half.
[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:22.800]   And yes, there's actually a windows menu in the Mac OS
[02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:25.160]   that will do, hey, tile this to the left or the right half,
[02:01:25.160 --> 02:01:26.360]   but it does something stupid.
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:29.200]   It says, oh, you want to create an entirely new workspace
[02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:31.360]   that has this on one side and on the other,
[02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:33.040]   just like on the iPad, right?
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:35.240]   Wrong, I just want to make some space.
[02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:36.760]   - It's just an arrangement, folks.
[02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:38.200]   It's just an arrangement.
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:39.520]   I don't need that. - Exactly, yeah.
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:41.480]   - It's the simplest thing in the world
[02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:42.880]   and Mac doesn't do it.
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:47.000]   And it's also not as complicated as Windows Managers
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:52.000]   on Linux are where they started off with that in like 1998,
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.280]   but then they said, oh, how about we do key binding
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:58.160]   so that if you want to tile all of your Emacs ones
[02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:02.360]   until 64 by 64 pixel, many would know, again,
[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:03.720]   I drag it to the left.
[02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:05.520]   It's the left-hand side of the screen.
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:06.680]   I drag it to the right.
[02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:08.480]   It's the right-hand side of the screen.
[02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:11.240]   It is one of the basic things I install
[02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:15.320]   on every single Mac, almost like in the first round
[02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:17.240]   of installations because the first time
[02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:18.840]   that I drag a window and it doesn't happen,
[02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:20.440]   so, oh, rectangle app, download it.
[02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:22.800]   And it's free, works great, it's very, very stable.
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:25.200]   Go ahead and get it. - Open source.
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:27.160]   Ryan Hanson, nice job.
[02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:32.560]   I guess this leaves, but you, Alex Lindsay,
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:33.600]   pick of the week.
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:37.800]   I hear nothing.
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:39.240]   You are muted. - Sorry.
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:43.480]   I need the credit Jason Beish in our office hours group.
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:45.920]   This morning, he kind of blew our minds with this app
[02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:48.200]   that I don't know how I didn't know it existed,
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:49.040]   but he brought it up, he was like,
[02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:50.120]   this is a real, someone was asking,
[02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:51.040]   how do you screen capture?
[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:54.040]   What's the best app to screen captures on the Mac?
[02:02:54.040 --> 02:02:55.760]   And he just said, well, you might want to try screen
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:59.640]   the layers and we were all like, what are you talking about?
[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:01.880]   Screen the layers and he goes, yeah, it captures,
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:04.320]   you know, your screen in layers.
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:06.920]   - As a PSD Photoshop. - As a Photoshop.
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:08.440]   - Or Photoshop.
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:10.640]   - And we were like, what?
[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:13.600]   And then immediately everyone started downloading it
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:15.120]   and everyone started playing with it.
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:19.160]   And it's as good as it sounds.
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:24.160]   So it's an incredible, so what it does is it will,
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:26.960]   you just hit screen capture and it works for a second
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:30.280]   and it literally captures everything,
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:33.280]   but it captures your menu bar as a separate layer.
[02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:35.280]   - Oh, they're all different layers.
[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:40.280]   - Yeah, all of the windows that are opened,
[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:42.360]   it captures those as layers.
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:45.120]   It captures just the icons on your screen,
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:47.880]   that's a layer, like everything is a layer, you know?
[02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:52.880]   And it just, and so it will, it's impressive.
[02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:54.720]   - That's some pretty, yeah.
[02:03:54.720 --> 02:03:57.880]   - When I got to this, I literally had never heard
[02:03:57.880 --> 02:04:00.600]   of this company, needed apps and they have,
[02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:02.360]   the other one that I tested,
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:04.960]   because they have another one, it's called Web to Layers.
[02:04:04.960 --> 02:04:07.360]   - Yeah, it does that with web pages too.
[02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:08.200]   - Oh.
[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:10.280]   - So it's M.
[02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:12.040]   I guess you figure, once you've figured out
[02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:13.520]   how to do it for screens.
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:15.640]   - Well, so a bunch of us, a lot of times we have to do
[02:04:15.640 --> 02:04:17.400]   animations where we're animating up a,
[02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:19.120]   you know, you're looking at a web page,
[02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:22.160]   like it's come, you know, and that's usually what you do
[02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:23.600]   is you capture a piece of the web page,
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:25.360]   then you scroll down where there's a little overlap
[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:26.560]   and you capture and then you go into Photoshop
[02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:28.600]   and you replace it and you talk about how smart you work
[02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:29.960]   'cause you use different, different keys
[02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:31.000]   and everything else, this just does it.
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.520]   You just hit go and it just, you get this long strip
[02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:35.000]   that's all done.
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:36.040]   - You know, it's all captured.
[02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:38.720]   - Should point out that you can use PSD files also
[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:40.120]   with Acorn and Pixel Mater.
[02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:42.840]   - Yeah, and Affinity. - And Affinity Photos.
[02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:45.360]   So you've got the layers, you don't have to have Photoshop.
[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:46.480]   - No, no, yeah, absolutely.
[02:04:46.480 --> 02:04:48.120]   It just grabs all the layers.
[02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:51.080]   It's, uh-- - Oh my God.
[02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:53.600]   - Yeah, like it was, it was like, oh my God.
[02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:54.800]   Is it, what's the cost?
[02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:56.400]   It looks like it's free. - $18.
[02:04:56.400 --> 02:04:57.240]   - $18.
[02:04:57.240 --> 02:04:58.080]   - It's worth it. - I think it's what
[02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:00.280]   they recommend, but I downloaded it.
[02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:01.520]   I'm using it right now for free.
[02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:02.440]   I downloaded it from the App Store.
[02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:04.120]   I'm not sure exactly when I was supposed to pay for it,
[02:05:04.120 --> 02:05:06.120]   but I haven't paid for it yet, and I started testing it.
[02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:08.200]   And so, I don't know how the payment structure works,
[02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:09.960]   but I know on their website it says it's like $18.
[02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:10.880]   That's every penny.
[02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:12.080]   I mean, it's-- - Oh my God.
[02:05:12.080 --> 02:05:13.800]   - Yes, brilliant. - It's brilliant.
[02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:15.920]   - It's brilliant. - I mean, if you're doing training
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:17.320]   or you need to do anything where you do that,
[02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:19.560]   it's worth it. - We spend all this time
[02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:23.360]   doing, oh, the snip and cup capture area and stuff.
[02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:26.280]   Now you just got everything as a single thing.
[02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:27.760]   - Yeah. - Brilliant.
[02:05:27.760 --> 02:05:29.200]   Look at all the layers.
[02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:30.040]   - Really?
[02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:33.240]   - There's quite a few layers in your screenshot there.
[02:05:33.240 --> 02:05:37.800]   Doc, Pip Agent, Pixel Mater Pro Finder, Safari message,
[02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:39.800]   and they don't even have to worry about hiding themselves
[02:05:39.800 --> 02:05:42.880]   'cause they're layers, so you don't need to turn that on.
[02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:44.240]   - Nice. - Oh.
[02:05:44.240 --> 02:05:46.080]   - The people who need to write documentation
[02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:49.680]   will spend any amount of money to make this process simpler.
[02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:51.760]   As the author of like a dozen books,
[02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:54.880]   it's like the bane of my existence was always
[02:05:54.880 --> 02:05:57.120]   the damn screenshot of the damn game.
[02:05:57.120 --> 02:05:57.960]   - Oh, yeah, yeah. - You have setting the stage
[02:05:57.960 --> 02:05:59.840]   properly. - Oh my God.
[02:05:59.840 --> 02:06:01.280]   - This is great. - Yeah.
[02:06:01.280 --> 02:06:04.400]   - How can it can do that because the way Apple,
[02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:06.520]   this must be something unique. - It's very strong.
[02:06:06.520 --> 02:06:08.680]   - It's just, yeah, just.
[02:06:08.680 --> 02:06:10.640]   - Apple must somehow be communicating
[02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:12.880]   that each thing is a familiar app.
[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:15.760]   - This is an App Store app, so it's within the sandbox.
[02:06:15.760 --> 02:06:18.720]   I mean, it's not doing anything creative.
[02:06:18.720 --> 02:06:20.680]   - Must have to do with the screen rendering
[02:06:20.680 --> 02:06:22.280]   and the Apple. - Yeah.
[02:06:22.280 --> 02:06:24.640]   - It's like grabbing all the individual windows.
[02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:25.880]   - Wow. - Yeah.
[02:06:25.880 --> 02:06:27.240]   Amazing. - I can see it.
[02:06:27.240 --> 02:06:28.800]   - Like how did I know that this is just--
[02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:30.840]   - Is the menu bar a window?
[02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:32.320]   I guess it is. - It is.
[02:06:32.320 --> 02:06:34.680]   It's a draw rack, it's a region.
[02:06:34.680 --> 02:06:37.320]   I guess it's a window. - All right.
[02:06:37.320 --> 02:06:39.200]   Brilliant. - Yeah.
[02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:41.000]   - Every platform should have this.
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:41.840]   That's so cool.
[02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:43.600]   I'm buying that right now.
[02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:46.760]   My, I'm sad to say my new MacBook is sitting
[02:06:46.760 --> 02:06:48.160]   on my porch at home.
[02:06:48.160 --> 02:06:49.720]   (laughing)
[02:06:49.720 --> 02:06:50.560]   - Oh, Lisa's there.
[02:06:50.560 --> 02:06:52.520]   Lisa's there. - Oh yeah, it's safe.
[02:06:52.520 --> 02:06:55.160]   It's, but in the before times we would complain
[02:06:55.160 --> 02:06:56.480]   about it being late or whatever.
[02:06:56.480 --> 02:06:57.720]   Now we're just happy it shows up.
[02:06:57.720 --> 02:06:58.840]   - I'm just happy it's there.
[02:06:58.840 --> 02:07:00.040]   - Yep, that's all I care about.
[02:07:00.040 --> 02:07:00.880]   - Yep.
[02:07:00.880 --> 02:07:03.400]   - I will be rushing, of course,
[02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:07.360]   'cause I'm leaving 7.30 AM from SFO tomorrow.
[02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:09.160]   I won't have time. - I've got to run those updates.
[02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:12.160]   - Well, I wanna get it all set up.
[02:07:12.160 --> 02:07:15.280]   So I'm gonna recommend a couple of things that I use
[02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:16.480]   and I've been preparing for this
[02:07:16.480 --> 02:07:19.000]   'cause I knew this would happen.
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:20.320]   Homebrew is a must.
[02:07:20.320 --> 02:07:23.440]   Everybody who uses any command line stuff
[02:07:23.440 --> 02:07:26.480]   knows about Homebrew, which is a way to install Unix apps.
[02:07:26.480 --> 02:07:29.920]   But there is a feature of Homebrew, Homebrew Bundle,
[02:07:29.920 --> 02:07:33.040]   that will actually make a file, a bundle file.
[02:07:33.040 --> 02:07:36.360]   I can actually show you what mine looks like.
[02:07:36.360 --> 02:07:38.360]   It's a bundle file that contains
[02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:40.720]   not only everything you've installed in Homebrew,
[02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:44.680]   but if you install Mass, which is a command line
[02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:49.360]   application installer, or you use Homebrew's Cask feature,
[02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:52.600]   which installs binaries,
[02:07:52.600 --> 02:07:54.320]   you actually will reinstall everything.
[02:07:54.320 --> 02:07:56.680]   It'll reinstall your Mac App Store stuff.
[02:07:56.680 --> 02:07:57.960]   It'll reinstall binaries.
[02:07:57.960 --> 02:07:59.120]   It'll reinstall everything.
[02:07:59.120 --> 02:08:01.360]   So my first step is to take my existing Mac.
[02:08:01.360 --> 02:08:03.640]   I don't wanna just connect the two together.
[02:08:03.640 --> 02:08:05.880]   First of all, it takes forever, right?
[02:08:05.880 --> 02:08:07.480]   And do this.
[02:08:07.480 --> 02:08:09.040]   I wanna build it fresh.
[02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:11.200]   So this way I will download fresh.
[02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:12.240]   Let me just log in.
[02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:18.320]   (mimics machine noises)
[02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:23.200]   Sorry, I have to type in my password.
[02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:27.480]   So I can show you my brew file is what they call this.
[02:08:27.480 --> 02:08:29.960]   This is called a brew file.
[02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:31.840]   And I have it here.
[02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:33.920]   I keep it in, this is the other thing I do.
[02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:35.200]   I keep it in Notion.
[02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:38.720]   So all I have to do is log in to Notion.
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:40.800]   Then I have my system setups.
[02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:42.120]   So I do this in the browser,
[02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:43.560]   'cause the browser's already working,
[02:08:43.560 --> 02:08:44.880]   and this is all the stuff.
[02:08:44.880 --> 02:08:47.040]   But my brew file, which is awesome,
[02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:48.120]   will automate this.
[02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:49.840]   Here's, I'll make it bigger.
[02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:52.400]   So you tap the Cask, you tap the fonts,
[02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:53.600]   and then it goes through,
[02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:55.600]   it'll use brew to install stuff,
[02:08:55.600 --> 02:08:57.400]   but it'll use my, to install,
[02:08:57.400 --> 02:09:00.760]   brew Cask, to install apps and master install stuff
[02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:02.960]   from the App Store with the App Store ID.
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:05.960]   So this in one step, it'll churn a bit,
[02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:08.440]   will download and completely update my system.
[02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:10.320]   And then of course, for settings,
[02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:12.520]   I use GitHub for my Emacs settings,
[02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:14.480]   so I can copy those in quickly.
[02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:16.560]   And I also, for documents,
[02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:18.000]   I've been using that armor lock,
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.880]   that great encrypted hard drive,
[02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:24.720]   and from, is that Western Digital, the armor lock.
[02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:26.360]   So I have on that,
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:30.600]   I have used R-Sync to create my documents folder,
[02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:32.960]   all my other data folders,
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:35.080]   so that I can quickly whip those.
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:36.880]   They're always up to date using R-Sync.
[02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:40.120]   Another good tool is unison, which does that as well.
[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:43.720]   And that way, I'm gonna be, I think up and ready,
[02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:45.920]   with a fully configured laptop,
[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:48.320]   bright and early 7.30 more morning.
[02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:51.200]   We have to drive down about 4.30, so.
[02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:53.400]   It better work tonight.
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:57.200]   Anyway, that was something I explained on my
[02:09:57.200 --> 02:10:00.800]   short little Mac show I used to do.
[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:02.440]   And it's really brew,
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:05.240]   and brew bundle is really a useful thing for all of this.
[02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:07.040]   - Yeah, those are some great choices.
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:09.000]   R-Sync is one of the,
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.600]   there might be only about six command line things
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:13.800]   that everybody would benefit from learning.
[02:10:13.800 --> 02:10:15.160]   R-Sync is one of them,
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:17.640]   that there's so many things that,
[02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:19.880]   in terms of making sure the two volumes
[02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:21.200]   are in sync with each other,
[02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:24.120]   backups, remote restores, things like that,
[02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:25.320]   where I think that, oh damn,
[02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:27.120]   what app do I need to download,
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:28.440]   or do I need to use for this?
[02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:30.320]   Oh, I can probably just do this with R-Sync.
[02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:33.720]   It's even how I keep my music library sync to my Walkman.
[02:10:33.720 --> 02:10:35.520]   It's like, just my R-Sync command,
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:37.240]   and it will just absolutely just do everything.
[02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:38.080]   Perfect.
[02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:38.880]   - Yeah, once you learn how to,
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:40.080]   it's a command line utility,
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:43.520]   but once you learn how to do it,
[02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:46.480]   I don't even, I just type it in now very quickly.
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:47.320]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:50.880]   There is a interesting file synchronization tool
[02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:53.680]   called unison, which is open source and free.
[02:10:53.680 --> 02:10:55.880]   It's from, I think, a university,
[02:10:55.880 --> 02:10:58.880]   I think Pittsburgh, your old stomping grounds,
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:01.000]   that works on OS 10,
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:02.680]   that will also do this,
[02:11:02.680 --> 02:11:03.520]   but I think R-Sync,
[02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:04.960]   if you know R-Sync's command lines,
[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:06.680]   you're pretty good.
[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:08.520]   So, I'm ready.
[02:11:08.520 --> 02:11:12.600]   I've been preparing my e-max.
[02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:15.520]   I've been slowly making sure everything is up to date,
[02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:17.480]   I put it all on my GitHub page,
[02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:18.320]   so I can sync it,
[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:20.160]   I put all my dot files on my GitHub page,
[02:11:20.160 --> 02:11:21.120]   so I can sync them.
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:22.280]   It's a three-step process.
[02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:23.200]   - It's on vacation.
[02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:26.960]   - Yeah, just so I could take the old M1 on vacation,
[02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:28.560]   but the old new one.
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:29.920]   - The old new hotness.
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:31.680]   - Yeah, I got the new hotness.
[02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:34.640]   All right, we are done.
[02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:36.760]   Hey, thank you everybody for a great show.
[02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:38.480]   I knew he had a lot to talk about.
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:40.920]   I'm glad Renee Richie came back from his briefings,
[02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:42.760]   laden with information.
[02:11:42.760 --> 02:11:43.880]   You can get more,
[02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:45.560]   he's posting it all on YouTube,
[02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:48.840]   youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:53.240]   Is the next video gonna be the conversation with a Gruber?
[02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:54.120]   - I have two coming up,
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:55.600]   I'm trying to get them both up as soon as I can.
[02:11:55.600 --> 02:11:58.320]   One is talking to John Gruber about Monterey,
[02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:00.560]   and the other is talking to someone familiar
[02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:02.800]   with everybody here, Alex Lindsey, about ProRes.
[02:12:02.800 --> 02:12:04.120]   - Oh, nice.
[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:05.560]   - Because I needed someone who was super smart
[02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:07.520]   about ProRes who didn't work at Apple,
[02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:08.360]   or, you know,
[02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:09.920]   I bet he'll have a really good camera.
[02:12:09.920 --> 02:12:12.000]   - And he ended up with me somehow.
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.880]   - I bet his picture will be excellent.
[02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:16.200]   - It was gorgeous.
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:18.280]   (laughing)
[02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:20.680]   I think he shot it in 24K and down sampled it for me.
[02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:25.200]   - Renee's M1 Max MacBook Pro Review is really, really good.
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:26.760]   We showed you a little clip where he's showing
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:27.920]   all the different cameras and so on.
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:28.880]   It really is great.
[02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:31.520]   AirPods 3 Review is up as well.
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:33.640]   If you are, listen to this show,
[02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:37.080]   I'm sure by now you subscribe to YouTube.
[02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:39.760]   Renee Richie, 290,000 subscribers.
[02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:41.240]   We should really get that to a million.
[02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:43.480]   YouTube.com/Renee.
[02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:45.440]   Richie, thank you for being here, Renee.
[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:49.040]   - Andy Naco, when are you gonna be on WGBH in Boston next?
[02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:50.280]   - A day early this week,
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:53.280]   'cause I'm traveling Thursday at 12.30 in the afternoon
[02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:55.480]   Eastern time, you can stream it live or stream it later.
[02:12:55.480 --> 02:12:57.800]   Just go to WGBHNews.org.
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:12:58.720]   - And where are you going?
[02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:00.280]   Remind me.
[02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:01.640]   - I'm going to New York City.
[02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:03.440]   First trip back to the Metropolitan Opera
[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:05.240]   since pre-COVID.
[02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:08.160]   I have one more thing to finish
[02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:11.200]   for my Metropolitan Opera audience costume.
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:12.320]   I have some paint.
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:14.040]   I did the primer coat yesterday.
[02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:16.280]   I have to do the finish coat today.
[02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:17.760]   It's really coming together.
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:19.400]   I look forward to either,
[02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:21.960]   I look forward to possibly being thrown out for good
[02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:23.520]   or being asked politely to leave
[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:24.440]   for just for this one.
[02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:25.920]   (laughing)
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:27.360]   It's Halloween weekend.
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:28.720]   - You're gonna share pictures.
[02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:29.800]   - I'm going to share pictures.
[02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:32.640]   I didn't wanna share anything.
[02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:35.880]   I have a couple of like little teasers on my Instagram
[02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:38.800]   that a couple of people have already guessed what it is,
[02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:43.800]   but it's not like a full like a Comic Con costume.
[02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:45.840]   It's like, how do I reinterpret this
[02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:48.120]   so that it looks like what someone would wear
[02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:50.320]   like to the Metropolitan Opera?
[02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:52.520]   And there are a lot of things I had to switch in and out.
[02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:53.360]   - Oh boy.
[02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:54.520]   - I'll change this one in the last second.
[02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:55.680]   - Oh boy.
[02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:57.040]   - I was gonna ask you,
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:14:01.640]   are you a person from another era or are you a superhero?
[02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:03.640]   I think it leans a little more toward the latter.
[02:14:03.640 --> 02:14:05.320]   I'm guessing.
[02:14:05.320 --> 02:14:07.800]   - It's a historical figure
[02:14:07.800 --> 02:14:11.320]   and it's from a galaxy far, far away a long time ago.
[02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:13.720]   (laughing)
[02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:14.960]   - All right.
[02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:17.280]   And people have already guessed from those two clues.
[02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:18.800]   I'm impressed.
[02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:20.960]   - The second one more than the first one, but yeah.
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:23.160]   - No, no, no, again, I believe me.
[02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:26.480]   I'm trying to hire Rumslike to make an appearance
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:31.480]   in act two because Turindot is a highly problematic opera
[02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:33.200]   and I really think that Rumslike
[02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:34.720]   is the coming in clean house.
[02:14:34.720 --> 02:14:36.120]   - When you see that exactly.
[02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:37.880]   - It's tweets from the Metropolitan Opera
[02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:40.160]   about that weirdo in the fifth row.
[02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:41.000]   - Exactly.
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:42.840]   - You'll know who it is.
[02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:44.480]   Have fun Andy, have a great time.
[02:14:44.480 --> 02:14:47.320]   I will not be here next week by the way.
[02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:49.440]   So I won't get to find out how it went.
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:52.320]   In fact, I won't be here for two weeks
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:54.720]   'cause no, I'll be here a week from Wednesday.
[02:14:54.720 --> 02:14:55.680]   Okay, good.
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:56.760]   No, a week from Tuesday.
[02:14:56.760 --> 02:15:01.680]   I will not be here next Tuesday.
[02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:02.800]   I'll be back in two weeks.
[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:04.400]   Okay, thank you for explaining.
[02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:05.240]   (laughing)
[02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:07.080]   I couldn't find out exactly.
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:10.480]   Alex Lindsey, what's going on at Office Hours.Global?
[02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:12.320]   - Oh, you know, it's always cooking.
[02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:15.280]   Yesterday we had this incredible breakdown.
[02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:16.640]   And by the way, you should go back
[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:18.320]   and if you're listening to this,
[02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:20.000]   look at yesterday's Mondays.
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:23.440]   We had Richard Levery from Belfast
[02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:27.200]   did a breakdown of how he does virtual events.
[02:15:27.200 --> 02:15:29.840]   And not only is it a great breakdown,
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:33.960]   but it actually is an incredible use of keynote.
[02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:36.040]   Like he just really had all the magic moves
[02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:37.320]   and everything else going on.
[02:15:37.320 --> 02:15:41.480]   And so anyway, so he did a great job there.
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:44.280]   Today we just said,
[02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:46.040]   let's talk about troubleshooting audio.
[02:15:46.040 --> 02:15:49.440]   And it was an incredible technical hour
[02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:50.880]   of us talking about that.
[02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:54.560]   On Friday we have the company universe
[02:15:54.560 --> 02:15:56.720]   that builds these automation tools for hardware
[02:15:56.720 --> 02:15:58.480]   and software, they're gonna come on and talk
[02:15:58.480 --> 02:15:59.560]   about what their product does.
[02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:01.280]   And then of course we've got education
[02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:03.360]   and cooking and concerts on Saturdays.
[02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:05.080]   So Saturdays the long day,
[02:16:05.080 --> 02:16:06.120]   there's all kinds of stuff going on.
[02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:08.560]   So it's still busy.
[02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:10.240]   It gets busier every, and today,
[02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:12.480]   this week we're starting the soft move
[02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:14.520]   to what we call office hours 2.0,
[02:16:14.520 --> 02:16:16.600]   which is that it's gonna look more and more like a broadcast.
[02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:21.360]   So instead of looking as much like Zoom as it does now,
[02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:24.400]   we've built all these tools that let us literally
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:26.880]   in the web interface, all the super sources
[02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:28.960]   and everything else are getting built programmatically.
[02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:31.040]   So when we, when I click on the,
[02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:32.640]   I'm gonna have these four people answer the question,
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:35.800]   it builds a super source automatically and sends it out.
[02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:37.880]   And we're gonna start, so tomorrow is actually
[02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:40.200]   the first raw stream, we're not gonna publicize it.
[02:16:40.200 --> 02:16:42.800]   Just the members get to watch it for a week or two.
[02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:45.840]   And then, but it's gonna look more and more like a show,
[02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:49.240]   but it's a lot of automated tools
[02:16:49.240 --> 02:16:52.520]   so that the person cutting doesn't have to like actually
[02:16:52.520 --> 02:16:53.320]   know how to use a switcher.
[02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:55.400]   They just, they need to push the buttons that they wanna show.
[02:16:55.400 --> 02:16:56.560]   So we're pretty excited about it.
[02:16:56.560 --> 02:16:58.560]   Coincidentally, super source is also the name
[02:16:58.560 --> 02:17:01.160]   of the character Andy Naco be playing at the Opera.
[02:17:01.160 --> 02:17:03.360]   (laughing)
[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:04.280]   Lots of screens.
[02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:06.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:08.200]   We do Mac read one hour beforehand,
[02:17:08.200 --> 02:17:09.920]   hundred bucks for the VIP package.
[02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:12.040]   It includes one signed photo with one foot.
[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:13.040]   (laughing)
[02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:15.840]   We do Mac break weekly, Tuesdays, 11 AM Pacific,
[02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:19.920]   2 PM Eastern time, 1800 UTC.
[02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:22.640]   Although remember, in the United States,
[02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:26.960]   we like to delay the change from daylight saving time
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:30.480]   to standard time until after Halloween.
[02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:33.440]   So next week, many of you will have changed your time.
[02:17:33.440 --> 02:17:38.000]   We will not have, but we do change on November 7th.
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:41.640]   So it's 1800 UTC for now.
[02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:42.720]   It'll be, what does that mean?
[02:17:42.720 --> 02:17:43.640]   I don't know what it means.
[02:17:43.640 --> 02:17:45.360]   1900, I don't know.
[02:17:45.360 --> 02:17:46.800]   Well, I'll explain later.
[02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:49.560]   It's three to 19, 17, I know one of,
[02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:51.920]   I think it's minus eight, so I think it's 19 now.
[02:17:51.920 --> 02:17:54.120]   (laughing)
[02:17:54.120 --> 02:17:57.800]   It'll be 19 starting November 9th, okay?
[02:17:57.800 --> 02:18:01.280]   Okay, which is when I'll ironically be back.
[02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:04.960]   We also offer a live stream of it,
[02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:07.080]   if you wanna watch it those times.
[02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:10.640]   If you go to twit.tv/live, there's audio or video.
[02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:13.800]   Chat with us at IRC.twit.tv, that's open to all.

[02:18:16.480 --> 02:18:19.000]   who are members of Club Twit, $7 a month.

[02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:24.520]   plus access to the discourse and Discord
[02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:26.360]   and special programming.

[02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:38.920]   twit.tv/mbw, there's also a dedicated client,
[02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:44.400]   I'm sorry, dedicated channel for the show on YouTube.
[02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:46.280]   All of our shows have their own YouTube channel,
[02:18:46.280 --> 02:18:48.120]   so you can watch there as well.
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:51.040]   I think my favorite way to get a podcast,
[02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:53.960]   I suspect at George as well as to subscribe
[02:18:53.960 --> 02:18:56.720]   in Apple's podcast or some other podcast player.
[02:18:56.720 --> 02:18:58.800]   If you do that, you get the show automatically,
[02:18:58.800 --> 02:18:59.960]   the minute it's available.
[02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:01.920]   If you will leave us a five-star review,
[02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:03.160]   let the world know.
[02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:07.400]   You too listen to Mac Break Weekly.
[02:19:07.400 --> 02:19:09.240]   Thanks everybody, I'm off to Mexico,
[02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:13.280]   I'll be off next week back the following Tuesday.
[02:19:13.280 --> 02:19:15.800]   But meanwhile, you have to get back to work
[02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:18.960]   because Breaktime is over.
[02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:20.440]   Bye bye.
