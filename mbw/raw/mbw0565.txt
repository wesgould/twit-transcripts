[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Joia Fettnashianel, Happy Quebec Delio.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Oh, it's Quebec Day. It was yesterday observed, but I'm just bringing it over. I'm keeping it going.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   What should we do for Quebec Day? Should we do this show in French?
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Well, I think we eat a lot of put in. It's like the only rational way to do this.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   I managed to go to Canada for four years and never have poutine.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Oh, Leo, you're the one. You're the one that got away. We got to fix that.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I had Tim's bits.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   McDonald's yesterday, I went in to get a coffee and these giant signs had new Mac poutine with bacon and three cheeses.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   And it just stopped the wall.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   That sounds like a plot out of Ottawa to kill everybody in Quebec.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   What a way to go.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   What a way to go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Also, here, Andy Enoch over the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   He's a diner aficionado of late.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Yeah, the roller derby official photographer of Providence roller derby.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   I actually have I now have my first like professional sports photography gig.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   I'm locked in as I've been hired as the tournament photographer in September for Providence roller derby.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Have fun.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Well, now I have to do it for real now.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   It's like, no, this isn't for fun.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   No, I know.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   I know.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I know that takes all the fun out of it, doesn't it?
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   And Alex Lindsey is joining us from his layer where he has very dark back here.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   It feels very dark when I look at it.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   No, it looks good.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   No, it looks good.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   You just have you have the soundproofing behind you.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   And so it sounds good, you know, because it sounds great.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   But it sounds good that the look would be plus it looks like you could be playing the harmonica with that microphone.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I know.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Great.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Apparently, helpless corgis in our chair is telling me there's a great place in San Francisco for
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.800]   Poutine called salt house.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.200]   I had I actually had a bit of a terrace.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.000]   We got put in a Paris is a fresh dish.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.800]   No, it is made in Quebec.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.800]   How dare they?
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.500]   I had Poutine in Paris drinking a caipadina watching the Steelers at a stealer bar right
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.000]   by Notre Dame, which is the most culturally confusing.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.520]   Well, we still not are down so they can have put in.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.600]   I have to say I am a caiparina fanatic now.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.600]   Yes.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.600]   Like when I was in South America, I started with Pisco Sours because I was in Peru.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.120]   But by the time I got to Ecuador, it was all caiparinas all the time.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.120]   They're Brazilian.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.120]   Oh, man.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.120]   It's so good.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.200]   I feel like I have to apologize.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.720]   There was a brew, ha ha because there was an article in Boston magazine, I think, about
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.360]   how apparently the Poutine is a thing in Boston, but they we it turns out that we seem to
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.240]   define it as a bunch of stuff piled on top of any other stuff as opposed to what the
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.160]   what the course what the Canadian correspondent referred to as quote real poutine unquote.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.240]   And so I have not had it myself.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.440]   I apologize on behalf of my.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.720]   We're sending the mountains.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.720]   That's it.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.040]   We are still a simple a simple Puritan fishing colony as we were founded in the six in the
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.040]   1600s.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.040]   Take care of that.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.480]   We'll get that Poutine sorted out right away.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:52.080]   And because Renee is a patriot, Apple and Apple Canada highlighting Canada's well, is
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.600]   it Canada or Candas favorite?
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.920]   Oh, oh, oh, I'm embarrassing.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.920]   Candas favorite.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.920]   Two hundred fifty.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.920]   Renee is going to excuse himself for the name.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.040]   Renee, I mean, it's your own.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.040]   Oh, can.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.760]   In American wrote that article.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.120]   So it's really Joseph Keller is an American.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.120]   He's from Ohio.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.120]   He doesn't have a spoke.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.560]   He's probably trolling me.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.720]   I always spill it.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.720]   Canadia.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.720]   Yeah, that's fine.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.680]   Look, Canada, Canada.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.680]   Look, Canada.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.760]   So what are Canada's favorite apps?
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.400]   There's a blank on them.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.480]   I'll find it in a second with you.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.200]   There's a running app that's amazing.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.400]   And I'll get it before we finish the show, but this he designed this running app for people
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.280]   who got lost a lot, which is exactly me.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.440]   I could go outside.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.120]   I've lived here for 20 years and I will get lost.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.880]   And it gives you it just through your headphones.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.680]   It gives you directions for running and it got taken up by the accessibility community.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.160]   And people have been writing to him saying, like, this is the first time I've gone on
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.160]   a solo walk or a solo run in 15 years because they now have lower no vision.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.640]   And he's just been rolling with it and increasing the utility of the app.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.880]   And now there's people everywhere who you go to a foreign city, you don't really know
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:00.880]   your way around.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.880]   You had a hotel.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.720]   You just plug it in and you go out for your run or you really you have low and no vision
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.320]   and you just turn it on and you go for your run.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.840]   And there's a story like screens Luke Fondal from Quebec, napkin guy English from Quebec.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.320]   Alan Pike, who does the wedding, the wedding DJ app and the party DJ app, which will not
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.800]   play nickelfish no matter how much money you give him from from BC.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.440]   I mean, there's just there's tons of talent here.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.440]   They're really amazing.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.440]   This is run go.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.440]   You're talking about run go.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.440]   Is this the one?
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.440]   Run go.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.440]   Yes.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.040]   Yeah, because it gives you turn by turn voice directions as you run.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.040]   What a great idea.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.040]   That is so many.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:39.240]   That's an example of how having a computer in your pocket can really literally change
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.240]   lives.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.240]   It's your life.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.800]   Wow, that's great.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.240]   So that's like the descriptive the descriptive audio they put on movies for running.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:54.360]   But for running on your left is the Canadian, you know, turn left here.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.280]   And again, like there are athletes who something happened.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.400]   They had an injury where they just, you know, they had the fact of a generation something
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.480]   that stopped them from running and now they can do it again.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.360]   Getting fairmont waterfront see wall run head west on Canada place.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.640]   Turn right onto see wall.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.080]   Don't hit that guy on the left.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.640]   I wish you could do that.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.600]   We're getting there, Leo's when everybody has the sense.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.520]   I'm right and up the stairs.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.360]   So but this is if you had low vision, this would be great.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.800]   I mean, you probably wouldn't want to do it if you're Olympic cauldron on your left.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.800]   That's neat.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.040]   Finish a fairmont waterfront.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.040]   Is that awesome?
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.120]   I've done that round, but I've never actually run it.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.120]   I remember walking there.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.800]   It was enough to walk it.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.800]   Cool.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.240]   Like like actors and singers.
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.960]   There's so many of the apps that you use that you don't realize are Canadian.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.680]   We did on iOS today.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.960]   We had an Australian school group in here.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:45.960]   We did all Australian apps.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.400]   And there's a huge number of Australian apps as well.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.320]   Also, Lavonovic, maker of pocket weather and pocket.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.320]   Right.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.440]   Yeah, a ton of them.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.880]   So iOS 11, I want to mention Erica Sedun's article.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.600]   Erica, did she used to write for ours?
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.600]   Or to our second.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.800]   And ours technical and the unofficial Apple web blog.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.880]   Yeah, she's great.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.840]   And she's developer and a UI guru.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:11.840]   Wicked smart.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.040]   And wicked smart.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:23.840]   Rota article about iOS 11 in which she bromones the new app switcher.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.840]   Or what is it?
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.840]   What is it called?
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.840]   The context switcher?
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.840]   Yeah, the app switcher.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.840]   App switcher.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.200]   Let me find the...
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.000]   Why I utterly loathe the new app switcher.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.640]   So as you know, when you double tap the home button on an iPhone on iOS 10 or an iPad,
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:46.200]   it puts up kind of a menu of previous applications you can scroll through.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.920]   If you don't want an application, you can swipe it out.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.800]   So she says that's a perfectly usable.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.800]   And speaking of low vision, that's a very easy to read.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.760]   You get almost a full screen of whatever was running that you can see what it was and
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.720]   so you could quickly go to it.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.440]   She says they've replaced that in iOS 11.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:09.600]   Now I don't normally report on this kind of stuff because iOS 11 is a beta.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.600]   And it may change.
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.400]   Although it's my sense now that it's a public beta.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.240]   It's not going to change a lot, right?
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.640]   They made a big deal about the new app switcher at WWDC on the stage though.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.440]   So they might tweak it, but I don't think they'll walk it back.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.600]   So here's a screen.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.600]   I don't have iOS 11.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.960]   Here's a screen grab and I know you're using it in a so you can confirm or deny.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.640]   This is the new.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.160]   So part of this is to make the doc accessible, right?
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.320]   And that's so you can drag stuff to apps in the doc.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.320]   Is that right?
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.320]   So the doc, you can pull it up from anywhere now.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.200]   Anytime any place with your in an app on the home screen, you can pull up the doc.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.920]   Also it's got control center built into it now.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.760]   There's no longer a separate control center and control center is customized.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.400]   But look at the look at that.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.360]   I mean, look at she, she points this out.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.360]   This is crazy.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:57.520]   She says, I don't even know what the, I don't even know what this is.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.160]   The circle with the dot in it.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.440]   And she says, look, look at there.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.800]   There's clock apps just randomly spread around.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:06.800]   So you can change all that.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.240]   The big problem they had with the previous version of control center, like the original
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.080]   control center had a very limited amount of buttons and people kept asking for more.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.560]   So last year, they made a three-pained control center where you pulled up and then you swipe
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.480]   either left or right to get to the, the now playing or the home screen.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.880]   And based on their data, people just weren't using it.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.240]   Either they forgot about it or they never knew it was there.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.560]   And as a result, they didn't access all those features.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.960]   So they went back to a unified control center on an iPhone.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.880]   It just takes over the whole screen.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.840]   But they have, it's like, again, you add, you add features, you add complexity.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.480]   They have too much stuff to fit in that one big pull up gesture from the bottom because
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.880]   now it's got to be the doc, the fast app, switch your end control center.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.720]   So sort of compiled it all onto one page.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.000]   So the right hand side is totally customizable.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.200]   If you hate those clocks, you can get rid of those clocks.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.200]   You can use screen record.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.440]   So you can drag these around.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.160]   That blank one is just ready for something else.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.040]   You can't drag them yet, which is ironic, given us a big drag and drop release.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.520]   But you can go into preferences and then you can, and there's a screen recorder too.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.360]   So you can put on a screen recorder or it's cord, you're screen in iOS.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.160]   Put in any apps, I have the low battery, not on iPad, but on iPhone.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.720]   I have the low battery icon there because I use it all the time.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.760]   And then what's nice about the left hand side though is it's not just apps anymore.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.480]   It'll show you apps, that's all you have.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.960]   But the minute you make those side by side, the split few apps, it'll save those screen
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:17.960]   layouts.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:23.760]   So if you always use notes in Safari and another one is files and a web browser or something,
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:29.120]   it'll keep those so you can go back to the apps you're using, but also the desktop spaces
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.120]   on macOS.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:34.840]   So one of the tiles here will end up being a layout tile.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:40.000]   Now, she also says, you saw how easy it was to swipe an app away to get rid of it.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   She says, now what you have to do is press and hold, kind of like deleting it.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.840]   I don't like that as much because it is slower.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.000]   Like you have to hold on, it jiggles, you get the X and you can kill it and that is
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   slower.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.720]   So I wish you would just be like the cards where you could fling them away.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.720]   So I'll never be following that.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.440]   I'll point out in her comments that, well, you shouldn't be killing apps that way anyway.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.440]   You don't need to do that.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.400]   But there are times when you do need to kill an app.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:05.440]   If Apple cracked down on big apps like Facebook and Snapchat who abuse background APIs, I
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.640]   would happily not kill them.
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.640]   Right.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.640]   Make a deal right now.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.920]   I've got a banking app that uses Touch ID for sign ins.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.680]   And then of course, I sign in to do the one thing I wanted to do, like move some money
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.680]   between accounts.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.680]   Then it's done.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.680]   I don't need to do it again.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.200]   Then the session times out and 15 minutes later, it's oh, by the way, we needed to sign
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.200]   in again.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.200]   I don't know.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.200]   I don't need to do that.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.000]   So yeah, sometimes you need the ability to swipe away.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   But I don't have the beta installed.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.080]   But one thing I wanted to check was, can I, is there a way that I can switch Bluetooth
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:41.720]   devices or switch Wi-Fi devices by pressing a hold or doing deep touch on the controls?
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:46.200]   So one thing that I think I can't, I really, really think that Apple needs to put in a
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.840]   way to simply very quickly switch from one Wi-Fi network to another or one Bluetooth
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.840]   device to another.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:57.160]   It's the one thing where switching into settings makes me feel like somebody on this planet
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.840]   has occurred to them that there must be an easier way than going into settings to switch
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.360]   from the auto connected to Wi-Fi to something else I wanted to do.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.400]   No, sadly, if you, if you 3D touch on those icons, you get an expanded view that also
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.880]   has like airdrop and personal hotspot and cellular data and stuff.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.680]   So just give you more options, not deeper.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.880]   It's such an obvious thing.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.000]   Even on Android though, Andy, it's, they've gone back and forth.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.840]   Now you can long press and go to the settings, but in the past, it's confusing because if
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.520]   you short press, it just turns Wi-Fi off and it's okay.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.800]   This is a UI challenge and I'm not going to disable too bad because it's clear what
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.800]   their goal was just to get everything on a page.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.160]   If you do it too quickly, people think it, people accidentally hit it.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.560]   If you take it too long, they think it's broken.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:40.640]   They bring their finger off.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.640]   Right.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:46.400]   I mean, and so this, this is a busy, this is a busy context switcher, but you're getting
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.920]   everything on a page and I presume this isn't live.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.920]   I can scroll to the right on these pages.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:51.920]   Yeah, you can scroll.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.840]   And all I meant is that, you know, like you can't layer too many actions behind one button,
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.920]   but you can make smart choices about what those actions do.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:03.760]   So Erica's point well taken, but I think it's not going to change.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.960]   I'm thinking maybe now I should install on this new iPad Pro.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.320]   I should probably install iOS 11.
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.440]   If it's an extra device and you don't depend on it for anything mission critical or like
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.960]   making emergency phone calls, then test away.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.680]   But it's not unreliable, is it?
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.200]   It's a beta and it's the second beta.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:25.400]   And sometimes let's say the second beta was great and then the third beta has a huge problem.
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.520]   So it's, it's, it's a path you should only go down if you really don't depend on it.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.720]   Is there a way to go back?
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.960]   Can you just change your mind?
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:35.560]   Yeah, backup completely make a complete like iTunes level encrypted backup.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.920]   And then you can always roll back.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:37.920]   Okay.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.080]   But you'll return to the point where that backup was made.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.040]   So again, if it's a critical device that gets new data all the time, you probably don't
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.040]   want to do that.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:49.800]   And what's the process of installing iOS 11 on your iPhone or your iPad?
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.080]   You get a certificate now.
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.600]   So you go to develop, you go, well, not develop for the public beta.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.400]   You go to Apple's beta page and then you get a certificate, you install that on your,
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.400]   on your iPhone.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.720]   And then when you go to, or your iPad, and then when you check for updates, it'll give
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.900]   you the beta as an update.
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.800]   And from then on is the regular update process, which is nice.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.360]   Okay.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.800]   So iOS beta software program is beta.apple.com.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.520]   And yeah, there's the I'm or article one on how to do this.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:20.520]   So if you want to, if you want to, I'm just wondering, I mean, I, this is my only, you
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:25.280]   know, the 10.5 is the only new, but it feels like this really was designed for the, the
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.680]   new iPad pro.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.680]   And I, I'm very angry at the Mac for not doing some stuff as well as the iPhone.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.280]   I had is now doing it after you're running it.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.280]   I am.
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.800]   We said this before this show, but I'll say it again on, on the record.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:45.880]   The more I use this 10.5 inch iPad pro, the more I'm pressed, I am with speed, smoothness,
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.480]   color accuracy on the screen.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.960]   It is a, it is subtle, but it's a real pleasure to use.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.960]   Alex, I'm sorry.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:58.000]   Yeah, I just got mine a couple of days ago and, and it is the best iPad that I've had.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.280]   You know, I mean, it should be, it should be.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.280]   It's a new one.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.760]   Yeah, but a lot of times these are kind of incremental improvements.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:08.440]   This one feels, it's funny because it's, you don't, I think it's all designed, as you
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.040]   were pointing out, Renee and I've given you credit for your insight.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:15.160]   This is about a AR kit and about the fall.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.560]   So you're not really seeing everything.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.280]   That's one of the reasons I'm thinking about iOS 11.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:22.720]   But you can see they've put so much that 120 Hertz right now.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.720]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.880]   They've put so much into this thing.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.800]   This is way, this is like a way, this is a way, this is like a Volkswagen with a Corvette
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.800]   engine.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.840]   I mean, this is a way overpowered device for what it does.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.200]   The Geekbench is like forget, forget MacBook Airs now.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.040]   It's like MacBook Pro, not too old MacBook Pro level.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:43.240]   And I feel like it's the first time where I, I started drawing on it and it was like,
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.240]   it's just like paper.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.320]   I mean, at this point it doesn't feel like mentally, I had to like reset myself with
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.200]   any iPad of going on.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.960]   It's a little sluggish, but it's really, really close and better than anything else I've seen.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.200]   To now it's just like, oh, it's just right.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.960]   It's like, it's like drawing or sketching, you know, and it's just.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:02.320]   You're using the pencil with it for your work or your.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.320]   I'm not an artist.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.800]   I mean, I am.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:10.720]   I do 3D and everything else, but when I draw, it's mostly me giving people feedback and drawing
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.880]   on things and dating things and signing things.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.680]   But it's sketching out ideas, but I don't usually.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.200]   Well, but see, that's another good use.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.360]   You don't have to be an artist.
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.320]   It's another way to express yourself.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.320]   It's so much faster.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.000]   I mean, I sit there and type it all of it, or I can just circle it and write on it like,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.080]   I don't like this or I don't like this.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.920]   And also just little like boxes of we're going to do this, and then it's going to go here.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:36.480]   And rather than going into something that will eventually happen, which is going to look cleaner,
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.880]   it allows us to sketch out ideas.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:43.160]   And I think that's to me, the primary use of the pencil for me is just having something
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:49.000]   that I can quickly sketch out an idea or write down ideas really quickly that I still
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.280]   can't type quite as fast.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.280]   Right.
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.800]   So what program do you use for that?
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.480]   I'm using, I'm testing a lot of them.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.600]   I have to admit that my favorite one still, the notes is the best.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.320]   There is just the Apple zone notes app.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.120]   It's even better in iOS 10.
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.120]   Yeah, it is.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.120]   Sorry.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.280]   Oh, I haven't seen iOS 11, but the iOS 10 version of it, you know, it's got this one
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:14.200]   thing that a lot of them seem to hide somewhere, which is delete everything.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.720]   Like erase all is something that a lot of these sketch apps, it's like a thing you have
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.400]   to think about and how to get to instead of just hit.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.880]   I just want to hit a button, like I just want to clear the page and go back to what, you
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:24.880]   know, what I was doing.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.720]   And it seems like that is hidden in a lot of them.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:33.600]   For more refined stuff, I've been, you know, I've been playing with paper, sketchbook,
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.600]   my vermino desk is another one that I like to use a lot.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.800]   It, you know, but they're all different.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.640]   Some of them we want, I want to go full screen because we're using it for something else,
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.720]   you know, that where we use it actually in a show.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:52.680]   So, so just it really depends on what we're doing, but my go to one is still Apple's notes.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:56.040]   I still think it's the easiest one to sketch out ideas anyway.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.960]   And iOS 11, it's got instant notes.
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.440]   So you just tap the pencil to the lock screen.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.840]   It takes you right to notes.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.440]   You can do in, you can do handwriting in line with type notes.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.960]   You can just push the pencil in.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:09.880]   It'll open up a space for you to do an in line illustration, like or, or, or drawing inside.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.000]   You can hit a screenshot and it'll automatically let you mark up a screenshot.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.360]   If you're in mail, you can tap on a PDF or another document.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.040]   It'll pull up the markup stuff and let you automatically mark that up.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:23.040]   So you just use it like someone sends you a design comp, you tap it, you start just putting
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.560]   in things you want to change, you share it back again.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.280]   It's, it's, when I find that people will slack me, you know, where we run like the company
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:35.600]   is mostly run on Slack and, and we, we, people will slack me something and then I, I feel
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.520]   like I have to go to my iPad to respond.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.440]   I have to take the slack and I, I take the picture and then I open it up and I draw on
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.680]   and then I push it back into Slack and I do all that because I can't draw on my screen,
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.280]   not that I'm, not that I'm bitter.
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:51.720]   So of course Apple is going to be the first to make apps that are designed for the new
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.760]   iPad and the new OS, OS, iOS 11.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.600]   But are there other apps already coming along?
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.000]   I saw Procreate for iOS 11.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   It was amazing.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.680]   It was, I think James said it's like four times faster because of metal too.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.680]   Oh, interesting.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.280]   And sorry, or 10 times faster than it was on open GL.
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.280]   Wow.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.480]   And that I believe because that's not fully open GL's fault.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.480]   Apple's open GL implementation is not the best.
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.480]   Yes.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.800]   Although open GL is still a very thick stack and metal is a very thin stack.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.840]   So it has less to go through and Apple's doing some really smart stuff with metal too
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.560]   is they're getting as much of the CPU and as much of the software out of the way so
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.480]   that when it engages and that's really important for VR when you want super low latency, they
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:31.280]   just get as much of everything out of the way as possible and let you speak directly
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.480]   to the GPU, which is really nice.
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.680]   I, I downloaded and I've been playing with affinity photo.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.440]   That's pretty, that's pretty good.
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.440]   That's pretty powerful.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.480]   It's like finger painting with deformation mask.
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.480]   Leo, it's amazing.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.480]   I'm cut.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:48.360]   It's really the UI is completely opaque, but I have to take the tutorial.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:53.080]   But serenity said she feels like she could do everything she does in Photoshop now on
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:57.080]   affinity photo $20 program on the iPad.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:02.160]   You know, I there's been a move even among professionals, not so much for the iPad version,
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:07.320]   but for the affinity on the desktop where we're seeing a lot of pros going in entire
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:12.600]   to pain for the what they're paying and for a Photoshop and not feeling like they need
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.560]   the stuff that Photoshop has that affinity doesn't have.
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:20.760]   And for me, I use affinity to edit VR pictures because the and I don't know if it has affinity
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:26.080]   photo on the on the iPad has it, but on the desktop, you can go into a VR, you can go into
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:30.400]   a 360 mode and look down at your tripod and then do a clone tool and paint it out.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.560]   Yeah, I think it does have that on the.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:34.560]   And so that's a super.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.440]   I mean, that's the only place that I know that I can do that easily and something we have
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.880]   been asking for for 20 years.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:47.440]   This affinity is done by the same guys who did serif, which was a quite a good, I thought
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:52.680]   quite a good, although not quite Photoshop, but quite a good inexpensive photo editor.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.120]   But you're using it on the desktop.
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.120]   That's really interesting.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.240]   Well, I, yeah, I use it again.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.400]   I've been using Photoshop since 1991.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.960]   So it's not like I still do things in Photoshop because I just don't know it's not that affinity
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.960]   can't do it.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.840]   It's just that I can do it really fast in Photoshop.
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.000]   So, but I'm slowly using affinity.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.280]   And the number one reason I use it again is because I'm editing VR photos or VR videos.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.240]   So the biggest problem you have with when you're shooting VR, of course, is the tripod that
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.600]   held the camera and getting rid of that.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.480]   It's something that we've been dealing with since 1994.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:32.680]   So being able to paint that out easily and be able to just simply clone it out is a big
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.680]   deal.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.520]   So anyway, so we haven't seen any, I haven't seen anybody else.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.400]   There's been lots of tools that kind of do it and there's lots of things that can kind
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.400]   of make that work.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:45.160]   But we haven't seen anything that really just makes it easy to flip it in, paint it out,
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.800]   flip it back, and you're not losing quality or anything else you're just doing it through
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:49.800]   a viewer.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:54.960]   Anyway, so it's been, affinity is, the affinity photo has definitely been something that
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.280]   we're starting to use more and more.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.440]   One of the things I really love about affinity is that it's one of a new generation of apps
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:06.800]   that doesn't try to take an existing app and make it, and figure out what 20% of these
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.960]   features are going to be relevant to the iPad.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:12.400]   Although there are great apps like that, this is an app that like says, what if we wanted
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:17.120]   to make a something that's as capable as a desktop version, but it's going to be within
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:21.640]   the context of a tablet computer or mobile device, and that's what it does.
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.520]   There's one of my other favorite iPad apps is Graphic by Autodesk.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:28.800]   They bought it from another company, and it really is just as simple as can possibly
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.480]   be while still being so powerful that any time.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.720]   This is one of the reasons why when I'm in my hotel room the night before I'm giving
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:39.720]   a talk, and I suddenly realize that, oh, these 11 slides could be replaced with just
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:44.280]   one graphic and one piece of text and bashing out a graphic that combines a whole bunch of
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:48.680]   things I'm using this app called Graphic that will take me about 10 minutes to do, whereas
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:53.520]   even if I had my Mac with me, it would probably take me three times longer because it's not
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:58.040]   really as fine-focused towards that one thing you want to make it do.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:06.480]   So yeah, that's why I really do think that in 2017, even if there's any computer that
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:11.160]   you want to buy, I think that an iPad should be part of the decision tree because if you
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.840]   have not taken a look at it in the next, in the last couple of years, you will be surprised
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:19.600]   at how powerful it is, how fast it is, how useful it is, and the fact that you're used
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:23.880]   to just a tablet computer being something you toss to the kids in the backseat so they
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.760]   can watch videos and shut up while you drive.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:32.280]   It's now really almost a desktop class experience, not just the speed power of an iPad.
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.280]   That is worth every penny.
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.280]   Well, I'll see that.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:40.000]   Well, I knew you're going to pay as much for an iPad once you get a keyboard and a pencil
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.840]   and you buy Renee's 29-watt adapter and the Type-C to-
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:44.840]   That's how they get you to-
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.800]   That's going to be as much as the laptop.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.800]   That's going to be as much as the laptop.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:48.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:53.040]   At that point, however, how much lighter and more portable is it?
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.040]   So that's it.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:58.960]   I have a friend who's been using the convertible windows for a long time and you got the iPad
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.600]   and he said this to me is a real convertible because it feels like the small one.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.600]   It feels like a tablet.
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.280]   It doesn't feel like a computer trying to be a tablet, no fan, nothing.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.960]   And then you put in the keyboard and you can kind of sort of do what you would do on
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.960]   a laptop.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.840]   So it's more inclined towards the tablet and it is a good-
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.840]   It is not a replacement but it is a good alternative.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:22.680]   So I brought a laptop and the iPad on my last trip and I'm thinking-
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:26.000]   And I'm really- This is probably the same kind of calculus a lot of people are going
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   through.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.760]   Could I get away with just the- It's so much lighter?
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.480]   Could I get away with just the iPad?
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.840]   Especially for me, the biggest issue would be photo editing.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.480]   Oh, I think I'd get back in.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.240]   I think it's gotten there.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:47.000]   Especially with the new Pro and maybe my next trip will be after iOS 11 comes out I think.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.840]   So-
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:53.800]   We have definitely, we've definitely people in the company that are not using laptops anymore.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.280]   Now, I still have, I'm too old or something.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.560]   I've just been doing computer too long.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.120]   I feel like I have a hard time not being able to get my mouse.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:03.480]   We've been talking about this for at least two years.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:08.840]   As Apple's drifted away from Mac OS and Macintosh computing and we've been presuming that their
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:14.360]   plan was at some point to migrate to iOS and iPads.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:20.320]   If you can get all the stuff, all the functionality into an iPad, it probably would be preferable.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.680]   I think we're getting close.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.080]   I will leave them before they leave us.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:29.360]   Well, and also I'm more convinced now playing with 10.5 and I'm going to put iOS 11 on it
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.360]   tonight.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.360]   I think that's for sure.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.600]   I'm more and more of the opinion.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:37.640]   This is Apple saying, look, this is where we're going.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.120]   This is really quite an impressive piece of hardware at this point.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.120]   I'll go even farther.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:49.320]   I need to rebuild and proficiency on Windows 10 because I've never been a really daily
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.320]   user of it.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.320]   You bought a ThinkPad 2.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.320]   Good man.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:57.760]   Well, I found a company that had this B stock ThinkPads from a company.
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.800]   Oh, always the best to buy one of the, like a T240 or something.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:03.800]   Right.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.800]   And so this isn't a, like, this isn't a decision.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.080]   Oh my God, there's so much better than anything else I've been using.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:13.680]   Again, it really is that I realized I should really add that more to the mix.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.620]   And so my little office rule has been that now when I leave the, when I leave the office
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:19.840]   for the coffee shop, I'm not going to take the iPad.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.680]   I'm going to take this, the ultra book with me instead.
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:27.000]   Again, so I do the stuff I need to do, but also it'll drill more Windows 10 stuff and
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.920]   boy, who I miss my iPad because for the stuff I like to do.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.800]   I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, at a coffee shop for three hours or I'm on the, I'm going to be
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:41.760]   spending two hours on the train to the city and back and stuff like that.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.920]   It's just so much more direct with the iPad.
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:49.160]   It's so much more focusable with the able to just do a very, very simple, instinctive
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.800]   split screen between the two.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.440]   I think that Windows 10 is wonderful.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:55.520]   I think this is, this is a really, really lovely laptop, even though it's like two years
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:01.120]   old at this point, but I really, really would if I had to choose one of these two to, to,
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.640]   to take with me forever, it would definitely be the iPad and not an ultra book.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.600]   I think, and I think the same would go to a lesser extent.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:11.600]   If this were like a MacBook, nothing, though I think I would prefer the MacBook, nothing
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:20.440]   to this, but I think that I would prefer the iPad, especially the 12.9 is to both of them.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.600]   It's happening, isn't it?
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:29.280]   So is it time to just kind of get over it and, and, you know, we've moved through denial
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.000]   and I have to get the help.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.280]   He's got the new iMac for my house and, and it's still great.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:39.200]   Are you going to buy a $5,000 iMac Pro?
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.200]   Yes.
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.200]   You are.
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.200]   Well, of course you are.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.200]   So I mean, it's, I think that it's designed to be handled.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.200]   But will you buy it and be handled?
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.600]   It was going to buy a $17,000 iMac Pro.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:54.120]   Yeah, but wouldn't you really rather have a cheese grater than a yes, an all in one?
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.120]   I do.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.360]   Well, I mean, I think that, I think what will be interesting to see is how far we can push
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.920]   at using the Thunderbolt 3 interface.
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:06.400]   So I think that a lot of the things that I would prefer to have a 3U rack mountable
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.680]   Pro, you know, like get rid of the circle stuff and just let me just shove something
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.960]   into a, into a server area.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.800]   I mean, that to me would be very valuable.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.360]   But I don't know if that's ever going to happen.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.360]   Yeah.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.360]   Well, that's what I mean.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:22.360]   I think it's time probably to say, especially with iOS 11, all right, it's obvious now.
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:26.360]   I think that the future of computing from Apple's point of view is iOS.
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.600]   But I think that's crystal clear though.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.760]   I'll just make this really quick.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:37.680]   I think that faith is not a good thing to go on on the Mac right now.
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:44.760]   I think that I really want to see Apple demonstrate a lot of enthusiasm for the Mac, or at least
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.720]   the same enthusiasm they're showing for iOS.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.320]   But if iOS, their eyes light up, they get excited, they get animated.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.480]   You could tell that they're, they really want to tell us about the next three or four
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:57.360]   years of iOS that they've all, they've all all planned out with the Mac.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:01.080]   They just, I'm just not seeing the same level and excitement.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:05.120]   And that's another reason why, again, if you've got a thousand bucks in your pocket to buy
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:10.600]   your next real productivity machine, if it's a portable thing, really seriously take a look
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.000]   at the iPad.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.760]   And if you don't think it's as good or better than, than a new MacBook, absolutely no problem
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:17.760]   get a new MacBook.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.200]   But this is the time where you really need to start making that decision.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.000]   I feel like I bought my last Mac book.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.160]   I wouldn't be sure.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.160]   We've been through this.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.800]   I feel so too, but Apple was pretty careful with their lag.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.120]   Tim Cook is always really carefully language.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.960]   And he said that the iPad Pro is the purest expression yet of Apple's belief in the future
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.440]   of personal computing.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.440]   But that's personal computing.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.760]   I think that's why we're seeing them double down on the pros side.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:38.760]   You still need Macs.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:39.760]   No, no, they need Mac.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:40.760]   Yeah, Mac.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:41.760]   The pro Mac.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.480]   Still, X code is still a necessity in their.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:48.360]   I don't know if X code will ever make sense on an iPad, frankly.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:53.160]   As I said, I still keep coming back to the whole statement about the Mac during WWDC
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:59.000]   was we think the Mac is the greatest computing platform ever for writing apps for iOS on.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   Yes.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   Like, what the?
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   That's the right thing.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.720]   That's only when you look at this with Playground, you know that that's, you know, a short,
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:06.720]   short-lived issue.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:12.400]   And I think that really for 90% of the population, maybe I, you could argue even 95% of the population,
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.800]   there's no reason to have a desktop computer or laptop anymore.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:19.880]   I mean, I just don't think that I think that it's more of us being not our model and not
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.320]   able to convert.
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.760]   But I think that it does everything that 90, 95% of the population.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.760]   Although that's it.
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:29.880]   That's an interesting question because here's my line of thought that if I, if it's, if
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:34.560]   I have bought my last MacBook, I have not bought my last Mac because now my thinking is
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:39.680]   that if I can't get a Mac book that I personally like, maybe the next thing, maybe what I should
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:45.480]   be thinking instead is to buy a super, super, instead of $2,000 for my Mac book, which I buy
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:51.560]   every two years or three years, I will spend $1,500 on the absolutely maxed out Mac mini.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:56.040]   And it will be this was wonderful desktop home and I will still use my iPad as my Rover
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.040]   as my, as my excursion unit, so to speak.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:03.960]   Because I'll, my MacBook Pro now spends most of its time docked to a screen, docked to
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.960]   a hard drive, docked to peripherals here in my office.
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.400]   And when I have to unplug it, that's a rare thing.
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.920]   I have to really want, I really have to really have a need to have all those ports and have
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:17.040]   a file system outside of my office in order for me to do that.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.920]   So maybe it's not so much abandoning the Mac so much as maybe they're saying that we've
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:25.240]   got, we've got a better field computer in the form of the, of the iPad.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:29.600]   And for something that's got to be sucked down to AC, why not go overboard and get something
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:36.080]   with 81 cores and 16 teraflops of processing power to blink the cursor while it's waiting
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.360]   for me to, for your machine learning Andy.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.360]   Yes.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:44.760]   So, Dieter Bon has a good article also addressing this issue of how do you, how do you pack
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:49.360]   desktop power into an iOS device?
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:54.080]   And he says, keep it simple, but as simple as possible, but no simpler.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:33:01.120]   And you know, he too has the screenshots of the kind of complex new UIs, but I think
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:05.400]   he's of the opinion that these, this is, this is kind of what, this is the compromise
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.400]   you have to make.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:11.720]   It's also really weird because they made most of the UI much information, less dense and
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:16.160]   they use those new big headline fonts on the top of applications and they made the text
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.560]   bigger and bolder again.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.600]   Like a lot of Texas really bold now.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.800]   And there's just, you don't fit as much on the space and it's really only control center
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.520]   where it got heavily information dancing in.
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:30.920]   He says he disagrees with the approach, but, but, but, yeah, I mean, I'm just going to
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.120]   have to use it and see.
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:39.920]   It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's clear what Apple is intent is.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.800]   Now the question really is, can we live with it?
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.880]   It's like, it's like using windows like shuffling cards.
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.920]   You just pick them up off the dock and throw them where you want them.
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:52.680]   Well, you know, it's interesting because Microsoft's done kind of a similar thing, but they've
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:55.480]   really hedged their bets saying, well, we're going to do a desktop operating system that
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.160]   can be used as a tablet.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.720]   And it's not a good tablet experience.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.480]   I don't think it really isn't.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.000]   So it depends what you're using it for.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.600]   I think it's a nice hybrid.
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:08.760]   I think it's a really, I think as a pure tablet experience, I don't think it can touch the
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:13.840]   iPad, but I like the idea of saying, well, what if we're not going to tell you that you
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:15.800]   shouldn't use multitouch anywhere.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:20.520]   Again, this one, one of the reasons why I did spend 500 bucks on this, on this carbon
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.200]   is I does have a touchscreen.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:26.560]   And even though this is really absolutely emphatically a keyboard and trackpad sort of
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:30.440]   operating system or device I'm using, it doesn't fold back or anything.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:34.360]   The number of times where I'm just sitting like at Starbucks and rather than using the
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:38.640]   trackpad to scroll, I just want to have my thumb on the screen holding it a little bit
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:39.640]   by the side.
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:40.640]   It's very natural.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:43.400]   And the number of times where I just need to tap a button, I'll see the button in front
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.400]   of me and Pevlovian.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.400]   There's a response to just reach out and tap it.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.400]   No, I'm not.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.320]   I think touch belongs in the desktop.
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:53.720]   But if you were to detach that screen, which you can't do on that think pad, but you can
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:57.600]   do on a lot of devices, including most of the Microsoft devices, and then try to use
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.600]   it as a tablet.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.600]   It's tough.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.600]   You can use touch targets.
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.360]   What you like, and I agree with you, is having a hybrid where you can use a mouse.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.360]   You could use a keyboard.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.120]   You could use touch.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.720]   And you use whatever is appropriate at the time.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:09.720]   It's appropriate.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:10.720]   And I completely agree with you.
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:14.200]   I mean, I use my think pad on this trip and I fell in love with it.
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:15.440]   It's a great computer.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.440]   I'm very.
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:20.000]   And also to be fair, I'm not a typical user.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   I'm kind of a nut.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   So I can.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.080]   I will spend $2,000 on a MacBook and also spend $1,000 on an iPad.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.480]   Most people have to choose.
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.240]   They've got $1,000 to spend on everything.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.720]   And if they can get a convertible, that will give them 70% of what you would get out of
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.480]   a conventional tablet.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.560]   That's a bonus for them.
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:38.560]   I was lucky.
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:43.200]   Look at people like Mike Elgin, who would use it exclusively a year ago or two years
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.460]   ago.
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.460]   We had Larry Maggett.
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:46.960]   There are a number of people who were just.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:47.960]   That's a little bit teaching.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:52.480]   And I thought you're really in order to do this, you have to suffer a little bit.
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.480]   You have to struggle a little bit.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.600]   And I just don't want to struggle or suffer.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:59.000]   And I'm kind of born into trouble just as far as play upward.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.200]   But I don't think you're just going to have to be a compromise much longer.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:06.000]   I still think that rather than one becoming the other, there's a lot of smart companies
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.680]   working on what replaces all of them.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:11.360]   And that'll be just a small mother box device that knows everything about you, has all your
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.360]   connections.
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:16.400]   And then whenever you come near a screen, it just moves your environment over to that.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.600]   They become endpoints, which a lot of companies have been talking about for a while.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.000]   They talked about thin clients.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.880]   I'm holding a this size piece of glass.
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.200]   I'm holding a that size piece of glass.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.200]   I'm in my car.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.200]   I'm at my desk.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.200]   I'm helping.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.320]   You're out with your watch.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:32.160]   And it just sort of manages everything about you and happens to know what control schemes
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.720]   are available depending on the device.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:34.720]   It's like, oh, I detect a mouse.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:35.720]   I detect a keyboard.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:36.720]   I detect multi-touch.
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.160]   I detect voice.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.160]   And it all works.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:42.000]   And that sort of feels like where all these companies are headed in a few.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   Maybe a few weeks later.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   That's what you do.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   That's what you do.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   That's what you do.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.120]   I know, I know, when it can't figure out which version of a song that I want to play when
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:53.680]   I say, okay, you know, you know, I feel like we're years away.
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:54.680]   I mean, you know, it's just pain.
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:58.880]   You have all of those devices in the house that I'm constantly testing.
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:05.000]   And it's just that the simple things that's getting wrong that, you know, that it makes
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.960]   me feel like we're probably a long way from that.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.560]   But I think Renee is correct to predict this because that's the trend, right?
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.560]   As you.
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:11.560]   I didn't know we wanted to go.
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:14.520]   As you know, intelligence everywhere.
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:22.600]   We're at this point still for really not good reasons tying the UI and the physicality to
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:25.920]   the computing, but there's no reason that you have to do that.
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:32.440]   So I like the idea of you carry with you computing power, but it uses whatever interface is
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.440]   available.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:36.160]   We haven't yet seen a very good implementation of that.
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:38.480]   Microsoft's trying to do that with continuum.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:41.080]   Samsung has its little box.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.240]   I played with it for a little bit.
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:46.600]   You connect your S8 to and you have a screen and a mouse and a keyboard.
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:47.600]   That's not it either.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.040]   It needs to be a little more fluid than that.
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:53.040]   But as far away until it's here, it's like autonomous.
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.040]   Well, it'll happen.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.640]   When it happens, it'll happen fast, I think.
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.680]   And I think that that's really what people want.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:01.840]   And the good news is that there's the three of the largest companies or all of the largest
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:07.120]   companies, the five largest companies, Microsoft, Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon are all
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:08.840]   competing in the same space.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:13.400]   So that's a good reason that we're all probably going to get something or a lot of it because
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:18.560]   they are all trying to take that space and I'm spending billions and billions of dollars
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.560]   to do it.
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:21.080]   Well, let's talk more about that in a bit.
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.720]   We've got lots more to say.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.240]   Annie and Akos here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:28.320]   Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core.
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:33.360]   I'm so always thrilled when I can get you on Alex's because your unique perspective as
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.000]   a power user is really valuable for us.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   Well, thank you.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   I always love being on it.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.640]   Just trying to fit it through the...
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:40.640]   Oh, I know.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:41.640]   You got a job.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.280]   The rest of us are not really gainfully employed.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.560]   So we could show up every Tuesday.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.480]   Well, governments don't rise and fall if we're not there.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:54.240]   Have you been... That's Renee Richie from i'mware.com.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:57.920]   We were watching House of Cards and there's this back stair that all the really interesting
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:01.440]   stuff in House of Cards happens in this back stair in the White House.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:02.600]   And we're watching it the other day.
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:06.440]   And Lisa says, "I think Alex Lindsey's been on that back stair.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.180]   Have you been on that back stair in the White House or can you not talk about it?"
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:12.640]   I don't think I can comment about what I've seen there.
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:16.160]   You're the one right now.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:20.240]   There's a lot of stairways in the White House that are pretty deep.
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:23.080]   We all know the cameras have been banned from the White House.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.240]   Alex has been totally screwed for that area of his business.
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.240]   He's now...
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.240]   He's now as an attorney.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.720]   He's drawn a sketch artist.
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:29.920]   I don't think you'll be doing...
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.440]   Yeah, I don't think you'll be doing Hangouts from the White House for a while.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:36.720]   No, I haven't had a lot of action in the White House.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.640]   Our show today brought to you by Kaptera.
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:44.280]   We frequently, when I do a radio show, when we do any show, one of the things people
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:50.200]   are always asking, emailing and calling is, "I need software to do X, Y or Z in my business.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.200]   What do you recommend?"
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:56.560]   And I have to say, I can recommend sometimes one or two things, but I can't talk about
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:59.200]   the whole range of available stuff.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.400]   And a Google search, it's kind of not the right way to do it either.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:08.440]   So if you're tasked to find software for your company, whether it's customer management,
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:15.680]   e-commerce, medical office management, church management, help desk software, I've got to
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.440]   tell you, Kaptera is a way to do this.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.520]   And it's absolutely free.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.800]   You go to kaptera.com/macbreak.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.280]   That way they'll know that you saw it on Macbreak.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.880]   That's all I ask.
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.880]   And you're going to see...
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.240]   Well let me just do a demo.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.320]   Pick a category for your business.
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.320]   I don't know.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.560]   What do you want to keep track of?
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:40.560]   Let's say you're Dr. Lindsey, and he's trying to run his medical practice, right?
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:45.480]   Now I just clicked one button and I'm getting the top medical practice management software
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.480]   products.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:53.000]   This is a complete listing plus independent user reviews vetted, so they're quality reviews
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.680]   by people who absolutely actually use it.
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:58.280]   But then look on the right, the way we can filter this.
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:01.560]   I can say, "Look, I only want to look at four star and up.
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:02.560]   I want to look at...
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.560]   Is it web-based or installed?"
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:05.320]   No, it should be web-based.
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.320]   What do you need to do?
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.640]   Do I have multiple physicians?
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:08.640]   Yes.
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:09.640]   Do I want to do patient billing?
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.640]   Yes.
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.200]   Do I want to do...
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.840]   It's got to be HIPAA compliant.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.360]   And then filter the results.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.360]   You can narrow it down to the stuff you want.
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.360]   And then watch this.
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.360]   I'm going to add...
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.880]   Okay, orchestra one, Athena collector.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.080]   This looks good.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.760]   I'm clicking the comparison.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.160]   See at the bottom.
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:30.240]   Take away the lower third for a second just so you can see what's happened as I click
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.240]   that.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:33.760]   I'm adding them to this comparison.
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:37.280]   Now I'm going to press compare and I'm going to get a chart comparing the four that I
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:42.880]   was interested in and the features, how it runs, what features.
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:43.880]   This is incredible.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:47.000]   And this is all completely free to you.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.880]   Four hundred categories of software.
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.280]   I mean everything.
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:57.160]   App development, business continuity, content marketing, file sharing, human resources,
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.760]   web analytics.
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:07.400]   For the 30,000 software solutions, 400 plus categories and hundreds of thousands of verified
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:11.000]   peer reviews and ratings from users just like you.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.080]   200,000 ratings and reviews.
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:19.480]   And they really work hard to keep track of these reviews to make sure that they're valuable.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.480]   This is fantastic.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.480]   I just want to let you know about it and it's free.
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.120]   There's no obligation.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.440]   You don't even register.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:29.240]   It's just a better directory.
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:32.760]   Don't Google and hope to find the right solution.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.840]   You do what you do.

[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.040]   Let's find out some other features.
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:21.040]   I love it.

[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.640]   We thank you so much for making MacBreak weekly a reality.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:33.080]   Alex Lindsay, Renee Ritchie, Andy Ennaco.
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.360]   I have an actual question for you.
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:38.880]   To get the public beta on my iPad, and I haven't done this for a long time, I usually
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:43.920]   stay away from the betas, but I go and I've logged in on the iPad.
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:44.920]   On the iPad.
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:45.920]   You've got to do it on the iPad.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.920]   With a registered developer account.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.920]   With a registered developer account on the iPad, right?
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:51.920]   Yeah.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:52.920]   Which I'm already ready to do.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:53.920]   I'm going to do it right now.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.920]   beta.apple.com.
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:56.920]   Yeah.
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:57.920]   Okay.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:58.920]   Yeah, there's the article.
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:06.560]   And you sign up and if you're already a developer, which I am, I'll sign in with my
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.560]   Apple ID.
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:09.640]   Okay, I won't do that.
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:12.200]   You're actually, I will do that, but I won't show you.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.040]   I won't show myself doing that.
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.040]   How about that?
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.040]   Secrets.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:19.640]   Then it sent me like the little code that I have to.
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:20.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.640]   You're already way ahead of me.
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:25.280]   It should give you a certificate to download, or does it give you a code with the public
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.280]   data?
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.280]   Oh, it gives me a.
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:31.480]   Are you doing the developer beta or the public beta, Alex?
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.480]   I'm in the Apple beta software program.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.480]   Okay.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.480]   So that's the public beta.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:39.080]   You can grab the developer beta.
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.480]   I have a developer account.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:42.480]   Okay.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.480]   That's a good question.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:44.480]   Which would I prefer?
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:45.480]   I'm a developer.
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:46.480]   Should I use the developer beta?
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.760]   Or is it, I mean, if you're a developer, the developer beta typically gets updated a
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.840]   few days earlier than the public beta.
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:55.360]   So if you're impatient, it's better to use the developer beta.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:58.160]   Also you developers get a beta, you know, they're one track ahead.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.160]   So public beta one is developer beta two.
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.920]   But might be a less stable.
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:07.120]   Yeah, it may in fact, from time to time be less stable.
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.120]   So you have to decide.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:12.840]   If you're living two weeks in the future, how much, how much you want to be in the future?
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:13.840]   But they'll be the same now.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:17.640]   I mean, because if public beta one is developer beta two, so developer beta three will be public
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:18.640]   beta two.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.720]   So it'll just be a few days later.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:24.960]   So maybe they'll catch a showstopper they didn't catch, but that's rare.
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.120]   So I've made my backup.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:31.560]   Now I download a profile beta.apple.com/profile.
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.720]   This is the certificate you were talking about.
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:35.080]   Yes.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:39.160]   So it's signed by AppleCare profile signing certificate verified.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:42.040]   So you, this is the prerequisite.
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:49.840]   After this, it's easy because yeah, once I do this, it will, it will then push an update.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.040]   It'll say, Oh, you have an up.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.000]   You have a system update.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   So I'm installing this profile.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.280]   It does require a restart.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.280]   That's interesting.
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.280]   Wow.
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:01.400]   I've never installed anything on my iPad that requires a restart.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:02.400]   That's hysterical.
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:05.400]   That's, but one thing that, yeah, it's a reboots.
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:11.600]   Now if I go to my system settings under general update, it will say, Oh yeah, you have a new
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:12.600]   version.
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:13.600]   Okay.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:14.600]   I don't know.
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:18.920]   And then from then on, it's probably in the developer part of it as opposed to the
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:19.920]   company.
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:20.920]   Well, I was in both.
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:21.920]   It'll give you certificate.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:25.880]   It's the same kind of certificate you get for both of them.
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:29.720]   Okay.
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:32.400]   Guess what's Thursday?
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:33.400]   Mm.
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:34.400]   Mm.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:35.400]   It's a big interview.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.400]   It's a big interview.
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:38.400]   It is a very big day.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:42.920]   It's a very big interview.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:44.320]   It's a big interview.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.320]   It's a big interview.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.320]   It's a big interview.
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:47.320]   It's a big interview.
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:48.320]   It's a big interview.
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.320]   It's a big interview.
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:50.320]   It's a big interview.
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.320]   It's a big interview.
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:52.320]   It's a big interview.
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:53.320]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:54.320]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.320]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.320]   I'm going to talk about it.

[00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:58.320]   It's a big interview.
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:46:59.320]   It's a big interview.
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.320]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.320]   I'm going to talk about it.

[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:15.320]   I'm going to talk about it.

[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.320]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.320]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.320]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:48.320]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.320]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:50.320]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:51.320]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:52.320]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:53.320]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:54.320]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.320]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:56.320]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.320]   It's beautiful though.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.320]   It's just iconic at this point.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:47:59.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:00.320]   It was skeuomorphic.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:02.320]   I was going to talk about it on my trio.
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.320]   That's what I had before my iPhone.
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:05.320]   I'm waiting in line.
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:07.320]   I'm going to get this new thing called an iPhone.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:10.320]   Remember that picture of Scott Bourne?
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:14.320]   We should have gotten Scott on the show today.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.320]   He's been very nostalgic.
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:17.320]   No, born.
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:24.320]   He's been very nostalgic in the last few weeks on Facebook posting.
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:31.320]   Pictures of him getting his new iPhone and how he had the most popular one time iPhone
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:34.320]   podcast in the world.
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:35.320]   It's so cute.
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:39.320]   Did you see when Scott Bourne said he never heard the word skeuomorphic for him?
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:40.320]   It was photo illustrative.
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:41.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:42.320]   You did, by the way.
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:43.320]   Thank you.
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:48.320]   You did a great summary of that video at the Computer History Museum, John Markoff interviewing
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.320]   all these great people.
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:54.320]   I'm at Scott's page, see if he has that picture of him.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:57.320]   He's been buying his iPhone vest.
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:58.320]   His iPhone vest.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.320]   Yeah.
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:00.320]   Wow.
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:01.320]   There it is.
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:04.320]   Ten years ago, I was hosting the most popular iPhone podcast in the world.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.320]   Everyone was telling me I was crazy.
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:11.320]   They said the iPhone was a fad and would never take off.
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:13.320]   Scott was a believer.
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:15.320]   Scott was a believer.
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:18.320]   He knew and he was so excited.
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:25.120]   I want to get that, find that picture of him coming out of the store holding his iPhone
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:26.120]   up high.
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:27.120]   Remember that?
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:28.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:29.720]   Oh, tell me your story, Renee.
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:30.720]   You were in Canada.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:32.320]   So you couldn't buy it.
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:33.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:34.320]   No, I couldn't.
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:38.320]   I was stuck on a trio, a 680 and a trio pro or something just looking at the rest of the
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:39.320]   world.
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:42.320]   We're looking at the US with abject jealousy.
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:46.120]   I brought one of these for Amber MacArthur.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:49.720]   This was probably a few months later when somebody had cracked it.
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:50.920]   That's when I got mine.
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:54.640]   You could use it in Canada on Rogers or Telstra or not Telstra.
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:55.640]   That's australia.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:58.480]   And it was $200 for 100 megabytes of data in Canada back then.
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:49:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:00.480]   I brought it up to her.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.480]   She never used it.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.120]   I found that later.
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:04.200]   She liked her blackberry.
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:06.120]   She wasn't going to use it.
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:09.800]   I think blackberries were the last holdout because there was a lot of reasons that people
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:10.800]   used their blackberry.
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:11.800]   Also Canadian.
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.120]   We still see them a couple of times.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.920]   We see them in some government areas.
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:23.480]   I traded in my, that was my last smartphone before the iPhone was the pearl, the blackberry
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:24.840]   with the pearl.
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:27.360]   What was your story, Alex?
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:28.640]   How did you get your first iPhone?
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:32.560]   I remember sitting in WWDC with you and Scott.
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:33.560]   We were excited.
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:34.560]   It's forward.
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:38.880]   Today, we're announcing three new products.
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:40.720]   We already went through that in January.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:48.440]   And internet browser, it was an internet device, a music player, a widescreen iPod, a widescreen
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:51.120]   iPod and a phone.
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:52.520]   Another legendary phone.
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:53.520]   I think it would break on.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.720]   I was like hanging on the iPhone.
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:58.280]   My old phone wasn't working.
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:01.760]   I was like, I am not buying a new phone because Apple is releasing a phone.
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:02.760]   They're going to release a phone.
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:04.440]   And so I'm not going to buy a new phone.
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:05.440]   Nobody believed it.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:12.640]   Oh, I had the angriest I ever got with AT&T.
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:17.320]   Got me in such a state that I had literally hang up the phone after two weeks of trying
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:23.000]   to solve this problem with them and thinking that I really feel the need to cancel and
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.480]   I AT&T.
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:29.000]   But this was like eight months before the announcement of the iPhone.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:34.160]   And I said, the best information I have right now is that AT&T either has already signed
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:39.120]   a contract to be the exclusive carrier of the iPhone of the Apple phone or they are
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:40.520]   very close to it.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:44.920]   Andy, are you willing to cut off your nose to that extent so you're going to have to
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:52.640]   sign up with AT&T again sometime next year to get the phone or are you going to eat mud
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.560]   on this issue?
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:59.520]   Give them the pay them the $75 that you are absolutely not required to pay them for and
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:03.560]   extend your contract for a year which you are not required to do.
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:04.560]   Okay, fine.
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:05.560]   I'll have to eat spit.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:06.720]   I want to let them.
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:10.800]   I want to let them know that it's because I know that they're getting the iPhone.
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:13.440]   That's the only reason why I'm putting up with this garbage.
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:17.880]   Andy, Alex Lindsey, who was on.
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:25.800]   So this is Mac Break Weekly number 46 June 29th, 2007.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:28.040]   We called the name of the show was I Day.
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:29.040]   It was Merlin.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.040]   I know was on it.
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.800]   Alex was on it.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:34.640]   You weren't on it yet, Andy, right?
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:35.640]   People you trust.
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:36.640]   I guess.
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:38.440]   Oh, no, I was on that show.
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:39.440]   Were you?
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:41.880]   Well, it says so, but that's because.
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:43.680]   Okay, sorry.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.840]   Yeah, ignore this.
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:50.840]   I miss skip ahead.
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:53.400]   Alex Lindsey is here from Pixel board.
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:54.720]   He has an iPhone.
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:57.440]   Scott Born is here from Apple phone show.com.
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.800]   He has an iPhone.
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:02.360]   Merlin man is here from 43 folders.com and the Merlin man show.
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:07.040]   He does not have a phone, but he did a great segment on that about the iPhone.
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:08.280]   He only got him one later.
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.440]   He's ending the hold out.
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:13.440]   Yeah, necessarily come out just hold out.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:15.000]   And I think there are quite a few holdouts.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:20.880]   I think a lot of people in fact, it was my advice to anybody who isn't a fanatic.
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:22.560]   A lot of people did hold out.
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:23.840]   Say wait for generation two.
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.840]   Is that what you're waiting for?
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:26.840]   Generation two.
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:27.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:32.240]   Well, this one actually may name not bad because this does not do 3G.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:33.240]   Right?
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:36.320]   Yeah, remember that there was so it didn't do cut paste.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.320]   It didn't have apps.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.320]   Didn't have it.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:39.320]   It didn't store apps.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:40.320]   It had a keyboard.
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:46.000]   They had the first all glass fake keyboard that if you'd used it, you were shocked and
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.560]   delighted at how easy was to use.
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:52.960]   If you had not used it, you're going to be like, I'm going to I'm spending $450 for a
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:55.320]   phone that doesn't have a keyboard.
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:56.320]   Okay.
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:59.920]   Well, also it was hard to it was for the longest time.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:02.440]   I couldn't type my name on an iPhone.
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:04.280]   It didn't have brick breaker.
[00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:11.600]   I kept having to tell people the secret is to don't don't think just type.
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:15.960]   Yeah, I think just screens were too small and it just never LaPorte just never came
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:16.960]   out right.
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.280]   Yeah, I don't know why, but I just it was very hard.
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:22.120]   The person who invented AutoCorrect is the same person who created Internet Explorer, Dean
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:23.280]   Hachimovich from Microsoft.
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:24.640]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:25.640]   Yeah.
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:31.240]   I have to say that launch day was a little bit heartbreaking for me because whenever people
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:36.840]   try to try to understand exactly how excited people were about the iPhone, I tell them
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:43.040]   about how look I got I had a briefing right after the keynote in January was introduced.
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:46.600]   And I got to like hold one of what must have been I now know we're like only like two or
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:50.040]   three functioning iPhones and use it unrestricted.
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:55.320]   And it was like what what news from gallery you you you actually touched the hem of Jesus
[00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:56.320]   what hand was that?
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:59.200]   What hand do you hold the iPhone is?
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:00.920]   Can I touch that hand as well?
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:03.360]   I'm like, oh, the scrolling was smooth.
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:08.200]   It was like like the like the waves of a calm tranquil ocean lapping toward the shore.
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:10.680]   By the way, I got so many meals off of that.
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:12.120]   That's how excited people were.
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:13.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:17.840]   Just to get stories of what it was like to use an iPhone was solid gold currency back
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:18.840]   then.
[00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:23.400]   Just for your information, Alex, I restarted, mainly went to software update iOS 11 public
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:25.720]   beta 1.8 gigs.
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:31.040]   I don't know where you started and I've gone through both of them and I never saw them.
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:32.680]   I must mean some kind of loop.
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:33.680]   I don't know why.
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:35.160]   No, it was very easy for me.
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:36.640]   Maybe a little too easy on my right.
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:38.840]   It's an anti Alex filter because I didn't back up.
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:41.360]   Yeah, it's like don't let Alex do this right now.
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:45.240]   That is not a list on a rat hole, but this is a timely place to anybody see that video
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:51.080]   of that that sports commentator who is trying to like live comment on the on the NFL draft
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:52.080]   or whatever.
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:55.880]   And he who's using his iPhone to like make his picks or make his bets or whatever he's
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.240]   live streaming all this.
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:58.840]   And he accidentally tapped the button.
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:00.160]   Yes, update my update.
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:01.160]   I was right now.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:05.000]   And so his is extremely valuable live stream stream.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.840]   Continuum because of him holding up the camera, the phone, the camera saying, yep, it's still
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:09.840]   updating.
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:11.680]   So I can't actually get any information.
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:16.480]   Oh, that's happened to me many times during the show.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:21.040]   I remember there was an update for Windows and I forgot that the Windows machine was
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:24.600]   using was the one I had a Skype call with Paul Theron on.
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:25.840]   And I said, Oh, I got an update.
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:30.160]   He said, don't hit it or don't hit it.
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:31.960]   We came back about 10 minutes later.
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:34.880]   So it should be like war games.
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:41.280]   Like two people have to turn virtual keys on iPhone simultaneously for it'll go.
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:45.440]   Here's the Mac rumors article.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:48.360]   Original iPhones first for reviewers reminise.
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:53.520]   This is of course the Mount Everest of tech journalists.
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:58.240]   David Pogue did this on CBS Sunday morning.
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:02.920]   David, of course, he was at the New York Times at the time.
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:07.680]   Ed Begg who was at USA Today, Walt Mossberger who was at the Mossberg who was at the Wall
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:09.360]   Street Journal.
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:13.320]   And Stephen Levy who was at Newsweek right at the time.
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:14.960]   Apparently jobs kept calling them.
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:21.120]   By David Pogue, tech critic for Yahoo Finance.
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:24.200]   There's been a lot of talk about this soon to be released iPhone.
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:26.800]   It's got everything you need to pull wrapped up in one.
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:31.360]   The Apple Store staying open until midnight to meet the huge demand.
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:32.920]   iPhone!
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:37.080]   Ten years ago this week, the iPhone was arriving in stores.
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:38.240]   You have no shame.
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:40.800]   The lines were better than though, weren't they?
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:45.560]   There were fewer people holding places for Chinese resellers.
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:49.000]   It's also like now they made a conscious choice.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.160]   Like Angela Arons doesn't want people to wait for the phones to do the orders right
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:53.160]   away now.
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:56.840]   The marketing team I'm sure would prefer the lines because it's short headlines for them.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:57.840]   Look at this.
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:57:58.840]   This is fun.
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:02.200]   David's got an example of what it was like.
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:06.720]   I mean, just so you understand what 2007 was like.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:12.240]   Here's a full page ad of President's birthday sale from the newspaper of that era.
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:17.720]   They were still selling to set players and micro thin calculators and $799.
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:18.720]   Those are gold.
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:19.720]   I don't know.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:20.720]   Is that really?
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:21.720]   This has to be earlier than that, right?
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:23.720]   This looks like 1980, 1997.
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:26.800]   Yeah, he's definitely going way back now.
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:29.200]   We had to look at maps.
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:30.200]   Remember that?
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:36.760]   The iPhone, we become a nation of distracted drivers, distracted walkers, and the...
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.760]   David does a great job on CBS Sunday morning.
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:40.120]   But yeah, those were the...
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:43.920]   So was the reaction universally positive for that first iPhone?
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:44.920]   No.
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:45.920]   I did.
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:46.920]   My old boss.
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:48.560]   I mean, he famously wrote, "It doesn't have apps.
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:50.160]   Not a real smartphone."
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:51.160]   Yeah.
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:53.160]   But that's...
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:55.640]   You can't really blame them for saying...
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:59.360]   There are people who go out and they buy a phone, not because they're excited about the
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:04.360]   latest gadget, but because I need something that I can place calls on, that I can receive
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:10.200]   calls on, I also need to keep up with my email and lots of furious text messages.
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:16.640]   And it really was a year or two before the iPhone and the iOS was really fully built out.
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:22.720]   It got its occupancy permit 10 years ago this week, but it really wasn't a home to live
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:24.640]   in until about two years later.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:26.080]   Again, no cut copy and paste.
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:30.320]   It took forever to just say...
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:36.520]   I wrote an entire book, an entire book series on how to get things working on an iPhone
[00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:38.200]   that are trivially...
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:42.440]   Without mentioning it, are trivially easy to do on a Windows phone or a Blackberry or
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:44.400]   on a trio.
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:45.920]   I was using this.
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:50.320]   The best feature of the first iPhone for me was the screenshot feature because that's
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:53.920]   how I would copy something to save it for later.
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:55.920]   Like there's a piece of information that I need to throw in.
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:59.080]   The thing that Mossberg asked them to keep and they never intended to keep it.
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:00.080]   And he said, "No, no, no, leave this.
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.080]   Reviewers need this."
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.080]   That's right, I heard.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.080]   I think it was Pogue.
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:05.080]   But yes, it was Pogue.
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:07.040]   It was the Pogue feature.
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.680]   It's such a funny story because, well, a couple of things.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:13.680]   When I had a meter on iMore, a Deeter meter that would go up and up as Apple added features
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:15.680]   until it would hit the red wheel smart.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.680]   Oh, that's smart.
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:19.360]   You were working for them in 2007?
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.680]   Towards the end, yeah, I missed the iPhone, but I started off that.
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:24.680]   But some of the stuff was just that Apple had never built a phone before and for example,
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.840]   it had no MMS.
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:28.760]   And the reason for that is, Apple's like, "We have a real browser.
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:29.760]   We have Safari.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.200]   We don't need a stupid WAP browser."
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:34.920]   And then it turned out that MMS is displayed through WAP and they realized that too late
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.560]   out of WAP browser.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:38.880]   This is Kent German has some guts.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:45.440]   He republished his CNET review with annotations.
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:49.600]   The bottom line, despite some important missing features, a slow data network and call quality
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:54.240]   that doesn't always deliver the Apple iPhone sends a new benchmark for an integrated
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:58.080]   cell phone and MP3 player.
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:02.440]   I guess because the iPod was so big at this time, you had to say, "Oh, it's an MP3 player."
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:03.440]   Exactly.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:04.440]   Well, I think the real...
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:09.240]   I mean, this was a really great phone until apps became something that you could add.
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.760]   And as soon as that happened, I think it turned into a platform.
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:15.160]   Well, it didn't have stereo Bluetooth, so you couldn't...
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:17.160]   No, it's also...
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:20.520]   It also didn't have a headphone jack for heaven's sakes.
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:25.320]   It was for that stupid reason that we don't want something to disturb the bezel.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:30.320]   They decided to inset the headphone jacks you needed this freaky little tiny tiny...
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.320]   It was so deep.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.820]   ... new headphone jack.
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:35.560]   And that was like, "Oh, wow, that was an idiotic thing to do."
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:36.560]   But oh well.
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:40.400]   Hey, you have that nice little rounded angle.
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:41.400]   That's something...
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.880]   Instead, Apple headphones, that's probably all the contested anti-cant.
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:44.880]   Exactly.
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:47.440]   Why would you not want to use the beautiful Apple headphones?
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.440]   You're welcome.
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:52.200]   I also said, "Wait for the next generation, because it's so expensive.
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.720]   $5.99 for the 8-GIG.
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:58.440]   $3.99 for the 4-GIG iPhone."
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.680]   I guess 4Gigs was a lot in 2007.
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:03.160]   Yeah, if you're not running apps, it's perfectly fine.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.160]   Yeah.
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:08.920]   And also remember that they dropped the price only a couple months after they gave Apple
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:12.240]   Store credit to people who had bought it at the original price.
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.560]   But the 3GS was the one that really...
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:15.560]   That was the one for everybody.
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:19.800]   That was one where you didn't have to be an enthusiast in order to love this phone.
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:24.840]   And again, it's not something that really Apple should be dinged about.
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:31.560]   It's hard to explain exactly how complicated it is to build an entire new phone from scratch,
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.360]   which is what Apple was doing.
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:35.520]   Especially if you try to...
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:41.320]   It's one of those few things where you really can't impose a lot of control over the user,
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:45.440]   because this is still the most intimate device that you own.
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:48.680]   It connects you to people in case of emergency.
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:53.560]   And it allows you to take an extra half-hour for lunch, because you know that you can keep
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:57.640]   on top of things in case of things back in the office where people can reach you.
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:02.920]   So if you decide that we think that it needs to be more secure and by maintaining the sandbox,
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:05.640]   if we let people cut, move a phone over, out of...
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:06.640]   No, no, no.
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:10.640]   You mean that you can't do the simple thing that I need my BlackBerry to do on this new
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:11.640]   phone?
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:12.640]   Well, great.
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:13.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:16.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:19.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:20.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:21.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:22.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:23.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:24.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:25.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:26.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:27.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:28.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:29.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:32.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:38.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:45.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:52.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:53.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:54.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:55.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:56.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:58.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:03:59.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:00.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:01.640]   I'll see you in a couple of years.
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:05.640]   I think that it's good for Apple, but I think that there wouldn't have been much left if
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:11.640]   Google hadn't put out a good solution that was not iOS.
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:15.640]   To Andy's thing though, they had to get that out the door and then once it shipped with
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:18.640]   iPhone OS, 1.0, they went back and rewrote everything.
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:21.640]   They made scroll view, UI scroll view, and they made table view, UI table view.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:22.640]   They had no time to make apps.
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:25.640]   They had that team which went on a forced march.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:28.640]   They had to race to that headline and a marathon of sprints.
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:31.640]   They had to turn around and then start racing towards App Store for the second one, which
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.640]   is like running a second forced march.
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:35.640]   They have small teams and everyone had to be.
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:39.640]   Steve Jobs had to personally disclose everybody who was on that team and one of the funniest
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:45.640]   stories was Nitin Gannatra when he was saying that because Steve was sometimes not there,
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:48.640]   he had engineers who were trying to code things and they weren't disclosed so they couldn't
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:49.640]   see the UI.
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:52.640]   We had to go into the room and look at it and then come back and describe it to them so
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:54.640]   they could start engineering it.
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:57.640]   It's almost a miracle that they got that things shipped on time.
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:01.640]   Yeah, it's like Brian Murchin's new book, The Secret History of the iPhone.
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:05.640]   I haven't read the full book yet but I've read The New York Times piece and The Excerpts
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:08.640]   from it and the thing that really just gets to you to the heart is the engineer says,
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:13.640]   "Yep, that my marriage ended partly because of that year I spent doing nothing but focusing
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:18.640]   on the iPhone 24/7 and I didn't really have an option once I was on that team but to focus
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.640]   on this and give it 100% of my time."
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:26.640]   Hopefully these days people are better coached on look, the other reason, go home at seven,
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:32.640]   go to bed at 1 a.m., come back to the office at 7 a.m. but go home at some point and give
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:37.640]   attention to your kids and to your spouse because this phone is going to be crap in five years
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:40.640]   anyway but hopefully you'll still have a marriage and still have a family.
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:43.640]   It's hard to hear this behind the scenes.
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.640]   It's all different now.
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:50.640]   Recode, Recode did some great graphs that show you how the iPhone changes things.
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:54.640]   Here's one voice versus data traffic in monthly bytes.
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:06:00.640]   The voice is basically flats gone up a little bit over ten years but look at how data traffic
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:01.640]   has gone up.
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:02.640]   This is iOS and Android.
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:06.640]   This is all traffic over mobile but it just shows you.
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:09.640]   I mean the world has really changed photography.
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:12.640]   Digital photos taken worldwide by device.
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:18.640]   The red bar is by camera phone and over the, this is only six years.
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.640]   Camera phones have basically taken over.
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:24.640]   There's 85% of all digital photos now from camera phones.
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:29.000]   And none of that would have been possible if not for such a long list of ways that the
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   iPhone changed everything.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.240]   One of them being that again seems amazing right now to the idea that a handset manufacturer
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:39.280]   now gets to build the phone that they want to build for customers that they know are
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:40.880]   out there before then.
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:46.040]   The reason why, remember that AT&T was just stopped being singular I think for like 10
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:47.360]   seconds after that.
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:51.240]   They were not on the ropes but they were clearly getting their clock cleaned.
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:54.880]   And the fact that they were the one company that was desperate enough to say look fine.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.640]   We will build, we will let you build whatever phone you want.
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:02.600]   We will adapt our network so that we'll use whatever features this phone needs to use.
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:08.760]   The idea of having extended caller ID and the ability to have like a navigable voicemail
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:12.960]   is something that was required to support on the par, par the carrier.
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:18.880]   But just the ability to run a web browser saying no, it's not going to be a micro browser,
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:21.520]   it's not going to use a special web protocol or anything like that.
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:24.320]   It's going to run real web browser.
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:29.600]   Which means it's going to put an incredible taxation on the network capabilities of the
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:35.400]   carrier because something that Verizon was not letting manufacturers do because they knew
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.560]   they would kill their network.
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:39.560]   They did not have the capability or if they did they didn't want to have to find out about
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:40.560]   it.
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:47.000]   Because AT&T said okay, we decided that we do want to be a successful company now.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.560]   We will let you do that.
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.600]   That's how all these apps started to come up.
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:53.040]   That's why people started to actually rely on these things.
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:57.800]   That's why I can upload a, I can send a photo to somebody else without having to pay $12
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:02.800]   a month for an extra AT&T photo family share feature.
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:06.680]   That's long as I talk, 10 of my friends into also signing up for this feature for the cost
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:11.760]   of $1.13 per photo, I can send photos to people independently.
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:17.640]   It's because Apple essentially brow beat AT&T and saying we will basically put this device
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:22.560]   on your data stream and however the user wants to use it is totally up to them and you're
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:26.560]   just going to have to build a network that can deal with that.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:30.800]   It's lovely to talk about the designs, talk about multi-touch but even just these simple
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:36.920]   business things about saying that Google and HTC and Samsung can simply build a phone
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:40.760]   that they think is going to sell as up to the carriers to simply have a network that's
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.200]   going to support it well.
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:45.880]   That's the reality we live in and that was not the reality 10 years and 10 days ago.
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:49.600]   Here's another great story from Forest Hall when he said that AT&T kept calling.
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:50.680]   They had no idea what the phone was.
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:53.520]   Apple would not tell him anything about the phone and they would keep calling going.
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:54.520]   Can you give it an email button?
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:55.520]   We heard that email is really popular.
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:59.000]   Can you give it a button that does email and Scott would mess with them by going, we'll
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   think about it.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.440]   Maybe we'll roll that out in the future release.
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:03.520]   They go, "Oh my God, they're building a Lego phone."
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.240]   Because they're all ideaable hardware center.
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:10.280]   I will say the thing that I'm most excited about this, the book is it has lots of inside
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:16.480]   baseball stuff about how much the Motorola rocker phone sucked.
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:22.760]   The Motorola phone that could also play off of an iTunes library, be synced like an iPhone
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:28.240]   and how hated and despised this phone was and how Steve, the story about Steve Jobs seeing
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:33.320]   it for the first time and saying, "This is utter garbage and we have no alternative
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:35.760]   but to release it now."
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:40.840]   The amount of influence that this phone design had upon them redoubling their efforts to not
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:45.880]   only make a phone but make a phone that actually showed off Apple as a positive thing, not
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:50.080]   as a simple add-on service to a terrible cheap plastic phone that doesn't really work very
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:51.680]   well.
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:54.920]   Here's a surprising side effect.
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:59.600]   What do you do when you're in the line at the grocery store?
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:03.600]   If you don't have a smartphone nowadays, you play Candy Crush Saga for a couple of minutes
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.240]   or clash of clams.
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:09.920]   In the old days, you'd buy chewing gum and look through People magazine.
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:13.880]   This now, I don't know if there's a real connection here, but Euro monitor did a study
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:21.440]   and this is the cumulative change in US, not gun, gum, chewing gum sales since the iPhone
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:22.960]   came out and it's a plummet.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:23.960]   It's a plummet.
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:24.960]   It's amazing.
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:31.480]   Four percent down to negative 15 percent over the last 10 years.
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:33.880]   And iPhone 9's are slapped as wings and Beijing and something.
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:39.160]   It's growing yearly when the iPhone came out and it's just nobody choose gum anymore.
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:40.160]   We don't have to.
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:43.160]   It's almost there's still just a hand and candy in that aisle.
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:47.880]   I don't think that's probably a specious step, but I like it.
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:49.120]   Thank you, Rico.
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.560]   Now gun sales on the other hand have been way out.
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:54.160]   Yeah, so that's what I want to see.
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:11:00.800]   It was very flat until the iPhone was released and then it has grown by 60 to 80 percent.
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:01.800]   You see?
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:02.800]   You see?
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:03.800]   Media consumption.
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:04.800]   Look at that.
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:05.800]   It's going up.
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:06.800]   But those are the skins.
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:07.800]   Those are the skins in video games.
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:10.960]   Media consumption has been going up, but mobile internet media consumption has gone up
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:13.160]   so much it's starting to rival television.
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:19.760]   122 minutes per day on mobile internet compared to 164 minutes per day on television.
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:23.280]   It's a bigger global story because they don't have to build out the infrastructure anymore.
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:25.280]   Everything just went to mobile and to personal screens.
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:28.760]   You could skip that entire technology divide.
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:36.720]   This is the year mobile ad spending will surpass desktop ad online ad spending, not a surprise.
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:42.440]   And of course, the biggest change, Apple and the Apple business model.
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:50.080]   The top bar is in 2006, Apple's revenue, $19 billion, 40 percent iPod, 38 percent max,
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:51.840]   the largest chunk.
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:58.960]   2016, it made more than 10 times more, $216 billion, 63 percent of that iPhone's 11 percent
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:00.040]   max.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:05.400]   And if you wonder why the Mac isn't getting the attention, iOS is getting that.
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:06.400]   That number tells it all.
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:07.400]   Yeah.
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.400]   It's iOS in total.
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:13.560]   The poorest they do, if I don't have a number, I think last week saying that sometime this
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:18.320]   year, iOS will have generated $1 trillion in revenue for Apple.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.320]   Wow.
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:20.320]   Oh, wow.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:21.320]   Yeah.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:22.800]   Some nice job on that.
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:23.960]   Some really fun charts.
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:24.960]   There's more.
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:31.000]   I didn't get to all of them on recode how iPhone changed the world.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:38.880]   Here from ours, Technica, the staff's favorite iPhone games from 2008.
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:44.040]   There really weren't any games in 2007.
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:48.840]   So we had to, we had Dizzy B from igloo games.
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.120]   Don't remember that one.
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:51.120]   Motion X poker.
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.120]   Motion X.
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:53.120]   I remember that.
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:59.600]   That dice game got me through a year of having to wait for relatives and hospitals.
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:06.080]   That was my fetish device for the entire year.
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:07.880]   We didn't need spinner fidget.
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:10.960]   We'd shake our phones to roll the die.
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:13.120]   Isn't that funny?
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:14.120]   Scrabble.
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:18.520]   Scrabble was quickly replaced by words with friends though, right?
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:19.760]   Those were on the original iPhone, right?
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:21.360]   Because there was no app store until 2008.
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.600]   Yeah, no, this is 2008.
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.880]   So these are more recent.
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:28.720]   So Hasbro, I guess, which owns the actual Scrabble trademark was the only one able to
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:30.320]   make a real Scrabble.
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:33.600]   But frankly, words with friends completely eclipsed that.
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.040]   I don't remember eye drops.
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:37.200]   This is Tetris, basically, right?
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:38.640]   It was Trism was a big one.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:39.640]   Trism, yeah.
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:41.960]   And what was the monkey one that spent the monkey in the ball?
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:42.960]   Monkey Ball, Super Monkey Ball.
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:43.960]   Super Monkey Ball.
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:45.880]   There's Aurora faint.
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.040]   This was actually pretty good.
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:50.640]   This was another Tetris or more like a bejeweled clone.
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:52.280]   And Nigma, remember that?
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:53.280]   You'd make puzzles.
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:56.440]   You'd solve little puzzle problems.
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:02.240]   Let's see if we can skip ahead to him playing a Nigma on the original iPhone it looks like.
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:03.240]   Yeah.
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:06.840]   And you'd have to solve these little physical puzzles.
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:11.200]   You know, I just, it just occurred to me that the fact that the iPhone is so locked
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:15.840]   down means that I wonder if it's going to be possible 10 years from now for them to have
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:19.320]   emulators online to preserve some of this cultural legacy.
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:25.080]   Just like that right now, you can play Mac games from the 1980s online editor-in-art archive
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:26.680]   because the source code is there.
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:29.080]   They could simply build a version of it.
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:31.800]   It sounds like it sounds like you're trying to make fun of something here, but that is
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:34.680]   part of it is game game design is an art.
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:36.160]   It is a form of expression.
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.160]   I agree on it.
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:42.840]   It would be horrible if an entire generation of creative expression disappears because
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:45.160]   it was a platform that was so locked down.
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:49.760]   I hope that some accommodation can be made so that this stuff can be preserved forever.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.280]   We did a great job in general.
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:58.600]   The triangulation with the guy who created a lot of the LucasArts games and then went
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.360]   on to do humongous games.
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:05.360]   I can't remember his name, but Ron Gilbert, Ron Gilbert.
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:08.680]   But he said, I asked him that because Ron created a bunch of these games.
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:11.040]   I said, how do you feel about emulators?
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.440]   He said, yeah, this is art.
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:13.440]   This is my art.
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:15.360]   I'm glad if people still play the games.
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:17.360]   Even Lucas might not be.
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:19.640]   Nintendo might not be.
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:21.560]   But I'm glad because this was my art.
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:22.560]   This is a big creation.
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:23.560]   This is years of my life.
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.440]   I'm glad that people play them in an ad.
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:29.880]   Do you guys remember before the App Store, Lucas Newman and Adam Bette lights off the
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:33.280]   first game that actually got running on native code back when the Caulkin Berry was working
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.880]   on jailbreak and everybody else?
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:39.480]   There were some really good jailbreak apps in that first year before the App Store came
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:40.480]   in.
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:43.240]   I was just used to it and Smith has taken that over.
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:44.840]   He puts it on everything that comes out.
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:50.920]   If Nintendo Switch comes out, I'm sure he's ported it to that already.
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:52.800]   I guess I could mention my hand.
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:55.560]   Remember how magical a jailbroken phone was though?
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:56.560]   Yes.
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.280]   Oh my God, I'm using tethering.
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:02.040]   I'm actually sharing my data connection.
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:03.280]   What sorcery is this?
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:04.760]   We got tethering before the US did.
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:05.760]   It was a main.
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:10.040]   I think everywhere outside the US got tethering a year earlier because AT&T was so dead set
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.960]   against it.
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:13.600]   It's still a nightmare.
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:16.080]   By the way, we should say it was singular when it first came out.
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:17.640]   It wasn't AT&T yet or was it?
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:18.640]   Yeah.
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:19.640]   It was transition.
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:22.480]   It was AT&T, then it was singular.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:27.200]   It was singular when I had my brew ha ha with the company.
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:29.800]   What happened was I had a Windows phone that I loved.
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:32.000]   It was like a Star Trek communicator.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000]   It wasn't exactly that, but it was like a beautiful phone.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:40.040]   My old sim would not work with a new one and they needed to give me a bare sim and
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:42.960]   they said, "We're going to extend your, we're going to put you under your, one of your
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:46.040]   contract because we can't give you a new sim without a new contract."
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:49.400]   I'm off contract right now and it was just, I was just offended by that.
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:50.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:51.520]   So that's why that's burned into my mind.
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:53.880]   It was singular at the time than AT&T.
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:17:00.200]   One of the side effects of the iPhone was it created some YouTube stars including a young
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:02.480]   woman we know pretty well.
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.120]   I just dean.
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:06.680]   She got her new iPhone and then she got her iPhone bill.
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:12.920]   It came in a box because AT&T in the time really couldn't figure out how to do it.
[01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:19.200]   How to combine all those messages into a single line.
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:28.720]   So she had a page.
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:32.280]   I think this was Justine's first really big video, right?
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:33.280]   I think it was.
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:35.080]   We're going through her iPhone bill.
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:38.280]   I think she had been on a, she had been on a, on a one-
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:39.280]   She'd have been on a Macquarie weekly.
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.520]   Yeah, sure.
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:41.520]   You introduced me to her.
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:44.320]   Do you met her at Wordcamp and Pittsburgh or something?
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.320]   Yeah.
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:49.120]   Yeah, it was a, it was an un, an uncamp I think that was for podcasting.
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:50.120]   Yeah.
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:53.440]   And she was the, she was in a couple of my classes and she had all the, all the right
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:54.440]   questions.
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:55.760]   She says, there's a young woman out of Pittsburgh.
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:56.760]   You've got to meet.
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:58.840]   Should be great on a Macquarie weekly.
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:02.400]   We did have her on very early on.
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:04.960]   300 pages.
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:08.040]   The fact that this is how old it is.
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:11.560]   60blogsnack.com is the URL.
[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:12.560]   Ah, remember that.
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:14.840]   That was her like, yeah.
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:16.400]   And then mom make me a sandwich too.
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:18.440]   I think was one of her sites.
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:23.920]   So I think I'm paused because I'm only 40% battery on my iOS 11 install.
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:24.920]   I think I'm in plug-in.
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:25.920]   I passed you.
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:27.920]   I went from behind.
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:28.920]   I don't even know how.
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:32.360]   I just kept on hitting things in the developer page until I saw a download button and then
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:34.360]   I get the download button and then I just kept on going.
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:37.800]   It really is like trying to get foreigner tickets on the ticket.
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:39.800]   Keep reloading the page.
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:41.720]   And then I was like a new button appeared.
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:43.200]   I was like, oh, there's a blue download button.
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.200]   I'll hit that.
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:45.200]   I need a yeah.
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:46.440]   John, give me a power supply.
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:49.080]   I've got to catch up with a Mr. Lindsey here.
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:50.080]   He's ahead.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.080]   He's beating me.
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:52.320]   Hit stop, hit stop.
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.320]   Have you rebooted yet, Alex?
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:54.320]   Are you in?
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:55.320]   I'm in.
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:56.320]   I'm I'm installed.
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:19:01.680]   I'm trying to figure out where to use the cool sketch things that Renee was talking about.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:03.520]   If you're really adventurous, we tried to do it.
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:07.460]   We weren't able to get it to work before iOS today this morning, but Apple has Apple
[01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:11.480]   TV has new firmware besides the or you were just doing the beta, right, John?
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:16.480]   But there's also new firmware available for the Apple TV.
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:20.800]   Is that the same as the beta or is it?
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:25.280]   They're not really they didn't really discuss Apple TV much at WWDC because they're going
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:26.880]   to talk about it more this fall.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:29.320]   So it's it has a lot of attention.
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:31.920]   It's the Amazon Prime app, which is coming later.
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:33.560]   Got some attention, but there's a new version.
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:36.000]   TVOS and iOS are basically the same build chain.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.240]   So when you get a new version of iOS, you get a new build chain is the wrong word developers
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:41.680]   stop laughing, but they're tied together.
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:44.400]   So they're eating crimbits the same time the iPhone does.
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:45.400]   There's a new version for it.
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:49.960]   So you sign up to the Spada software program on your Apple TV, you enable the public beta
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:55.240]   then you download it and we don't know.
[01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:59.280]   I mean, and gadget says, if you're adventurous, we don't know yet what what new features are
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:00.280]   and do you really need it?
[01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:03.200]   I mean, like if you're developing, you need it, but there's there's nothing in the way
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:06.200]   of transformative, at least as far as I've seen transformative new features that you
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:07.200]   want to play around with it.
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:10.520]   Actually, let me ask because somebody sent us an email on iOS today.
[01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:11.640]   By the way, that's our new time.
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:16.240]   I should point out iOS today has moved to right before Mac break weekly on Tuesdays.
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:17.800]   We started nine Pacific 12.
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:20.480]   It's a power hour like a TV channel.
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:22.960]   We thought, why not put all the Apple stuff together?
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:23.960]   Yeah.
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:28.320]   So Megan and I do iOS today, then we do Mac break weekly on Tuesdays.
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:30.480]   That won't affect you if you download it.
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:35.720]   Although if you subscribe, you'll get the new iOS today a day later because we recorded
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:38.280]   a day later.
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:43.080]   And by the way, we won't be here next week, nor will iOS today because it's the 4th of
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:44.080]   July in the United States.
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:49.440]   We celebrate Independence Day on the 4th of July and the network will be dark that day.
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:53.880]   We'll be back on Wednesday and we'll be fire worked fire worked and brought you out of
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:57.520]   out of respect out of respect for our Canadian neighbors.
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:00.840]   No, we have Canada Day observed on the 3rd.
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:02.600]   So we'll already be barbecued in fireworks.
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:10.240]   So what we want to say is that like all of us, including like police, government, army,
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:13.360]   Navy Air Force Marines, we're going to be at our homes having cookouts.
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:14.640]   We're going to be totally distracted.
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:20.480]   So Canada, you and your incredibly cool Prime Minister, don't exploit this to come down
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:23.160]   and take over and become our new government.
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:24.240]   Don't do that.
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:27.200]   And though you'll totally succeed and you know, we'll be too.
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:30.400]   I evidently they can hit us from there.
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:34.160]   I mean, you saw the sniper shot from the Canadians.
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:35.160]   Sniper shot.
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:36.160]   What?
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:37.840]   So I was in two miles of the border.
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:38.840]   You're the world.
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:39.840]   The world.
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:41.480]   I think bad about you.
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:45.040]   Hey, there's there's the top five sniper shots.
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:46.000]   Three of them are Canadians.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.640]   It just seems like this crazy thing that that it is, you know, the Canadians, they seem
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:52.320]   like such nice people.
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.960]   I think it's partially because they don't like confrontation.
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:58.160]   They're like, we have the Blyathalon to train with and then we don't breathe very much
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:00.720]   because there's a little bit of cold.
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:04.120]   But it's the three Canadian three Canadians in the chill, but mellow.
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:08.920]   But I don't, but I don't get is that it takes 10 seconds to reach the target.
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:13.760]   Is it, is there like someone like near the target saying, by the way, could you stand
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:17.600]   in this corner and just like not move for the next eight point seven sec?
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.880]   How does, I don't understand how that shot happens.
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:22.120]   And we'll never know, of course, but I'm fascinated.
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:23.880]   Well, it probably is not.
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:26.640]   This is probably not something you do in war.
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:28.040]   This is something you do as a.
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:32.200]   Well, so, oh no, this is, oh no, it's sniper shot in Isis Millet and then Iraq last month.
[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:35.960]   So what happened was is that they, they, they, which is funny, by the way, there's
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:42.960]   Canadian, the CNBC or whatever, the CBC coverage talked about it in, in terms of 58 hockey
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:45.080]   lengths, hockey, uh, rink lengths.
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:47.000]   Oh, that makes more sense in Canada.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:52.160]   Canadian, you know, to, to explain this in hockey, in hockey, uh, rink, uh, terms, but
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:56.200]   the, um, you know, it basically they have a, they had the snipers there.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:23:02.560]   They saw their, uh, a group was about one of our, or, uh, Iraqi, um, uh, groups was about
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:07.520]   to be, uh, ambushed by Isis and they couldn't call a drone in because they're women and
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:08.520]   children.
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:12.320]   So they, you know, he had to take a chance and try to, and by hitting them, it was so far
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:13.800]   away they couldn't hear it.
[01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:16.760]   So literally, you know, you can imagine someone just probably just picked up and
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:19.800]   slammed against the ball and it stopped everything because they didn't know where it was coming
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:22.560]   from, you know, and, um, you know, from two miles away.
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:25.240]   It's, it's all, it's all I apologize.
[01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:29.640]   I thought this was some, I thought this was some sort of, uh, record breaking attempt.
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:32.200]   This was actually, uh, the kill shot.
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:33.200]   This was serious.
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:34.200]   Yeah.
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:35.200]   This was wow.
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:40.720]   Fifty Cal, um, that's, uh, that's an almost, I mean, it's, it shouldn't have worked.
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:41.720]   Is it luck?
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:43.120]   It's luck, right?
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:48.120]   It's not well, it's, it is incredible amount of skill, um, and, uh, and a little luck because
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:52.560]   of the wind and the curvature of the earth at that range.
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:58.160]   Um, so, so it's a, uh, um, it's, it's a long way away.
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:02.160]   I mean, yeah, obviously he knew what he was doing and he gave it every, uh, every, uh,
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:03.360]   effort to make it work.
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:07.560]   But the fact that it also worked has a little bit, a little bit of luck.
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:08.560]   Wow.
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:09.560]   Wow.
[01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:10.560]   That's amazing.
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:13.560]   That's a little bit of luck.
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:15.560]   I mean, I think it's a little bit of luck.
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:17.560]   I think it's a little bit of luck.
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:19.560]   I think it's a little bit of luck.
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:21.560]   I think it's a little bit of luck.
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:22.560]   I think it's a little bit of luck.
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:24.560]   I think it's a little bit of luck.
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.560]   I think it's a little bit of luck.
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:28.560]   I think it's a little bit of luck.
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:30.560]   I think it's a little bit of luck.
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:32.560]   I think it's a little bit of luck.
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:33.560]   I think it's a little bit of luck.
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:34.560]   I think it's a little bit of luck.
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:35.560]   I think it's a little bit of luck.
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:36.560]   I think it's a little bit of luck.
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:37.560]   I think it's a little bit of luck.
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:38.560]   I think it's a little bit of luck.
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:42.560]   Everybody watch now the new Apple, original Apple music programming.
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:44.560]   The app.
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:46.560]   I know how that picture works.
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:49.560]   We're going to manly app development.
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:50.560]   Sexy.
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:52.560]   I mean, I guarantee you that would do it.
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:54.560]   It's beautifully produced, but it's just not a magic.
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:56.560]   I wish there was a better show in all that production.
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:57.560]   It's so crazy.
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:58.560]   It's the idea.
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:24:59.560]   I'm sorry.
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:00.560]   Go ahead.
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:01.560]   I'm sorry.
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:02.560]   Go ahead.
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:03.560]   You have to be a member of Apple music, right?
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:05.560]   I'm just saying that they've lost me the moment.
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:06.560]   They lost me the moment.
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:09.560]   I realized that, oh my God, this is really happening.
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:13.560]   They have to give a 30 second pitch while actually riding an escalator.
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:14.560]   Yeah, that's a little weird.
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:17.560]   And they have to finish the pitch by the time they get to the bottom.
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:19.560]   So an elevator would be claustrophobic, Andy.
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:20.560]   Oh my God.
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:21.560]   I mean, it gets worse.
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:22.560]   And it gets worse.
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:23.560]   And it gets worse.
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:24.560]   And they sure lock that guy.
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:25.560]   They sure lock that guy.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:26.560]   I really said that.
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:27.560]   Yeah.
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:28.560]   This is everything funny.
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:29.560]   Yeah.
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:33.560]   Apparently the guy who was showing off an AR app had put his heart and soul into the whole thing.
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:39.000]   And then the entire for the whole episode, like they're going to show it now that I've
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:43.200]   now that my mentor has gotten on board, she's going to explain to me, well, maybe we should
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:48.080]   just use the AR technology and license to other people and people will sell to catalogs,
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:50.840]   will sell it to and see how no one can duplicate this.
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:52.120]   It's so hard to do AR.
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:54.120]   And I'm like, Oh, dear.
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:55.120]   Oh, honey.
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:26:01.360]   So it's Jessica Albrecht, Gwyneth Paltrow, Gary Vaynerchuk, and Will I Am or the judges.
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:02.360]   Yeah.
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:06.400]   They don't make any point of like why any of these people are qualified.
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:08.160]   I mean, I'm not saying they're not qualified.
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:13.000]   I'm saying that they don't at least in Shark Tank, they start by saying this person started
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.720]   with nothing and now they have their own real estate empire.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:20.440]   This person was a cleaning person and she decided to start selling things on QPC.
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:23.400]   It's like, okay, so they understand something about the business that they're trying to
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:25.000]   build for these people.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:30.600]   It's like I designed a really freaky looking car that's based on based on a DeLorean.
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:36.040]   So Albrecht has a very successful honest cosmetic line for
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:37.840]   Executive QPC.
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:38.840]   Paltrow has Goop.
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:43.840]   But they don't explain what do they understand about the software development and app marketing.
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:44.840]   Right.
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:45.840]   Really.
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:48.480]   There's the escalator that you have to ride.
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:52.440]   It's like, and Gwyneth Paltrow has Iron Man armor.
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:59.280]   So, but it was what was crazy is that the production value is three or four times as
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:04.200]   good as Shark Tank, which it's based on over over, you know, and it was, I mean, I will
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:07.480]   say it was incredibly well executed.
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:11.600]   But literally by a third of it, a third of the way in, I literally had to shut it off
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:13.200]   because it made me so angry watching it.
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:17.480]   Like I just couldn't get past the production value is not as good.
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:18.840]   It's really, really awful.
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:21.680]   It doesn't understand that someone walks in, they give a pitch.
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:22.680]   You don't need an elevator.
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:26.040]   You don't need a special lineup floor that says who's interested in who's not.
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:30.440]   There really is going to be about the pre these four people talking to this would be entrepreneur
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:34.760]   about their product or their service and why they should, how the deal should be structured.
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:40.760]   This is the least interesting, at least interesting articulation of this idea possible.
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:42.240]   It's a perfect bingo.
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:44.240]   They could not have made this less interesting.
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:45.240]   Right.
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:48.120]   No, and what I'm saying is the production value from my perspective is the, the, he's
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:52.200]   talking about the cameras, the graphics, the graphic, you know, like everything.
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:57.400]   I think what you're saying, Andy, is the design of the show is a, is a, is a failure.
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:02.880]   Well, and also they don't, I would, I mean, you can't, it's, you can make a fascinating
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:07.560]   movie about how hard it is to, as an independent developer to bring something to market.
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:11.200]   Was it, was that documentary on two documentaries on indie game development?
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:14.560]   I think it's called the indie movie or the indie, indie planets, something like that.
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:18.640]   And this fascinating watching this, these people inside their homes, but working with
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:22.920]   the focus of the team making the iPhone to try to create, to try to create this amazing,
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:24.320]   amazing games.
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:26.320]   And that's where the interest is.
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:30.120]   And they're not even really showing the difficulty of building an app and finding it audience.
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:34.800]   It really is about the fake meeting they're going to have with the, with the investors
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:38.560]   that they're going to be lined up later on saying, we, if we, we decide that if you're
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:43.840]   going to pivot, do you see the use the word pivot to expand our audience and then market
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:44.840]   profile.
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:48.600]   Like, it's, it's so they could not, again, they could not have figured out.
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:54.160]   A less interesting way to have a show about, about people who build apps.
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:55.160]   This, yeah.
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:29:00.760]   And actually the truth is I kind of, I was, I thought that when I first heard about it,
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:02.360]   I would, I thought this is not good.
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:09.080]   This kind of trivializes what's involved in app development and popularizes it in a way
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:13.920]   that's going to not, the good news is nobody's going to watch it.
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:15.400]   It's, I have.
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:18.400]   It's not going to be a mass appeal show.
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:23.920]   Well, I think what I showed you how hard this is to do, frankly.
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:25.080]   Yeah.
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:29.560]   There was a Wall Street Journal article today that Facebook is going Hollywood seeking
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:31.760]   scripted TV programming.
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:32.960]   You know, it's not just Facebook.
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:34.600]   It's Apple, Facebook.
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:36.360]   Well, Apple hired those two Sony guys, right?
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:37.520]   To start running.
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:41.840]   You can throw money at this stuff, but maybe the Sony guys will bring the expertise that
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:43.600]   they need to do something.
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:47.040]   But you got to think, Apple had higher Alex, higher Alex.
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:52.000]   Yeah, I mean, I think the, I think Netflix is probably doing this the best.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:55.920]   Netflix and then Amazon are probably, you know, and what they're doing, I think in a
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:59.800]   lot of ways or what has been reported that they're doing is they're really going to creators
[01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:03.280]   who are in the business, but not the business that you would traditionally get them from
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:04.760]   and say, okay, what's your passion project?
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:05.760]   What do you want to do?
[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:06.760]   There you go.
[01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:07.760]   What do you want to create?
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:08.760]   And then you let them go.
[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:10.560]   You let them do their thing.
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:14.880]   And they've been really successful at that, you know, giving them not the level of crazy
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:18.320]   control that typically comes with Hollywood.
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:22.560]   But going straight to the Hollywood studios and asking for that, gets more of the same
[01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:25.720]   into a new, it's old, you know, it's new wine and an old wineskin, you know, at that
[01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:30.280]   point, you know, it's not going to give them, you know, what they, what they need, you know,
[01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:34.480]   and I think that there's a lot of people who are on the fringes of Hollywood that would
[01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:35.720]   probably serve a lot of these guys better.
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:40.160]   And that's what I think Netflix and Amazon are doing a better job of getting than the other,
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:43.520]   I mean, because you have YouTube, Apple, Facebook, it's never been a better time to
[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:44.960]   pitch your own content.
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:45.960]   Yeah.
[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:48.360]   And that's, that's not how Apple works though, right?
[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:51.360]   They really want to, I think they want more control.
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:52.360]   And that's the thing.
[01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:53.360]   Yeah.
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:56.320]   And I think Apple have a hard time doing this because they're not going to want to do what's
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:58.440]   required to let these guys run with it.
[01:30:58.440 --> 01:30:59.440]   I mean, maybe they will.
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:01.880]   Maybe they'll figure out that they could, that that, but I think that they're going
[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:06.120]   to be so worried about brand and so worried about, you know, what it looks like as an
[01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:07.120]   original.
[01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:09.840]   I think that those are the things that are very challenging for Apple in a way that they
[01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:12.200]   aren't for some of the other platforms.
[01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:13.200]   Well, look at YouTube.
[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:16.760]   I mean, they've spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to generate original programming
[01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:18.240]   and not gain any traction.
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:22.040]   Well, I think that, I think that YouTube's, you know, challenges really that, A, first
[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:26.440]   they really try to leverage their, you know, their, their YouTube creators, the problem
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:30.360]   with YouTube creators is that they're really good at their pla, at their medium, giving
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:33.120]   them more money didn't necessarily make it any better.
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:36.480]   You know, like it was really good at utilizing what it had.
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:38.480]   I think that they've had trouble taking that.
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:43.400]   Cutee Pie with a Hollywood budget didn't make it any better, you know?
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:46.080]   And I think that that's, that that was one of the big challenges that, that YouTube's
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:49.800]   had, it's also had a, you know, hard time with, I think, I think that they, you know,
[01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:52.360]   they've had a rough relationship with Hollywood.
[01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:56.640]   And so I think that it's harder for them to make that work as well as some folks that
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:58.520]   are coming in a little bit more new.
[01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:03.520]   So it's not an Apple story, but speaking of Google, it is probably the big story of the
[01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:08.920]   day, the EU has fined Google $2.7 billion.
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:11.400]   Billion or euros?
[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:12.400]   Oh, dollars.
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:13.400]   Okay.
[01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:19.880]   Billion dollars, uh, of, uh, for antitrust actions because the search engine stacked the
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:25.120]   deck in favor of its own comparison shopping service, frugal, which no longer exists.
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:27.360]   That's, that's the worst part.
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:31.360]   It's like it's, like it's no longer there and you're getting punished for it.
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:32.360]   Yeah.
[01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:37.920]   Um, I understand why, and I've said this, I've been critical of Google.
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:42.040]   I don't like seeing Google for instance, get into content because there is some temp,
[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:46.200]   you know, there's search engine and they're a very powerful entity and there's probably
[01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:49.280]   some temptation to favor their own content.
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:53.120]   So I can understand the issue.
[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:57.360]   But this, um, this is, well, I'm a lot of money.
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:58.360]   That's a lot of money.
[01:32:58.360 --> 01:32:59.360]   That's all I got to say.
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:01.480]   No matter where you're coming from, that, that's, that's a lot of money.
[01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:06.000]   And for Google, that's, you know, that's all, that's a month's, uh, income.
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:10.880]   Apple would have to sell iPhones for another three quarters to make that kind of money.
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:14.640]   Well, as, as I think, and I think one of the challenges really is as the digital world
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:18.720]   becomes the digital world, you know, as we, as we start moving away from oil and, and
[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:23.640]   hard certain things into all digital goods and, and this becomes more and more, uh, you
[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:24.640]   know, important.
[01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:29.080]   I think that there's this collision that you're seeing between the European sensibilities
[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:33.480]   versus the American sensibilities versus the Chinese and Russian sensibilities.
[01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:36.680]   And all of these things are just colliding in these companies are kind of in a no win
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:40.400]   situation in a lot of ways because they're going to be pushed to go one way by America,
[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:44.960]   pushed another way by Russia, pushed another way by Europe and see, in those seeming requirements.
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:47.880]   And I think it's going to, that's going to be one of the big challenges over the next
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:51.840]   decade as, as, as these companies figure out and as the world figures out how you're going
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:53.800]   to manage something that doesn't have borders.
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:56.720]   It's more than double their previous record.
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:01.120]   They find Intel a billion euros into 2009.
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:05.960]   Oh gosh, interesting story.
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:10.400]   I will, I'm sure talk a lot more about it on TNT and tomorrow on this weekend Google,
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:11.840]   it'll probably be the story of the day.
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:13.720]   And I'm sure Jeff Jarvis will be incensed.
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:17.160]   In fact, he's already called a Euro techno panic.
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:21.080]   It would just be hilarious if Larry Page showed up, opened his wallet and just casually handed
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:27.200]   out $31 billion bill and then a butter, the moth flies out after that.
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:28.200]   Yeah.
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:29.560]   Can I have my change in $10,000 bills?
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:34.680]   I need to tip the sky cap on the way home.
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:39.340]   And as long as we're talking tomorrow, I think maybe day after tomorrow I'm going to get
[01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:41.720]   my Amazon home.
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:43.160]   It's shipped.
[01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:44.160]   We're starting to see reviews.
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:49.280]   We're talking about the echo, the new, what's it going out the home, the echo show show.
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:50.280]   Thank you.
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:53.480]   I'm going to call you on it because I have mine mine coming to.
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:54.480]   Yeah.
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:56.480]   Middle of the night, sun, Alex is in your bedroom.
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:57.480]   Hi Leo.
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:34:59.680]   It's pretty positive reviews actually.
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:01.680]   Where did you get the Scooby-Doo underpants?
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:03.680]   Can I buy those?
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:05.600]   That's what I thought Amazon?
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:07.160]   $230.
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:12.960]   It's got a camera and a touchscreen and gadget called it kind of a crappy touchscreen.
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:16.320]   But they said they also said they use it quite well.
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:21.080]   So the show is I got two because I'm going to send one to my mom so I could talk to her
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:24.200]   over it because it'll be a lot easier way to do video calls.
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:27.880]   They're going to sell a lot of them for that kind of reason for people who just need to
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:31.040]   keep an eye on people who are a thousand miles away.
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:33.320]   That's going to be a big deal.
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:34.920]   That's actually why I got three.
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:35.920]   You got three?
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:38.960]   Well, I got one for myself and one for both sets of parents.
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:39.960]   Nice.
[01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:40.960]   And for ours.
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:41.960]   And so we get to know.
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:44.120]   Because you travel a lot, you're not going to bring it on the road with you.
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:45.120]   No.
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:46.720]   But you can use the Amazon.
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:51.280]   I'm not going to call it by name of the Echo app to make those video calls to the show,
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:52.280]   I think.
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:53.280]   That's a dilemma.
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:54.280]   Yeah.
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:55.280]   I haven't seen that yet.
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:57.320]   But I just testing it as far as the hardware goes.
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:00.400]   That's I'm, you know, that's what I'm going to be playing with.
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:01.400]   Yeah.
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:03.280]   See how well it works as far as pulling the family together.
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:04.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:05.440]   I'm all in on Echo.
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:06.440]   I really love it.
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:09.080]   Although I'm looking forward to buying apples.
[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:11.040]   Now that's what I call the bathroom.
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:12.040]   People, please.
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:13.040]   Yes.
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:15.120]   But you set it up in your house, they'll point it away from the bathroom.
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:17.040]   Just save yourself that.
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:20.360]   I think, well, Lisa's already spoken to me about it.
[01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:22.960]   I think it's going to end up in the kitchen.
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:23.960]   Yes.
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:24.960]   Yeah.
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:25.960]   Ours are our Google home.
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:26.960]   Remember that when you get midnight snack.
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:27.960]   Yeah.
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:30.800]   Well, I also going to turn off, there is a drop, a feature they call drop in.
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:31.800]   Yeah.
[01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:35.080]   Where you can just go look and see what's going on.
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:37.400]   I was watching Leo's fridge at midnight because I was born.
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:40.880]   And all of a sudden, yeah, I don't think I'm going to make sure drop in is disabled
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:42.960]   before we set it up.
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:48.720]   Anyway, we will have our take on that Saturday on the new screensavers.
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:51.520]   I think a lot of us are getting, Megan's getting one.
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:52.520]   I got one.
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:56.280]   I think one of our producers Jerry's getting one.
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:58.400]   So we can make some phone calls.
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:03.520]   The screen is a terrible screen, seven inch, 1024 by 600.
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:07.960]   But I think the danger is always that for cutting the corners too much is then you have
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:10.160]   apples come in and they say, we're not going to cut the corners.
[01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:13.280]   We're just going to make a really great one and then turns out they sell almost the same
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:17.440]   number just with higher actually really high quality about the home hub.
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:21.280]   I have a feeling that I'm going to be replacing all of my Sonos.
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:22.280]   Yeah.
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:23.280]   I don't know.
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:24.280]   That would be hard.
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:27.160]   Was the second, was the secondary market for Sonos.
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:28.160]   Yeah.
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:29.160]   Quick.
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:30.840]   No, except for the sound bars because the sound bars, there's no sound bar from Apple
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:31.840]   yet.
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:32.840]   Yeah.
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:34.600]   I think there are no losers in this because there are people who are going to be very,
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:38.080]   very happy with their Apple home pods and then they're going to be people on eBay and
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:41.840]   Craigslist who are going to be very happy with their $30 Sonos gear.
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:42.840]   Yeah.
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:43.840]   Yeah.
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:48.280]   Because if it does, I mean, you're the only one I know who's heard it Renee, but if it
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:54.920]   does what everybody says it'll do, especially the ability to buy multiple pods and have them
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:55.920]   pair.
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:58.040]   It just doesn't do home theater yet.
[01:37:58.040 --> 01:37:59.040]   So that's what you want.
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:00.040]   Yeah.
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:01.800]   No, I have a pretty nice home theater setup.
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:02.800]   I'm not going to replace that.
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:07.880]   I think it's just, you know, maybe again in the kitchen, perhaps in the bedroom, maybe
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:10.440]   a pair or three, but I can just imagine this technology.
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:12.720]   If they had like Dolby Atmos support Apple, you could do that.
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:15.840]   You could have like the 9.1 or the team plan on doing that.
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:16.840]   Yeah.
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:17.840]   And the technology.
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:18.840]   Yeah.
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:19.840]   Technology exists.
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:22.080]   That's not such a hard thing to do.
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:23.760]   Yamaha has a sound bar that does that most.
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:24.760]   They just use it.
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:25.760]   Yeah.
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:26.760]   Well, reflection.
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:27.760]   Right.
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:28.760]   Right.
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:29.760]   Just saying.
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:30.760]   All right.
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:31.760]   Let's take a little break.
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:34.560]   Little tittly little bit, tiny little bit.
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:35.560]   Okay.
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:36.560]   Talk.
[01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:38.360]   Tiny little break and we come back.
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:42.200]   Gentlemen, put together your picks, if you will, picks of the week coming up in just a
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:43.200]   second.
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:48.160]   I showed it a brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:49.160]   You know, it's interesting.
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:52.080]   I mean, to me, the selling point of Rocket Mortgage is completely online.
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:54.360]   That is all I need to hear.
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:59.760]   But I think it's important to emphasize that it's more than just putting it all online.

[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:08.760]   I want to emphasize this.

[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:34.840]   Alex, you haven't been here in a while.
[01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:39.520]   I bet you have a few expensive picks you'd like to share with us.
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:45.440]   No, I don't actually have an expensive pick, but I have a, so I've talked in the past.
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:48.600]   I mean, we're kind of obsessive about weather because of what we do live streaming.
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:51.320]   You're worried about raining, you're worried about thunder, you're worried about all kinds
[01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:52.320]   of other things.
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:56.640]   And so dark sky, of course, is what is kind of our new app to make sure that another one
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:02.000]   that we've started to use a lot is radar scope.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:08.040]   So radar scope really just gives you a, it's just in half that just shows you basically
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:09.640]   the radar for just about anywhere.
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:14.320]   And you're actually getting a lot of the data that you don't get necessarily as clearly
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:15.320]   on dark skies.
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:19.960]   So I love their tagline professional radar for the average Joe.
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:21.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:22.120]   Exactly.
[01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:24.960]   Now, it happens to be very clear here in San Rafael right now.
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:29.040]   So it's not a lot to see, but if you go over towards, you can see that there's a, you know,
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:33.840]   near Antioch or Rio Vista, there's something, there's a lot of storm going on right now.
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:36.480]   And so, but anyway, it's cool.
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:41.400]   If you like to see the weather going by, I think that it's a really fun app.
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:45.960]   And the other thing I just want to say is that I, you know, we've already talked about
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:46.960]   it a bit.
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:48.600]   So I'm not going to talk about it, but I love my new iMac.
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:53.360]   I have been spent the last year and a half complaining about Apple's hardware, but I
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:58.480]   just wanted to say that it's, I haven't had a hard piece of, I haven't had a desktop
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:01.040]   in my house for five years.
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:03.320]   Now you didn't buy the iMac Pro.
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:06.680]   This is, but this was something that was just the new up to the iMac.
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:07.680]   Yeah, the new updated iMac.
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:09.560]   This is seventh generation Intel.
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:10.560]   Kaby Lake.
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:11.560]   It's a Kaby Lake.
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:12.560]   Okay.
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:16.880]   And it's just, it's just a pleasure to work on, you know, and so I wanted to have something
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:20.240]   that I wasn't tempted to pick up and move to be honest.
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:22.320]   I was, you know, I just wanted something that's going to be sitting there.
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:23.320]   It's going to have my storage.
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:24.320]   It's going to have my photos.
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:25.960]   I love that five K display.
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:28.080]   I have minds a couple of years old, but I just love that.
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:32.440]   So what do you use as a third as a, as a, I have a couple of old cinema displays that
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:34.840]   I just put on the left and right.
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:36.360]   And that way you get a three, I have a three.
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:38.720]   The LG's work, I think on this one now too.
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:39.720]   That's the five case.
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:40.480]   Yeah.
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:43.080]   This has enough horsepower to drive two five K monitors.
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:44.080]   That's nice.
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:45.080]   Yeah.
[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:47.680]   And which five K monitor do you use for that?
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:50.000]   I have the LG, the LG five K's.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.080]   The new ones have the, have fixed that annoying Wi-Fi problem.
[01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:56.720]   They don't have Apple design, but they have the identical panel to the iMac or to the
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:57.720]   previous generation.
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:02.320]   I just live with not having a five K display on the left and right, just one in the middle.
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:06.240]   Because I have a lot of, I have a lot of the Dell 27 inch 4K's which I mean.
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:07.240]   You can use those.
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:08.240]   That's fine.
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:09.240]   Yeah.
[01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:11.120]   Because you have, you have, what do I do?
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:17.720]   I have a thunderbolt, a thunder, no, mini display port and I can't remember.
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:20.440]   But I have the older, an older one in the new one and it works out fine.
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:23.880]   You have to daisy chain stuff, but thunder, daisy chain is fine.
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:24.960]   Yeah.
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:26.800]   So tell us the specs just so we know.
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:28.800]   I just, I don't know.
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:32.360]   Did you like go for the top of the top line, everything?
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:36.400]   I didn't, I didn't load it up with RAM or the biggest hard drive it could have, but
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:44.760]   other than that, so it's got 32 gigs of RAM and it's got one, a one terabyte flash drive.
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:49.360]   That's actually nice that you can, you can put that much RAM in it.
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:50.360]   Yeah.
[01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:51.760]   And boot camp that I run five games.
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:53.760]   64, it was, there's a 64 gig option.
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:56.200]   I was like, I do not need 64 gigs of RAM.
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:44:00.840]   Well, you were at any boot camp or not boot camp, but I decided I didn't need it.
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:05.280]   I got the 4.2 quad core.
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:07.360]   And the one, you did upgrade to that.
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:08.360]   Okay.
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:09.360]   Yeah.
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:10.360]   And, you know, it's about the price.
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:11.360]   Yeah.
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:12.360]   And I would not get a fusion drive.
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:13.360]   I just not crazy about a few drives.
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:14.800]   And now with the S-S-D, you can't go back.
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:15.800]   Yeah.
[01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:16.800]   Yeah.
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:17.800]   I know.
[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:18.800]   S-S-D or S-S-D's.
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:20.040]   I mean, you're just- And a terabytes plenty because you're going to have external thunderbolt
[01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:21.040]   drives in.
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:23.040]   Well, and a terabyte are tailored externally.
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:24.040]   Yes.
[01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:25.040]   Yeah.
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:28.800]   Well, I'm, I've, I've really moved to not keeping a lot of hardware, not keeping a lot
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:29.960]   of the important stuff on the computer.
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:31.600]   So I want it on an external drive.
[01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:33.240]   I want to be able to pick that up and take it.
[01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:34.240]   I want to be able to back it up.
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:36.800]   I want to be able to, I don't want it to be tied up in the same thing.
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:38.520]   So one gig is really there.
[01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:41.800]   The one terabyte there is there for me to use a scratch drives and stuff like that.
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:46.520]   I'm not going to put real data on it or keep it there for any longer time.
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:50.120]   You, you've had the five K, the older 5K, I presume.
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:51.120]   I did not.
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:52.120]   Oh.
[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:53.560]   Well, no wonder you're happy.
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:54.560]   No, no.
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:58.040]   The last piece of, I've been on a laptop pretty much because I've been on the road.
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:00.040]   I mean, most of my time has been on the road.
[01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:05.200]   So I've been on, I haven't had a, my own desktop machine.
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:07.840]   The company has lots of desktop machines, of course, but I haven't had one that I'm
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:10.720]   using since my cheese grater.
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:14.120]   So it's been five years since I've sat down on it.
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:17.280]   And so it's like, it is just like this beautiful thing that's in my desk.
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:18.280]   I love it.
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:23.920]   So anyway, but I'm going to use one of my iPads as the, as my wine tablet.
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:26.520]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:30.000]   In fact, I didn't point that out when I was playing with Duet earlier.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:34.120]   You can use it as like a touch bar with the laptops, right?
[01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:37.760]   You could get the, not only as a wack-up tablet, but you can also get the touch bar.
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:38.760]   Is that right?
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:39.760]   I haven't tried that.
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:42.680]   I'm just, I've just started to test it with, with just using it and it just works really
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:43.680]   well.
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:47.720]   And I, again, that was one of someone that we were working with just loved, loved that
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:48.720]   experience.
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:51.240]   So, so I've been kind of sold on, on that.
[01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:54.680]   So I'm kind of trying to build kind of a nice thing at the house.
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:59.080]   Now that I actually have an office, my wife had taken most of my office away.
[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:02.280]   And I moved the last time so now I'm known kind of moving in.
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:03.840]   So it's back.
[01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:04.840]   It's back.
[01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:05.840]   Yeah.
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:06.840]   Yeah.
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:07.840]   Five KIMAC.
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:08.840]   What do you say that wasn't expensive?
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:10.400]   That's like, you just spent $4,000.
[01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:11.400]   It's good.
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:12.400]   It's a computer.
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:16.680]   But it's, but it's, you know, it's, it's a well spent.
[01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:18.880]   You know, I, I'm actually going to use the horsepower.
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:20.520]   No, we know you are.
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:21.520]   We know you are.
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:24.640]   So, you know, I, I think that it would be a waste of the loaded up would be a waste for
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:25.640]   most people.
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:30.160]   And I need the actual processing power for some 3D rendering and, and so on.
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:31.320]   I have off at Alex.
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:32.560]   Late Batman.
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:33.560]   Did they update?
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:35.560]   Only if you're running Windows.
[01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:39.040]   Did they update the SSD?
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:41.320]   Is it a little, is it MVME?
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:42.320]   It's MVME.
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:43.320]   It's, it's, it's.
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:44.320]   Yeah.
[01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:45.320]   Yeah.
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:46.320]   Okay.
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:47.320]   PCIe still.
[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:50.840]   But, but, but I will say again, I mean using spinning drives is just absurd.
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:53.040]   Oh, it's like it's gotten.
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:55.080]   I bought a spinning drive in years.
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:47:00.440]   And my raids, you know, my, my, my Drobo has an SD SD and, you know, and it's 10 bit to
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:01.440]   the timing controller.
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:03.320]   So it can do their, a billion colors, which is really nice.
[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:06.560]   Because sometimes when you have a deep color, you seem banding, you wouldn't see on a lower
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:08.840]   colored, a lower dense, a lower depth display.
[01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:09.840]   Yeah.
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:10.840]   Right.
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:11.840]   So it just looks really nice.
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:17.240]   Actually, I should, I should make my pick because it just came out today, the new Drobo.
[01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:19.240]   You can do this.
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:20.240]   This way.
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:22.360]   They're a sponsor, a disclaimer.
[01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:28.640]   But you should, you should, there's a new Drobo 5D3 Thunderbolt 3.
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:30.360]   You have Thunderbolt 3 on that 5K, right?
[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:31.360]   I do.
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:32.360]   Yeah.
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:34.360]   5B thunderbolt 3.
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:37.520]   So you're going to, that's, and this is what you need for your video, right?
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:38.520]   Yeah.
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:42.400]   Because you need, you don't, you only have a terabyte internal drive.
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:46.840]   You need a, you need something, something with a lot of storage.
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:50.320]   So I'm smoking, smoking, smoking from my, from my pockets.
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:51.320]   Let's see.
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:56.720]   You get six, four terabyte drives in there and six, no.
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:57.720]   Six by four.
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:47:58.720]   Yeah.
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:47:59.720]   Twenty four terabytes.
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:01.560]   That should be enough for you, Alex.
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:02.560]   For now.
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:03.560]   For now.
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:04.560]   For now.
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:05.560]   I don't know how they get six.
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:06.800]   They must mean four.
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:10.120]   And is the, and, and you've, have you used it?
[01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:12.600]   No, it just came out literally today.
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:14.080]   Okay.
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:20.000]   So I haven't used it, but maybe Drobo will hear this and send us one.
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.360]   I use the Drobo mini for, on my iMac, cause, cause, cause it really, I think that's a
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:28.680]   smart thing to do in general is to not load up the internal drive.
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:33.520]   Have enough there for your apps and your operating system.
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:37.280]   And then, cause you got thunderbolt, which is extremely fast.
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:41.800]   Use a giant, so I have a Drobo, a thunderbolt, a giant Drobo, it's thunderbolt two, cause
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:43.560]   it's an all the older 5K.
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:49.040]   Drobo mini with four solid state drives and the M sat accelerator.
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:50.040]   And that's nice.
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:51.040]   That's a sweet.
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:54.760]   PFS is better with fusion drives, but I was still never go back from SSD.
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:57.040]   Is it a, oh, you mean it's a fusion drives?
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:00.720]   You say it the other way around fusion drives are better now with APFS.
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:01.720]   Yes.
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:02.880]   Yes, because it's smarter about it.
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:04.240]   It can actually see it at a block level.
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:08.880]   So we can, for example, put all the metadata on the SSD and then put just the data data
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:12.200]   on the platters so that it can access things much faster.
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:14.400]   But APFS also is great for SSDs.
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:19.000]   And I imagine this is these will also be better with APFS.
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.720]   How about your pick of the week, Mr. Renee Ritchie?
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:23.400]   So mine, utterly predictable.
[01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:27.400]   They had what probably is the biggest Pokemon Go update ever this week.
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:29.040]   And there's a couple of really interesting things about it.
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:31.720]   The first one is just a gym update.
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:35.040]   And what they did with gyms is they basically said, if you have really powerful Pokemon,
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:36.400]   we're going to hurt them bad for use.
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:39.520]   You're going to want to put lower powered Pokemon in there, which makes it more accessible
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:41.920]   to people who are just casual players.
[01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:42.920]   And the whole system's changed.
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:44.800]   So now it's really easy to take down a gym.
[01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:46.160]   You get coins faster.
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:49.880]   So it really made it more accessible to people who don't play all the time and have super
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:51.480]   high level characters.
[01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:53.360]   So just in general, it's more approachable.
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:55.960]   But they added this thing called battle raids, which are really cool.
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:59.320]   So if you're playing the game, you'll get a notification saying battle raids are about
[01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:00.320]   to start.
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:03.280]   And then the gym goes down and a boss goes up on the gym.
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:06.400]   And up to 20 people at a time can take on this gym.
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:09.360]   And it sounds goofy, but I live in a pretty small suburb of Montreal.
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:12.600]   And we had 27 people at one just the other day.
[01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:14.880]   You know, we have to take turns going after it.
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:19.120]   And every day there's people, especially people organizing on Facebook groups for the big ones,
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:22.960]   the ones that are tier four gyms, which are like really powerful Pokemon.
[01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:25.640]   There's groups of five, 10, 15 people showing up.
[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:27.440]   And they sort of, they got rid of the teams for that.
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:29.280]   So it doesn't matter if you're red or blue or yellow.
[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:32.040]   Everyone's fighting together to try to beat the boss.
[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:35.520]   And that's led to a whole bunch of metal, even on the weekend when I was just trying
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:40.240]   to figure out how it all worked, I met 30, 40 people I'd never met before because our
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:43.720]   neighborhoods in the suburbs are so spread out and we just never crossed paths.
[01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:45.600]   And everyone was working together.
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:48.440]   They were there with their kids, you know, because kids could join in because they were
[01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:51.200]   people with more powerful accounts and they could just sort of ride along with them and
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:52.800]   have their fun too.
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:53.800]   And it was really great.
[01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:57.160]   And it adds a new dimension to the game and it will probably be a way that they do special
[01:50:57.160 --> 01:50:58.160]   events going forward.
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:01.720]   Like they're going to have Pokemon Go Fest in Chicago soon and they'll probably do a
[01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:03.320]   bunch of stuff around that.
[01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:06.320]   So just in general, if you haven't looked at Pokemon Go lately and you're afraid that
[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:09.400]   you got stuck behind, none of that really matters anymore.
[01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:10.400]   Anyone can enjoy the game.
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:15.320]   They can enjoy going out walking in the park, having fun, getting gyms, fighting in raids.
[01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:16.560]   All of that is great.
[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:21.520]   The only thing I'll advise because raids, especially are only from 9am to 9pm because
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:25.880]   they don't want to create noise and encourage people to trespass at night or anything,
[01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:30.480]   break park curfews or anything like that, is just really hella hot in some places during
[01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:35.520]   the day and make sure you have like sunglasses and hats and water and all of that kind of
[01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:40.720]   stuff because you can quickly, as I have personally discovered, get heat exhaustion if you're
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:44.800]   not well prepared to survive out of your nerd confines.
[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:49.280]   Well, it's funny because this is the one year anniversary next month, right?
[01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:51.280]   Yeah, that's what they're going to have.
[01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:54.560]   And there's rumors they'll have like the legendaries and mythical Pokemon come out for the first
[01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:58.720]   time using the boss battles as a mechanic for it.
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:02.280]   So yeah, it was Sunday.
[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:04.480]   There was like four on the roll along the waterfront.
[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:10.000]   A bunch of us could just walk down the lakes front and just we fought in a raid, went around
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:14.000]   for a little while, talked to the next one and we walked like a mile or something in a
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.720]   very short period of time doing one to the other.
[01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:17.560]   It doesn't even feel like extra slides anymore.
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:19.960]   It's just a lot of fun.
[01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:21.560]   So you just get it automatically?
[01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:25.560]   Yeah, it's all you might have to update your app if you haven't updated it in a while.
[01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:30.120]   But once it's there, you'll just get the new gyms and the gyms, it's much more approachable.
[01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:31.120]   You have to have different Pokemon.
[01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:34.720]   So there's a lot more variety and they have little heart meters now so you can feed them
[01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:36.120]   berries and get reward.
[01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:38.040]   It's just it's a lot more engaging for casual players.
[01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:40.120]   It took them a long time, but it's about time.
[01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:41.840]   This is a much needed update.
[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:42.840]   That's good.
[01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:44.160]   Yeah, they were victims of their own success initially.
[01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:46.200]   Those servers were not prepared for it.
[01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:48.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:49.040]   Now I'm fired it up.
[01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:50.040]   I'm going to have to play.
[01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:51.040]   Oh, yeah, I could see already.
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:53.360]   Yeah, I must have the new one because the gym looks different.
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:54.360]   Yeah.
[01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:55.360]   Wow, that's cool.
[01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:57.560]   Ooh, this is going to be fun.
[01:52:57.560 --> 01:52:58.560]   Yeah.
[01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:00.720]   Your first raid battle at least is going to be epic.
[01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:01.720]   Yeah.
[01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:02.720]   Yeah.
[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:05.720]   Somebody's made the butter and eggs day paraded gym.
[01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:06.720]   Nice.
[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:09.120]   That's great.
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:12.360]   Mr. Andy Inaco, your pick of the week.
[01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:14.320]   I got a tip and a pick.
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:16.280]   If you're eating fruit, I'm trying to.
[01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:19.960]   I'm not a fruit oriented sort of omnivore.
[01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:23.120]   But yes, you have to peel off these little stickers before you eat them.
[01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:24.360]   I don't know if they're edible.
[01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:25.840]   I don't want to find out.
[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:27.800]   But there's don't just throw them away.
[01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:30.680]   They actually have a really good use as I've discovered over the past month.
[01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:36.920]   They make really, really good privacy stickers for your camera on a device.
[01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:41.840]   Oh, because they peel off really easily and you put them right back on.
[01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:45.560]   And so I will not operate like any sort of anything other than a phone.
[01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:50.400]   I will block the camera just in case because I don't know, especially now that I have
[01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:55.000]   a Windows machine, it's like, I don't really trust that camera, not to be hijacked by
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.440]   somebody.
[01:53:56.440 --> 01:54:00.320]   And so I've been finding lots of uses for these as a summer and I'll be eating more
[01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:01.320]   fruit.
[01:54:01.320 --> 01:54:02.320]   And now these are like all over.
[01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:05.760]   Wherever I snack, there's one of these like stuck to a monitor and stuck to a keyboard.
[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:09.520]   And I just peeled this off of this little box that I keep SD cards in.
[01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:14.480]   But I seem to keep finding uses for like low tech, colorful stickers.
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:17.440]   That's my technology related tip.
[01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:20.880]   My pick though is the Met Opera in demand app.
[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:28.480]   So the Met Opera has not just like all of their best shows over the past 20, 30, 40,
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:30.840]   sometimes going even back 50 years.
[01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:34.400]   And it's their own little channel that you can get on Roku or on Apple TV or on your
[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:36.240]   iOS device.
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:39.240]   And for 50 cost 15 bucks a month.
[01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:43.800]   And if you want to get in it, if you've even sort of tempted to get into opera, wow,
[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:46.680]   is that a cheap way to start to get into it?
[01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:48.240]   Because the first week is free.
[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:53.600]   So pick one opera again for the past 20 or 30 years and they have had every single star
[01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:58.400]   of opera doing some of their ex best work and some of the best productions in the world
[01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:00.840]   of some of the best operas ever written.
[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:05.600]   And so take your free seven day trial, pick an opera that you want to go see, watch it
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:06.600]   in HD.
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:07.600]   They're subtitles.
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:09.160]   So you can just read along.
[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:13.880]   It also helps if you kind of just read the libretto, just read the story beforehand so
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:15.280]   you know what's going on.
[01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:17.720]   And maybe and you'll say, okay, well, I'll cancel it after a month.
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:20.920]   And then it's three months later and your watch you've got like Thursday night is opera
[01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:22.680]   night every week.
[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:25.480]   So it's such a great recommendation.
[01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:32.840]   I did get it because a few months ago, because somebody had illegally posted a certain opera
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:37.120]   onto YouTube and I felt guilty about not paying for it and I couldn't buy it on Blu-ray.
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:41.760]   So I said, okay, I'll subscribe to Med Opera HD for a month to sort of cleanse my soul.
[01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:44.520]   I'm still watching it every week.
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:50.920]   And the side pocket sort of recommendation is on Sunday, general tickets for the 2017-2018
[01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:52.920]   season of the Med Opera went on sale.
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:57.760]   It starts in late September, goes through May of 2018.
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:01.640]   And if you're going to be in New York anytime during that period, check out the website,
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:05.480]   go to Med Opera dot org, check out what's going to be available.
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:08.520]   And one of the nights that you're going, you'll be really, really surprised.
[01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:13.000]   I went to my first opera at the Met about three or four or five years ago, assuming that I'd
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.360]   be kicked out for being obvious riffraff.
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:17.000]   But they're happy with riffraff.
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:18.600]   Oh, they want more riffraff.
[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:19.600]   Yeah.
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:20.600]   They don't.
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:21.600]   They don't.
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:27.080]   I mean, they do so much outreach to make opera accessible to everybody.
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:29.120]   I've really admired the way they go about it.
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:32.200]   And the Met from Opera House, it's a barn.
[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:36.960]   It's got thousands of seats and they will, they want to fill those seats rather than
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:37.960]   let them go empty.
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:42.720]   So yes, you can get the best seats in the house cost about 400 bucks, but you can buy
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:46.200]   in advance tickets that cost 30 bucks, 40 bucks.
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:50.600]   And yes, those are like higher on the upper tiers, but the music fills the entire house,
[01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:53.680]   you know, and you can still see the, and you can still see the, the auditorium.
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:57.360]   And it's way, way cheaper than any ticket you're going to get on Broadway, even at half
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:56:58.360]   price.
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:02.920]   And the production values, you will see 30, you'll see, you'll have a full live orchestra
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:03.960]   underneath you.
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:10.080]   You will have a cast of like 30 people, a huge set that takes a immense amount of labor
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:13.240]   in order to put in and to switch from scene after scene.
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:18.520]   I will, I will say that if you go to the site at metropmetoper.org, I'll give you the advice
[01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:22.400]   that I'm following as I'm sort of eyeing certain tickets as I'm traveling.
[01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:26.840]   Anything with Joyce D. Donato on it, she's in two different productions.
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:30.840]   Kathleen Kim, which is another soprano that I've been really looking for an opportunity
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:36.720]   to see actually D. Donato and Kim are in a production of Cinderella in April or May.
[01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:41.120]   Vittorio Grigio is an amazing tenor that I've seen twice now.
[01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:45.480]   And he's on that list of if I'm going to, if I happen to be in town on business, I'm
[01:57:45.480 --> 01:57:51.000]   going to definitely see if at 1201 PM to see if I can get $25 last minute rush sheets.
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.920]   Because that's another thing they do for you can get I've gotten like $200 seats in
[01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:58.040]   the orchestra for $25 damn dollars.
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:02.960]   Because if there are seats available, they release them at like 1201 PM on the website,
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:04.040]   you can go buy them.
[01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:06.240]   So it's definitely worth doing once.
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:09.880]   If you're going to be in New York City, it's less than the cost, less than what it costs
[01:58:09.880 --> 01:58:12.920]   to go to the Empire State Building or the top of the rock.
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:18.200]   So many things that cost a lot more than $25 or $30 and do not include 40 people on stage,
[01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:23.080]   three world class professionals who've been studying 15 years before they produce, they
[01:58:23.080 --> 01:58:26.000]   did this performance even once.
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:30.360]   And one of the most beautiful sites you can be in the nice in the in New York City.
[01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:31.560]   So definitely check it out.
[01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:33.440]   It's definitely worth doing at least once.
[01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:35.920]   If you don't become a fan after once, that's fine.
[01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:41.400]   And the last thing I need to remind you of the seatbacks at the Metropolitan Opera House,
[01:58:41.400 --> 01:58:46.320]   each has a tiny little LCD screen so that there will be there are English subtitles
[01:58:46.320 --> 01:58:47.320]   as they're singing.
[01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:51.440]   You can turn on and off so that you you have if you've ever watched a foreign movie, you'll
[01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:53.400]   have no problem following the story watching it.
[01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:56.760]   So high recommendation, you've got 30 bucks in your pocket.
[01:58:56.760 --> 01:58:58.400]   You should see the Metropolitan Opera at least once.
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:03.280]   If you've got $15 in your pocket and you're curious, check out this app for a month and
[01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:07.800]   you'll find that it's not something that you'll you'll be dismissing the alarm, the reminder
[01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:11.360]   that you set for yourself every month to say, make sure you're not.
[01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:12.960]   You cancel this thing you signed up for.
[01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:16.640]   I'll give it one more month because I think the last season stuff is going to start to
[01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:17.640]   drop.
[01:59:17.640 --> 01:59:21.000]   And if you're going to go see your first opera, pick something that's a little bit of a crowd
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:24.560]   favorite because there are operas that are avant garde, modern operas.
[01:59:24.560 --> 01:59:27.040]   There's a little off putting.
[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:29.240]   Lucia de Llamour is really hard.
[01:59:29.240 --> 01:59:30.600]   You will be crying at the end of it.
[01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:35.840]   However, they did they had Julie Tamor, who was the like famous Broadway director.
[01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:37.120]   She did the producers.
[01:59:37.120 --> 01:59:38.280]   She did the Lion King.
[01:59:38.280 --> 01:59:42.640]   They commissioned from her a production of the Magic Flute that is intentionally designed
[01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:43.640]   to be accessible.
[01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:45.240]   It's in English, not in German.
[01:59:45.240 --> 01:59:46.840]   It's about 90 minutes long.
[01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:50.160]   So kids can maybe even sit through the entire thing.
[01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:54.160]   So it's not necessarily the greatest version of the Magic Flute ever done, but it is a
[01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:58.600]   really good intro and it's running from September 27 to October 14.
[01:59:58.600 --> 01:59:59.600]   I think that's a great opera.
[01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:00.600]   It's 25 bucks.
[02:00:00.600 --> 02:00:06.240]   I took Lisa and her son, Michael's 14 to the Magic Flute because that opera is traditionally
[02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:08.480]   considered a great one, especially for kids.
[02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:15.640]   It starts off with a giant snake being operated by 18 puppeteers attacking a prince.
[02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:17.360]   Oh my God, opening scene.
[02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:18.360]   And this is an opera.
[02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:23.240]   Unfortunately, the San Francisco opera decided to do an avant garde presentation of it.
[02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:26.840]   It was a little off putting for them, but I think this Julie Tamor sounds like a very
[02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:28.040]   good one.
[02:00:28.040 --> 02:00:31.040]   She knows how to make something really pop.
[02:00:31.040 --> 02:00:36.000]   And then the barber Seville is very easy and light and fun.
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:39.960]   There's some great fun operas that would be a good one to start with.
[02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:43.800]   Don't start with, you know, got a dommering the ring cycle.
[02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:45.600]   That would probably not be.
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:47.120]   They don't do a lot of Wagnerian opera.
[02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:55.000]   They do a lot of like, tell some Hoffman, which the opening story is the poet falls
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:56.000]   in love with a robot.
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:57.000]   Yeah.
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:58.000]   It was written in the 1890s.
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.000]   There you go.
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:00.840]   Yeah, they had robots back then.
[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:02.280]   Interesting.
[02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:09.080]   That concludes this thrilling gripping edition minus the singing of a Mac break week.
[02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:12.280]   That's the, yeah, we left it.
[02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:15.280]   We let it was all the bread.
[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:16.760]   You can add the music.
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:21.360]   I was going to say the common opera similarly about when something is over, but then I realized
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:23.560]   that that's kind of the kind of stuff.
[02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:25.640]   The Viking sings.
[02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:26.640]   Yes.
[02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:29.280]   You need a light motif, Andy.
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:32.960]   Some song, some theme that plays whenever you walk.
[02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:38.280]   I'm disappointed because I'm a baritone and all the great areas go to tenors.
[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:40.440]   We get to play Zoroastro.
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:45.800]   We get to play the, the uncle that tells Vailetta, please let my son, Alfredo alone.
[02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:46.800]   We don't get that.
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:47.800]   We don't get the cool.
[02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:48.800]   Oh, I'm a prince.
[02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:50.360]   I'm going to save the world and I'm optimistic.
[02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:52.160]   It's a well.
[02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:53.880]   Oh, sigh.
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:58.760]   Andy and I goes at the Chicago Sun times when he's not at the Metropolitan Opera.
[02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:04.720]   And you can find his blog at cwob.com and he's on the Twitter at IHNATKO.
[02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:08.240]   Don't forget Andy I on the Flickr too.
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:09.240]   Great photos.
[02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:10.240]   Always a pleasure.
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:11.240]   Thanks.
[02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:16.560]   Mr. Renee Richie, you'll find him at imore.com where he has written fabulous articles about
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:18.840]   Pokemon Go and others.
[02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:21.120]   iOS 11 and I hope they got it.
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:22.120]   Oh yeah, that.
[02:02:22.120 --> 02:02:23.640]   Oh, and our new homepage is finally a lively.
[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:25.360]   Oh, you've been asking me for weeks and it's finally alive.
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:26.360]   Let me go look at it.
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:29.320]   I'm mower.com.
[02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:30.320]   Very yellow.
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:32.160]   It's yellow is the new black.
[02:02:32.160 --> 02:02:36.720]   Yellow is the new black, but it's yellow is the new orange.
[02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:37.720]   So yes.
[02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:39.800]   Well, that nice.
[02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:40.800]   Very nice.
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:41.800]   Like it.
[02:02:41.800 --> 02:02:42.800]   Yeah.
[02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:44.320]   Very pretty.
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:45.320]   Very nice.
[02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:46.320]   Thank you.
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:47.320]   The design team did all the hard work.
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:48.600]   I just get this here and see.
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:50.600]   Yeah, I like this font choice too.
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:51.600]   The headline font.
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:52.600]   Thank you.
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:53.600]   What is that?
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:54.600]   I have to look it up.
[02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:55.600]   I don't remember.
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:02:57.840]   Yeah, it's really nice.
[02:02:57.840 --> 02:02:58.840]   That's fun.
[02:02:58.840 --> 02:02:59.840]   Thank you.
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:05.720]   Yeah, it's kind of friendly and fun, but clear.
[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:06.720]   It's really good.
[02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:07.720]   We're getting there.
[02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:08.720]   Yeah.
[02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:09.720]   Thank you.
[02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:11.200]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, he's at the Pixel Core.
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:17.000]   Busy, busy, busy, but I'll tell you what, if you follow him on Twitter, ALEX, L-I-N-D-S-A-Y.
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:23.840]   Occasionally, he'll do public events, you know, on Final Cut Pro and stuff and it's
[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:25.040]   worth following him to know.
[02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:28.520]   I'm actually committing myself to doing more get-togethers.
[02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:30.640]   So I travel a lot and a lot of times I can't.
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:35.600]   So I'm trying to extend my stays a little bit and get to, you know, especially looking
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:37.280]   for production people, usually in the cities.
[02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:38.800]   Like meetups and stuff.
[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:39.800]   Meetups, yeah.
[02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:43.120]   So we're going to do more of those throughout the summer and fall, so it'd be good.
[02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:47.720]   And everyone's probably going to just have me, I think my last tweet was not nearly as
[02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:48.720]   useful.
[02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:51.520]   It was just me talking about the fact that my kids were watching Redneck.
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:52.520]   I saw that.
[02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:53.520]   Redneck fails.
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:54.520]   Do you ever do any of this stuff?
[02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:58.040]   Because they, I mean, they've seen where I grew up and they, I was like, yeah.
[02:03:58.040 --> 02:04:01.280]   So that was, that was like, yeah.
[02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:03.920]   That's why they call his uncle Bert Three Fingers.
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:04.920]   Yeah.
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:05.920]   Yeah.
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:07.920]   There was a lot of that.
[02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:14.680]   I'm like, I look back and I just, I'm not, I don't even know how I survived.
[02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:16.760]   I look at how worried I am about my kids.
[02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:21.000]   I'm like, I mean, when I was their age, I was, you know, I had a friend who grew up in the
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:26.440]   country and he did have an uncle, Bert, who was the fireworks king.
[02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:27.440]   They had so much fun.
[02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:30.280]   They'd set up bleachers in the cornfield.
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:35.880]   So the, so the whole family can get together and watch as Bert blew things up, sometimes
[02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:37.800]   a little bits of himself as well.
[02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:40.200]   That was, that was my childhood.
[02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:42.200]   Did it fall on Big Acannon?
[02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:45.360]   Well, I, I made a lot of time there.
[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:48.280]   And, and, but, but on Big Acasions, Mike, we would get the license and I would get, I
[02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:51.320]   would get four inch mortars, which were fun.
[02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:52.320]   Mortars are the awesomest.
[02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:53.320]   Yeah.
[02:04:53.320 --> 02:04:54.320]   Yeah.
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:55.320]   They were great.
[02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:57.520]   So just don't put your head over, over when you're lighting the dust.
[02:04:57.520 --> 02:04:59.040]   And did you do that once?
[02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:00.040]   I got close.
[02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:01.800]   They went off a little faster than I expected.
[02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:02.800]   Yeah.
[02:05:02.800 --> 02:05:03.800]   So, but I only lost a little hair.
[02:05:03.800 --> 02:05:04.800]   Yeah.
[02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:07.080]   Obviously I'm still not a lot gone.
[02:05:07.080 --> 02:05:08.080]   You know, yeah.
[02:05:08.080 --> 02:05:09.080]   Yeah.
[02:05:09.080 --> 02:05:12.640]   But just now, you know why he never turns his head to the left.
[02:05:12.640 --> 02:05:16.720]   We do a Mac break weekly every Tuesday, 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern time.
[02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:20.200]   That would be 1800 UTC if you want to come by and say hi.
[02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:23.800]   As I mentioned, come a little early, you'll see iOS today because we start that show on
[02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:25.440]   Tuesday now.
[02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:26.920]   And you can also join us in the chat room.

[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:35.520]   But if you can't do that, and I know, you know, people have jobs and lives, don't worry.

[02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:44.280]   But you know what you really should do?
[02:05:44.280 --> 02:05:48.920]   For app you use to listen to podcasts, go there, search for Mac break weekly and subscribe.
[02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:51.000]   Subscribe to the audio or the video feed.

[02:05:56.520 --> 02:06:00.040]   But now I'm afraid my friends, I must tell you, it's time to get back to work because
[02:06:00.040 --> 02:06:01.360]   break time is over.
[02:06:01.360 --> 02:06:11.360]   [MUSIC]
