[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:49.480]   Joining us from the loop, loopinsight.com. The famous, the world famous Jim Dowrymple.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.480]   Hello, Jim. How you doing, Leo?
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.480]   I am great. It's good to see you.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.480]   Good to see you too. I miss you.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.480]   Yeah. Looks like the beard's in fine fettle.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.480]   Oh, you know, it's going strong. Nothing I can do about it.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.480]   Great to have you. Your ears were probably burning because I've been talking about iTunes
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:14.480]   match and the problems you had a couple of years back with Apple's music matching and so forth.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.480]   It's all better now, right?
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.480]   Pretty much.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.480]   Okay. There you go. There you have it.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.480]   There's topic two today.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.480]   There's the view from the front.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:33.480]   Also with us, Mr. Andrew Inocco of WGBH in Boston, Boston Public Radio. Nice to see you.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.480]   Nice to see you in honor of Jim. I did not shave today, so I have don't have a beard.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.480]   You've got to wait a minute.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.480]   I have solidarity like chin stuff. You've got to wait a minute.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.480]   Yeah, you've got a month or two.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.480]   See, I got, again, between this, my sideburns and Jim's everything else.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.480]   We've got real like Civil War, like Northern General stuff.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.480]   I'm the only one on the panel without any facial here.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.480]   I feel really left out because Renee Richie's back.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.480]   We missed you, Renee.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.480]   And so I missed you guys too.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.480]   I had to go. I had an unexpected CES experience.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.480]   Yeah, so who's like that?
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.480]   How did that happen?
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.480]   My boss kept saying you don't have to go. You don't have to go.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.480]   You don't have to go. And then like two days before he's like,
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.480]   I remember when I said you don't have to go.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.480]   I was kind of wrong.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.480]   You have to go.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.480]   Was it worth it?
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.480]   What was it?
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.480]   Did Apple actually had a little bit of a presence to CES?
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.480]   Yeah, with all the, I'm sure we're going to talk about it with all the AirPlay2 and HomeKit
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.480]   and iTunes for Tizen.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.480]   I mean, let that sink in for a moment.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.480]   I tuned for Tizen.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.480]   Wow.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.480]   They were the big talk of the show.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.480]   Last year there was a lot of condemnation for them not being there,
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.480]   not having any presence, letting Google Home and Alexis deal the show.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.480]   And this year Samsung put out their announcement the Sunday before the show
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.480]   and they got just a ton of attention for the rest of the week
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.480]   because it kept me like, and another TV set company and another TV set company.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.480]   So Apple did much better prepared.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.480]   Apple did, at first we thought Apple's only presence would be that big billboard on the
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.480]   side of the Marriott Hotel there that said,
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.480]   That was priceless.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.480]   And what happens on the iPhone stays on the iPhone.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.480]   A great lesson in snark according to CNET.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.480]   And that, and that, and that, of course the whole point of that is,
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.480]   while everything else at CES is spying on you, we're not.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.480]   You like that, Jim?
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.480]   I mean, I did like that.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.480]   I thought that was a brilliant marketing campaign going into CES
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.480]   considering the other companies that were going to be there.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.480]   Probably Google Assistant and Amazon's Echo.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:46.480]   When you think about it, what better way to fight the competition than boost the thing
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.480]   that you put out there the most, which is privacy for Apple,
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.480]   and the thing that other companies put out there the least.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:01.480]   This, Apple's, I was talking on Friday with, on triangulation with Shushana Zoboff.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.480]   She's written a new book called Surveillance Capitalism.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.480]   She says, "Invented by Google, perfected by Facebook, but she gave Apple a pass."
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.480]   She said, and I asked her about this.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.480]   She said, "Really, it's a big opportunity for Apple.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.480]   So if people want to use technology, because technology doesn't mean surveillance,
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.480]   but if they want to use technology without having the company collect data about them,
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.480]   and then try to influence them with that data,
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.480]   Apple seems like they're well positioned to do that.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.480]   That would be a real opportunity for them, and it seems like they know that.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.480]   Can I give you a great example, Leo?
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.480]   So like Apple also got their act together with HomeKit this year,
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.480]   and they worked with a bunch of providers to get really good products like door locks
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.480]   and doorbells and all these camera systems,
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.480]   that also have options not to share your data with anybody.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.480]   And that came into really good focus a couple of days in.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.480]   Ring.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.480]   Ring.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.480]   The first the information and then the intercept broke that story about Ring,
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.480]   and that really, I know for a lot, especially a lot of people at this show,
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.480]   that gave them sort of an instant different take on almost all of the gadgets that were putting all your stuff
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.480]   into these company's hands all the time.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.480]   And companies who didn't always know, like they were just a product name,
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.480]   you didn't necessarily know who owned them or where the data was.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.480]   And I'll mention this story because Ring was a long time sponsor of our shows.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.480]   The Ring Doorbell was purchased by Amazon.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.480]   Amazon says they're not doing this.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.480]   Ring wasn't clear whether they'd done it in the past.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.480]   A couple of years ago, I think it was 2016, Ring wanted apparently,
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.480]   according to the, this is the story from the intercept, Sam Biddle.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.480]   Why don't completely trust?
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.480]   You said the information also had this, I trust.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.480]   The information had it earlier in December, and they listed, like,
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.480]   they're very good at disclosing.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.480]   And they said, we have 24 sources who said this.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.480]   We have company documents, we have their PowerPoint presentations.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.480]   Okay, that's very good.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.480]   We have their investor notes.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:59.480]   So in order to get a face recognition into their device,
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.480]   they, and this is not an unusual practice, they needed it to be trained,
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.480]   actually object recognition, they needed to be trained.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.480]   And so they sent it to contractors in Ukraine who would then circle,
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.480]   that's a face, that's a package, that's a tree.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:21.480]   And according to the story, they basically gave them access to an S3 bucket
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.480]   that had everybody's video from every Ring device,
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.480]   ostensibly for the training, but it also meant that those people
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.480]   that download it share it.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:37.480]   Without, without, without due caution, without due protection,
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.480]   this is how these things almost always happen.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.480]   It's never, it's never, it's never that cavalier,
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.480]   but it's just as devastating.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.480]   Where they say, oh, we just need to train our system to learn about
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.480]   what a dog looks like, but it doesn't occur to them that maybe this
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.480]   should be, this training should be happening inside a locked box
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.480]   with all kinds of controls over who gets access to this video
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.480]   and what they can do with it.
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.480]   But no, unless your company is really built from the ground up
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.480]   with the idea that security and privacy is one of our foundational
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.480]   and foundational and fundamental tenets, this is the sort of thing
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.480]   that happens.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.480]   That's the difference between a company like Apple and everybody else
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.480]   and then to a lesser extent, a company like Google and a company like Facebook.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.480]   Remember that the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, uh,
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.480]   uprising from employees could not shut down the project to create a search engine
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.480]   for China.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.480]   Outrage from governments could not create, create the, could not turn down
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:36.480]   that, that, that project, pressure from, from, from, uh, human rights people
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.480]   that do that.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:42.480]   But as soon as they violated internal, internal privacy protocols say that
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.480]   you should not be, you did not come to what come to our department for permission
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.480]   to scrape this data from this Google owned China launch page.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.480]   You are getting shut down right now.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.480]   You have no access to any of the data you need.
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.480]   So it, but it's, it's shocking though, isn't it, that the only thing that
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:03.480]   stops these things from happening is the goodwill or the good intentions
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.480]   of the good dogma in Apple's case of a company that there are no, in the United
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.480]   States, there are just no protections whatsoever.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.480]   All you got to do is say, sorry.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.480]   And then maybe you have to send to some, send a nice note to the shareholders for
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.480]   this, for the stock dive, but there's no consequences whatsoever and that needs
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.480]   to change.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.480]   And it's, it's never, it's almost never malicious.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.480]   Sometimes it's almost never malicious, but it's just expediency.
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.480]   They wanted this done and they have terrible, but they also had a database that had,
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.480]   that they could go find the email address and then put that email address in and
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.480]   watch that specific camera.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.480]   And because there was no one supervising any of it, guess what they did.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.480]   I mean, it just, it, it's just trouble all the way to go.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.480]   I still have a ring doorbell.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.480]   I don't really much care.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.480]   Somebody looks at what's outside my house, but I guess ring also, I didn't realize
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.480]   this had inside cameras.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.480]   Yeah, it was the internal cameras too.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.480]   And they said they were, like, they, people were walking by or they were
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.480]   watching people kissing and having conversation.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.480]   This is why I wonder when Apple is going to do their own like home security or home,
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.480]   like home monitoring service, that's going to be a killer thing.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.480]   If there's one thing that could get me to switch a certain platform to Apple,
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:13.480]   it would be if they would decide, if I get the functionality of my Google backed
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.480]   internal cameras, which are really useful for me because sometimes I just need to
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.480]   check what's going on outside.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.480]   Or sometimes when I leave, I really do want to have a camera going on inside my
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.480]   office to make sure that nobody is stealing a $5,000 thing that's on loan to me that
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.480]   I'm going to have to pay for.
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:34.480]   But even with Google, a company that I trust with conditions, I keep that
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.480]   camera turned off when I don't need a security thing.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.480]   If Apple decided to do this, I mean, you guys are absolutely right.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:45.480]   When it comes to privacy and security, this really is hardwired into the DNA of the
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.480]   company.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.480]   And I would implicitly, instinctively trust that not only do they as a company,
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.480]   are they as a company not going to abuse this data, but they're going to make sure
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.480]   that no one else can abuse it either.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.480]   This would be a huge opportunity for Apple.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:03.480]   Neither Amazon or Ring responded to the information's request, although according to
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:09.480]   the intercept, a Ring spokesperson said it's not happening now, but he did not.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.480]   Yeah, I got a comment from the guest.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.480]   I got a comment from, because I put up a video about it.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:20.480]   I used those as examples for why we need both regulation about privacy for
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.480]   companies and also protection from the government from these companies, but also
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.480]   protection from the government, like basically a right for privacy.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.480]   And I got a very polite two paragraph statement from them, basically saying that they take
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.480]   privacy very, very seriously and they have strict policies in place.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.480]   But as numerous people pointed out, this was all forward looking stuff.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.480]   It didn't really address anything specific in the past.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:44.480]   Are they changing the terms of service to say that now it is an explicit opt-in to
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:50.480]   allow the company access to data for training purposes, both humans and robots, or is it
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.480]   now simply, well, this is one of the things that's been done.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.480]   This is one of the things you blow past when you're trying to get this thing installed.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:05.480]   I think a lot of this stuff, not just from Ring, but for all of these companies that are
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:14.480]   looking at AI and machine learning and all of that, they're so focused on the technology.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:19.480]   They tend to forget about all of the privacy aspects of what they're doing.
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.480]   And I agree with Renee a lot.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:29.480]   This isn't necessarily malicious, but the end result is basically the same.
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.480]   I don't think it's malicious, but it is sloppy.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.480]   Exactly.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:40.480]   It's the interests of a company superseding what the interests of the user are.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.480]   And it's a complicated problem in medicine too.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:50.480]   The thing is, the more data that medical algorithms get access to, the better these things are going
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:58.480]   to be at discovering diseases and discovering problems early on, or reducing the cost and
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.480]   increasing the access of medicine.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:07.480]   However, medical information is one area in which we do have laws protecting what information
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:12.480]   can be sent elsewhere and why and how consent has to be performed explicitly in order for
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.480]   this sort of happen.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:22.480]   So it's odd that we are being protected very rightly our privacy of medical information,
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:29.480]   but this is also delaying the access to medical technology that could potentially save a lot
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.480]   of lives in the future.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.480]   But you have to make a decision.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:38.480]   It's also the same week that we found out 300 bucks could get a bounty hunter or debt collector
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.480]   access to your exact location from a 20, almost all the carriers.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:48.480]   The mobile Verizon had done it before and got caught, so they weren't available.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.480]   Apple has taken measures that are interesting.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.480]   You're getting some sense that maybe care.
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:14:01.480]   They hired this week, a former Facebook employee, Sandy Peracales, who had left Facebook in
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:07.480]   2012 and has been very critical over its privacy policies since then.
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.480]   According to Financial Times, Peracales will work in Apple's privacy team as a product
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:19.480]   manager, which is an internal facing role designed to, and I love this, to ensure that new
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.480]   products and development protect users' privacy and minimize data collection.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.480]   That's, I think, a strong signal that Apple cares about this.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.480]   They have a really cool approach.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:32.480]   Previously, there was the performance team and the security team who could literally take away your
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.480]   code and say, "No, you're not shipping this until you fix it or we fix it or somebody fixes it."
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:41.480]   They've added a privacy team and the privacy team starts when you have, like with FaceID,
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.480]   it starts when you have the idea for FaceID.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.480]   It's not like, "Develop FaceID, then we'll figure out how to make it private."
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.480]   It's, "No, you can't do this until it's private."
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.480]   "Okay, you've done that.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.480]   Now you can't do this until it."
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:54.480]   Each step along the way, they have to figure out how to collect the minimum amount of data
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.480]   possible, how to encrypt it, how to anonymize it, how to get rid of it as fast as possible,
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.480]   and in the end, ultimately make a product that passes Apple's privacy criteria and they're
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.480]   involved every step of the way along the process.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.480]   They have these teams, including individuals like him, who sit down with the engineers
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.480]   and with the engineering managers and figure out how to do it.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:19.480]   Tim Cook, in his interview with Axios last November, said the privacy is a core value.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.480]   If you look back over time, we were talking about privacy well before iPhone, so we always
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.480]   believe that privacy was at the core of our civil liberties.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:31.480]   It's not a matter of privacy versus profits or privacy versus technical innovation.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.480]   That's a false choice.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.480]   What we've done is your device has incredible intelligence about you, but I don't have
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.480]   to have all of that as a company.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.480]   Now, okay, here's a tough question though.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.480]   Some say, "Yeah, Apple pays lip service to this.
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:51.480]   It's good marketing, but do they really do it?"
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.480]   I think they do.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:16:00.480]   They really do it because a lot of the information that we try and send to Apple through Siri
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:05.480]   Siri could be a much more intuitive product if Apple would pull up.
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.480]   That's the proof.
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.480]   Siri sucks.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.480]   Oh, my God.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.480]   You think they would do that purposely?
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.480]   That should have been the second billboard.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.480]   They have another wall billboard available for purchase.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.480]   Look how bad Siri is compared to everything else on the market.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.480]   That means you could trust us.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:29.480]   I mean, really, Siri can do things inside of your iPhone or your iPad, but it's not
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.480]   on your iPad.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:37.480]   But if Siri collected more data and looked ahead more like some of the other products out there,
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.480]   then that's a good data knowing.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.480]   I agree.
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.480]   What about China though?
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.480]   I mean, Apple has been very cooperative with the Chinese government.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.480]   In fact, iCloud data in China is stored on Chinese servers.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:53.480]   So I asked about that because I talk about this stuff quite a lot and always want to make
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.480]   sure I know what I'm talking about.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:00.560]   It's hard for people outside China to think about life in China because for China, our
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:05.000]   citizens have data and will be damned if that data gets stored on American servers.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   That's data for Chinese.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   Completely reasonable, by the way.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.680]   Has to be stored on Chinese.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.280]   And France wants this too.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.480]   And the US doesn't want US telecommunications to go through Huawei.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:17.920]   But we know that China, the Chinese government has in the past, in the case of Yahoo, used
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.480]   information collected by tech companies to prosecute and...
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.480]   Sure.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.480]   So Apple has the keys.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:27.480]   So the difference architecturally between how iCloud works in China and how iCloud works
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.480]   in America.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.480]   So the Chinese government doesn't have access to that data without some sort of legal process.
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.980]   No, the danger is it's so much closer that they could force their way in and use legal
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:39.480]   compulsions that would take weeks or months to get done in the US.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.480]   They could do them there.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.680]   But if that happens, then I think Apple will have to make a bigger decision about China.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.800]   But for now, it's really, it's repatriation.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.560]   It's still problematic.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:55.760]   It's the only reason why Apple is the company you can trust the most in terms of taking
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.840]   security and privacy seriously.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:03.720]   That's why I twitch a little when I see as big a flex as the statement that what happens
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.400]   on your iPhone stays on your iPhone.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:12.280]   Because I don't think that they can, I don't think they can, they have really earned the
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.240]   ability to be that.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.400]   I don't want to use the word arrogant again about it.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.120]   I think there's something too much not just below arrogant.
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:27.240]   Because because they have a similarity with Google and Facebook in that they know where
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.120]   their money is coming from.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:34.080]   And they're willing to flex on something that doesn't really affect their own bottom line
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.160]   at all.
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:39.960]   What if one of the best things they could do to help user privacy is to say, well, guess
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:40.960]   what?
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:45.480]   We're no longer going to be taking any money from Google to use Google as the default search
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.480]   engine.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:53.520]   All search engine is going to be duck duck go because we love their privacy protections.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.320]   And also we know that the one of the most helpful things we could possibly do for duck
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:02.200]   duck go is to make it the default search engine for the most popular mobile platform.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:06.160]   Excuse me, but one of the most popular mobile platforms in the world.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.640]   But they don't do that.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:13.080]   And they could also make the Safari browser a lot that make more proactive in protecting
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.960]   people against trackers, but they don't really do that either.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.840]   That's not saying that they're hypocrites at all.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:24.160]   But that's when you it's a difference between saying we are proud of our respect for the
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:30.600]   privacy of our users and saying big billboard facing everybody at CES saying what happens
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.040]   on your iPhone stays on your iPhone.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:36.920]   Well, it depends on what country you're in and depends on what you're doing with it.
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:42.320]   And we'll still let certain apps on the app store that maybe are still gonna tell you
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.920]   that it's I just want to show a shot.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.040]   I said, do you use a smartphone?
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:51.240]   She said, yeah, I use an iPhone, but I don't put any apps on it because because that is
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.240]   it.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.240]   That is the case.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.960]   If you put the Facebook app on an iPhone, right, what happens in your iPhone does not stay
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:01.360]   on your iPhone with regards to the Facebook app, including location, information that
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.240]   you allow Facebook to collect.
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:10.400]   The way that that users interact with with other companies or other apps Apple can't control
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.400]   that.
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.520]   I mean, and they're not a charity.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:26.520]   They do, they're out there to make some money, but keep users' privacy as one of their main
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.520]   objectives.
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.160]   And they can argue that it's a user's choice.
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.880]   I mean, I don't have Facebook in my iPhone.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.880]   That's up to you.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.160]   Again, I'm not saying they're hypocrites.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.640]   I'm not saying that they're in any way like a terrible at security and privacy.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.360]   Again, they are the apps, not only the best, they are the standard, I think, that every
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.240]   all other companies should emulate.
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:48.400]   However, when they do something as explicit like that, I'm the jerk in the back of the
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.080]   room who cops and raises his hand and saying, can you clarify your position on this?
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:59.480]   I would love to hear Tim Cook at some point post a letter simply saying that there is
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:05.720]   a line that we're not willing to cross when it comes to helping governments do bad things
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.520]   to their own citizens.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:17.480]   Like if the government of any country wanted to want the iPhone to have a kill switch for
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:22.000]   certain types of conversation, let's say they passed an actual law in the country saying
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.880]   that every phone in the country has to do all this text messaging through the standardized
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:31.400]   text messaging app that we can actually take a look at if we need to.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:36.040]   And we're not allowing VPNs, which is something that's already happened in China, but we're
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.120]   also not allowing encrypted chat applications.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:47.000]   I would love Tim Cook to say we have a duty to say that if a government crosses an ethical
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.280]   line in our estimation, we will simply turn our back on that market.
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:56.280]   We will not simply decide that a market is so valuable to us that we are willing to let
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:01.640]   the iPhone become a tool of oppression, which is very, very possible in so much of the world.
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.080]   We're talking so far historically, Dave.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.080]   We're talking slight differences here.
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:10.560]   I mean, if I put a Google phone next to the iPhone, if that's the choice, well, it's clear
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.560]   this is more private.
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:15.720]   Maybe it's not perfect, but the iPhone is clearly more private than any other.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:21.200]   There's also sort of a quasi line where they, like for example, they prefer to stay engaged
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.200]   in everything.
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.120]   Apple always believes that engagement is the best way to elicit change.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.800]   And if they pull out completely, then they no longer have an effective platform to which
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.520]   promote the change that they want.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.920]   So they'll do a certain like, for example, they still want to provide backup services
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.560]   to Chinese customers because they believe they promised them that.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.320]   And that's fail safe, not fail secure.
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.800]   And you can argue about which is better for which customer, but they believe that by pulling
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.400]   out completely from China, they'd no longer be able to offer things like preserving your
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.640]   photos of your children and things like that.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.360]   But they've also shown with San Bernardino that there is a line where they believe if
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.440]   it's not legal and it's not ethical, they will fight for it.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.200]   We don't know what will happen if they lose ever.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.600]   Like, we'll see what happens with Australia now with some of their laws, or maybe in the
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.240]   EU when they pass their laws, but they've shown a willingness to at least engage in incredibly
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.280]   public fist-ac-cuffs over things that they find.
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.840]   >> And let's point out that human rights groups have said exactly the same thing that
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:14.000]   if you mostly, mostly in terms of what Google is trying, it wants to do in China.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.840]   But saying that although it's a complex issue, we do believe that it's better to give people
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:26.680]   access to tools that may, tools that might improve their lives and hope that it doesn't
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:31.080]   get compromised and maybe pull them back later than to simply preemptively decide that no,
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.840]   we're just not going to participate whatsoever.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.600]   >> I think FaceTime was pulled in the Emirates when they were having issues with it.
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.040]   They would rather not provide the service than provide it compromised.
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.360]   They just pulled the FaceTime app.
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:44.880]   >> You know, it's interesting because in this, I learned a lot in this book, Surveillance
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:51.320]   Capitalism, but she quotes Larry Page and Sergey Brin in their early paper about Google
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:59.280]   in their late 90s, which they said, "We'll never do advertising because advertising ultimately,
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:03.520]   however much you try to isolate it will impact the result of search."
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:11.240]   But what happened is the dot-compust and their investors in 2000 and 2001 came to them and
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.040]   said, "You guys have to do something to monetize.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.560]   This is not tenable."
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:20.360]   And Google flipped and said, "We're going to do advertising and in order to do advertising
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:24.240]   better, we're going to collect all of this data we have about..."
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.640]   You know, people are, we have a browser, we know a lot about what people do, not just
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.120]   what they search for, but what they do.
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.600]   And we're going to, instead of throwing that away, we're going to start using that.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:40.440]   Initially, they used it for advertising, but then Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg left Google,
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:45.480]   went to Facebook, Facebook realized, "Oh, this is more than just targeting ads.
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:51.400]   You can use this initially to predict behavior and ultimately to affect behavior."
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:55.680]   She points out that Facebook and it's, they call them the contagion studies.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:01.040]   You may remember a couple of these, one, Facebook tried to influence your mood by changing what
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.200]   was in your newsfeed and proved to be done.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.720]   In fact, they gave a paper saying, "Look, we could do this."
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:13.160]   And at that point now, it's not just the trade-off you're making, it's not just for better advertising,
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:18.520]   which to me is a worthwhile trade-off, but they're in fact able to influence you.
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.840]   And that starts to get problematic, obviously.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.040]   I don't know how perfectly they'll be able to do that.
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.480]   And we need some sort of legislative protections.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.320]   One company that never gets brought up in these conversations, and I think they're one
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.320]   of the most dangerous, potentially one of the most dangerous companies of all is Amazon,
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:40.040]   because the whole benefit of collecting data for advertising purposes, if you want to sell
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:45.680]   how good your ad network is, is you tell the tire company that, "No, not only are we going
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:49.520]   to give your ad and put your ad in front of a million people that suit the people you're
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:55.840]   asking for, but here's our data on how many people actually see one of these ads and then
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.280]   go through to an actual sale of that product."
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:04.200]   Amazon is the one company that can not only track everything.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:09.000]   If you just had a casual interest in a folding bicycle, they can track all the searches you
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.480]   did within Amazon, all the different products you looked at, track the level of your interest
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:20.000]   as it waxed and waned, track your interest in certain price levels, certain feature levels,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.720]   compare that to the history of the things you bought over the past 10 years, all the
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:29.920]   way down from chocolate chip morsels to an iMac, and then basically tell you, "No,
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:35.120]   we know that Andy Naught goes going to be ripe to buy a folding bicycle on February 8th,
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:41.520]   2019, and we're offering to the highest bidder someone, a series of ads that will target Andy
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.200]   for a folding bicycle.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:48.760]   If there's one company that is really ready to have the antitrust hammer brought down on
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:53.480]   them, I think that Amazon has to be one of those final two or three candidates on the
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.480]   pageant."
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:58.800]   That's part of the problem though, is that you can have a private iPhone, a private Apple
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.200]   stuff, but you're going to use it to buy stuff on Amazon.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.200]   You're going to use it to share.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:07.760]   I'm going to email somebody using Gmail and they'll have my email anyway.
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:14.440]   Amazon is at a very unique position though, and Andy is absolutely right about Amazon,
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:21.680]   but the way that the public looks at Amazon is for convenience and for shopping.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:31.080]   We're willing to go in there with an Amazon Prime subscription to get free shipping.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:35.720]   Amazon gives us all of this stuff, music and video and all of that kind of stuff with
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:42.520]   Prime, but they're getting so much information from us because we continue to buy there all
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.480]   the time.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.880]   As a consumer, it's very easy.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:52.240]   You can order off of Amazon anywhere and you can basically order anything you want.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:57.880]   I order firewood sticks from Amazon to light fire.
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.880]   Really?
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.240]   You buy your firewood on Amazon?
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.240]   No, the little sticks.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.240]   The fatwood.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.240]   The kindling.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:12.520]   I ordered that off of Amazon because you bought a cord to deliver a big box and it's done.
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:16.080]   You bought a cord of firewood on Amazon, then I'd be impressed.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.120]   They have a lumberjack network, Leo.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.120]   What are you talking about?
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.120]   They come in their plaidjack.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.120]   It's a driveway.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:28.880]   But we intend to trust Amazon as a brand like we trust Apple as a brand, but the differences
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:33.120]   are remarkable in how they use our information.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:37.200]   I think it's important and I think we can do this that we continue to tell Apple because
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:42.560]   I don't think most users probably aren't really that aware of it and care that much.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:46.760]   But I think it's important that we who do care really keep telling Apple, yes, this is
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:47.760]   good.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.840]   Keep doing this.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:53.840]   Keep your eye on the ball because at some point it may be that the investors or the shareholders
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:59.360]   say you got to make more money as their revenue drops on iPhones.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.880]   You got to make more money.
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.160]   You should really start doing it.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.960]   They tried eye ads, remember.
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:08.680]   That would have had some sort of trade off of privacy for advertising that they don't
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:12.840]   move down that road, that they understand there's real value to them as a company to
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:15.800]   preserve privacy as their core value.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.280]   As we said, once or twice before, it's all about the transaction.
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:23.280]   I'm comfortable with the transaction I'm making with Google given the quality of the apps
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.680]   and services and now the hardware that they give me.
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:30.240]   I'd like to think that I'm aware of what I'm giving them in response.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.080]   Some people are not comfortable with that transaction.
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.080]   That's perfectly fine.
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:36.200]   I'm not comfortable with the transaction I make with Facebook.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:41.720]   So I limit my exposure to Facebook to the minimum thing possible, which means that I'll
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:46.720]   like log in and check like on the web app messenger saying, oh, wow, remember that week
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.800]   that I was feeling really lonely because no one might want to invite me to Christmas
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.800]   parties.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:54.120]   You're like eight messengers on messenger saying, yo, Andy, I'm having a Christmas party
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.120]   two days.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.120]   Why don't you come over?
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.120]   Whoops.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.120]   Sorry.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.120]   It's January.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:02.280]   Second, and I don't have the messenger app on my phone.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:05.320]   So Andy, I'm happy to ask you for a new rescue.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.160]   I've got a Facebook portal.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:12.760]   I'll be glad to send you, Andy, if you want to really keep up with the friends.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:13.920]   So there is good news.
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:20.480]   A judge has now ruled a federal judge, just a court judge has now ruled that the feds,
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:27.720]   even with a warrant, cannot force you to unlock your phone with your finger or your face.
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:30.000]   This is a huge, huge ruling.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.960]   And I don't know how, you know, how I'm not sure what'll happen here.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:38.360]   The daughter came from US District Court, the Northern District of California.
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:42.000]   They denied a search warrant for a property in Oakland.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:49.600]   The warrant included all the phones, any phone on the premises and the ability to unlock
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.880]   them with facial recognition of fingerprint or an iris.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:59.560]   In the past, we've just kind of set off the cuff that courts seem to support the ability
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:03.640]   to use biometrics to unlock, but not the use of passwords.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.640]   Because it wasn't testimony.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.960]   Passwords were testimony, but biometrics weren't.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:14.000]   The judge, and I think this really recognizes the significant role that a phone plays in
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.560]   your life.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:20.680]   The judge, Candice Westmore, ruled the request was over-broad because it wasn't limited to
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.800]   a particular person or a particular device.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:29.480]   The judge said the government does not have the right, even with a warrant, to force suspects
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:35.880]   to incriminate themselves by unlocking their devices with their biological features.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:43.320]   This is a very surprising and I think a big deal ruling.
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:47.160]   It's a foundational thing.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.480]   Again, do you have the ability to keep a secret from the government?
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:55.520]   This isn't the big rule that I'm hoping to see in my lifetime, but it is a big deal to
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:59.280]   say that if you've encrypted a phone, if you've locked a phone, you can't be compelled
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.280]   to unlock it.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:04.680]   The government can take the phone and try to unlock it themselves, but they can't compel
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:07.040]   you to unlock it.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:10.720]   If this holds and this is certainly going to be challenged, the next step is to make
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:16.120]   sure that everybody, including the police, knows that they have the right to say, "No,
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.200]   I will not let you unlock my phone."
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:22.200]   That includes a cop taking your phone and then simply holding up to your face and hoping
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:26.280]   something good happens that we have to make sure that everybody understands that this
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.280]   is one of your rights.
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:31.080]   You don't have to give up a fingerprint or a face scan.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:37.080]   All the same, if I'm ever in a sketchy situation, I might just power down my phone just to
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.080]   take the case.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.360]   It would probably be prudent to use it to alpha and america pass code.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.880]   You can just squeeze it now.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:45.720]   It also doesn't affect border crossings, which I think is a much bigger problem.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:52.200]   There is a broader ability to search as you cross into and out of a country.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.800]   Of course, she's a magistrate judge, so she could be overruled by district court.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.600]   It could be appealed farther.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.080]   I don't know if it will be.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:03.640]   She said, and I think this is really great, "Technology is outpacing the law and that
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:08.960]   fingerprints and face scan are not the same as physical evidence."
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.880]   That's what they've been considered up to now, right?
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:16.400]   Like a fingerprint or a hair, and considered in a context where those body features would
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.800]   be used to unlock a phone.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:18.880]   It's essentially a recognition.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.880]   The phone is something special, something different.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:26.280]   She said, "If a person cannot be compelled to provide a pass code because it is testimonial
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:30.600]   communication, a person cannot be compelled to provide one's finger, thumb, iris, face,
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.840]   or other biometric feature to unlock that same device."
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.320]   That seems sensible.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.320]   That seems sensible.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.200]   It will be challenged, though.
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.440]   Maybe not in this case, but at some point.
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.520]   At some point, it will.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.040]   It's not law.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.880]   It's a precedent, but I don't know how strong it is.
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:50.920]   It's critically important, though, because our phones are now basically indistinguishable
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.920]   from external storage.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:55.520]   It's like a hard disk with a wire that we're hanging off of our heads instead of hanging
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.520]   off of a computer.
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:00.160]   It's keeping track of all the things that we're no longer equipped as humans to keep track
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.160]   of.
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:04.560]   Eventually, that link is going to break down between what's in our head and what's in our
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:06.720]   phone or what's in our devices.
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:10.240]   These are right now maybe external cybernetics, but eventually they'll get more and more internalized
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:13.360]   and technology will progress to the point where they can start having a real good idea
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.480]   what's knocking around inside our brains.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:19.480]   If we're not really careful about privacy, it sounds like one of those dystopian future
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:23.520]   movies, but it always happens one step at a time, we'll absolutely lose it.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:27.720]   I think it's best for all of us if we start litigating this stuff as early in that process
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.920]   as possible.
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:36.160]   The law is hysterically funny in how a precedent can shape unpredictable results in the future,
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:44.440]   but the whole basis of wiretapping without consent or being informed is based on telegraph operators
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:50.040]   saying that, "Well, the thing is we often have to listen in on a telegraph signal to
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.480]   make sure the wires are running properly."
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:59.440]   And on that basis, the person who is sending a telegraph wire cannot assume that this communication
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:04.280]   is not being observed by someone else, and therefore if we were to put a tap on a telegraph
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:09.760]   line before it even gets to a station or to someone who will turn into a printed message,
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:14.160]   it's okay for us to do that because the person had no idea that they were sending something
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:19.640]   that was private to say nothing of the transcription person, but that was the basis of saying that
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:23.600]   when we got telephones and then automated switching later on, even though we now have
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:30.040]   a system where no human is required to ever oversee that signal to make that connection
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:34.200]   happen, it's still a basic principle that if I'm calling someone,
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:44.200]   on a 4G network, that is a secured-ish signal, I have every expectation that this call is
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:49.840]   being listened into by a third party, so that's why we have to really keep a very close eye
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.720]   on every one of these actions.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:58.440]   This just in Theresa May's Brexit vote has failed for 32 to 202 in the UK parliament.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.320]   Well, that'll be interesting.
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:03.880]   Let's take a break and we're going to come back.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:11.600]   Jim Dowl-Rimple is here from the loop, loopinsight.com and Iainako, WGBH Boston and of course Renee Ritchie,
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.280]   iMore.com.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.320]   All three of you are writers.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:21.760]   I pride myself, I think, on my excellent education, my ability to write clearly.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:26.800]   However, I wouldn't write any more these days without Grammarly looking over my shoulder.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:27.800]   I'm a blogger.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.560]   You're a long time blogger.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:30.560]   I am a long time blogger.
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:35.960]   You're a thought influencer and brand leader.
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.720]   It's not a teacher going no, no, no.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:47.800]   It is a very useful writing assistant that makes you look and sound smarter and avoid.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.960]   Everybody makes mistakes.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.720]   Avoid mistakes that make you look dumber.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:55.680]   Great time to get Grammarly right now, whether you're in school, a blogger, whether you're
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:04.920]   writing essays for law, whether you're writing job resumes, Grammarly is awesome.
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:07.320]   It helps you show your best self through your writing.
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.680]   It's on every platform.
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:12.200]   They have online browser extensions.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.440]   There's desktop editors on iOS.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:19.240]   You get a mobile keyboard checker, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, iOS, Android, Windows,
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:20.240]   Mac.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:25.120]   They're free product as critical spelling and grammar, but I would recommend Grammarly Premium.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:28.760]   Really because of that great email I get every week that says, "You use more words than
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.920]   99% of other Grammarly users."
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:31.920]   I like that.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:40.760]   It looks after spelling, grammar, plus advanced punctuation, structure, style within context.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:41.760]   It understands context.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.960]   That's really important because your writing's different in a business proposal than it
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.720]   would be in a blog post, right?
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:48.840]   Consiseness, vocabulary suggestions.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.720]   They even grade your readability.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.200]   That's really important too.
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:56.440]   You got to know your audience and then make it something that your audience can understand.
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.760]   Accomplish all your goals with help from Grammarly.
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:02.160]   No more email typos on your phone.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.920]   Close more deals at work with your emails.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:07.080]   Polish your resumes and get that new job.
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.440]   There's nowhere Grammarly isn't a great help.
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.520]   It even doesn't do this to me.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.720]   It's a Lisa.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:13.720]   She wrote an email.
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:14.720]   She's in a hurry.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:17.600]   She writes sometimes her emails are very short and sweet and to the point.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.280]   And Grammarly said, "You might want us.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.280]   You might want to soften this up just a little bit."
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.120]   It's a little brask.
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.640]   And she appreciated that.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:25.640]   I think that's really great.

[00:38:54.040 --> 00:39:00.320]   Let's see.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:06.240]   Interesting note in Jean-Louis Gasez Monday note during Fireballs.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:09.640]   John Gruber pulls it up.
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:15.720]   Gasez wrote that he had a hard time believing that the $29 battery replacement plan could
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.320]   have much of an impact on Apple's numbers.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:22.920]   He obviously never went to an Apple restale store when he had those lineups for that.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:23.920]   Apparently...
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:26.120]   Those places were clogged all year.
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:32.560]   Mark Gurman at Bloomberg had private notes from an all-hands meeting on January 3rd.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.560]   Those are not public.
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:42.040]   But at that meeting, apparently, Tim Cook said Apple replaced 11 million batteries under
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.640]   the $29 replacement program, which was...
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:48.000]   I think Gurman had that they had a meeting and Gruber had the number that they discussed.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   Gruber has the number.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.040]   Oh, good on you, John.
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.040]   Oh, birdies.
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.440]   Little birdies.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.800]   Little birdies.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:03.160]   So that's about 10 million more, 9 or 10 million more than they would have normally done.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:08.400]   And so really what the question is not is just did fewer people upgrade to the newer iPhones
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.520]   because their old iPhone worked great.
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:12.240]   Purely anecdotally, I mentioned this before.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.640]   My mom, I kept saying, "Come on, mom.
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:15.640]   I'll give you a 10R.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:16.640]   I've got one here.
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.360]   I'll give you a 10S Max, whatever you want."
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.000]   And she said, "No, my beloved iPhone 6 is better than ever.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   I got the battery replacement."
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:30.840]   I mean, if you go back to the 2018 Q1 conference call, Tony Sakanagi asked Tim Cook if he was
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.920]   at all worried that the battery replacement would affect upgrades.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.080]   And Tim said, "It never entered our minds.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.480]   That's the last thing we think about.
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.640]   We want to do what's best for our customer.
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:40.640]   And I have no idea.
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:41.640]   Ask me next year."
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:42.640]   So now obviously...
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:43.640]   Well, yes it is.
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:52.160]   And Gessay points out that regardless, they should have known about this.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.440]   They must have known about this for months.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.440]   Not just the battery, but the drop of sales in China.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.760]   No, because people even have new iPhones for months.
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:40:59.760]   Very few people.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.080]   When you look at the iPhone release, it's like a blockbuster movie.
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:05.000]   It's not that the same amount of people buy it in January, who buy it in February, who
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   buy it in March.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.160]   There's a huge spike in September, whatever the release month is in October, November
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.920]   for some of the rumor-recent phones.
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.880]   But it's a giant spike.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:15.680]   And you don't see that really affecting it.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:21.000]   But if people who got those battery replacements, 11 million people, if even a portion of those,
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.640]   by the time it got to September said, "You know what?
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:24.640]   Exactly like your mom.
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.120]   This iPhone 6 is working great.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:29.280]   Maybe I'll wait until next year to get a new iPhone."
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.240]   And that spike is no longer quite so spiky.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:34.120]   But the Chinese economy has been slowing down for a while.
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:37.000]   It would have been foolish for them to assume they're going to have the same results in
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.560]   China.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:43.960]   This was, as Gisei points out, and many others have, an S generation phone.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:47.960]   That's typically slower anyway.
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.400]   Is that still a thing to think?
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:51.120]   Oh, it's a thing.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.880]   Of course it's a thing.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:53.880]   It's a little modern to think.
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:59.640]   Some people wait for the S because they think it's going to be a better version of the phone.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:06.200]   Because this year I thought was a nice deviation from that, where it didn't feel like, "Hey,
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:12.480]   we took our top of the line flagship phone and made only an incremental adjustment to
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.920]   the processor and the storage."
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:21.120]   It felt like Apple was saying, "The folks who really, really wanted an iPhone X last
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:26.200]   year but couldn't really stomach the price, we found a way to give you most of the features
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:30.040]   in slightly less build quality for a more affordable price."
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:35.120]   And to my mind, and at least to the people, what seems like the people I was talking to
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:39.920]   about this, that they almost saw it as a whole new product as opposed to an S sort of thing.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.680]   You're talking about the 10R.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:42.680]   Exactly.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:49.800]   Yeah, but I think the 10S is not significantly different than the 10.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:55.040]   But maybe we watch pretty closely to the average consumer.
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:56.040]   It's just the new phone.
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:58.080]   It looks the same to me.
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:00.840]   I don't know if there was a lot of pressure if you had a 10 to go to the 10S.
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:02.080]   I gave my son my 10.
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.560]   He was very happy to have a 10.
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:06.440]   It's hard to think that what they would, I mean the 10 was so different, like immediately
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.120]   expecting a phone as different the next year to some watermark.
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:10.120]   No, you should.
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:11.400]   I'm not saying you should expect that.
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:15.960]   I'm just saying that that's typical of an S year and that Apple should have known that
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:19.880]   the 10S wasn't going to be gangbusters compared to the 10.
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.760]   Any more than the 6S was gangbusters to the 6S.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:26.280]   It was pretty clear that they saw, like they expected this because they guided down heavily
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.280]   for this quarter.
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.760]   This quarter was already discounted more than I think a lot of people expected.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:30.920]   So what surprised them?
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:31.920]   What was the big surprise?
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:35.120]   The amount of battery replacements affecting the upgrade cycle, but that was small.
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:39.600]   I think he said over 100% which is a funny number until he actually dig into it.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:45.400]   But over 100% was a rapid downturn in the Chinese market far faster and more extreme
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.800]   than they expected.
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:57.120]   And I think if you look at the notes that Tim provided in his statement, the issue here
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.040]   is the Chinese economy.
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.840]   It's not an iPhone problem.
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:09.880]   And when Tim first released those notes, people jumped on the iPhone problem.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:16.880]   But if you look through all of the things that Apple was able to accomplish in the quarter,
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:26.520]   it becomes clear very quickly that if it wasn't for China and the economy deceleration,
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:32.960]   there would have been no need for Apple to do a guidance change.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:37.720]   Now their quarter still wouldn't have been as good as what they would have hoped, but
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:40.760]   there would be no need for this guidance change.
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:50.320]   So to say that the iPhone is failing or Apple has a huge iPhone problem, I think is a bit
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.440]   over dramatic at this stage.
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:59.080]   Yes, the upgrade cycles were affected by the battery replacements.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:05.280]   And I'm not quite sure why Apple was so surprised with that or at least as surprised as they
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:07.360]   seemed to be.
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:13.600]   But that could also be with a lot of users, it could be a comfort level.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:23.720]   I've talked to a lot of people that are very weary of Face ID and not having a home button
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:25.400]   and just different things.
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:31.680]   And if they have the chance to keep their phones by replacing a battery, then they're
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.640]   going to do that.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:42.560]   And the economy I think of a lot of countries right now are kind of up in the air, the
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:45.360]   US, Chinese battle and all that kind of stuff.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:51.520]   So it's affecting a lot of people in the economy in a lot of different ways.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:59.800]   So if somebody has a chance for $29 to keep their current phone, I think they're going
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:00.960]   to do that.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:09.760]   Now an economic problem in a country as big as China is going to take, it takes a while
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:10.760]   to go down.
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:15.320]   I mean, Apple rode that wave up and right now they're riding that wave down.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:19.760]   And they have no choice in the matter, it's an economic condition.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:22.080]   But that will change again.
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:25.760]   And the economy will start to rise and Apple will do that.
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:31.160]   And let's face it, if this economic problem came from Canada, Apple still wouldn't have
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:32.160]   had to warn.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:35.960]   You know, Chinese thing would have been good.
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:43.400]   If the economic problem was in Switzerland or they would not have to warn like they did
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:46.600]   now, this is an economic problem.
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.520]   It's not an iPhone problem.
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:51.160]   It's also interesting to see now that we've heard from Samsung and we've heard from LG
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:53.680]   and we've heard from some of the Chinese manufacturers.
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:56.280]   And their results are in some cases not going to be any better.
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.760]   And I think an LG's case way, way worse.
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:46:59.760]   Right.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:00.760]   Yeah, everything.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:01.760]   Go ahead.
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:06.200]   And I'm not sure if you're aware to the people that are saying that this is an iPhone problem.
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:12.720]   Are there things that Apple should and could do to affect upgrades in the coming quarters?
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:13.720]   Absolutely.
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:14.720]   Absolutely.
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:15.720]   I'm not saying that there isn't.
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:24.120]   I'm just saying that all the reporting saying that the iPhone is dead, I think they're wrong.
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:26.800]   Oh, yeah, that's a great headline.
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.920]   That's a great way to get people to click until they realize how many times they're
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.880]   clicking on that story today.
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:35.480]   You make an excellent point.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:38.920]   The $29 battery upgrade was a great deal.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:48.040]   But even paying full price right now, $49 is not prohibitively expensive to perform an
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:54.880]   optional upgrade, excuse me, an optional and available swap that can almost give new life
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.760]   to an old device.
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:01.400]   And maybe one of the genies out of the bottle is people being aware that, wait a minute,
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:06.080]   all this time I could have just replaced a battery and been really happy with what I
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.400]   got.
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:15.160]   And I do think there are people who are worrying that they're starting to think of phones the
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:20.320]   same way they're thinking of their cars, unless they're on a lease program.
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:26.720]   Now it's like, no, this is the thing that I will keep using until it gets really, really
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.080]   weather beaten and broken.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:32.160]   And I can't use it anymore in which case that's when I shift off to the kids.
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.000]   And that's when I finally get a new phone.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.560]   Even this idea of getting a new phone every two years because a contract expired, I think
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:40.320]   is kind of dying.
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:47.760]   I do wonder if Tim is going to try to spin this at the next keynote by saying last quarter,
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:52.480]   we sold over a third of a billion dollars in batteries.
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:55.120]   Applause, applause, applause, applause, applause, applause.
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:57.120]   Please don't pay attention to this other graph.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:00.360]   >> One of the things that's really interesting to me though is that an Apple doesn't say this,
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.960]   but this is also partly a problem of their own making.
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:05.040]   Apple really wants to create premium phones.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.160]   They don't want to operate on the low end.
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:11.080]   But in order to at least partially justify the price of those phones, they want to make
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:13.120]   sure they have an incredibly long, useful life.
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:16.080]   And they've had Lisa Jackson involved in that as well.
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:19.120]   So they have processor overhead, which is set to five years.
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:22.960]   So if you buy it now, that processor should still run five years worth of iOS.
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:26.480]   Well, the construction is built well, it should last well.
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:30.520]   They've done iOS 12 now, and they're apparently going to keep doing that so that the iOS continues
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:34.680]   to make these devices run well because they understand if people spend that much money,
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.000]   they want to keep it for five years.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.160]   And even if they don't, they want to hand it down or they want to resell it and get
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:43.160]   a really high resale value or they want to give it back to Apple where Apple can sell
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:45.120]   it in emerging markets.
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:48.480]   And they want to basically increase the overall value you get for your money.
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:52.040]   But that does mean that these phones stay on the market for far longer than phones probably
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:53.040]   did a few years ago.
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:54.520]   You have five years ago.
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:58.720]   Compare this to Google where I'm still using a first generation Pixel phone.
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:02.720]   It's still running so well, particularly with all the software upgrades that are almost
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:06.880]   like hardware upgrades that I didn't buy the Pixel 3 that I thought I was going to be buying
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.160]   this year.
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:14.160]   But Google has Google basically has that crystal in the palm of every single phone saying
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:17.040]   that after three years it goes to carousel.
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:23.800]   We will only promise OS upgrades to our own Pixel products for three years time after
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:24.800]   that.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:28.520]   You're kind of wishful thinking and being hopeful about things.
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:33.640]   Whereas with Apple, I've had phones that have run for four, as nice as four or five
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:34.640]   years.
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:40.280]   And I only voluntarily bought a new one because at this point there's so much new hardware
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:45.400]   and so much of a new evolution in the CPU and what it can do that I'm actually now attracted
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:48.800]   to buy to spend $700 or $100 for a new phone.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:52.200]   So that's Apple will almost until they take their eyes off the prize, they will always
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:55.320]   have that built in advantage as a hardware maker.
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:51:00.160]   Let's remember that there are a lot of reasons to upgrade your phone too, not only because
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:07.440]   new technology comes out, but because children get to a point where they want a phone.
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:09.920]   So it's true.
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:11.680]   I mean people do upgrade.
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:16.200]   So imagine you're instead of grabbing your phone, Jim, a new phone for the kids.
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:19.000]   You buy a new phone for yourself and hand yours down.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.640]   I mean there are all kinds of different reasons for upgrading.
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:27.920]   You know, a broken screen used to be though, Jim, that it was you upgraded because there
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:30.440]   was an amazing new feature.
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:32.360]   And that is the case.
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:37.840]   See, the problem these days is that the amazing new features and everything else is coming
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:41.640]   with amazing new prices too.
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.160]   And we haven't mentioned that, but that's a big part.
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:46.120]   Or there are software and you get them on your old phone.
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:48.960]   I mean that's the beauty of the Google Pixel approach as well.
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:53.040]   I mean, like if you have either Pixel 2 because my long story, my Pixel 3 never arrived, I'm
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:54.320]   salty about it.
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:57.960]   But it's getting so much stuff that I'm not really that complaining about it.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:00.280]   I hear a lot of people say that.
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:04.280]   And there's also the question of is there going to be a time where Apple will want to be more
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:07.360]   proactive about third party updates.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:11.960]   So some of the coolest YouTube videos I've seen that are iPhone related are people who
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:14.560]   like live in Shenzhen.
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:20.880]   And so if they want to buy, so they can really buy every tool they need to do any sort of
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:23.160]   repair or upgrade they want.
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:28.000]   And including I've got an iPhone 6, I've just added wireless charging to it.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.640]   Or I've got an iPhone, I've got an iPhone 8, I've just added a headphone jack to it.
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:35.400]   And those are kind of, those are fun and ridiculous.
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:43.240]   But we've been talking about things like I'm going to remove the memory chip, reball it,
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:48.360]   reball a higher capacity one and basically turn a 16 gigabyte phone into 128 gigabyte
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:49.560]   phone.
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:53.960]   And it's not something that requires clean room sort of stuff.
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:57.880]   Essentially this guy had to make like, make one week's worth of like occasional trips
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:00.840]   to the market on foot to buy.
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:05.560]   I can't get this board reball correctly.
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:11.960]   So I go to a stall in a shop and buy a template that has the exact right pin outs for the
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:13.360]   exact model of phone.
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:18.280]   This is something that somebody in a strip mall could easily do, particularly after they've
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:21.760]   killed their first 20 and they're on their 50th or 60th.
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:24.280]   Is there going to be a time where my screen is fine?
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:25.920]   I think the CPU performance is fine.
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.880]   It runs all the software I want.
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:32.120]   I just wish I didn't get the 32 gig model, I want 128 gigs.
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:37.680]   I think the ability to spend $100 to get my phone refreshed with a memory upgrade and
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:46.520]   a battery upgrade by a cowboy or a cowgirl who had who ordered the right stuff from Alibaba.
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:49.200]   That's interesting, isn't it?
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:53.480]   It's driven by the lack of change in the platform though.
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:57.840]   And this PC industry has kind of been through this as well where, you know, Intel's processors
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:01.520]   really weren't getting that much faster and there just wasn't that much demand for new
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:02.520]   PCs.
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:03.520]   It really, it really tumbled by the way.
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:05.520]   They want Johnny Sarucci so badly Leo.
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:10.240]   Yeah, but I mean, some of this is overcome by marketing.
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:12.440]   Some of it is I've eventually will be overcome.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:13.440]   I'm sure by innovation.
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:16.600]   And that's why Apple's looking so hard at augmented reality.
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:18.720]   It's kind of like I call it the saturation.
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:23.640]   It's like we are the part of the PC era where everybody has everybody who wants a phone
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:25.280]   has a phone that they're pretty much happy with.
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:26.280]   And it's okay.
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:31.520]   But that notion that you have to have the latest phone is I'm hoping is gone.
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:33.520]   I mean, that was a bad trend.
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:34.520]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:37.080]   It's going to be like any industry where like there are people who buy the new Canon
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:40.280]   body whenever that new Canon body is up because they love it.
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:44.520]   But yeah, but that's what it becomes like your your constant adopters become a niche
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:49.240]   and your mainstream adopters pull out the dramatically increase the adoption cycle.
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:52.720]   And you and so what you do is you sell them AirPods and you sell them Apple and Apple
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:55.320]   television subscriptions and you do all sorts of other Apple prize.
[00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:59.680]   The largest share though of those enthusiasts than any other manufacturer.
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:00.680]   I would say.
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:05.400]   And also, well, could Apple preempt this and create a new hardware channel by simply saying
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:11.880]   that after after a certain amount of years ago, after after a phone is out of Apple care
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:18.900]   by one way or another, we will allow you to buy 128 gig upgrade or 256 upgrade or a mother
[00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:20.560]   board upgrade.
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:25.160]   If at some point if they see that the writing is kind of on the wall here that we see.
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:29.320]   But we see where our profit our hardware sales are flattening out.
[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:35.160]   If we can no longer make 40% markup on an $800 phone, maybe we can make for 40% markup
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:37.440]   on a $200 board upgrade.
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:42.240]   You know, it's going to save Apple the air power to charger.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:43.920]   Don't don't don't.
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:48.200]   Finally, coming according to a Hong Kong website charger lab.
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:54.760]   Again, this is from the supply chain, a company called Luxshare Precision, which is a part
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:56:00.240]   of the wireless power consortium, assembles AirPods for Apple and lightning to USB-C cables.
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:06.800]   According to charger lab, Luxshare is now making the Apple air power wireless charging
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:07.800]   pad.
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:10.800]   So my standard is that if it was on Weibo, it's got to be true.
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.600]   Yeah, it's one of those.
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:16.440]   One of those rooms that he's that he just went out to get cigarettes and he's going to
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.040]   be back any day now.
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:20.600]   He's just really you guys don't think we're going to see it.
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:21.600]   Come on.
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:26.360]   But I mean, though, so will not believe it until I actually see it on a web on the Apple website.
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:30.480]   A couple of weeks ago, Smith, Trenton Smith said he's heard that Apple may have solved
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:32.800]   the technical challenges.
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:33.800]   That's the story.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:37.880]   But the thing is like, like Andy said, this is like a Gandalf thing for me.
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:41.600]   Expect it when you see it because we've had like the Swiss retail channel say that it
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:44.200]   was coming last December or January.
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:48.160]   And it's just until this thing is actually in store, anything could happen.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:49.760]   We could find out that the white is discoloring.
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:51.960]   We could find out that it doesn't do.
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:54.520]   I'm just this is a shut up and ship thing for me at this point.
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:55.520]   You're skeptical.
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:57.240]   And then anyway, we'd have to get in the year skeptical.
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:58.240]   It's just I'm tired.
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:02.720]   Yeah, we'd have to get new cases for our air pods with wireless charging built in.
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:05.080]   So that's going to happen first.
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:08.200]   The difference from being skeptical and simply saying at this point, I'm not even going
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:09.880]   to comment on it.
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:13.680]   My only comment is we do we do not comment on unreleased air pod.
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:15.680]   I'm really scared for it.
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:17.400]   Actually, I was surprised to see this.
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:24.440]   Tim Cook said the revenue for Apple's wearables, watches and air pods is 50% higher than the
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:27.560]   iPod at its peak.
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:30.560]   Not just the iPod, you know, when it first started out.
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:37.360]   The iPod, this is he's talking to a mad money's Jim Kramer, the iPod at its peak.
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:38.360]   That's stunning.
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:43.080]   Each the watch in the air pods have each generated between four to six times more sales than
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:47.040]   the iPod had generated in the same amount of time since its launch.
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:50.680]   Apple Watch by itself is also I don't it's not one and a half, but it's also higher than
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:54.360]   I, which is it's so funny a while ago, Neil Cybert put this thing up saying everybody
[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:57.920]   thinks the Apple watches a failure and the echo is a huge success when Apple Watch is
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:57:58.920]   selling.
[00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:03.360]   I think it was 10 or 20 X what what the because there's so much we're all dealing with imaginary
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:05.600]   numbers like Apple doesn't disclose Apple Watch numbers.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:07.520]   Amazon doesn't disclose echo numbers.
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:09.560]   So it's it's like all fantasy math.
[00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:11.800]   But when you start looking at how much of these things are going out the door and how
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:16.120]   much of the percentage of the other category or now the new wearable category, people like
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:20.080]   Neil can start to piece these numbers together and just gave them away.
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:21.640]   And it's a huge market.
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:26.360]   But when you look at how big iPod was and then you look at how big Apple like Apple Watch
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:30.840]   and I and I sorry, AirPods have become and those are all dependent on iPhone.
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:34.480]   You start to understand why all this decade of building up iPhone as a platform is kind
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:39.280]   of set the stage for using iPhone as a platform to build up the next decade of products.
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:43.360]   The way iTunes and iPod built up iPhone and that's one of my favorite aspects of Apple
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:47.320]   is that they're one of these companies that never mistakes their product for their business.
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:52.400]   Like Apple never became an iPod company the way that Microsoft for a long time was a Windows
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:53.400]   company.
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:55.160]   You know, and they'll ride this into the last dime.
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:56.640]   Apple's like, okay, this is going down.
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:57.960]   We're going to get the iPhone up.
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:58:58.960]   Okay, iPhone is going down.
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:02.280]   We got to make sure we have the AirPods, the Apple Watch, everything else prepped and
[00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:03.960]   you start to see these in the results.
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:07.440]   And when you take away the iPhone distortion from this quarter, I think Cook said they're
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:11.760]   going to be up 19% on almost everything else, which is super interesting.
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:13.560]   It's going to be the second biggest quarter in their history.
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:15.160]   I mean, it's still going to get killed for it.
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.360]   It'll be the second biggest quarter in their history.
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:24.480]   Yeah, can we can we can we also point out that that's how bad that's how badly the iPhone
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:29.560]   letter affected everything that Tim Cook is eagerly sharing numbers on the success of
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:32.680]   something that they didn't share numbers on with you and Kramer.
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:34.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:35.680]   Of all people.
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:37.400]   You know, we were talking about privacy.
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:42.080]   Duck Duck Go just announced that they're going to use Apple Maps for their maps for local
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:43.880]   searches on the web.
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:48.120]   Duck Duck Go, of course, the privacy alternative to Google search.
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:49.440]   That's absolutely consistent.
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:54.080]   They could have gone for a real open source mapping solution.
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.640]   There were a couple of out there open street maps.
[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:58.600]   It's a good one, but it's not as good, frankly.
[00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:03.920]   It's not as good, but sometimes partnerships like this are what makes what has to happen
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.440]   to make things even better.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.640]   So that's a really, really smart move.
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:11.360]   Again, that's that's kind of what I was talking about earlier that if Duck Duck Go is saying
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:14.200]   that this is what we are privacy privacy privacy oriented.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:19.360]   Well, if that's the product you're selling, you really can't send people to a service
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:22.400]   like Google Maps that has an incredible amount of advantages.
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:26.160]   But one of the disadvantages is that Google is going to be collecting information to both
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.880]   enhance the map and also to enhance their advertising product.
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:31.320]   I guess stuck to go was using open street map.
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.880]   But if you asked for directions, you got Bing.
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:40.280]   It's just like open source is great, but you've got to spend so much money to go out.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:43.520]   You literally have to have the trucks on every street the way Google did and the way Apple
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:44.520]   does now.
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.000]   And that's non-trivial for any company.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   So if we're going to--
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.840]   Yeah, open street map relies on users to modify and update their maps.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:54.520]   You have to find-- finding entrances is an amazing amount of technology for places.
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:58.720]   You can't-- and the amount of work that Google does just to figure out that, yes, here is
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:03.360]   a street address, but we are-- you're going to have to walk a half a mile if a car drops
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:07.480]   you off on this side of the block as opposed to this other side of the block.
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:12.760]   And I still remember riding around with a member of the wear map team for Nokia saying
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:14.200]   that we have to send someone out.
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:17.400]   We have to physically send somebody out, not an automated car.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:21.800]   We have to send somebody out to everything that we think is a hospital to make sure that
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.320]   A, it is actually a hospital and also to--
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.320]   That's pretty important.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.320]   Yeah.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:29.720]   And also to locate where the emergency remandrence is specifically.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:34.160]   So that is another underscoring how difficult maps is.
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:37.920]   And that's what Apple's spending billions on for the new version of Apple Maps and driving
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.600]   all those streets and doing all that mapping.
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:44.280]   And that's just hard to get any-- you can crowdsource that, but you won't get the consistent
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:48.160]   pull through of data that you get when you actually drive it.
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:52.160]   Let's take a little time out and then we're going to talk about Apple's next thing, which
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:56.160]   Tim Cook says might be health.
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:01.800]   The episode you're watching a Mac break weekly is brought to you by LastPass.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:04.440]   We need LastPass here at work.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.920]   We use it at LastPass Enterprise at home.
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:07.920]   I use it.
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.360]   Steve Gibson uses it.
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.680]   That's a pretty strong recommendation from my point of view.
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:16.560]   It is a password manager with trust no one encryption.
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:19.440]   Your data is encrypted and decrypted only at the device level.
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:23.880]   Not even LastPass can access anything in your vault, zero knowledge.
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:26.520]   It's also the most convenient, the easiest to use.
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:29.240]   It's just a great password fault.
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:35.120]   And in your business, you know that your employees are not using the best practices when it comes
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.440]   to passwords.
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:40.200]   Just go down into the business office, see how many Post-It notes are on the monitor
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:44.440]   with the password to your checking account on it.
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:49.080]   Or in the engineering office, there's probably a notebook somewhere with all the passwords
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:53.600]   to your website and all your databases and so forth.
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.720]   You need strong passwords.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:57.280]   You need passwords that aren't reused.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:01.680]   You need passwords that are stored securely and shared securely.
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:03.040]   You need LastPass Enterprise.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:05.440]   It makes password sharing convenient for employees.
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:10.360]   It's got to be or they won't use it, but it keeps access to your corporate data secure.
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.840]   And you have complete admin oversight.
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:17.640]   You can set master password requirements, enable password resets, restrict access of
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.640]   an employee leaves.
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:24.120]   You can configure over 100 policies, access actionable security reports, create shared
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.120]   folders.
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.120]   We do that.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:28.240]   The ops team has their folder, the business team has their folder.
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:32.400]   That makes it very easy to get the password you need without actually seeing the password.
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.200]   That's another nice feature.
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:37.320]   It turns out employees share passwords, not just with other employees, but with their
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:38.880]   friends and family.
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.480]   Keep those passwords secured.
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:41.480]   They don't need to know them.
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.720]   They just need to log in.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.520]   I trust LastPass so much.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:51.520]   You keep everything in there.
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:04:17.040]   Passport, my drivers license, even my social security numbers are in LastPass.
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:21.960]   And the password auto fill functionality now in iOS 12.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:27.240]   It's available on Android as well in Oreo and later makes it so easy for employees to
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:30.520]   seamlessly use LastPass across their mobile devices.
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:31.920]   In fact, it's so easy.
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:35.520]   It's the first app I install when I get a new phone because it's going to let me log
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.520]   into all the other apps faster and easier.
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:38.920]   I don't have to copy and paste.
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.080]   It just fills them in.
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:41.520]   I just love it.
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:46.640]   If you want to turn on multi-factor authentication, and we do require that, by the way, at Twit,
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:52.400]   you have a variety of multi-factor tools, Duo, Yuba Key, and of course, LastPass's own
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:56.200]   authenticator app, which will send a push notification, not a text message, but a push
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:57.200]   notification.
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:02.200]   That's more secure to your phone saying approve, deny that login.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:06.520]   The second factor is so important because, of course, even if your passwords are breached,
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.600]   second factor keeps bad guys from getting in.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:12.640]   You don't want to be the next company on the big breach list.
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:15.000]   You need LastPass.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   Here's another nice benefit.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.560]   If you're an active directory user, your company, they can use their Microsoft AD credentials
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:24.920]   for a true single sign-on experience.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:25.920]   LastPass.
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:26.920]   LastPass teams.
[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:31.400]   For teams of 50 or fewer, LastPass Premium, for personal use, LastPass Families, for your
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:32.400]   family.
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.400]   That's what we use at home.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:36.600]   Of course, LastPass Enterprise, that's what we use here at work.
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:43.120]   Join the 43,000 businesses and the millions of users who trust LastPass, the number one
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:46.000]   most preferred password manager.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.400]   I wouldn't leave home without it.
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:55.360]   Find the best password solution for your team at LastPass.com/twit.
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:57.600]   It is on everything you see here.
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:01.200]   My phones, my laptops, my desktops everywhere.
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:03.800]   Love the LastPass.
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:15.240]   So Tim Cook says, "Apple's greatest contribution to mankind will be coming in 2019 and it will
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:17.480]   be health related."
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:20.000]   This is part of the Jim Kramer interview.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.440]   I think those are two separate things.
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.280]   Oh, they're separate.
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:30.800]   I think he said that in number one, we've got new services coming up in 2019 and then
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:33.800]   our greatest thing for mankind is going to be health.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:36.840]   I believe both things.
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:40.920]   I shouldn't say there will be new health services in 2019.
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:45.800]   In fact, it's probably a new video service, maybe a new service, new publishing stuff
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:49.880]   for the magazine company they bought and new video service.
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:52.800]   You think next year we'll be seeing health care run out?
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:53.800]   Texture.
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:54.800]   It'll be constant.
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:58.080]   They are really all in on health.
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.800]   It was sort of serendipitous for them.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:02.680]   They'll tell you the story that they only wanted an accurate calorie count for Apple
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:03.680]   Watch.
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:06.360]   Because of that, they made a heart rate monitor and they saw all the data they were getting
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.000]   off the heart rate monitor.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.080]   And then Jeff Williams, who was running Watch the Time, got very interested in health and
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:14.480]   they started doing research kit and care kit.
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:17.840]   I think that's the sort of thing that they're going to incrementally grow as they see new
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:18.840]   opportunities.
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.760]   They've done health care records now.
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:24.520]   They also have the Apple technology where you can use your watch as a badge.
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:26.520]   It starts to get really interesting.
[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:29.160]   It's easy to imagine one day you'll walk into a clinic.
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:32.440]   It'll tap your Apple Watch and that will grant permission for that clinic to access your
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:33.440]   health care records.
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:38.000]   And it'll be a private transaction that you have complete authority over and they'll know
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000]   your entire history, what medication you're on with.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   That's privacy.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   She's a happy previous thing.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   Really becomes a big deal.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.920]   And that's one of the things I think Apple really believes that they can leverage is
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:50.720]   that they originally they were absolutists about trust, about privacy.
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:54.840]   But then they saw that with the health care industry, they had people who for example,
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:58.120]   because of their conditions, couldn't keep track of their medication or couldn't actually
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.840]   report back what they were doing with the research studies.
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:05.200]   So if they created the ability for them to grant explicit permission for some of that
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.920]   information to be shared and they found out that when it was done, like that old Steve
[01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:12.000]   Jobs things, ask them, ask them again, then ask them again.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   Tell them in simple language, in plain language, and do it until they'd ask you to stop asking
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   them.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.880]   But once they implemented that, you're getting all these amazing studies onto things like
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:25.200]   multiple sclerosis, which we previously had multiple medications and they would have
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:30.280]   to guess which one to give you and postpartum depression and all these other studies.
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:35.080]   And it's proving that Apple, if you are in a trusted position like Apple, you can start
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:37.840]   to do some pretty amazing things in the health care industry.
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:38.840]   Yeah.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:44.680]   And these people, these studies that Apple is doing, those people have said that they've
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:51.640]   never had so many people sign up for the studies and want to be part of the studies, which
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:54.640]   helps the medical community.
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:58.080]   They get more information than what they've ever had before.
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:02.000]   They get a wider variety of people signing up for these.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.080]   So I agree.
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:08.160]   I think that health care is going to be one of the biggest things that Apple ever does.
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:13.040]   Tim Cook said, in this interview, on health care in particular and your well-being, this
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:16.840]   is an area that I believe if you zoom into the future and you look back and you ask the
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:22.920]   question, what was Apple's greatest contribution to mankind, it will be about health?
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:23.920]   Yeah.
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:24.920]   Yeah.
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:27.480]   That's absolutely true.
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:32.040]   I think that's the closest thing to Apple's historical mission to try to improve people's
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.280]   lives through technology.
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:38.960]   And you can't do a better improvement on someone's lives than preventing them from having an
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:44.520]   injury that changes the entire direction of their remaining days or reducing it to zero.
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:50.640]   I mean, even the basis, the number of stories that we're getting back of people being able
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:55.880]   to point to data on their Apple watch as a way of describing, "Hey, I was climbing
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:00.660]   stairs and I suddenly just absolutely felt exhausted and that was not normal for me.
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:01.920]   That was three days ago.
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:07.320]   And here's my heart rate and here's a strip that I took when I was feeling that way.
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:12.320]   And everything else, if you do all the tests today, you're perfectly normal, but you can
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:17.080]   actually show here's the data that was collected, the time where I was feeling incredibly not
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:18.080]   right.
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:22.720]   Now, you've suddenly been, you might not necessarily have had your life saved by that piece of
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:27.200]   data, but now you have more information on trying to figure out exactly why did you have
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:31.120]   to sit down after climbing a flat of stairs for the first time in two or three or four
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:32.800]   years.
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:39.600]   I have to say that I'm wondering why Apple has not made the Apple watch into a broader
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:45.480]   sort of product like they did with the iPhone, like they did with the iPod and make it multi-platform
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:50.480]   because not only is it a huge amount of money that they can make off of all these things,
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:54.280]   but also the more data that comes in, the bigger benefit and the more people who have
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:58.800]   access to buying these things, the more improvements of life they can do.
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:04.760]   And finally, wearables on almost every other platform is either non-ambitious, meaning
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:08.240]   it's just sort of a fitness tracker that works well, but it's just a fitness tracker, or
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:13.360]   it's a total mess like Android where it could be the Apple watch, but they don't have the
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:14.360]   hardware.
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:18.000]   They don't have the engineering, they don't have the unified sort of idea of here's what
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.400]   we're going to be doing with the data that we're going to be tracking.
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:25.480]   I still often wear my Series Zero watch even though I'm an Android user because it's just
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:28.680]   like my favorite fitness watch ever.
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:31.400]   I'm considering buying new one.
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.880]   I think they're just waiting.
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:37.680]   Sort of like it took until iOS 5 before iPhone was independent from iTunes and went to the
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:38.680]   iCloud.
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:40.680]   I think they're just waiting for the device to have the capabilities where it doesn't matter
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:44.160]   what platform you have instead of logging with an Apple ID, you log in with the Google
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:47.960]   ID and you're fine regardless of what phone you have is just all your stuff.
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:54.240]   They could still do an Apple ID on other platforms, but I'd be surprised if they don't have
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:55.720]   a target for it.
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:12:01.520]   I will also say I'm surprised that you have to have an iPhone, you can't set it up using
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:07.200]   an iPad or a Mac because if that were the case, I would have upgraded my Series Zero
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.000]   like two or three years ago.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.160]   But why wouldn't you just want to get an iPhone and he come on?
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:13.160]   Get with a program.
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.680]   Yes, it's not enough.
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:19.840]   I have to have like a card in the mail saying here's how many years of your life you will
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:20.840]   get back.
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:25.280]   If you switch from the phone you like to a phone that is fine, but it's not for you.
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:26.280]   It's not just running.
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:27.280]   It's not just running.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:28.280]   You can send you one of those cards.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.280]   You can make one.
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:34.240]   Okay, but are there going to be good years or there going to be like the crap years from
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:40.680]   like 87 to 90 or living relatives left, I'm in a nursing home and there's my sugar coke.
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.120]   We're fine sugar coke.
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:47.040]   We're focused on the watch, but AirPods could also end up being a big thing.
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:57.160]   In August of next year, the FDA's funding bill in 2017 included an interesting statement
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:03.800]   that there the FDA would have to investigate by August 2020 would have to introduce rules
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:06.000]   on over the counter hearing aids.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   Yeah.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:14.780]   And already we saw a year ago at CES with a in-ear much less expensive hearing aid that
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:20.160]   also did some, you know, health tracking.
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:21.160]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:23.000]   Starkey, which makes the hearing aids I used to use.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:28.640]   I'm now a resound user, but the now has a Livio platform that does that as well.
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:34.720]   And Apple's perfectly situated to jump on that the over the counter hearing aid market
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:39.000]   and the wearables or hearables, I guess you should call them.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.080]   They'll be the new I-Pods, Leo.
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:43.760]   I mean, they'll have health functionality akin to an Apple watch and also be able to stream
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.520]   Apple music.
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:47.720]   That's not a long term goal, I don't think.
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:48.720]   Yeah.
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.720]   I think that's a very big opportunity.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:52.880]   So the watch is just the entry.
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:58.240]   The other question I have is, can you describe this really to Tim Cook?
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:01.320]   Yeah, I think Steve became very interested in health as he was dying.
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:07.040]   And I think Tim, as he's sitting there watching him pass away also, and I think that he's
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:12.080]   even said this became very aware of this, but this is really give Tim Cook credit, I think,
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:17.560]   for that one, for saying maybe for privacy, Steve was big on that, but absolutely for
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:18.760]   health.
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:23.920]   And Jeff Williams too, I mean, the heels just sit there and they deeply believe in privacy
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:25.720]   and health and all of these things.
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:29.240]   It's not trendy for them, it's just part of the expression of what they believe their
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:30.720]   company should be used for.
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:31.720]   Yeah.
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:38.280]   Well, and you can tell that Jeff has really taken up the baton here for health.
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:45.440]   And when you hear him speak, this is something that he really believes in.
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:47.880]   So let's talk about Qualcomm.
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:51.960]   The gift that just keeps on giving.
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:56.880]   The last time we talked, Apple had to stop selling its iPhone 7 and 8 in Germany.
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:59.960]   Well, a German court is now thrown out.
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:03.400]   Qualcomm's patent case against Apple.
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:09.440]   Just earlier today, this is a big reversal for Qualcomm, the regional court in the city
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.480]   of Monheim.
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:14.160]   That's the big town where they make steam rollers, right?
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:16.680]   Dismiss the Qualcomm suit is groundless.
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:17.680]   Dad, Dad.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:22.760]   That's make those jokes again.
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:27.040]   The patent in question was not violated by the installation of its chips and Apple's
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:29.000]   smartphones.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.360]   Apple said, we're happy with the decision.
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.840]   Qualcomm, well, you know, Qualcomm's not happy.
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:38.440]   Apple has history of infringing our patents while we disagree.
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:42.880]   The conversation between licensing and chipsets within Qualcomm is kind of weird.
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:48.880]   I didn't know this, but maybe I learned this here, but Qualcomm refused to sell Apple
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:51.400]   its chips for the latest generations of phones.
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:55.320]   I thought Apple was trying to get over, you know, move to Intel to get out of this.
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:58.040]   But in fact, it was they wanted to buy the Qualcomm chips and they couldn't.
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:15:59.640]   Well, that's part of the problem here.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:03.720]   It's sort of like with the old Intel, the Intel lawsuits where, or the old Microsoft
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:07.120]   laws were, in order to have one, you have to have the other and then they will penalize
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.120]   you if you don't go all in with them.
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:11.320]   And that's all of the information is coming out.
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:15.320]   And I think that's why so many independent jurisdictions are also going after Qualcomm.
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:18.120]   Never mind the Apple lawsuit, like Federal Trade Commission and other commissions and
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:21.120]   other countries is because they were doing that sort of bun.
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:27.360]   They were doing the things you do when you abuse a position like bundling and like they
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:28.360]   could choose.
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:29.880]   They could choose not to be part of standards.
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:32.080]   They could say we're doing our own proprietary thing.
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:33.080]   We think it's amazing.
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.400]   If you want to use it, we'll make sure that it works where it works.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.440]   But they're like, no, we want everybody to use it.
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:40.320]   But now we want to charge you exorbitantly for it.
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:44.240]   And especially in the EU and maybe in the US now, I don't think that's going to be
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:45.240]   tangible.
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:46.240]   It's hard.
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:53.000]   I've been trying to understand everything about this lawsuit and it's a result of like,
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.720]   this used to be a little bit browner here in my sideburns and that's this little patch
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:57.800]   of gray.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:00.640]   And I really don't know how I feel about it.
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:05.120]   The Qualcomm for their part, they make a pretty good argument, at least for the FTC case,
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:08.840]   which is saying, so what have we done to abuse consumers?
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:11.640]   No, it's never been cheaper.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:16.280]   The consumers are not paying a price for whatever you think is going on.
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:18.480]   There is an alternative to Qualcomm.
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:25.560]   We are and as a counter to the, so I'm wondering how, at least in the United States, the FTC
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:30.760]   action is going to play out because there are great cases to be made on both sides of
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:36.120]   Qualcomm simply trying to make money off of something that they've been doing extremely
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:41.400]   well and navigating a business also extremely well versus the other stuff that they've been
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:46.640]   doing, which is like it doesn't seem as though they're doing the right thing by double dipping
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:48.040]   as Renee says.
[01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:53.720]   So I'm, this is, I'm almost at the state where I'm just going to wait to see who's
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:54.720]   still alive in two years.
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:58.720]   That's what makes it so interesting is that like absolutely like Qualcomm is you get every
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:03.520]   dollar you can, but there is a point where your short term gain comes at the expense
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:05.120]   of your long term viability.
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:09.280]   And again, I use a Microsoft example where they rode Windows so hard that it caused them
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:12.640]   to ignore other potentials that could have, you know, like lots of stuff I wanted to see
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:16.640]   on the market and Qualcomm, first they have that licensing, that patent arm, which is
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:21.280]   so important to them, but that comes a little bit at the expense of their chipset business
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:25.840]   and they, they want people to pay based on the price of the device because they believe
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:30.600]   their component is so important that it's worth more than just a component itself, but
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:31.800]   you can't scale that.
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:36.880]   Like if suddenly the phones are cameras now, the people buy phones because of the cameras,
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:39.760]   we make the sensor, we deserve part of the entire phone price.
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:43.920]   Oh, but you know, the chipset, you know, we're making these, we're fapping these processors
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:44.920]   for you.
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:45.920]   People buy because of the chipset.
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:50.040]   So now we want a part of the, there's only so many parts of that phone that you can divvy
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:51.040]   up.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:54.240]   And I think Qualcomm would have an amazingly robust business and would have an amazing growth
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:58.520]   curve if they're like, okay, he pays for the chip and license these products and,
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:01.240]   you know, everyone shakes hands and goes home afterwards.
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:03.400]   Well, yeah, it's hard to say.
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:07.240]   You could also, to play, and I'm explicitly playing devil's advocate here as opposed to
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:10.600]   asserting a point of view that I hold dear to myself.
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:17.040]   There is, you could make a devil's advocate could make a comparison to Apple's defense
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:19.880]   of their iPhone business that yes, they have so many other businesses.
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:24.840]   But really, if the iPhone were to go away magically tomorrow, they would be screwed with
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:28.400]   a double K in the word screwed.
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:30.760]   And the Qualcomm is in a lot of other businesses.
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:35.800]   They make CPUs, they make Wi-Fi chips, make Bluetooth chips, mobile processors, game
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:40.440]   processors, but the line share, their money comes from cellular modems because again,
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:43.240]   this is what they built their business around.
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:45.440]   So it's, it's hard.
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:51.520]   I don't understand the business enough to have a really good opinion on who's absolutely
[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:53.880]   right and who's absolutely wrong here.
[01:19:53.880 --> 01:20:00.000]   I hope it doesn't come to a point where users experience will suffer because the thing
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.280]   is we really like Qualcomm chips in our modems.
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:08.840]   They really work extremely well, especially if you travel, especially if you're in parts
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:14.760]   of the world where there isn't, there aren't really, really great unified cellular networks
[01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:17.480]   and you have to keep buying coverage as you go.
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:22.120]   So again, I'm continuing to read about this.
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:25.160]   It just feels like the one company you don't want to encourage to make their own chips
[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:27.920]   as Apple just given their history of making their own chips.
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:29.640]   Yeah, you're exactly right.
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:31.640]   That's something you don't want to do.
[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:36.440]   And to Andy's point, who's expressly right and who's expressly wrong?
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:42.080]   I think in situations like this, there isn't one company that's completely right and one
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:43.880]   that's completely wrong.
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:50.960]   But I know that Renee said jokingly and not jokingly, you don't want to encourage Apple
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:52.960]   to start making its own chips.
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:53.960]   Good news.
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:58.320]   We've created a whole new network that's so better than any standard we could have
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:20:59.320]   bothered.
[01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:01.040]   But I mean, just to make it personal.
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.200]   I've lost.
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:08.360]   So to make it personal for a minute, I had to pay the call contacts on my iPhone, even
[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:13.280]   though there hasn't been CDMA anywhere in Canada for I think a decade now, just because
[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:15.320]   they demand that regardless of where you are.
[01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:18.760]   And I could have paid, I don't know, 20, 30 bucks, it's conceivably less for my phone because
[01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:24.120]   I would have just had a regular GSM modem, like a small, small country off on the top
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:26.280]   of your hat.
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:32.040]   According to Jeff Williams, it's $7.50 per phone.
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:34.040]   That's a lot.
[01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:39.280]   I think some of the companies that are suing, organizations that are suing Qualcomm have
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:43.360]   said it's as high as 20, but that's another area that I can't really find out where the
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.360]   actual number is.
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:48.240]   The chips and the license, I think you have to add them both together to get the...
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:49.240]   So you have to buy the chips.
[01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:50.240]   The Qualcomm dollar.
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:53.600]   And the license that goes with them because you don't get the license with the chips as
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:54.600]   far as I remember.
[01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:57.960]   It would be nice if the license came with the chips.
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:02.960]   And you're saying that in order to make an iPhone, even if you don't need the CDMA architecture,
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:03.960]   you need to license that.
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:07.680]   Well, because Qualcomm, they were doing these world phones for a while that you could use
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:10.200]   on Verizon plus all the way around the world.
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:13.320]   Because Qualcomm modems are so good people want them, but they're Qualcomm won't make
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:16.240]   one that doesn't include CDMA because that's their bread and butter.
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:19.840]   I mean, it's licensing all the way around.
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:23.440]   But the Qualcomm does have 5G patents as well.
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:24.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:25.440]   And Rinson Rapitlio.
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:29.520]   So they're not just outdated stuff.
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:31.960]   It's the E patents.
[01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:34.040]   They have 5G patents.
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:42.320]   The other aspect that confuses me is that in some regions, in some regions, they're required
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:47.480]   to cover a minimum number of bands that might include CDMA but might not.
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:51.880]   And Qualcomm's position might be that we really don't want to create a whole other
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:55.800]   chipset just to take care of this one part of the world in which CDMA doesn't exist
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:57.480]   and we don't have to pay for it.
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:02.560]   We feel as though the amount of sales we're going to lose by charging extra for a licensed
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:07.120]   people, a manufacturer is going to lose is less than the amount of money we'd have to
[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:10.760]   spend to have a new fab or to have an alternative flavor of this chip.
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:16.880]   So again, I have to get very zen and say, I do not even know what I do not know.
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:21.400]   I'm just so happy that AT&T's 5G is not affected by Qualcomm 5G.
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:23.840]   Because it's not 5G.
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:24.840]   That sticker works.
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:26.400]   That's just you just put it on.
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:27.400]   You stick her off.
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:28.400]   You put it on the end.
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:32.640]   Did you see the T-Mobile response where T-Mobile said BRB and they put a post it note with 9G
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:34.240]   on top of it?
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:38.120]   I think they're hiring Nigel Tuffler, who's just spokesperson.
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:42.120]   Well, when you've got 4G, that's not not fast enough, not fast enough.
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:43.320]   Where'd you go from there?
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:44.320]   We've got 5G.
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:49.440]   Why don't you just have 4G and just make that a little bit faster and make that the highest
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:50.640]   speed?
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:58.600]   So the iPhone, 10S, 10S Max and 10R only have Intel 4G chips in it.
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:05.040]   What Williams said in his testimony on Monday is we were going to, because we wanted 5G,
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:09.080]   you know, every major Android vendor in the US has a 5G phone.
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:14.120]   Intel's 5G modem isn't expected to hit phones until 2020.
[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:17.480]   Williams said the strategy was to dual source in 2018 as well.
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:21.080]   We were working toward doing that with Qualcomm, but in the end, they would not support us
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:22.240]   or sell us chips.
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:24.240]   He said it last year.
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:27.240]   So if you were on Verizon, you got the Qualcomm.
[01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:28.600]   If you're on everywhere else, you got the Intel.
[01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:29.600]   Yeah.
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:32.520]   And of course, Apple famously slowed down the Qualcomm.
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:35.600]   So it would be as dumb as the Intel.
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:40.920]   He said he contacted Qualcomm CEO to get him to sell chips to Apple when Qualcomm refused.
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:45.880]   Apple had to call Intel CEO, ask him to supply all the modems new for the iPhone instead
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.520]   of only half the volume.
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:48.680]   He had to scramble.
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:53.760]   Williams said, we would have loved to have continued access to Qualcomm tech.
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:56.320]   So it's not that Apple doesn't want Qualcomm.
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:57.320]   They do.
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:58.320]   Yeah.
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:24:59.320]   They just don't want to pay them.
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:00.320]   Again, it's the goal spandered.
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:02.280]   They don't want to pay them as much as they're being asked.
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:03.280]   Yeah.
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:06.600]   All your prop, if you have a Qualcomm modem, all your problems resolved, you do not have
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:10.840]   to worry about anything in terms of compatibility and connectivity and speed.
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:13.920]   Well, I don't want to pay Apple a thousand dollars for an iPhone.
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:18.200]   So there, sell it to me for less.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:19.600]   You know, that's what it costs.
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:23.720]   So this is, yeah, I mean, I'm buying a different phone.
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:24.720]   Yeah.
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:32.200]   And also the from two apples, apples defense is sort of like that would be like if they
[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:37.800]   were saying, yes, you can buy an iPhone, but you were marking up $120 because we're also
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:41.960]   selling you a pair of AirPods and you can't buy it without AirPods, but I don't want AirPods.
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:44.560]   Well, it's too bad you're getting it anyway.
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:49.200]   That's the argument about how Qualcomm is abusing the markets, but that's that's absolutely
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:50.200]   it to you.
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:52.120]   Like, imagine this, Leo, it's like, not that you don't want to buy an iPhone.
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:54.360]   It's that you don't want to pay a percentage of your gross revenue.
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:55.360]   The price of that iPhone.
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:56.360]   Okay.
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:57.360]   That's fair.
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:58.920]   The same base price that everybody else pays for it.
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:25:59.920]   Right.
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:01.400]   It's maybe maybe the better analogy is Ticketmaster.
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:06.840]   It's like, why am I, why am I being charged an extra $30 for this $80 ticket?
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:09.360]   Because usually you say because why well.
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:13.800]   It's because because actually service fee.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:16.600]   Apple's going to start selling the home pot in China soon.
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:19.120]   That'll be an interesting just agenda.
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:20.120]   Yeah.
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:21.120]   It's wonderful.
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:23.560]   January will start disappointing users in a whole other language.
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:28.840]   Oh, they've been doing that on iPhone for years.
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:34.760]   Is it so every time I say, hey, you know who in my kitchen, I mean, I'm 15 feet away
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:35.760]   from my home pot.
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:38.120]   I'm sitting, you know, distantly.
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:41.400]   I'm right next to my phone, but the home pot takes over every single time.
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:43.600]   Is that, is that supposed to happen?
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:45.600]   Well, it's, it's a bit, it's, yeah.
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:46.680]   Sorry to go ahead.
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:52.480]   The way that it works is if your device, whatever device you want, your phone or your
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:59.600]   watch is active, then that will answer.
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:01.760]   But the home pot's always active.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:02.840]   That hey thing.
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:04.200]   It's not playing anything.
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:07.760]   It's just, but it's always active compared to when I was listening to you, Leo.
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:14.320]   But all of those judges communicate among themselves and say, okay, who's going to take
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:15.320]   this?
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:16.320]   Right.
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:20.960]   And if nothing is being used, like you don't lift your, your watch to, to your mouth or
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:27.080]   you don't lift your iPhone and make it active, then the home pod will be the one to answer
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:28.280]   the call.
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:32.320]   So what I should do is I should shake my phone before I say a slow mo.
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:35.480]   Hey, or hit it, hit it with a hammer.
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:36.480]   That always works.
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:39.280]   You blow into it like a Nintendo cartridge that works for me.
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.440]   It's to be crazy.
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:45.240]   I do have to thank the NFL because whatever that, you know, that during all the NFL games,
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:47.920]   they say, hey, slow mo, give me the scores or something.
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:53.040]   It drives me nuts because my home pod always hears it and always launches into a 15 minute
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:55.520]   tie raid.
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:56.520]   They've changed.
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:57.680]   Is this your experience to Jim?
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:59.280]   They changed something this weekend.
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:01.200]   It stopped activating it.
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:07.920]   I, the, during the college football games and everything that was going on.
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:09.680]   It was driving me crazy.
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:10.680]   Oh, it was.
[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:11.680]   Yeah.
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:12.920]   I do know with other systems.
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:14.760]   They've Amazon does that.
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:15.760]   They fuzzled.
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:19.240]   Well, what they, well, what they actually do is they have, their servers have a way of
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:24.600]   telling that all of a sudden everybody is active as asking for Ali ocean to do something
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:26.000]   at the same time.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.480]   We're going to guess that this is a commercial or this is a radio thing that's happened.
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:31.240]   So we're going to basically ignore that.
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:36.400]   And if it was a legitimate request, the person's just going to ask it again and no harm, no
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:37.400]   foul.
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:38.400]   Okay.
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:40.200]   But yeah, I, but, but, but they're doing something.
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:46.160]   I had a, my Google home max is right above like my bedroom TV.
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:52.840]   And so I was, as part of research, I was in bed until 11 AM watching, watching some, watching
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:57.720]   some like Google corporate videos in which the, the latest ad, which is just, Hey, hey,
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:28:59.160]   Guillermo, Hey Guillermo, do this.
[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:00.600]   Hey Guillermo, do this.
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:03.240]   And it was, it was lighting up, but not responding.
[01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:07.280]   So it's not just that because not everyone was watching that ad at the same time.
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:11.880]   So okay, now wait a minute, you got Guillermo, you got slo-mo and you got Ali ocean.
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:12.880]   Yes.
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:15.240]   What do you call Cortana?
[01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:16.240]   I don't call it.
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:22.120]   No, because we could, we could say, it's the one name that's not, we could say Cortana,
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:23.120]   Cortana, Cortana.
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:26.280]   It won't be here because nothing happens.
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:31.240]   Oh, Leo, the iPhone, the new iPhone battery cases just went live.
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:35.440]   Oh, is that, I didn't even know there were going to be new.
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:38.960]   10s, 10s Max and 10s are the hump cases.
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:39.960]   Yep.
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:42.560]   The hump cases, huh?
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:44.120]   Should we talk amongst ourselves?
[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:45.120]   I don't know.
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:46.120]   I don't know.
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:47.800]   I don't like them.
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:49.800]   I think they look funky.
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:52.760]   So they have good, they have good characteristics.
[01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:55.640]   So be under iPhone accessories.
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.760]   What are the good characteristics?
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:02.000]   They, instead of, so what a lot of battery cases do is they get in the way of the signal
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.560]   so the radio has to ramp up and it's got more power while you're trying to charge it.
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:08.080]   These get out of the way and they have antenna amplifiers.
[01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:11.640]   They also a lot of battery cases put the iPhone in plugged in mode, which spirals up
[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:13.880]   all the networking and all the updating.
[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:15.160]   These keep iPhone in mobile mode.
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:16.720]   So it's not expanding all the extra energy.
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:20.200]   So again, you're not, you're not expanding energy as fast as you're charging it.
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:26.440]   Well, there must be a Canadian thing because I don't see it on my, if you, for the first
[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:28.400]   time ever, Canada gets it first.
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:31.960]   Well, just, just, well, they're up on the link.
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:34.040]   I'll throw the link in the show notes.
[01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:35.040]   Okay.
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:37.240]   Yeah, that saves you money.
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:41.040]   The number of times I've had like an iPhone in a battery sled and it's thought, oh, I'm
[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:42.040]   connected to power.
[01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:46.960]   Now I can do all the photo and video uploads that I'm not supposed to do until I'm connected
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:47.960]   to actual wall power.
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:52.080]   It's like, no, I'm still on cellular.
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:31:00.440]   I just bought four, not one, not two, but four, Aussie type C power banks.
[01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:05.200]   They're very thin and they don't affect anything because you just plug the phone into them.
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:11.360]   And I have four of them because, well, Pokemon go.
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:14.760]   I know that they're nice because they're power delivery.
[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:15.920]   So it's over type C.
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:17.680]   So they're very, they charge very quickly.
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:18.680]   They're nice.
[01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:22.840]   We definitely, we've definitely crossed over a certain mountain recently because this was
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:28.360]   the year that I started replacing all of like the old power bricks and old power chart
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:33.000]   battery chargers that I keep in one and every single computer bag of mine with USB-C ones.
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:37.880]   Because now I've got enough USB-C stuff that makes sense for me to plug directly into a
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:44.120]   USB-C type charger or a USB-C charger that can charge an entire laptop rest before.
[01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:47.920]   It's like, as long as I can charge a phone when I'm good.
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:48.920]   Yeah.
[01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:54.120]   I think we can take a little tiny time out and come back.
[01:31:54.120 --> 01:32:00.440]   If you will prepare your picks, we will be doing that next.
[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:03.240]   First a word from Atlassian.
[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:04.240]   We love Atlassian here.
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:05.960]   We're in Atlassian shop.
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:11.640]   And I think if you talk to developers, IT professionals, and you say, are you in Atlassian
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:14.480]   shop, they'll certainly know what you're talking about.
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:17.240]   And most of them will say, oh, we wouldn't be anything else.
[01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:23.040]   Atlassian creates collaboration software that empowers teams around the world.
[01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:30.200]   It is a high stakes business keeping track of your ops and having the right tools can
[01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:33.400]   make your job a lot easier and make you a lot more effective.
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:39.600]   Of course, everybody knows Atlassian's JIRA, which is a great way to plan, track, and support
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:40.600]   software.
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:42.200]   It's Agile.
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:46.680]   Bitbucket is a great one for keeping track of your code base.
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:51.040]   If you've got a code base, we use Confluence for documentation all the time.
[01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:54.280]   In fact, last time I didn't add something to the chatroom said, I'm in Confluence right
[01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:55.280]   now writing docs.
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:57.480]   Nobody wants to write docs, right?
[01:32:57.480 --> 01:33:02.120]   But you need to have documentation for your setup for how things work.
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:06.600]   At least if you're going to do it, do it in a way that makes people want to do it.
[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:07.600]   Confluence.
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:08.600]   Not just for developers.
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:13.320]   Atlassian offers an affordable, reliable suite of tools for teams.
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:20.200]   A wall size is in all areas from DevOps to Agile, from IT apps to ops to ITSM and whatever is
[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:21.400]   next.
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:24.600]   You can see there's a whole lot more going on in there.
[01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:29.680]   Atlassian provides a technology backbone to help modern IT organizations plan, service,
[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:30.680]   and support.
[01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:33.600]   The kind of change that propels the business.
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:38.240]   JIRA Confluence Bitbucket, that's the backbone of an effective cross-team project planning
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:40.760]   organization and communication.
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:44.760]   Then you've got JIRA Ops and Ops Genie and Status Page.
[01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:49.080]   That really helps teams better detect incidents, alert response teams, coordinate response
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:50.360]   efforts.
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:53.880]   Your teams can choose the tools that are right for your current framework, but trusting that
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:57.120]   as you grow, they will grow with you.
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:00.360]   It all integrates seamlessly with JIRA and Confluence.
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:02.920]   Your team can get the job done.
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:06.560]   Look at all the big companies that rely on Atlassian.
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:08.720]   125,000 companies worldwide.

[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:36.840]   AT, L-A-S-S-I-A-N Atlassian.com.
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:41.000]   Because the week time I like it, Jim Dowerable usually has a great rock and roll pick for
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.000]   us.
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.040]   What do you have today, Jim?
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:51.000]   I have a band and I believe I mentioned them very early on when I started doing this show
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.280]   with you, but I'm going to mention them again.
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:59.400]   It's called, they are called a pale horse named Death.
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:04.560]   This is a metal band, but they're a rock band too.
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:06.600]   They're coming out with a new album.
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:12.280]   There are three songs out right now on Apple Music and the album is coming out on the 18th
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:13.280]   of January.
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:18.960]   I thought it was good timing since you invited me back that I would bring a brand new album
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:22.120]   to the listeners.
[01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:31.120]   This band is founded by the drummer of Type O Negative and a very, very good band.
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:35.840]   If you just like, good rock, but some of it is slowed down a little more, so it's not
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:39.680]   really, it is metal and it's not.
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:46.000]   I think a lot of it is just good rock music.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:52.080]   There you go.
[01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:56.680]   It makes me so sad that none of the current pop charts are rock.
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:36:05.920]   Rock is really disappearing from the American music scene and it is the American music scene.
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:09.880]   So I'm glad to see rock is not dead and that people are...
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:14.840]   They are really, really good band.
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:20.880]   Some of their songs tell about the journey of being a rock star and things like that.
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:29.800]   Some of them are funny and some of them are very truthful about drug addiction and things
[01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:32.400]   like that.
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:36.400]   It's not just thrashing around on instruments.
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:39.360]   There's some sad stories in there too.
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:41.240]   In the great tradition of rock and roll.
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:42.240]   Yes sir.
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:43.880]   All right, good pick.
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:48.160]   A pale horse named Death.
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:49.160]   Rock out.
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:53.400]   Danny and I go, you're big of the week.
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:57.920]   If you're into Sean and Freud, this is a great week to be subscribers to Netflix and Hulu
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:02.440]   because two competing documentaries about the fire festival and the debacle that ensue...
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:04.600]   F-Y-R-E, oh boy.
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:06.600]   F-I-F-I-F-I-F-Y-R-E.
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:13.600]   Hulu's documentary surprise dropped like four days, last night, four days before Netflix's
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:16.600]   documentary is dropping on Friday.
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:21.840]   I only found out about it like midnight and of course I was up another two hours watching
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:25.840]   it and it was a terrific documentary.
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:29.920]   Your lowest hopes would have been that it's just, "Hey look, here's some stuff we got
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:33.640]   off of Instagram with people having a bad time and, "Hey look, here's another Psharla
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:36.600]   cheese sandwich that you saw on Instagram a while ago."
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:40.800]   It's a very, very thoughtful documentary about the process of social media influencers and
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:47.400]   how a crap storm like this can happen not only because of how easy it is to promise
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:52.080]   a group of people something that can't possibly be delivered by hooking into their dreams and
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:59.240]   aspirations but also how there is this still this tech bro sort of culture that says that
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:04.360]   so long as I'm wearing my sunglasses and a backwards baseball cap, I can raise millions
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:09.200]   and millions of dollars for an event that everybody is telling me can't possibly work.
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:12.920]   No matter how many lies that I tell, it's more of a business documentary.
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:17.560]   I don't want to downplay it that way but you will learn a lot more than not just the
[01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:18.560]   fire festival.
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:23.520]   You'll kind of learn about how the next fire festival is definitely going to happen.
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:30.960]   I haven't seen the Netflix one but this one is done but was produced by a couple of the
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:37.320]   social media promotional team members that actually promoted the festival which means
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:41.360]   that A, they have access to a whole bunch of video and information that maybe the other
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:47.040]   producers didn't have and also it's being told by producers who have some skin in the
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:49.360]   game of trying not to look like idiots.
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:53.720]   Part of what I really enjoyed about the Hulu documentary is that you really do have different
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:54.720]   levels.
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:59.320]   They were talking to social media influencers who I'm still absolutely puzzled by but you're
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:03.200]   also talking to reporters who are covering this event and covering the broader stories
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:10.800]   around it and also people who are in mainstream advertising who rely on this sort of an outlet
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:17.720]   who are giving a very sober sort of discussion even as they are in business interview mode,
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:23.160]   they're a nice little professional suits on a neutral backdrop being shot in high definition
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:31.320]   and being forced to talk soberly and seriously about a media organization called F. Jerry.
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:36.760]   Like they're talking about Raytheon or Halliburton which is also the biggest laugh that I think
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:40.840]   I'll get all week long but I really enjoyed the Hulu documentary I think it was called
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:46.840]   Firefraud and I really hardly recommend it and I'm definitely going to be tuning in for
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:48.800]   the Netflix one.
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:49.800]   Nice.
[01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:52.480]   Reminds me of the world record egg.
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:54.880]   Did you see this on Instagram?
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:55.880]   Oh God.
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:58.880]   I saw people making videos about it trying to get in on it.
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:02.600]   This is the most liked image in history on Instagram.
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:03.960]   The world record egg.
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:05.920]   It's just a picture of an egg.
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:14.520]   42,792,968 likes and the reason it's doing so well is because they're trying to beat the
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:18.320]   current world record held by Kylie Jenner.
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:20.160]   Boy, did they beat it.
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:22.560]   That's a very 2019 thing.
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:26.960]   We're liking this thing not because we like the egg but to show our dislike for actual
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:27.960]   human being.
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:32.320]   That's really what it's all about is how much we hate the Kardashians right there.
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:34.320]   That's so empty.
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:38.080]   That's not my pick.
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:40.440]   By the way, Richie, you're picking the week.
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:42.600]   I just couldn't help picking the fire festival.
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:46.320]   I was just engaged in a hot Twitter debate, Leo, about how I'm going to be using this
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:51.400]   new iPhone XR smart battery case for Pokemon Go Fest because an iPhone XR plus this battery
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:54.440]   case might just give me actually hours of your money.
[01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:55.440]   Your fun fest.
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:56.440]   Your living room.
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:58.000]   You're literally juicing.
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.240]   I don't know because they I think they did Chicago last time because they wanted to prove
[01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:03.400]   they could do it after the dismal failure the year before.
[01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:05.120]   So maybe your own fire festival.
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:07.480]   They should do it Montreal, I think.
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:08.480]   Oh, that would be.
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:10.480]   They're doing the first one in Brazil this month.
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:12.160]   So we'll see how that goes.
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:16.760]   So my pick of the week is this is one of the devices that Apple worked on for the HomeKit
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:17.960]   launch at CES.
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:20.040]   It's not out yet, but I really like it.
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:22.840]   I'm going to mess up the name is Natatmo.
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:23.840]   Natatmo.
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:24.840]   Yeah.
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:25.840]   Yeah.
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:26.840]   Thank goodness.
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:27.840]   Felio.
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:31.760]   So what's so interesting about this is that it really is a privacy first doorbells.
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:33.560]   I'm going to call it a solution.
[01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:36.560]   It doesn't have any online component.
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:40.280]   You can put an SD card in it and record I think two days of video and it'll keep recording
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:43.960]   over it if you don't pull it out and download it or something or you can choose to hook
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:46.440]   it up to your personal Dropbox account if you want to.
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:47.920]   Oh, I have an online.
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:48.920]   That's a good thing.
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:53.360]   But there's nothing that goes up to any cloud that is not yours.
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:58.280]   So it's designed to be quote unquote offline by design, but they also have a bunch of clever
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:00.760]   features in it like it's got an accelerometer.
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:05.280]   So if someone tries to do something to like pull it off the wall, it starts just taking
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:09.320]   flash photos of the person so that you have some record if you did it.
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:14.840]   It does all these really cool sort of anti tampering things.
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:20.280]   And it just I got a chance to talk to them and it's just so considerate, not just smart
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:24.360]   but considerate the way they put it together because they didn't realize that people wanted
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:29.080]   cameras, but they didn't necessarily want those cameras plugged into another company.
[01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:32.680]   So this is just you buy this and that's the end of your relationship with Natatmo.
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:34.360]   It doesn't go any further than that.
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:37.800]   And if you want to buy another product, that's as far as that goes to.
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:39.280]   And I love like you might love Nest.
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:40.280]   You might love Ring.
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:41.280]   You might love all those companies.
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:44.280]   But I always think it's important to have these kinds of options on the market as well.
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:47.040]   Well, you know, we like those wise cams for the same reason.
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:51.680]   And they don't you don't pay a subscription fee, which is everybody get by.
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:57.920]   But also the idea that you know, your your videos aren't stored somewhere that you don't
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:42:58.920]   control.
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:01.720]   I think that's kind of this after the ring debacle.
[01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:04.200]   And I think this is I might replace my ring with this.
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:05.560]   This looks really good.
[01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:07.560]   Yeah.
[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:11.880]   Next the next level is not having to know one level is trusting a company like Apple.
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:14.400]   The other level is I don't have to trust another company.
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:17.520]   I know that this has been does not connect with anything else.
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:18.520]   That's better.
[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:19.520]   Yep.
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:23.040]   I'm on the site right now and trying to figure out where to give them my money because that's
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:24.040]   a great day.
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:25.040]   Yeah.
[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:26.040]   It does look like you can.
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:28.440]   It's like because people will often say, how do you trust?
[01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:29.440]   How do you trust?
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:30.960]   I do not trust any single company.
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:33.200]   I trust the technology behind a yes encryption.
[01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:34.360]   Yeah, trust trust.
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:35.360]   That's right.
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:36.360]   Yeah.
[01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:37.360]   That's fair.
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:42.640]   Well, I want to counter Jim's recommendation of rock and roll with a recommendation Andy.
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:43.640]   Andy will like.
[01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:48.560]   I found the new streaming music service that focuses on classical music.
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:50.520]   This has always been for me an issue.
[01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:55.800]   I love all kinds of music, but classical music while it is on Apple music and the in-spot
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:58.640]   of find everywhere else often gets short shrift.
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:03.520]   If you search for something you're just as much going to find a pop song as a classical
[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:04.520]   song.
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:09.480]   The other thing I like about this is they're different subscription levels depending on
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:11.280]   your bit rate.
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:17.280]   The base bit rate is 320 kilobits MP3, which is fine.
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:18.520]   That's fairly affordable.
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:20.720]   Eight dollars a month or $80 a year.
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:23.680]   It's a little bit less than Apple music.
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:30.160]   If you want lossless 24-bit flax streaming and you've got the right devices for it, $15
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:31.960]   a month, $150 a year.
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:36.560]   If you really care about audio quality and classical music, I think this is really interesting.
[01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:38.400]   I've enjoyed it quite a bit.
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:40.280]   They have a two-week free trial.
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:44.440]   People deciding whether I'm going to end up ponying up the money or not.
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:48.760]   I love the ability to just stream quality classical music.
[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:51.080]   I listen to it all the time.
[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:52.880]   I think this is an interesting play.
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:54.880]   Prime from the...
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:45:00.000]   The problem of classical cataloging is so bad that that's one of the main reasons why
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.240]   I switched from iTunes to Plex.
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:10.240]   The ability to simply say that, yes, the ability to say that I'm interested in this
[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:14.280]   recording of this opera because these two singers are singing on it.
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:19.360]   Please don't make me sort it by the orchestra and the conductor because I will never remember
[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:21.720]   either of those things.
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:28.120]   Please, when it comes up on my phone, I want to know that this is the second act area from
[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:30.040]   the title of the second act area.
[01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:36.200]   I don't want to have to see Mozart, Colin, the adduction from the Saraglio, Colin,
[01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:40.120]   the conductor, Colin, orchestra, and I have to wait 12 seconds to find out what track
[01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:41.360]   I'm listening to.
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:43.480]   So yeah, that sounds like a really great idea.
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:45.800]   That's a problem that needs to be solved.
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:46.800]   This...
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:50.280]   It does support airplay if you're on an Apple device.
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:51.280]   They have a...
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:52.280]   I...
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:54.040]   I'm sorry, Android version.
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:58.040]   I haven't checked to see if it supports Chromecast now that the Chromecast audio is dead.
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:45:59.200]   Well, who cares?
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:00.200]   But...
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:01.200]   No, I'm kidding.
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:05.240]   But it doesn't yet have a Sonos connection.
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:09.040]   It's brand new and the software is fairly new.
[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:10.040]   And so I think...
[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:11.040]   But so far so good.
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:12.560]   I'm really enjoying it.
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:15.480]   And I just often will have this on in the background.
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:19.920]   And one of the things I like is some of the playlists are really interesting.
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:22.960]   So it's called PrimeFonic.
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:26.920]   It's at primefonic.com and you can try it for you for two weeks.
[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:32.760]   And I just thought I'd mention that because you've got your rock and roll well represented.
[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:35.160]   Now you've got your classical music.
[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:38.160]   And now you've got MacBreak Weekly.
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:39.160]   Thank you everybody.
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:40.280]   Jim, it's always great to see you.
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:41.280]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:42.280]   Yeah.
[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:43.280]   Thank you.
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:44.280]   I appreciate it.
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:45.280]   Love you, Jim.
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:46.280]   Always good to be here.
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:47.280]   LoopInsight.com @dowalrimple.
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:49.360]   Anything you want to plug any podcasts or anything?
[01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:50.360]   No.
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:51.960]   I'm good.
[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:52.960]   I just want to plug you.
[01:46:52.960 --> 01:46:54.760]   No, not like that.
[01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:55.760]   Show title.
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:57.560]   He's going to plug me.
[01:46:57.560 --> 01:46:58.560]   Oh no!
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:00.040]   Thanks, Jim.
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:04.360]   Always great to see you.
[01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:10.160]   Mr. Andy Enoco, we know we catch you every week at WGBH Boston, Boston Public Radio, and
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:14.240]   the material podcast all about Android on Relay.fm with us.
[01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:15.920]   I mean, I'm Florence Ion.
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:17.760]   She's lovely Florence Ion.
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:21.480]   She has so much wisdom and knowledge about Android and Google that she can actually do
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:22.640]   two shows a week about it.
[01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:24.760]   And I'm so glad to be doing that show with her.
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:25.760]   Fantastic.
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:26.760]   Anything else you want to plug?
[01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:30.760]   Also, I've fixed the database problems on my blog.
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:32.600]   And so I'm now blogging again.
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:37.840]   So if you go to not go.com, you will see it updated more than once every four months,
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:40.560]   which was when I was able to do it when I was having database problems.
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:44.480]   You can move you to WordPress.com or you can have these.
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:49.120]   I actually have established an account in a new URL on WordPress.com that is waiting
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:50.680]   for something.
[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:53.760]   And I'm looking forward to not having to make sure.
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:55.760]   You're doing WordPress, but it's self-hosted.
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:57.320]   I have a self-hosted one.
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:01.600]   I also have a WordPress account on WordPress.com that is not active.
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:04.000]   It's not public yet.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:08.960]   And so I've been using it long enough to know that, yes, it is much nicer than doing self-hosting.
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:10.920]   Oh, I mean, because I self-hosted for a long time.
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:12.920]   And I remember those database problems.
[01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:16.400]   I don't want to ever look at them again.
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:21.520]   It's like that vacation to that place where you get some beautiful pictures, but you have
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:27.120]   to really abuse yourself to get that place where you say that I'm glad that I've done
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:28.600]   self-hosting.
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:30.320]   I learned a lot of valuable thing.
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:32.000]   I learned a lot of valuable experiences.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:35.720]   I feel as though I'm a more experienced and wise person.
[01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:38.280]   Now I'm ready to never do that, I guess.
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:41.440]   I can put that on the bus at.
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:43.560]   I will with me like impossible.
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:46.280]   Andy 2.0 is my guess on the record.
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:50.280]   I H N A T K O Docs.
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:51.280]   Common.
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:52.280]   I like the new look.
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:53.280]   It's very pretty.
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:54.280]   I'm working on it.
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:56.480]   I love the new.
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:57.680]   I love the nice template.
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:48:58.680]   Yeah.
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:48:59.680]   Yeah.
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:01.800]   Are you using Gutenberg yet to post?
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:02.800]   Yes.
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:05.360]   You like it, which is a hoot and a half.
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:08.720]   I'm still getting used to it, but I'm kind of liking it.
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:13.120]   I'm kind of liking how easy it is to make more structured and more interesting looking
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:14.560]   posts than the old one.
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:15.560]   A lot of power.
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:21.640]   I kind of miss the ability to sort of push the easy, to me, push the easy button saying,
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:24.520]   "Yeah, can you just give me the HTML code right now?"
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:27.800]   Because I know exactly how to do the thing I want to do in HTML.
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:29.960]   And I don't know how Gutenberg wants me.
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:33.120]   What kind of a block I need to insert in this thing to make it happen.
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:34.120]   And so.
[01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:35.120]   Yeah.
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:38.760]   I mean, I'm for, you know, Mars edit still works and Mars edit is always a good way to
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:39.760]   post with that.
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:40.760]   That's much worse.
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:42.760]   WordPress is a hell of a system.
[01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:47.080]   There's a new initiative, by the way, that's being backed by a whole bunch of people.
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:52.880]   To create a new WordPress platform, it's based on WordPress, but also includes monetization
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:57.320]   that is designed for small newsrooms, not necessarily for one person, modern.
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:50:02.560]   But I'm talking about local newspapers who have as few as one and as many as a dozen
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:08.320]   people where it's not just the CMS, it's also the optimization, it's also monetization,
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:12.000]   it's also getting memberships in, it's also getting subscriptions in so that you can just
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:15.440]   hire to write the stuff and the business.
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:19.840]   And we'll sort of like a quick book for running a commercial web operation.
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:20.840]   What's the name of that?
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:21.840]   Who's that?
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:23.760]   Oh, I just read about it this morning.
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:26.120]   It was on the Neiman blog.
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:27.120]   Okay.
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:28.120]   I'm from Harvard.
[01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:30.560]   I should probably make it a pick of the week next week.
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:35.080]   My first thing is, can I do it just as a one person person who's not like a real newspaper?
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:36.080]   No?
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:37.080]   Okay.
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:43.720]   But yeah, it's just another testimony to how versatile and how solid WordPress is a platform.
[01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:48.760]   If you're one person who just wants to post recipes, it's got you covered.
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:54.360]   If you are a newspaper supporting a community of 100,000 people, it's also got you covered.
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:59.040]   And if you're even scale up 10 times or 20 times that, it's also got you covered and
[01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:03.720]   it's not terribly so long as you don't host it yourself, it's not hard to use.
[01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:06.320]   News revenue hub and it's Newspack.
[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:07.320]   Yeah.
[01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:09.160]   New feature on WordPress.com.
[01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:12.760]   I will very definitely check that out.
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:17.760]   Also anything that empowers journalism is good money.
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:22.280]   I really think we're starting to turn the corner now that we've got people who started
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:28.000]   off as careers as journalists started off in the internet age.
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:34.280]   So they can start a new business that's not based on classified ad revenue and on tire
[01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:38.160]   ads and on grocery ads that they're sure they're going to be getting every single day.
[01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:40.760]   We're starting to turn a corner where you've got that sort of awareness of here's how we
[01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:41.760]   can build this business.
[01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:46.160]   Here's how we can deliver news to the community, but also be able to pay people to do that
[01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:51.040]   because the quality of the journalism goes up when you can actually make people work
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:54.480]   full time on it instead of having to sort of squeeze it in.
[01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:58.760]   That's why on Instagram, that's why people are sort of fishing for, "Hey, give us a free
[01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:01.440]   hotel room and we'll blog about your thing."
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:04.760]   If they're making enough money that they can pay for their own damn hotel rooms and buy
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:09.080]   their own tech products, you've got a certain level of insulation.
[01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:14.360]   Now we're seeing more sophisticated tools like this that say that we can not only, it's
[01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:18.400]   not just about publishing, it's also about the business ends of things and we can integrate
[01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:23.920]   that into WordPress in a way that will essentially make the thing run with less supervision than
[01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:24.920]   you acquired before.
[01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:28.960]   I really think this is another indication that's turning the corner, that maybe you'll
[01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:33.840]   never be able to start a brand new newspaper print publication again, but the people who
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:38.880]   really want to continue to deliver news to Worcester, Massachusetts, Lowell, Massachusetts,
[01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:44.120]   and even be an alternative to the Boston Globe, you can absolutely totally do that without
[01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:46.480]   having to mortgage three houses.
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:49.200]   Well, I credit to WordPress.com for doing this.
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:50.200]   That's great.
[01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:51.760]   One of the reasons we love having them as a sponsor.
[01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:53.520]   No, no paper motion for me.
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:53:00.200]   Renee Ritchie is, of course, at iMore.com and his vector podcast is a much listened to,
[01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:03.600]   in fact, you already got the DuckDuckGo story I see.
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:04.600]   Sir.
[01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:05.600]   Very good.
[01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:06.600]   Very good.
[01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:07.600]   We had three ads.
[01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:08.600]   We had three ads.
[01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:11.520]   He had time to write 1200 words in shoot of me.
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:13.520]   Anything else you want to give a plug to Renee?
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:17.080]   No, I really like that video, the one that you see, Georgia, and the thumbnail, though,
[01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:22.120]   because I laid out some of the issues pertaining to government regulation, but also the fundamental
[01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:25.840]   right to remain private that I think we're all going to have to start discussing and grappling
[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:26.840]   with.
[01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:27.840]   That was the answer.
[01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:28.840]   Yeah.
[01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:29.840]   Check it out.
[01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:30.840]   Please let me know.
[01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:31.840]   We talked about today, of course.
[01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:32.840]   Yeah.
[01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:33.840]   I don't have an answer, but I'd love to be part of the discussion.
[01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:34.840]   Yeah.
[01:53:34.840 --> 01:53:35.840]   I think that's all anybody can say.
[01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:38.520]   You've got to, we've got to be talking about this.
[01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:41.080]   And I do recommend that book, Surveillance Capitalism.
[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:42.600]   It's on Awful if you want.
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:47.880]   It's really, it's long, but it's very profound, I think.
[01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:49.320]   And she's a deep thinker.
[01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:53.600]   I don't know yet whether I agree or disagree, but I think it's a really important part of
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:55.520]   the conversation she's talking about.
[01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:56.520]   Yeah.
[01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:57.520]   All right.
[01:53:57.520 --> 01:53:58.520]   Thank you everybody.
[01:53:58.520 --> 01:53:59.520]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:02.280]   We do this show every Tuesday right after iOS today.
[01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:07.200]   So you can make it a double Apple day if you want, starting at 9 AM with iOS today and
[01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:09.200]   then at 11 AM with Mac break weekly.
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:12.560]   That's Pacific time, 11 AM Pacific 2 PM Eastern, 1800.
[01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:16.240]   You can watch it live at Twit.tv/live.
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:21.680]   If you do that, join the other folks watching live in our chatroom, irc.twit.tv and go right
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:24.640]   there from your browser.
[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:27.720]   And it's always fun in the chatroom 24/7 really.
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:31.800]   They're constantly, I don't know what they do for a living, but they're always in the
[01:54:31.800 --> 01:54:33.800]   same people always in there.
[01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:35.000]   Do you ever sleep?
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:36.000]   Do you ever sleep?
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:41.040]   You can also watch on demand shows for everything we do.
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:45.360]   In this case, twit.tv/mbw or subscribe.
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:48.040]   That'd be my preference in your favorite podcast application.
[01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:50.200]   Just open it up and look for Mac break weekly.
[01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:51.200]   We've been around a while.
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:54.200]   I think you'll probably be able to find us pretty quickly.
[01:54:54.200 --> 01:55:00.360]   And don't forget your voice assistants Guillermo, Shlomo and Aliyosha.
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:06.040]   In every case, you can just say, hey, Aliyosha or whatever, listen to Twit Live to listen
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:10.280]   to the live stream or play Mac break weekly podcast.
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:12.360]   And you'll get the most recent episode.
[01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:13.880]   That's an easy way to listen.
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:15.800]   There's got to be a way we can monetize those three names.
[01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:19.120]   There's got to be a t-shirt design that will take advantage of this wonderful intellectual
[01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:20.800]   property that we've created here on Twit.
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:22.280]   Well, if you don't mind, I'm going to make the show.
[01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:23.280]   That'd be the show name.
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:24.280]   So we'll start.
[01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:26.960]   Hey, thanks everybody.
[01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:31.360]   We'll be back to work now because break time as the man's head is over.
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:31.720]   See you next time.
[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:41.720]   [MUSIC]
