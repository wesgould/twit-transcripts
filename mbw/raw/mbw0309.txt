[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.720]   Apple news. In this case, the latest Apple rumors. That's pretty much all we've got. And we have a
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.280]   great panel. I don't know where I'll tell you what, I'll begin to my left and we'll work our way around.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.640]   Starting with Andy Inaco of the Chicago Sun Times, a regular here, thank goodness,
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.600]   his hat has fallen off. No, see, the reason why I almost always wear a hat is because
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.640]   Tuesday mornings are incredibly busy. So it's rare that I've had a chance to like fully like
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.120]   shampoo and wash my hair in the morning. I just fortunately today, a free electrical thunderstorm
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:12.400]   woke me up at 5.30. Oh, God. And so I've been so tired all day today that the only way to keep
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.160]   awake and to keep cool in this 92 degree weather is to shower roughly every two hours. So I have,
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.760]   I, this hair has been prelled and conditioned twice already today.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.000]   Well, you look great. In fact, I think a lot of people think you wear the hat because you have
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.800]   no hair, but no, you have a nice bouffant going there. No, although although I, a side effect of the
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.120]   hat when I was 18 or 19 realizing that chief, I like this set. I like bringing this set. But if I
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.600]   keep wearing this set, no one will ever do. Andy has hair and we have a show title. Great to have
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.440]   you once again. And he also here and this shocks me because we did not expect this. We actually
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.560]   thought we were going to Skype Mr. Alex Lindsey back from Australia. It was good to be back. How was
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.480]   it down under? It was, it was great. It was good. This is my first time in Australia. And so I was
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.280]   in Sydney and Melbourne. The nicest people in the world. It was, it was just great. They're friendly,
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.640]   they're warm. They love to party. I didn't party too much, but we did have a lot of beer.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.640]   There was a lot of, there was a lot of beer drink. A lot of beer.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.600]   Mixed drinks are not as popular, but the beer was very popular. It was very good.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.760]   You had a little mini meetup. What's this? What are all these?
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.960]   I wasn't sure. This is my name. You need all of these. This is my life. This is what I care
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.440]   around. Someone was asking about this. So I thought I'd bring and show it, show it to you.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.960]   So this is, I could tell you this is England. Okay, that's the UK. That's the UK.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:29.520]   This one is Korea. That's Australia. Australia has the tilted
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.520]   dual bronque. We're looking at plug adapters. That one is either France or Korea. It depends.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.200]   There's a slight width difference between France and Korea. That one's France. Okay.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.880]   And then this is, these are the plugs you need in the good old US of A. These are all just adapters
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.720]   for your Mac. Just a little note that you can use these with it. You don't have to go out and buy
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.280]   like a transformer. You know what? I love it. Apple sells his travel kit with all of these.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.600]   And you slot it into the big, the big thing in the middle of your power court. And now,
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.640]   and look, he's got Australia on there. And it's great. You just plug it into the wall. And
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.160]   it does the voltage handles voltage in a problem. All of these adapters use
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.680]   volt. 110 to 240. No problem. Yeah. Anyway, but Australia was great. 50 and 60.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.560]   It's funny. The people in Melbourne were telling, of course, the people in Sydney said that
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.080]   people in Sydney were the nicest and the people in Melbourne said that they were the nicest.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.560]   They're all pretty. They're all pretty darn nice. It's really, it's fantastic.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.640]   They're all equally drunk. And that's all it's important. It was just, I mean,
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.240]   in both, both cities are just stunning. I mean, I just, in space, we were,
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.200]   had a good chance to hang out with Mike Seymour, who's, who has FX PhD and just had a great time
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.080]   on the bay. How long are you back for now? A couple days. And then you take your fine,
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.960]   you finally got your MacBook right now. We'll talk about that in a second. But first,
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:54.320]   I got to introduce our far-flung correspondent from the Peloponnesus in Greece, Mike Elgin.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:01.120]   It's the, it's the parapetetic Mike Elgin. It's the sun is going down. Are you outside at a cafe?
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.200]   I am indeed. I'm in the town of Sparty, which is a tiny little town in the center of
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:14.160]   La Coney and the Peloponnese in Greece. I'm at an outdoor cafe with about 3000 Greeks.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:21.120]   And yeah, it's about, it's about 9 20 p.m. tomorrow. No, today, still today.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.320]   We've been watching the sunset when we first started and we had to do some Skype, but
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.680]   finagling. It was, the sun was still up and now it's getting darker. It's beautiful. This is,
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.040]   and this is, this is not vacation for you. This is your life.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.040]   Until the sun comes up again. This is not a vacation.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.000]   That's right. I went full time until the night. That's right. Do you have kids?
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.320]   It's like, uh, grown. We have, I have grown kids and so they're on their own. So, you know,
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.600]   hopefully they'll survive. But, uh, no, it's great. My wife and I have been wanting to do this for
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:59.680]   three, four years and then catastrophically, she went and got a big job. So that kind of sucked
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.320]   and, and, and now she's left the job and we're, you know, pursuing our dream of living wherever.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:14.160]   That is so great. And, and because you, you know, you're a writer, uh, uh, you, you can file from
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:20.720]   anywhere and I presume nowadays because of the internet, you can follow stories anywhere.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.240]   You could be absolutely. And in fact, yeah, I have, and I have more time to do it because, uh,
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.800]   they don't have a house to deal with. I don't have a commute, uh, taken up an hour or two of my
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.600]   day every day. So it's actually there, there are huge advantages, uh, to doing this from a
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.920]   career point of view. The other thing I'm really looking forward to is I normally don't attend
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.200]   the European conferences like, uh, the wireless, uh, wireless conference in Barcelona and, uh,
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.960]   see bit and so on. I've been to see bit a couple of times, but normally I don't go.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.560]   And now I'm, I'm just going to go to all the European conferences and, you know, I'll be back
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:58.400]   in the U S for the major U S conferences as well. But, um, yeah, so far it's, it's just been fantastic.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.960]   Oh, we're just, it's just great. So from now on, I guess Michael be joining us from
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.600]   somewhere new and different from somewhere. Yeah. Well, it won't always be Greece.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.720]   No, no, no, we're after, uh, we'll be here for about three months probably. And then we're
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:19.360]   probably going to go. We may go to, um, to, uh, Nairobi Kenya next, um, but we don't know yet.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.760]   We haven't decided. I'm so jealous. Yeah, we have, we have a house in Rwanda. If you want to visit.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.160]   Same. You want to go to Rwanda? Alex is inviting you.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.960]   Have a school. I, I've heard a lot of things about it. Yeah, absolutely.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.040]   It's the, it's become very global. Alex offered Andy your apartment, the pixel
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.960]   core apartment in London. Now you're offering him your house in Rwanda.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.680]   We do. We do a place in London as well. So, and I was researching, I was researching places in,
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.520]   in Sydney when I was there. No, when I was in Sydney, I was like, yeah, no, I didn't have any
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.920]   department. Well, you know, Trey or Eclif move to, for believe it or not, Quainstown, which is,
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.360]   I know I was really tempted to tell him I was in town. Like I was going to try to go. Yeah.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.480]   I was like, Oh, you just, you look very close now that I'm here. It was just so, it was just too busy.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.120]   I wanted to go. I wanted to go visit, but I think I'm going to go back to Australia soon. So,
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:11.040]   all right, let's get to the Mac news because there's some, uh, I, you know, I guess we're waiting.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:16.160]   We had thought that tomorrow would be the day Mountain Lion would come out today. After the show,
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.080]   of course, Apple will have its quarter. I find it very interesting that Apple Apple is releasing it
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.840]   like right after the show. They do that every year. They haven't,
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.400]   when the stock market closes right after the show, you know, it's Microsoft at the same thing to
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.640]   Windows weekly last week. We just kept, we kept the show going until we got the quarterly results.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.440]   I don't think there's any reason to, I think we know what Apple's going to say. We made a bucket load
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:43.040]   of money. We sold a crap ton of devices. Turns out that the iPhone is a success.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:49.040]   And now I guess sales are slowing a little bit from some reports from analysts. The sales are
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.000]   slowing as people wait for the iPhone five, but that's always what happens.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.040]   And they're saying, isn't the analyst, but the analysts are also saying that
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.000]   iPhone five, they think is going to sell, was it 40 million? Is that right?
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.160]   That's, it's really interesting that the analysts seem to be converging on this idea that the
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.240]   iPhone five is going to be the most successful iPhone ever. I'm not sure why. I guess pent up
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.800]   demand people who had iPhone fours, skip the iPhone four s because it was a two year,
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:17.200]   or is it isn't this, this is the first, you know, full jump up where all the carriers are involved.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.400]   So I think that, you know, I think that that's the other thing is that they were all coming out.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.880]   TV rise and Anne Sprint are all going to have new ones. And global, yeah, and cricket. And
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.160]   there's, you know, so the thing is, is it's the first time they're able to launch worldwide,
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:34.320]   all at one time, with a big up a date, you know, the four s was, you know, the half update.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.360]   So Mike Elgin, your prediction, how big will the crap ton be?
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.200]   And I think there's a lot of, yeah.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:44.480]   Well, I, well, first of all, I think that the other thing is a lot of people are ready to
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.280]   upgrade their phones. You know, they've been, they've done their time, you know, they've done
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:53.440]   two years. A lot of people have had an iPhone for quite a while. And I think the iPad and the iPhone
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:59.200]   and, and, and the, I hate to say it, but the death of Steve Jobs and so on has sort of focused a lot
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:05.200]   of attention, attention on Apple these days. And I just think it's going to be the most
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.160]   massive. I mean, you remember all the disappointment with the iPhone four s that it wasn't the five.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.880]   Everybody wants the next big jump. And when they provide it, it's going to be, it's going to be
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.520]   ridiculous. The other thing I think they're going to surprise us with is information about China.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:26.400]   I think there, there's quiet, so-called quiet release of the iPad in China is going to be,
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.800]   turned out to be a lot bigger than anybody thinks.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.760]   How about you, Andy, you agree?
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:37.600]   Yeah, it really is the, the, the Apple's really put all the pieces into place that they need for
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.800]   the, for the operating systems and the hardware. So now it really is about making sure that if
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.200]   there is anybody on this planet with money or round stone coins in their hands to exchange for
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.840]   an Apple product, that Apple can get an Apple product in that person's hands, their aggressive
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.480]   move into China, it's just not even, it's not even a matter of debate. I mean, they really,
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.320]   really want that market and they've, they're really all set to do a really good launch there.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.640]   So I think we're going to see some good numbers from there, in regards, I think I should do a
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.280]   preemptive strike every time that we mentioned either a seven inch iPad or an iPhone five,
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:11.920]   we get lots of tweets and emails from people saying, it's not the iPhone five, stop cutting
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:18.800]   it the iPhone five. It's a, I do, I do believe that maybe this is the iPhone for us is the last
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.960]   time that Apple actually puts a number next to a phone, but realize people that we, these are
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.600]   pretend products, these are imaginary products. They're, they're, they fly and they're made of
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.440]   a graham cracker crust at this point in our minds. So we can call it whatever we want.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:39.120]   But yeah, yeah, the reason, I do think that the next iPhone for lack of better word is going to
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:44.240]   be a lot bigger because if rumors are true to form that this is finally the iPhone with the
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:50.160]   larger screen, people don't like to have to sit in for a technical description of why this phone
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:55.040]   that looks just like last year's phone is actually much better on the inside than the model that
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.120]   preceded it. When you can show them this has a bigger screen sold, like, but I didn't tell you
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.560]   about the new CPO. It's all shut up and take my money.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:12.320]   By the way, the full name is the putative iPhone five, but we ask you to impute the putative whenever
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:19.840]   you hear it. Otherwise we sound like idiots. So the new iPhone, the new iPhone, we could say
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:27.120]   that safely. I don't know. And I'm hoping that someone at Apple listens because I think they're
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:32.080]   packing the iPhone in graham cracker dust would be not a bad idea. Fantastic. It would give you a
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:36.000]   little like like it would keep it protected and then there'd be like a little snack at these,
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.240]   you know, I think that's a lot of work to get those boxes open. Apple will probably put another
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.720]   magic dot inside. I said, Oh, I'm sorry. We wouldn't swap this off for you. But this dot says that
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.800]   this has been packed. This has been been washed in graham cracker dust. We don't support that.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:54.080]   I suppose if this were a serious news program, we would have you now all predict what Apple's
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:59.920]   earnings will be later in the day. Blah, blah, blah, screw that. I want to know, is Apple going
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:05.360]   to announce as they did last time that tomorrow, Matt and line would be available? You know, last
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:10.240]   time a year ago, I thought we had a tomorrow line will be we don't know anything. Oh, okay.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:15.040]   I thought the 25th was the date. Nobody has said that. They said in July, okay,
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:20.960]   hasn't hasn't been announced. But I have seen lots of indicators outside of the ones that
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:25.440]   have been made public that tomorrow's the day. I'll be very surprised. I'm the reason why I'm so
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:30.320]   bummed that I got jolted out of bed at five thirty this morning is that I now I'm not very
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.720]   sure that I need to finish my review today. It was going to be in the paper tomorrow. Oh, oh,
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:40.000]   interesting. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. When I say on the on the on the Sun
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Times website, because if I were to file it today and what printed tomorrow and I was wrong,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.320]   I'd be in big trouble. Right. You have to wait. You have to wait for that one. And apparently,
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:52.480]   according to nine to five, Mac Mountain Line has been seated to Apple Care reps, which you would
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:59.200]   expect in coordination with Apple Care operations. This is a email be pretty good to fake this.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.480]   I think this is probably the real thing. This email is provided to AHA's.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:07.760]   That's the Apple Care reps in advance of Mountain Line's official release. Copy the
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.600]   code below into the redeem section of the Mac app store in the Mac. You wish to upgrade to
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.920]   Mountain Line. Your download will begin automatically. We do know that the ready to manufacture came out
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:20.640]   the gold master. I mean, there's no reason not to think it'll be coming out tomorrow.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.840]   So let me ask this esteemed panel. First of all, you're in the Peloponnesis art. Can you get it?
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.360]   Mike Elgin?
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:34.560]   Well, I'm going to find out. I mean, I haven't tried yet, but I would imagine I would. I mean,
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:39.840]   I don't see why I wouldn't, but I should I should try that. In fact, I'll do it during the show.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.920]   Yeah, because it's going to be tomorrow in a few hours. You should get it before we do.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:51.920]   Well, you know, but I have the one laptop. So, uh, oh, that's a brave thing. Alex, Alex,
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:56.800]   you you have context in Australia. There there as far as anybody can get. Yeah. I'll, I'll, I'll,
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.480]   wait. Now I would, well, okay. It's what's going to happen. I'll show you right now. Yeah.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:05.760]   What's going to happen is they'll do the, they'll do the call at right after the stock market closes,
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:10.240]   about four p.m. Eastern one p.m. Pacific. And they'll announce it at that call on the call.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.480]   And then the code will start to push to the app store probably almost immediately for
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.600]   news, because I don't think they want to have a conversation. I think part of it is that I would
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.040]   doubt they want to have any conversation about it. Right. They just want to get to it. Right. Yeah.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.840]   So that's when the, that's when the flag goes up and that will be probably
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:32.240]   in the morning in Australia. People get up and say, good day, mate. I'm a mountain lion.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.480]   Anything we should be doing to prepare right now, first of all,
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:42.160]   should Mike Elgin be doing it on his one and only laptop and his one and only connection? I don't,
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:46.480]   I don't know. And this is a really good thing. Yeah. I vote no. This is,
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:53.680]   this is one of the most based based on reports that have been published. This is, and also on
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.880]   public statements that Apple has already made about mountain lion. This is a big, big, big update
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:04.640]   with lots of critical fundamental changes to it. And so personally, I do have a second
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.120]   Mac that set aside for this, but my primary Mac is not going to be, not going to be getting 10.8
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.880]   for another couple of weeks. One of the, one of the problems is going to be,
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:18.560]   is going to be just a simple idea of iCloud, how well this sinking service works when it goes live
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:23.680]   to millions and millions and millions of people. Furthermore, it's going to be on an app by app
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:29.360]   basis that the once I work, the I work apps get updated. Once your favorite personal organizer
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:36.000]   gets updated, third party has the developer sussed out every different circumstance between
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   your iPhone, your iPad and your desktop to make sure that these, that iCloud can sink them all
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.560]   together correctly. Because we've talked about this before in the show, the huge source of pain
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:52.720]   amongst developers I've been talking to over the past year has been making sure that the,
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:59.040]   that iCloud sinking works in everything except for the most idealized circumstances.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:04.400]   Everybody has a story to tell me about the time that they absolutely nuclear-fied
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:09.200]   every single test document that they had on every single device because of a simple little
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.400]   error that they made in figuring out what, what would iCloud do if I threw it this slightly
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:19.680]   like curveball? Then, you know, as of nine months ago, at least iCloud had an absolute
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:24.000]   grand mal seizure and decided what if we just were to make sure that none of these documents
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.480]   could be opened by anybody anywhere under any circumstance. Let's try that and see if that works.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.240]   No, iCloud, don't do that. That's not what we're paying you to do. So yeah, it's going to take
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:39.920]   a couple of weeks before I trust it. Now, if you are using Leopard, what do you do?
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:48.000]   Leopard. Yeah. Sorry. Leopard. That was before Snow Leopard. Yeah. That's a long, that's a long,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.200]   that was a long time ago. Yeah. Yeah. But I'm just saying, if you're, or Leopard,
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.880]   or earlier where you don't have an app store, you can't get it, right? What do you do? Walk into
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:18:01.840]   the Apple store and say, upgrade me? How do you get it? I think you can still get, you still get
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:06.960]   lying on media. I believe, I don't know for a fact, but I would be pretty certain that there's
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:13.120]   going to be every machine that can run 10.8 will be able to run 10.8. So I'm sure that they've
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:18.720]   thought about that. There's a serious double digit percentage of Macs out there that are
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.200]   still running 10.4, 10.5. And most of those, by the way, won't be able to run Mountain Line.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:29.120]   I mean, there's a big compatibility issue with those, right? Roaringapps.com has a table of
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:36.400]   compatibility for applications, which you should pay attention to. And then, of course, by the
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:41.680]   way, there's a lot of Xs like, yeah, I mean, typically when these come out, if you're doing
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:46.320]   mission critical work, I would really watch and see how things come out here. You have two computers.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:51.280]   I'm going to have another computer that I install it on so that I can get used to it and
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:55.600]   test it and check it out. But I'm not going to put it on this machine. So check the Roaringapps
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:00.720]   list for your app compatibilities, because that's huge. And then there's quite a few Mac models
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:05.840]   that are not compatible. In fact, I'm wondering if my question is moot. Are there, would there be
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:14.000]   any leopard running Macs on this list? We're talking the specific models that are compatible
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.320]   with Mountain Line. I think the late 2008 was still late 2008 MacBook, because it wasn't
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:24.160]   snow leopard 2009. Okay, maybe Macbook Pro mid to late 2007. Those for sure could be running leopard.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:31.360]   MacBook Air's late 2008 or newer, those could be running leopard iMac, mid 2007 or newer.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:39.760]   Mac Mini 2009 or newer, Mac Pro early 2008 or newer, X-serve 2009 or newer.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:44.080]   Well, there's no newer. X-serve 2009.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:51.200]   And then there is a compatibility,
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:59.760]   oh wait, no, is this a, no, this is for the apps. Presumably, this is a great article, by the way,
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.600]   Cult of Mac, Alex Heath writing it. This is one of the places Mike also writes for,
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:08.880]   getting your Mac ready for Mountain Line the right way. And so check the requirements,
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:17.600]   check the compatibility on apps@roaringapps.com. Back it up. I'm not sure I would use, you know what
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.520]   I would not use Time Machine for this one. I would probably use Superduper for this one.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:26.000]   Yeah. And make a bootable backup and put it on an external drive and keep, and then that way,
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.080]   if the thing goes to hell, you can boot up your external from your external drive.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:35.600]   I never really take into Time Machine. It's kind of, I just, if your machine is screwed,
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.640]   Time Machine, we're storing for Time Machine is not even going to be an option.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:43.360]   Yeah, I believe we use, I have to ask the guys, but I think we're still using carbon copy for that.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:48.320]   And it's similar. Yeah, and it just clones it out. And yeah, I either want any one of those, but,
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:55.520]   Now, Andy, we know you can't talk about Mountain Line. So I'm going to have to phrase this in a
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:01.440]   way that he could talk about it. I'm just curious, if you or someone like you were to have installed
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:07.280]   a Mountain Line on a machine, if one would do a clean install or one would be okay,
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:15.760]   time myself in lots here, to try a upgrade on top of the existing Mountain Line, if one were in fact
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:20.160]   trying to do this. Actually, this is, this is, this is just, this is just general tips and tricks.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:25.200]   I mean, I, I am a firm believer that even before there was this one click, a really cool system,
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.520]   level of installs, I have been a firm believer that once every year, once every year and a half or
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:35.440]   two years, you really should just nuke it all from orbit, do a fresh clean install. If, if,
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:40.880]   if my laptop is half during its service life about a year and a half, two years in, I will
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:45.040]   actually do make sure that I have a complete backup, then actually reformat the whole hard drive
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:50.640]   and reinstall, just put in all the reinstall of fresh copies of all my software. The, the rule is
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:56.320]   though that I only reinstall apps as I need them, because that's the only way to make sure that
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.080]   after a year and a half, you install, see, there's so many documents and so many files and things
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:04.880]   on your, and apps that you don't actually need, you'll, you used it once a year ago. And I'm always
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:09.680]   shocked that I'll have another 90 to 100 gigabytes left on this 500 gigabyte hard drive by doing
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:16.800]   that clean install. But it's not, it's not as necessary as it once was, because you can do a really
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:23.280]   good, Apple really has to, and reengineered the upgrade process to make it only marginally more
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:29.760]   complicated than updating an app. So you can just go into the app store, click on, make the purchase,
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:33.680]   click a button. If this works, the way the previous updates have worked, by the way,
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:39.280]   and just walk away for a surprisingly short amount of time and come back to a working install of
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:44.640]   10.8. So I wouldn't say that it's absolutely necessary to do, realize that a clean install,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.080]   and the throw things I'm advocating can often take like hours and hours and hours, if not the whole
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:54.720]   day. So not, not necessary, but definitely recommended, especially if you're installing this on an
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.600]   older machine, something you've had running for a couple of years. I strongly suggest the, I mean,
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:04.160]   I mean, I clean every time I get a new, every time I move to a new operating system, that generally
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.440]   means unless it's like brand new, like if I, we got a brand new retina, what are you gonna do with
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.160]   that one? I'm gonna leave it the way it is for now, probably for the next three months, you're not
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:14.560]   gonna put mountain line on it. No, no, no, I have to do work on this. So the, I'm gonna do it right
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.040]   away. I'm gonna do it as soon as it's available. I'm gonna do it this afternoon.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.280]   Well, and, and things, I deal with a lot of stuff like Skype.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.480]   On all my machines.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.240]   Yeah, exactly. I am, I'm serious.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:22.800]   Crazy.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.720]   I don't care. I know, I do. If one goes bad, so what?
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:32.000]   Think things that, things that use the CPU, and especially the inputs and outputs like Thunderbolt
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.560]   and stuff like that, that stuff tends to be a little bit more sensitive. So whether it's hang
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:40.240]   outs or Skype or other things like that, those things tend to be a little bit more sensitive to
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.520]   upgrades and compatibility issues. I don't care. I know, I'm a rebel.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:48.160]   I do, I do. I'm gonna do it. And I bet you 99% of the people watching this show are gonna do it,
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.480]   even though they know it's the wrong thing to do. They're gonna do it anyway.
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.440]   Oh, crazy.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.240]   How about in the audience? You're all gonna just, as soon as mountain lines available, boom!
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:59.520]   Here's to the crazy one. Yeah. You know what they say, you know what they say?
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.080]   You're all looking at me like, you're wrong.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.880]   You know what they say? It's, if you're, if you're one step ahead, you're a leader.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.320]   If you're two steps ahead, you're a martyr.
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:10.960]   Here's one thing that is really, I don't know how many steps ahead.
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.160]   Installing them. It could be one of the other. Yeah, at least it's two.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.360]   So here's one thing that's really handy to know. If you are running Lion,
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:22.080]   I guess this would be true of any system that's capable of Lion. There's a Lion Internet
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:28.480]   recovery that you can use. So even if you mung everything, first of all, always back up your data.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:33.040]   But any other pieces that you didn't get, that you didn't make yourself that are one of a kind,
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:37.840]   one, you know, one off stuff you got back. But if you really mung it up, you can restart your
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:44.240]   machine with a command R, right? Well, there's a recovery partition that can boot up the machine.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:48.320]   You won't, that's not the same as recovering your entire boot partition.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:54.640]   Sorry. I recovered your entire directory. But then there's this cool thing that you can
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:25:01.520]   restore it from Apple servers. You can restore the operating system installed from
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:07.440]   online because the recovery partition will let you boot locally. You can even boot
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:11.520]   slightly off of a network if you need to do that. It really is designed to make sure that
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:15.360]   you're not left high and dry, particularly if you're using a MacBook Air or something that doesn't
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:22.800]   have internally the ability to just stick in the stick on a CD. You might not even have your USB
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:27.120]   recovery chip with you. And so that's really what's designed to cover. It really is though,
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:31.520]   like an emergency ejection seat, you don't want to have to use that unless the alternative is
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:36.160]   guaranteed fireball death. Why? Why? Why not? I mean, I'm getting a clean install from Apple
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:43.040]   servers. I have backed up my data. Remember, I stipulated that it's much, it's much better to
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:48.880]   have made a local backup on a hard drive and be able to perform that restore locally rather
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:53.360]   than try to use these emergency services to resuscitate your Mac. Because that's kind of
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:58.000]   what the service is designed to do. It's a resuscitation. Plus, if everybody's doing it tomorrow,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.200]   you don't want to be the one that's waiting for service. Yeah. I mean, it's so many things
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:07.920]   can go wrong when you do an operating system level update. Just a couple days ago, I earned a
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:14.880]   free loaf of zucchini bread from a neighbor because they're trying to install an Apple update and
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:20.800]   it went to blue screen like over and over and over again. And it was one of those things where
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:25.680]   if you have another drive standing by because you did a backup before it is something that's
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:30.080]   serious, worst case scenario is you go out, you see the Batman movie, you come back and everything's
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:35.120]   fixed because you did a restore. If you don't have that backup, you can still still get everything
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.960]   back. But now you're dealing with like a hands on process or trip to the mall to visit your Apple
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:45.840]   store. So our advice to you then would be bake some zucchini bread now. I could get my email
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:52.960]   address and get Andy's email address just in case. I will, I will, I will say that if you, those of
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:58.720]   you who have Amazon.com, who have Amazon Prime, you can get a full capacity hard backup hard drive
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:04.560]   for it to cover your existing hard drive. It will cost you what like $3.99 to $99 for next day delivery.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:08.800]   Order it today. It'll arrive tomorrow. Download a free copy of SuperDuber,
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:13.680]   which you can just do a one-click backup. That's a great thing to have. If you have an external
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:18.480]   drive, it's a or even a USB key because how big is it? I mean, how big is your hard drive? I guess
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:22.400]   it might be too big to do that. Probably bigger than the USB key. But I mean,
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:27.680]   the fact is that these external pocket size hard drives are just so damn cheap.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:33.920]   I mean, if AOL were still an ongoing concern, they would ship like half-terabyte hard drives,
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:40.160]   USB 2.0 to every door step of the AOL logo on it now. So I mean, it really is worth like the 50 or
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:45.200]   60 or 70 bucks it'll cost to get one of these external drives to just once a week or so,
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:51.280]   put it on your schedule, remember like this. Every time you brush your teeth, do a full backup
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:57.600]   using SuperDuber and you'll be fine. I just rebooted my 11-inch air. This is the older air
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:03.920]   and restarted it and held down command and R. And this is what boots up now. This is from the
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:08.720]   local recovery. Can you see that? You can't chat, unfortunately. I don't know why. Maybe I
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:15.040]   could stay there. I could drag that over. You're on the second screen. But that's what you get.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:24.560]   You get utilities and you can restore from a... Now, if this gets munged up, that reinstall option
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:30.800]   is coming from your hard drive. There is this kind of emergency emergency
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:37.120]   that you can get it from Apple servers. And this really is one of the things that in an ideal world
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:45.600]   10.8 will be just a legend, legions ahead of 10.7 and 10.6 and windows. Because in an idealized world,
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:49.840]   like let's say next, this time next year after all the problems have been worked out,
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:54.640]   you will have purchased all of your software through the app store. So that's safely off.
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:29:02.480]   So that's safely offsite. All of your documents are being synced through iCloud. So they're
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.320]   safely offsite. So again, in a perfect world of all this works that you're from now,
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:12.240]   you will get that dream situation where even if you're having a tea on the porch using your
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:18.960]   MacBook Air and a team of badgers rests your MacBook Air and takes it into its den and does
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:23.040]   dirty business on it. You don't want to put back anymore. You'll be able to buy a brand new MacBook
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:30.560]   Air, take it back, click a couple buttons, sign in and get back every single... Get back your 10.8
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:34.800]   install, get back all of your apps, get it back all your data, get back all your settings. Right now,
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:39.760]   it's not going to work quite that way. But in an idealized iCloud future, that's the whole idea to
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:48.640]   have sort of a Chromebook on a Chromebook only where you actually have possession of your files
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:52.480]   and Apple is just simply quietly making sure that there's a copy of it someplace else automatically.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:56.960]   Now the reason I said don't do it from Time Machine is in case of this worst case example.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:03.200]   Time Machine is great for rolling back documents. It's great for put this back to the status it was
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:09.280]   in two days ago. When it comes to doing a full restore, it can certainly do that but an app like
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:14.240]   Superduper is optimized for backup the whole thing, restore the whole thing and do an incremental
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:18.800]   backup and do an incremental restore. It's much much better than Time Machine. I got to say,
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:22.400]   when I got this machine, I got this machine right before I left for Australia and I mean literally
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:26.880]   I was holding home for like 36 hours and so I just came in and opened up the machine.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.640]   Nice, open up the App Store. I just went... I didn't hit all of them because there's some of them I
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:34.000]   found like I'm not using. I just went down and just went like this and then I went back to packing and
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.600]   doing other things hanging out with my kids. You know whatever came back. It's all ready to go.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:42.720]   And then I've been using, I mean yes eventually iCloud will solve this but you could use Dropbox
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.640]   or Carbon under some other solution for your data that makes it just as easy to do that.
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:50.880]   Hey Chad could you show my screen again? I can't get out of this because only you can see,
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.600]   okay what is... would you zoom in on that? I don't know what it's saying now.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:59.840]   Are you sure you want to quit? Yeah restart. Okay where's my mouse? I think you just hit return.
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:06.400]   Is it return? Okay thank you. You saved me. I couldn't see it. I'd moved it off screen.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:10.160]   Now I'm rebooting and I did not erase anything so I'm just gonna come back.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:17.680]   Anyway we're very excited. We talked last weekend. I hope you saw that. If not go back and watch
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:23.280]   about the main new features in Mountain Line. They're fairly significant. This is not a minor
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:29.120]   upgrade despite the naming which implies minor upgrade. It's a great update. I think it's gonna
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:33.920]   be a good update and I think you're gonna want to put it on your retina before anybody does.
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.400]   Well no because it's got retina specific stuff. No but I need to test some things first.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:43.360]   I know it does. It's supposed to fix the resolution issues and you know all that stuff but I have to
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:48.160]   tell you what I'll do it and you can just... I'll watch. I'll be the either the leader or the
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:53.360]   martyr. One of the... we're not undecided. Exactly. And usually when I'm not... when it's not like a
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:57.920]   production ready machine like this one is... I understand. I do live production so the problem is a bit
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:03.520]   of it breaks in front of thousands of people which is a real bummer. And I've done that.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:10.720]   But the other thing is typically on my other computers I'll always upgrade one quickly because
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:16.160]   of the show but outside of that I usually wait for the second update. So you know there's only a
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:21.920]   patch. So Apple releases an op the OS and within a week there'll be a patch. And that patch was like
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:27.440]   oh that's what I got about that. Yeah whoa as soon as you know and then they'll be...
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:32.480]   and that's the gamma testing. That's what we tend to call it. There's alpha testing which is just
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:37.280]   internal beta testing which is external and gamma testing is when you actually buy it and
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:42.560]   screw up. And I think this is germane for people who use their max for production. So they'll patch
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:47.040]   it and then they'll patch the patch. And the patch... the patch... patching the patch fixes whatever the
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:52.240]   patch broke when it... You know and... So how long do you wait on that chain? Usually that happens in
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.600]   about the first two or three weeks. You don't want the first patch. You want the second patch.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:59.040]   Because the first patch will break other things. The second patch could break things too. It will
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:04.160]   but it's less. It's fewer things. It very quickly drops too. We're just doing security. You don't want
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:09.360]   to wait till Delta. What? Alpha beta gamma delta epsilon data, eta theta, yoda. How about wait to
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:13.920]   Kappa? We're lambda. I'm gonna wait till we... I like to wait till it's almost obsolete and then
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:18.000]   I just update. You know I was like... and then I say oh well you just stay a year behind everybody
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.480]   else. It'll sort itself out. Mike Elgin we lost you briefly but we got you back. It's now dark in
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:32.720]   the Peloponnesus. Mike are you near Sparta? I am in Sparta. It's now called Sparty but I am in the town
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:40.640]   of Sparta. Wow. Do you just... Yeah you just walk around just staying. It's kind of interesting.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:51.360]   In the Middle Ages they dismembered, dismantled the ruins of Sparta to build a big wall town called
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:56.160]   Meastroft like five miles away and I went there today and you could see all this like Spartan
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:02.320]   like marble like like embedded into the walls. It's pretty crazy. And you know aren't... isn't
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.120]   your wife writing a cookbook called the Spartan diet or something like that?
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:12.400]   Did we lose them? Aren't you on the Spartan diet? There's a lot of latency.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:20.880]   Oh this can make me sad. Hey yeah there's a lot... I'm sorry it's very choppin' decided. I didn't get
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:24.080]   that. Isn't your wife writing a Spartan diet cookbook?
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:33.840]   Oh I'm sounding glad. That's right we're finishing the book this uh you know while we're here so
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:38.640]   a little bit of research and you know part of it is just because it's kind of awesome but
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:44.640]   part of it is just to do a little research here and yeah but that's that's what we're working on.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:49.280]   It's text deductible. All right we're going to keep working on our connection with Mike in
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:54.160]   Sparta in the Peloponnese. I think we found one drawback to working anywhere you want.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:35:01.360]   You gotta have a good connection. You should probably find a fiber connection. But every town is going
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:07.440]   to soon have that. See I'm waiting till I could do a twit from a boat. You can do it. Well we gotta
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:13.440]   work on a latency. Yeah we gotta work 600 milliseconds. Yeah uh as soon as as soon as I can get high
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:18.960]   speed internet in the middle of the Atlantic I am there. Every time I do a speed test on that LTE
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:26.400]   iPad, new iPad I think oh that is so close. It's not exceeding like those some speeds I get at home
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:31.600]   over oh this is so tempting. I should do it. Well while it's nice I should I should I should do like
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:37.200]   next week's Mac break like on a swan boat in the public garden because of what I do is I just
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:42.640]   I do speed tests everywhere. We could have we could have a little internal competition chat could we uh
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:48.800]   for best uh best you know remote and I have to say the Peloponnese is is is is in the lead
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:54.080]   although we you know we had Jeff Jarvis from the bridge in Sydney from so the opera house behind
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:58.720]   him. We've had some interesting calls. We've lost Mike again. We're gonna work on that. And one other
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:03.760]   thing I want to ask you chat before we go to break um do we on the editing machines do we wait to
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:11.520]   update or because we use Apple Mac Pros with Final Cut Pro studio. We tend to not update unless
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:16.880]   if the uh computer came with it. So we're still sitting probably on leopard. Some of them still
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:23.120]   have I think leopard. Sagan? They're all still leopard. A coriander. Snow leopard. Snow leopard.
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:28.800]   Flowmaster Alex who now we know by the way because if you watch before you buy we actually know he's
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:36.160]   got a little a little layer behind the wall and he's listening and he's just pop your head up over
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:46.640]   the uh over the wall there so we can. It's a great shot. We're waiting for Curtis Stan.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:50.160]   Is that what he said? The sand. It's because of the sand. Oh we have a storage area network that
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:54.560]   has to work with. So that's interesting. I didn't so we are actually on a fairly old version.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:37:01.040]   See. See. See. I just want to say but I can I can I can be three steps ahead because I I don't do
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:06.000]   anything important around here. So it's okay for me to upgrade all my Macs. We never take your screen
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.760]   on productions or anything. No that's fine. That'll always work. All right we're gonna take a break.
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:17.360]   I'm by the way I'm now in the app store updating my apps because I thought well that's a good idea.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:22.000]   Speaking of which Sparrow is getting updated for retina support. That's nice.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:28.080]   We said about Sparrow. I'm I'm just devastated. I love Sparrow as an email app.
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:33.760]   I just I never I opened it. I mean I was suggested I was getting I was angry with mail and then I
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:37.360]   just was like it's just complicated because mail so embedded with everything else that I'm doing
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:42.000]   that I either use mail or I use the web page like I go to a you know Gmail or whatever and
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:48.720]   my thing. I just I like Sparrow and I'm sad Google bought them you know kudos to the Sparrow team.
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:54.320]   They made a great Mac App Store app which was 10 bucks and a iPhone app which is five bucks
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:38:00.160]   that really integrated beautifully with Gmail but all all your email and I just I just felt it
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:04.960]   was very elegant and had a unified inbox and there were things I liked about it but they've
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:08.080]   announced that they're not going to update it any further now that they're owned by Google and I
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:12.320]   presume that what will happen and I hope this is this could be good is that Google will then
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:17.440]   incorporate these features into their own apps so at least iOS will benefit from it. If not maybe
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:22.560]   I would love to see Google a desktop app. Thank you. All right we're gonna take a break when we come
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:29.920]   back more with Mike Elgin who's dropped us I think again. We'll get back to him. It's great to have
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:33.520]   him though from the Peloponnesus. I didn't know he didn't even tell me he was like leaving town.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:38.640]   He's like gone. He's just I want to do that. I was telling him. I was telling him. I was like I
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:43.760]   just want to I want to Johnny Quest life. When I was a kid I just imagined Johnny Quest as long
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:48.720]   as and I was like we have to hire race band and to you know teach the kids. Did Johnny Quest go
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:54.560]   from race to race or what did he do? No race. No race was his like no I'm thinking of a speed racer
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:58.960]   which was a similar. Johnny Quest is his father was a scientist. They had the they had the jet
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:03.360]   and they had race and race was like his security guard and his and a teacher. Isn't that awesome?
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:06.400]   Yeah a teacher that you know can you know be people up.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:14.320]   Alex Lindsey is here. Where are you going next? I'm just going to DC. Oh and just for a couple
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:21.280]   days. How boring now the nation's capital big deal. And then after that. Houston next week.
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:26.880]   That's fun. And then back to DC a couple weeks and then you just all over the place in Florida.
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:32.400]   Alex you're the sort of person though when you say you go into DC I think Denmark, Copenhagen.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:36.800]   Yeah. Yeah the big the big research triangle and Denmark Copenhagen.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.080]   Denali Canola.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:46.160]   Canada. Alex Lindsey is here so is Andy Inaco who is just Boston bound. He's just tied down.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:50.640]   He's got roots. They need me here Leo. It would break their hearts if I left them.
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:56.320]   He's got a job to do. One thing that makes you more mobile and I should when Mike gets back I'll
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:01.840]   ask him if he did this is getting rid of the extra stuff in your life. That's kind of a challenge
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:07.120]   you know. I keep getting tempted just to get a big dumpster out in front of the house just
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:13.360]   load it up say take it but that's kind of irresponsible. Especially since Jennifer did a
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:19.360]   one dollar sale of all my stuff. One dollar. It went fast.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:25.200]   We don't know when I pick it up. I wish she'd known about Gazelle. This was a few years ago.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:30.560]   Now this is what we do. We use Gazelle.com. This is you get more than a dollar. What do you want to
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:37.440]   sell? Choose from an iPhone, iPad, iPod, Apple TV, Apple laptops, Apple desktops, Apple displays,
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:44.000]   Blackberries. If you've got a Samsung, I mean, an Android phone from HTC Motorola, Samsung or LG.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.680]   Nokia phone. Let's say you know, I think maybe it's time to retire this MacBook Air 11 inch
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:57.280]   and replace it with say a retina display. Why not? How is this situation? It's you know, actually
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:00.480]   it's good because I've been keeping it in a case. I've got all the cords and everything. I'm just
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:04.880]   checking these boxes at Gazelle.com. You can do this too by the way and get a 30 day quote. That
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:10.400]   means a quote. You don't have to act on it right now. The quote is good for 30 days. 287 bucks.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:14.560]   That's great. That's money in your pocket. Now here's the beauty part. When you check out,
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:21.360]   you can choose a check PayPal or and I would recommend this an Amazon gift card and they'll
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:27.040]   bonus it another 5% and given that Amazon sells everything you want to replace this stuff,
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:32.320]   that's a great place to go. So I guess they're kind of, if you're doing through Amazon,
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:35.360]   are they kind of giving back their cut? I think that's probably what they're doing,
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:40.480]   but I don't know. I mean, it's just so cool. It's awesome. Yeah. What a great company. Well run,
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:45.600]   nice guys. They're data experts, by the way, will wipe your data off if you forget to.
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:49.840]   They often, this is kind of cool. I mean, they're looking at the quality of the thing,
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:55.120]   making sure they can sell it at the price they quoted. Sometimes, I'm surprised, but I hear from
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:59.120]   people all the time and said, they actually raised the amount of money they gave me. They have no
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:03.920]   obligation to do that. But if they say, "No, this is better condition than you saw it," and
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:08.800]   I've seen them do this, raise the amount of money you get. What a great way, if you're planning an
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:15.280]   upgrade and I know many of you are, say an iPhone, next generation, you want to visit Gazelle. Get
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:19.120]   a quote now for the old iPhone because I can promise you tomorrow it's worth less and the day
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:26.080]   after it's worth less and on and on and on. Gazelle.com, the best kind of recycling. You keep it moving
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:29.360]   by Gazelle. I know Mike's a big Gazelle fan. When we get him back, I'm going to ask him. I
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:39.600]   bet he gazelle a lot of stuff. G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, Gazelle.com. You're watching Mac Break Weekly,
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:43.760]   coming up in a little bit. We're going to other new time for the weekly daily gizwiz, which now
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:48.800]   we've just renamed the gizwiz, Dick D. Bartolobian Studio. This is the one-year anniversary of
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:52.640]   our parade down the street. I love it when Dick's in the stew. The Brick House Dick is so much fun.
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:57.520]   He's going to bring a bunch of gadgets and we will relive some of the memories of the year ago
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:04.640]   and the reopening of the Brick House Studio exactly one year ago today. Next week, Aaron
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:09.920]   Hillagas joins us. He is the author of a brand new book and he just sent it to me and I'm very
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:14.240]   excited. Aaron, as you know, runs Big Nerd Wanch. I think he's great. I took the class. You took
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:18.320]   the class. It's awesome. He's the guy in the cowboy hat you've seen before. He's fantastic.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:22.960]   This is a new one and this might be from the class you took. This is for non-programmers and
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:28.640]   beginners, an introduction to Objective-C programming, what you need to know to write iOS and Mac apps.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:34.800]   He has books for advanced users. He's got the classic, which I have Coco programming
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:40.160]   for a Mac OS X and iOS programming, the Big Nerd Wanch guide. That's the class you took.
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:44.320]   But this is new. Objective-C programming, the Big Nerd Wanch guide from Aaron Hillagas.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.320]   I think these are some of the best books out there for it.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:50.320]   Very. You know, this is, you could work your way through this and you would be ready to write
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:54.400]   iOS apps and desktop apps. And even if you're, here's the thing that I found useful is I took
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:57.760]   the class, which works through the book, but you can ask questions and so on and so forth. But
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:01.200]   one of the things that I think worked really well was that now when I talk to programmers
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.880]   about what I want, you know, you speak their language. And I understand what, I understand
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:08.240]   how hard something is like, oh, this is going to be hard. That's not going to be hard. This is
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:11.920]   just calling a class versus they're going to have to write a drone code. You know, and that's the,
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:16.480]   much really, really make so it's useful to go through a book like this. Even if you,
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:19.040]   if you think you want to develop something, you're going to hire someone to do it,
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:22.160]   right? It just means that you're, you can speak, you can speak objectives.
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.360]   And this starts from the beginning installing apples, developer tools. One of the things I
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:30.800]   love about Mac, I always have is that it comes with, you know, a bunch of stuff installed and
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:33.840]   then you can easily install Xcode and then the end and then the world is your oyster.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.160]   You know, I need to use any of those code. Five dollars or something?
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:39.920]   No, it's free now. Is it free now? That was, they were charging five dollars. I bought it for some
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:48.400]   reason. It's great. But it is free now. So the OS 10 mountain lion up to date application has gone live.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:56.320]   This is, this allows any customer purchasing a Mac on or after June 11th. That would be you,
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:00.800]   Alex. That would be me as well. We bought our MacBook retinas to get your upgrade for free.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:05.520]   So you could do this right now. If you want Alex, this gone live.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:08.240]   I can see, I can see if my retinas going to be compatible with not,
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:12.320]   well, what happens is you submit a claim and then they send you an app code.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:16.320]   Oh, yes. So I can do the upgrade. So you can do the upgrade for free.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.480]   I guess I'll just get the claim and then I'll just hang on to the claim.
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:22.640]   I would do it now. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the fact that this has gone live.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:28.800]   Well, wait a minute. Now I just went there and I don't see it live, but this is what nine to five
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:35.360]   Mac was claiming. Hmm. Maybe it hasn't, maybe it's only live in some areas. It's not live for me.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:43.360]   Okay. You got my hopes up. All right. Let's talk about the new iPhone. We're still trying to get
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:52.880]   Mike Elgin back from the Peloponnese. I just like saying that. The latest somebody, this is such
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:59.600]   bogusity, but Reuters now says according to two sources. We have two now. Yeah. Oh, let me
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:06.080]   vote for according to two sources. We have confirmation that the 19 pin connector will be the new connector.
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:13.040]   I'm also hearing from others that Apple will have an adapter. Of course, Apple's not saying.
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:21.120]   And even Reuters does not know whether the adapter will come with the iPhone or be an
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:25.120]   additional charge. I wonder, what do you think, Andy? I would, if I were Apple, I'd bundle it.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:29.200]   You've got to respond to these issues. I would say that they're going to,
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:33.520]   they would charge X for four. I don't think they put it inside the box because, well, because-
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:39.120]   Well, because- It's just a piece of plastic. Well, we don't know that. If it's just pin for pin
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:44.000]   rerouting Conduis, that's one thing. If there's a chip inside there to make sure that you're not
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.360]   pirating, that it's a new control or something like that. That could be something else. Also,
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:57.520]   you look behind at every single box of every product that Apple has made. Have they ever
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:01.840]   included something recently that they don't feel is that you don't absolutely need?
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:06.640]   So that's the only reason why I don't think. Well, also, I do think that if there's a way to save
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:12.640]   $1.30 on every unit sold, they're going to save that $1.30. Did you, Alex, buy the Thunderbolt
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:18.000]   Ethernet? Yes, for your retinocetoto die. What I wanted to do, though, is I went, actually,
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.120]   that's actually where I was in the Sydney Apple stores buying it, and I forgot that I needed one.
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:27.120]   I want the USB one. I don't want to use up my Thunderbolts with- You got two Thunderbolts.
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:31.360]   I know, but I use both of them. Yeah, I actually probably don't need all that speed, do you?
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:35.520]   Yeah, you probably don't need all that speed. I don't need it. For Ethernet, the USB is just fine.
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:39.200]   I'd rather put it on my USB and not use up my Thunderbolts, because I put drives on those and
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:43.440]   video input. The reason you need two Thunderbolts, or the reason it's better is because if you want
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:48.640]   to do an HD camera into your laptop and then write it to an external Thunderbolt drive
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:55.280]   that's like SSD, then you need two Thunderbolts. You can try to pass through, but it's not a stable.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:58.960]   Right. So it's really great to do it that way. That's why I like to have two.
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:04.480]   This is the best laptop ever made. I mean, they're all good, but I mean,
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:08.400]   I have to say that if anyone- It's the best case. I got to tell you, it's the best computer I have
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:16.800]   ever used. It's very expensive. It's stunning. Just so you know, do you think an iPad Mini will
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:24.320]   also come out when the iPhone next? I'm going to call it next. I really want it. I'm really
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:28.320]   finding myself not from a price perspective, but just from a usage perspective. I find that the
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:31.760]   iPad is just a little bigger than something that I carry around all the time. I realize I just use
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:34.480]   the iPhone a lot more than the iPad because I don't want to carry the iPad around.
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:40.240]   Right. I mean, I've had these smaller tablets now for many, many months. And now it seems,
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:44.400]   as a person who relies on my iPad for everything that I do outside of the office,
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:49.440]   I'm really now used to having a second screen next to the iPad. And when you have something
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:54.720]   like the Nexus 7 where for 199 bucks, I can have a second screen that will have like a web browser
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:59.440]   open or Netflix or something else like that, I wouldn't spend an extra five, six, seven hundred
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:03.600]   bucks for that kind of a feature. But given that it's a more portable tablet, something I'm going
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:08.000]   to be taking out when I don't necessarily want to have my 10 inch, it really makes the case that
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.480]   this 10 inch iPad tablet can be that much more useful if you're now going to have it in a two
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:18.720]   screen configuration. So having had more chances to use these smaller tablets has really over the
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:23.840]   past year made me think rethink a lot of my assumptions about how people would use a 7 inch.
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:28.080]   I've always almost exclusively thought that the seven inch tablets for people who either can't
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:32.560]   afford an iPad or can't make the case for owning it. Now I think that it would also make a great
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:38.880]   accessory for laptops for full size tablets. So it's really interesting to see how people
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:42.880]   would react to it. And I do think that we're, I mean, at this point, I'll be kind of surprised
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:48.240]   we don't see a many iPad at the end of the year. I mean, we're kicking around the Nexus 7 and it's
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:52.080]   just just a great little machine. I mean, it's just to really, and I really like that form factor.
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:56.880]   And by the way, apologies. I'm more Renee Richie writing it. I'm more was the one who had the
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:02.400]   story that the adapter, there will be an adapter for the new smaller. I have to admit with the European,
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:07.280]   with the European regulations, I'm kind of surprised that they don't just move to USB.
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:10.320]   You know, like, you know, like, but you know, I think it's licensed.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:15.760]   Well, I think and I also think the 19 pin connector, they want more capability than USB can give you.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:19.760]   Right. Right. But you're connecting it to a USB on the other end. So, I mean,
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:24.960]   you're just as a test of this adapter theory. They did the same thing with the mag safe on the
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:30.640]   retinus plate. You got your adapter with you? The there's a man. I didn't know there was a
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:35.520]   and a doctor for this. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't know that. You want to go to the Apple Store in Sydney again?
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:40.320]   Yes. We've got Mike Elgin back. He's gone inside. I guess the cafe just didn't didn't.
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:45.760]   You know, rely on public networks like that. As people were showing up at this cafe,
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:50.400]   I think they were using the Wi-Fi connection. It got really dicey. But I'm back in my apartment
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:55.040]   and I have a really good connection. So awesome. I had to be back. I hope I didn't miss anything good.
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:58.720]   Obviously you haven't watched this so much.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:08.320]   We were just waiting for you to come back. No, I'm glad we got the cafe shot. And I think that
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:11.680]   might probably make sense. You probably didn't have to move in. But that was good to have it as
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:18.800]   long as we had it. Research says Samsung has sold 10 million Galaxy S3s. But the next iPhone is still
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:24.320]   the most wanted phone. This is from 451 research. Change wave.
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:30.080]   Unprecedented advanced demand higher than any other iPhone model has had before this
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:35.440]   conference that you were saying. Alex, 14% of respondents said very likely. Let's try it here.
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:40.880]   Presumably people who are in our live studio. This is survey of the five people. No way.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:46.560]   One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. 10 people in our audience today.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:52.480]   They're here for Mac break weekly. So presumably they're Mac fans. How many of you are very likely
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:59.920]   or more to buy the next iPhone? Show of hands. One, two, three, 30% of respondents.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:05.280]   So 30% from our scientific research here. We're going to say 30% of the United States is going
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:10.160]   to buy an iPhone. That's a hundred million. That's exactly that's double the amount.
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:14.240]   They're I got to point out the change wave said they said 40. We got 30%.
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:19.200]   I would I would I would argue that it's not skewed at all by the fact that we're doing a Mac based
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:23.600]   show in the audience. I mean, I don't know. Well, they don't say how they chose their people.
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:27.840]   Exactly. And I would say also also like at the door, it's not like you were interviewing people
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:33.040]   and only letting in people who are iPhone users. So anybody could come in. You didn't do that.
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:36.720]   Did you should have should have that would have been a good idea. Well, you know, but here's the
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:41.520]   here's the thing about this this information and this idea about about how well Samsung
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:48.000]   mini tablets and big phones are going to sell are based in a vacuum of Apple products in that
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:54.560]   space. I did an analysis last year. And if you look at like who's making money, the actual revenue
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:53:01.600]   profits in mobile devices, all of the profits are smaller than the iPad and bigger than the iPhone.
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:07.360]   The the things are the same size as the Apple devices or bigger in the case of tablets smaller
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:12.240]   than the case of phones. Nobody's making a penny. Companies are losing money. So all the
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:16.960]   competitive money is being made in that space. And that's why Apple is getting into that space
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:23.680]   with both the next iPhone and the next tablet. The mini iPad will crowd out Samsung and the
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:28.160]   slightly bigger screen iPhone will a little bit crowd out Samsung. So all these numbers about
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:34.080]   Samsung based in an environment of, you know, in an absence of Apple devices in the, you know,
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:38.880]   mid-sized devices is can be all thrown away as simple ships and stuff.
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:46.480]   Tim Cook said that Apple will not leave this direct quote will not leave a price umbrella
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:52.000]   for competitors. Yep. Exactly. And that's what you're talking about, right? There will be no
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:57.440]   no place out of the out of the Apple sphere. There'll be no they did that with the iPods too. I mean,
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:02.000]   they had you had shuffles and you had nannos and you had so the thing is it's it's a pattern that
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.800]   Apple's used before. And and the curious what I'm curious about is what price will that be. I mean,
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:12.240]   it's if they I think that if if they come in with a seven inch iPad that is $199,
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:16.080]   they'll leave nothing but stubble. I mean, there'll be nothing left. I mean, you know,
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.280]   and just I'm not sure whether they're going to be that competitive or not.
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:21.440]   It depends on how.
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:30.000]   So again, for the mini iPad, I'm thinking I'm thinking it's going to be 250. They're going to
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:36.400]   give the competing against a gazillion $200. Right. Things but $50 more will get you. You know,
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:42.560]   the the Cadillac. I think that I think I think 249 or 299 will make it very competitive. I just
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:48.960]   think that is deaf. 299 they I be I'm sorry, I shouldn't I shouldn't speak in absolutes.
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:55.440]   249 is I think the highest they can charge for a smaller pad near to really. Well, I'm I'm I
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:59.760]   blurted that out and I should have said that. What I mean is that I would be I think that they'll
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:04.320]   have some challenges ahead if they price it that high if they put that much of a price differential
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:10.960]   between a mini iPad and $199 device of the quality of the Nexus 7. When you look at there was another
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:16.800]   report, I think that was got a lot of press over the past week about the difference between saturation
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:23.600]   of the iPhone in the United States versus versus Europe, saying that because the price of the iPhone
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:28.480]   isn't nearly as subsidized nearly as cheap in the in the in Europe as it is in the United States.
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:34.480]   That's the reason why Android is maybe artifact made a naturally higher adoption rates. So on the
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:38.800]   one hand, it does say that no people aren't aren't looking at Android and saying gee, we like this
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:43.600]   as much as the iPhone. But on the other hand, it's also saying when we look at an iPhone versus an
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:47.840]   Android device, the Android device is cheaper. We don't care that the iPhone is much, much better.
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:53.600]   So I'm not sure that people will I believe that maybe people will be able to say for $50 more,
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:58.800]   I could get the the brand that everybody recognizes. I think when you jump that to $100 more,
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:04.240]   the sort of person who's walking to the store for a mini tablet who is who probably has been
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:09.600]   talked maybe has been talked up for from a $100 ebook. I'm not sure that they would see the differences
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:15.920]   between Android 4.2 and iOS 6 on a mini tablet. But the people who can't see the difference are
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:21.040]   not the people Apple goes from Apple's revenue model is all about making money from the hardware,
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:28.080]   from the apps, from the from the from the whole services thing, the content downloads, all that
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:33.200]   stuff. And if you look at the market for phones in general, Apple's making you know with 4% or
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:38.240]   whatever it is of the entire cell phone market, Apple's making, I don't know, what is it? 70, 75%
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:42.560]   of the profits. The reason they're doing that is they're going after the profitable people.
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:50.400]   And if somebody's going to wants to say $50 and rather have a Samsung rather than an iPad,
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:55.280]   that's not the person who's going to make them profitable with content and buying movies and all
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:57:01.600]   that kind of stuff. So I think the thing is that with the Nexus 7, we keep on talking about $199,
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:07.120]   but the one that's that's sold out is the $249 one. I mean, you know, that's the right.
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:10.960]   You know, people want to learn more memory. You're absolutely right. So those are the ones that
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:15.200]   actually sold is they went in thinking, you know, $199 and they walked out with a 16 gig that's
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:19.840]   $249. You know, and I think that that's that could be the same situation for Apple. I do think
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:26.480]   I do think $299 is a big one from Apple might be the one that outsells the $250. Right. But I think
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:32.240]   Apple being able to have the press that they have a 199 or 249 version, I think would be, you know,
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:35.920]   I think that's going to be useful for getting people thinking about it. There's a name for that.
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:42.240]   Remember in predictably, irrationally talked about that kind of pricing structure where you have a
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:48.480]   low price that people remember, but you always you never end up selling that one. You always sell
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:52.720]   the next one up from that. And you also have a high price. And the one I can't remember what
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:55.760]   that's called, but there's a name for it. We're not a good book if you're not read predictably
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:58:00.000]   irrational, but that he's talking about it. And the example he uses was the Wall Street Journal
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.880]   subscription model, where they had a really cheap one. But no, you and they put that there because
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:11.360]   you go, I could for 15 bucks more, I can get both the online and the print version. I'm going to do
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:15.440]   that. And they get and they basically are upselling you without anything. And I bet you, I don't
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:19.760]   know if Apple's clever enough to do that. They're clever enough. I don't know if they, they feel
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:24.240]   like they need to, if they do that or not. But it would be smart to have, they've never done this
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:30.320]   to my knowledge, but it'd be smart to have a 250 buck one. But the one you wants 300. Right.
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:34.400]   Yeah, it is. I say, I say the real smart is to have one, I want to figure out a way to be one.
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:38.240]   That no one wants, you know, or whatever. But I mean, having to one on it. So for the
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:41.920]   handful of people that really, you already have that, you have to touch. Yeah.
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:47.120]   I think there's an excellent reason why you can't buy and I, in the United States of America,
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:50.880]   you can't buy an iPhone for one penny more than what you can buy an Android phone for.
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:56.640]   I don't, I mean, there's, there's, there is now the three different free, right?
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:59:00.560]   They're different. There are different price structures for different volumes. But if you want
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:04.240]   to spend 200 bucks for an iPhone, if you want to spend 99 bucks for an iPhone, if you want to get
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:10.240]   an iPhone for free, all those bases are covered. I'm just, I'm just saying that I'd be surprised
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:18.560]   if they could get away with charging 50% more for a iPad mini than for a comparable,
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:24.480]   which looks like to be comparable in every way, shape and form, a Google based seven inch tablet.
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:29.280]   Yeah. And I just, I just, maybe it's a lack of imagination on my part. And I do understand the
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:33.040]   idea that you want the people you want to, the people that you want to invite into the tent
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:37.360]   or the people who have the money to spend once they get inside the tent. But I think that this is a,
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:41.840]   this is a really much more consumer-y device than the iPad is. And I think that different
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:45.120]   rules are going to apply. And I think that's just my hunch. And for people who, a lot of people are
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:49.280]   wondering why, why is it important that Apple, you know, takes care of that lower market? And a
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:52.800]   lot of it has to do with standardization. I mean, one of the, one of the, you know, when you're that
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:57.280]   leader and you're, and you have a lot of people using your, your software, it's easier to make,
[00:59:57.280 --> 01:00:01.680]   you have more developers, you have more cases, you have more, you know, all of these other things.
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:06.640]   And, and that is a, you know, a factor that affects all of your sales. And so I think it is
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:11.120]   important that they find a way to, I mean, for Apple, it is important for them to find their way
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:16.800]   into that market to make sure that it doesn't, you know, dilute, you know, from, from their perspective.
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:19.760]   I mean, I don't, I don't, I think it's important.
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:26.000]   I think also the elephant, it's not the elephant delivery, that's a wrong cliche. But the, the sort
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:32.400]   of unappreciated factor in all of these seven inch, or they're about tablets,
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:38.560]   is the children's market. And I wrote a column about this recently. Both the Android space and
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:45.040]   the, and Apple are going to be going after kids. I think that the little tablets, and not just
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:48.800]   kids, not just kids at home, kids at school. I mean, the thing is, I think that I think the
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:53.680]   school market is a, is a massive market for Apple. And I think that they got that exactly right. And,
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:59.200]   and they, I talked to educators about this, and they won't send kids out the door with a $500
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:03.840]   iPad that they're going to get mugged over. It's a very desirable consumer electronics device.
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:08.800]   And it's just a safety issue for the kids. That's interesting. A $52 device is something, you know,
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:12.160]   and they're going to get discounts. School districts going to be buying, you know, 3,000 of these
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:16.000]   things. They're going to, they're going to, the price is going to be $175 or whatever. And,
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.800]   and they're going to be happy to put those in kids' backpacks and send them out the front.
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:25.440]   I mean, $199 seven inch iPad is Apple's O.L. PC. I mean, it's, it's, I mean, that's,
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:29.440]   that's what they're doing. We, when we, when author came out, we kind of talked about that,
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:34.160]   we said, Hey, that's a great start. But what, but how, okay, so you're going to have textbook
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:38.800]   authoring, blah, blah, blah, but you got to have a low price product. Just put that into everybody's
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:42.480]   hands because most schools are not going to spend 500 bucks minimum. And this is the time,
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:45.360]   because all the schools are trying to figure out what, I mean, we, we deal with a lot of
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.080]   schools trying to figure out where curriculum is going to go over the next 10 years. Everyone
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:52.560]   knows that it's broken. Everybody, I mean, we're now like past the, do we keep it the same or not?
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:55.200]   This is the time that we're going to change it. So a lot of schools are going to make the decision
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:59.200]   over the next 10 years, how they move technology into the classroom. And this is Apple's chance
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:03.440]   to do it or, and Roy's chance to do it. And I think that Apple's better positioned, but if they
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:08.480]   don't find a better, a better price point, it'll be an answer. I never thought about the education.
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:11.600]   We're talking, that's a really good point. Hundreds of billions of dollars.
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.640]   We're not talking about little numbers. And it's, and it's the key to their publishing
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:17.920]   dominance. It is. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, thank you.
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:23.200]   I have to think, I have to think that at some point when Apple went into Pearson and
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:27.280]   McGraw Hill and all of these textbook publishers, they said, you know, we're going to make an
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:32.480]   iBook author, but you might also want to know we're going to make a device for schools, right,
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:36.400]   that will make it more affordable. I think that's a, that's the missing piece, isn't it? We said
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:40.480]   that during the announcement. I mean, coming out in the fall, it isn't, it isn't the right sale time.
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:43.920]   I mean, the time to do it, if they were trying to sell it into this year would have been now,
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:48.080]   in the first May, April or May. But, but you're right, my kids schools already made that buying
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:52.320]   decision for freshmen long ago. But what it does is it sets it up so that they're having a 2013
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:56.160]   conversation with something that's matured and successful. D. Flores says something interesting
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:01.280]   in the chat room. Why do you think Apple went back to E-Pete? Because many school districts
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:05.200]   require recyclable. But those aren't going to be recyclable. I mean, it'll be, that's true.
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:08.240]   They won't be E-Pete. They'll never make it. They'll never, never get a E-Pete. Yeah.
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:13.840]   So the other, the other sort of free-floating question that I was having, especially when I
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:21.760]   was looking at the Nexus 7 pad, is would Apple screw up a mini iPad? The Google had really nothing
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:25.760]   to lose when they were putting the feature in, and ASOS when they were just putting the features
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:30.560]   into the smaller pad. So much so that there's very little, this little tablet can't do. It really
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:33.680]   is a full feeling. You know, and there's an interesting thing for recyclability. You could
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:38.640]   pry the back off of that and detach the battery. It's got a removable, replaceable battery. You
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:43.200]   could detach a lot of it. That one is not glued down. That's kind of interesting.
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:49.360]   So what, so there's that. There's also, I don't feel as though this is a chilling concern, but
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:55.280]   would Apple do that sort of really horrible like person in a black t-shirt? Yes, a white
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:04:01.360]   background speaking through Tented Fingers saying, "We reconceive the tablet for the 7-inch form.
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:06.480]   There is no on-screen keyboard because you do everything via voice. There is no Wi-Fi because
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:11.040]   it's all near field communications instead." Like, yeah, but that tablet sucks. You just
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:14.880]   subscribe. Why didn't you just build an iPad that's smaller? We've been asking for an iPad
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:19.280]   that's smaller. You're welcome customers. No, no, don't take your fingers. That's why you didn't make
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:27.440]   this a function. I want to be able to use. I work on this. And he's on a roll. We're going to take
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:32.960]   a break. We've got more coming up. Andy and Ico, Mike Elgin, Alex Lindsey. We got picks. We got tips.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.920]   Leila Porte. But first, I got to tell you, I'm so excited the new Squarespace is here.
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:46.480]   Squarespace is here. We've been waiting for it for some time. And they have shipped. And I got
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:53.280]   to tell you, this is a huge revolution. Everything you need to create an exceptional website,
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:59.040]   plus a free trial that requires no credit card that makes it so easy to take advantage of
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:03.440]   these new features. Things like their new responsive design. This is the state of the art
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:09.200]   in web design. That's for you. Yeah, site now, you don't have a separate mobile site. That's so
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:17.520]   1999. You have one site that works on all platforms, whatever the size, the ease. And one of the ways
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:22.960]   they do this is they process every image into multiple sizes automatically for you, so that when
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:29.360]   you resize the device, resize the page on a different device, you get the best image size for that
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:36.480]   device. It's so slick. This is all automatic, by the way, for a blog, for a photo portfolio,
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:42.240]   for an art portfolio, for e-commerce, it couldn't be easier to set up a page, drag and drop,
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:47.600]   to make everything work. If you know CSS, of course, this guy is the limit, but you don't have to,
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:52.560]   to completely redesign that page to make it work. There are importers from Tumblr, WordPress,
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:56.320]   and Blogger mean that you don't have to, when you try this new site, you just get all your data
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:02.320]   over, including all the links, all the SEO, all the comments. You could post directly from the web,
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:07.600]   or with their great Android and iPad and iPhone apps, it's not only let you post,
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:14.080]   look at this, how they integrate the maps in, isn't that sweet? But also, let you do stats.
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:18.560]   Well, the great thing is, is that it's super easy to update and work with, and if you're geeky,
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:23.520]   and you want to add a lot of customization, you can do that too. So it's not, it's not limited to
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:27.440]   only what you can do with the WYSIWYG. You can, you can actually, you know, we have a lot of custom
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:31.600]   code, e-commerce, everything else built into, into both the DeGrawaj and Pixelcore, and those
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:36.240]   are both sitting on Squarespace. Now you may be concerned, the new Squarespace 6, how do I use it?
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:42.480]   They've got workshops.squarespace.com, webinars for everybody free interactive classes,
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:48.000]   so that you can learn all about this. I got to tell you, this is the time to go to squarespace.com.

[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:32.640]   and of course for the best savings, do the annual plan. They have not, for all these new features,
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:39.120]   they have not increased the price. It's still a remarkable $16 a month when you buy an annual
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:44.320]   plan for the full unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage, unlimited pages, galleries, and blogs,
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:49.120]   unlimited contributors. This is really a good deal. They do have an $8 a month plan, and there's,
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:53.040]   if you build month to month, you can go to $10 a month. So they have a variety of plans to fit
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:57.440]   your needs. A lot of people do Squarespace for one-off sites because you can do that inexpensively.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:03.600]   But even for a site that is gonna generate a lot of traffic, this is the best deal out there.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:09.120]   16 bucks for hosting and the best content software. I just love it. Squarespace.com,
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:13.120]   please, when you decide to buy, you don't need this for the free trial. You don't need anything

[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:25.280]   Mac Break 7 as the offer code, and you could try Squarespace 6. Brand new. It is so sweet.
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:32.880]   It is so nice. They've done such a good job. Back to Mac Break Weekly, Amazon to introduce
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:39.680]   five or six new tablets, including, according to Staples, a 10-inch. Something directly head-to-head
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:44.880]   with the iPad. Five or six, really? So let's see. So the current one is like seven inches. So that's
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:52.800]   seven, eight inches, nine inches, 10 inches, and 11 inches. And then the A5 model for the UK market,
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:58.400]   a 14-inch model for the legal market. This is coming from the president of US Retail at Staples,
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:04.720]   Demos Parneros. He told Reuters, Amazon set to introduce, I'm sorry, five or six new tablets
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:08.320]   cues with at least one of them sporting a 10-inch screen. I don't know.
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:13.600]   Yeah. I think they're talking about different capacities, maybe a refresh version of the original
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:18.720]   one, and then a larger one, each with different capacities, or maybe one has a free smart cover
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:24.160]   with it and not. They'll have like half of them will have mobile broadband, or there may be a
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:28.240]   phone or two in there too. Yeah, why not? Just throw everything against the wall.
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:31.840]   I think that a lot of these manufacturers aren't real. I mean, like when you go to CES and there's
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:36.320]   a whole section that's committed to iPhone and iPad accessories, the reason they can do that is
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:40.000]   because there's only a couple sizes. You know, there's only a couple form factors. I was talking
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.520]   to someone about like, why don't you make these for Android? You know, whatever. They said there's
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:46.960]   too many different ones and they changed too quickly. And with Apple, we know it's going to go
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:53.760]   be there for a year. Who cares about accessories? That's not who cares. Really? Okay. I have cases and...
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.280]   I know, because you're an iPhone guy and the iPhone hasn't changed in
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:02.240]   two, four years. So you can get lots of accessories. I don't think the world is looking
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:06.640]   to decide what phone they can get based on what case availability. But it definitely improves.
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:10.240]   I'm not saying that they make the decision. I think it's a great thing. No, they make the decision
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:15.600]   that way, but it improves the quality of life that you have with it. Having all those... I think so.
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:19.600]   Well, you have a case. I have a case on this. I don't have a case on my Android phone because
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:24.880]   they don't make it. And I don't need one. Dang it. Point set.
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:31.040]   I mean, obviously Amazon is not a consumer electronics company. They want a show-rooming
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:36.080]   device. That's all they want. They want something you can do. It's for selling Amazon goods.
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:43.040]   Exactly. Mike Elgin says, who is this Mike Elgin? Microsoft has more taste than Apple?
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:51.920]   Yep. Defend yourself, Elgin. Well, the reason I wrote this is as we all know that in
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:57.280]   Pirates of Not Pirates Silicon Valley, the other the PBS Special. Triumph of the Nerds.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:03.600]   Triumph of the Nerds. Steve Jobs very famously said, Microsoft has no taste.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:09.120]   They said Bill Gates has no taste. It was very personal. Yeah, be okay, right. And he said,
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:13.760]   you know, I don't mean it in a small way. I mean, in a big way. They don't... They're not artists.
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:18.720]   Like we are. They're just a bunch of geeky engineers. His implication was they have bad taste.
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:23.200]   The only time that they ever get good taste do things like proportional space fonts and stuff
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:27.600]   like that is when they copy us, the people who have good taste. So he made a big deal about
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:35.120]   contrast. And you know, this is like, this is beautiful reality distortion field, Steve Jobs.
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:43.200]   I mean, that idea that Microsoft has no taste and Apple has taste is baked into everyone's thinking
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:49.200]   about... We all bought it. Absolutely. We still do. We still... It's still colors. And partly,
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:56.960]   it helps that it's kind of true. Broadly speaking. Yes. But it just occurred to me that there's an
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:02.560]   aspect of Windows 8 and Windows Phone that if you look at what they're doing, what they're trying
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:05.840]   to do, whether you like it or not is an entirely different issue. But what they're trying to do
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:12.960]   is something that is spectacularly good taste. They base the entire look and feel of the Metro UI.
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:21.600]   On Swiss Rail signage, it's based on typography as opposed to gevish,
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:28.720]   you know, imagery. Meanwhile, Apple is doing something that technically is very bad taste,
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:34.240]   which is skewomorphic design. The idea that when you get the iPod, the podcast app,
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:39.120]   or example, I don't know if you've played with this. Yeah, we've shown this. It's not a very good
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:45.040]   app. It's very buggy, unfortunately. It's not as feature-rich as many of the apps that are available
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:50.960]   for iOS. But it has this tape record, has a real, real tape that actually plays when you're playing a
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:56.480]   podcast. And it's... You know, people say, "Well, I like it." Well, whether you like it or not,
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:02.080]   it's skewomorphic design. Skewomorphic design comes from somewhere. Like in the same way that
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:05.600]   you said proportionally spaced fonts come from somewhere. They come from beautiful books and
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:10.560]   typography. Well, skewomorphic design comes from somewhere. It comes from huxter, huxters,
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:15.760]   selling you shoddy goods that are gussied up to look like the quality goods that you actually
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:22.640]   want to buy. And if you look at skewomorphic design on Wikipedia or any other site,
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:28.640]   they'll give lots of examples, many, many examples of kind of things that represent other things.
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:38.160]   Leather grain plastic, for instance. Or leather grain apps, which is one of the big themes.
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:41.840]   If you look at Find My Friends, which I think is one of the most egregious examples,
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:46.560]   here's something that's not a digital version of something analog and familiar.
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:53.440]   There was no analog equivalent to be able to use satellites to find out where your spouse
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:59.840]   and your kids are. But they decided to encase it in not just leather, but it looks like a
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:06.240]   wall. It's horrible. It's not even good leather. It's cheesy. It's arbitrary. Not only is the
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:12.400]   application of design arbitrary, the application of the concept is arbitrary. Some apple apps
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:19.520]   are skewomorphic. Some aren't. The ones that are skewomorphic vary in their aesthetic approach.
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:26.640]   This looks like this looks like this is Find My Friends. It looks like gimp. It looks like
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.680]   there's leather stitching. It's bad leather. It's not even good leather. It's like,
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:36.880]   it couldn't be cheesier. It's not for sure where it started.
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:42.080]   Yeah. And a lot of people say, "Look at that. There's an example. Yeah. There's that big,
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:45.440]   you can't even buy a ribbon mic like that anymore."
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:49.200]   Yeah. And I have to wonder why the dialer app doesn't have a rotary dial. I mean,
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:53.520]   if you're going to go that far. But I don't know. I admire the detail. For instance,
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:59.200]   the tape reels as you play the podcast, it gets bigger on the right and small on the left and
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:02.800]   slows down appropriately. I mean, somebody spent hours.
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:10.000]   But why would they put that? Here's why it gets me on the voice memo app. You said after
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.120]   waking up his phone again, that when you're recording like a lecture or something,
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:20.720]   the thing you want more than anything else is some visual indication that, yes, it is recording.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:25.840]   So if there's one app in which I would love to see two real-to-reels actually spinning,
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:29.600]   it's moving on this lap. I said they give you this lovely like rendered photo that takes up
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:33.360]   four-fifths of the year. It doesn't move. And that is a good point. The other issue is that
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:39.520]   it takes up so much space as you point out, Andy. I mean, almost all of the UI on podcast app on
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:43.680]   the iPad is something that's completely non-functional. I think part of that is-
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:46.880]   It's not non-functional. I should point something out.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:54.480]   Okay, let's see the mic. You're zooming in. You can do one thing. If you tap on the mic,
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:59.040]   it actually VU meter actually does something. Oh, I've never seen that. That's kind of funny.
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:03.120]   That's excessive skeuomorphism. I mean, it's well-
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:07.360]   So something like- There's no point to it. Yeah, they're skillful at it. I'm not saying they're
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:12.400]   not skillful in detail. But here's the other. Here's the final irony in all of this,
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:19.520]   which is that Apple's famous for its design mostly for its hardware, Apple hardware,
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:24.320]   especially nowadays. If you look at the MacBook Air, if you look at the iPhone,
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:29.360]   if you look at the iMac, these are beautiful, beautiful devices. I mean, just from an industrial
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:34.960]   design point of view, they're absolutely gorgeous. And they come from someplace too. They come from
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:42.000]   a European minimalism, a Bauhaus kind of European minimalism, which ironically is exactly the origins
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:48.240]   of Microsoft's design for Metro and Windows 8. I can't disagree with you. I have to say,
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:55.760]   there's a certain anodyne simplicity to the Metro interface. There's no shadows. There's no rounded
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:17:02.320]   corners. It's not 3D. It's flat. And it's clearly and intentionally an antidote to what the
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:06.400]   skeuomorphism of Apple. And by the way, the skeuomorphism is, I think, pretty new with Apple. I remember
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:10.960]   the early Mac. I didn't have a lot of it. I mean, they did it initially because they wanted it,
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:17.040]   for instance, folders and pages, you know, in the little corners and stuff, were to tell you,
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:22.080]   this is a document, this is a folder within which, and that I think was necessary in the early days
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:28.080]   of the system. There's an immersive quality to it though. I mean, I used to be a long time ago
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:33.440]   in another life. I was an interface designer. Okay, good. So you're standing here. And all I
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:39.680]   did was skeuomorphic. So that was in movies, right? No, no, no. This is for software. This is
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:44.560]   Broderbund. And there's an immersive quality to Costco shopping carts.
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:50.080]   Yeah, well, I mean, I'm just saying that the, you know, and I built all of them in 3D. I mean,
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:57.440]   so they literally, every button was rendered. But taste is, by the way, a definition, a subjective
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:01.440]   thing. We did a ton of tests though. And so the thing is, is that there was a long, there was a
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:06.080]   big discussion about this 20 years ago, or whatever, 15 years ago, when I was doing the interface
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:13.920]   design, about we showed target audiences, you know, things that felt like an interface that
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:18.000]   looked like you could touch it. And it was a real thing. And then one that was all text and
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:23.360]   much more, not quite Windows 8, but I mean, very similar to that look. And it was like,
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:26.720]   eight out of 10, one of the one that looked like pictures, like one of the look like
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:30.240]   something like a physical thing they could touch. So it was, it was, it was, it was something
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:34.000]   people want. It was, it was, it was clean. I mean, you can decide whether eight out of 10 people
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.320]   have bad taste. But I'm just saying that from a pure consumer perspective, we did a ton of testing
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:43.600]   on it. And it was, it was clear. I mean, it wasn't, it wasn't like close. It wasn't like what,
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:47.120]   what do they actually want now? What I will say is I will agree with you that a lot of the stitching
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:52.000]   and stuff like that. I don't like it. But I'm just saying that it is a very successful model for,
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.320]   a little Baroque, but it's a very successful model for interfaces. And the, what I wish they'd
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:59.120]   spend a little more time on is actually making sure the podcast one, for instance, that you're
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:03.920]   using in the article actually worked. And also the, the, the, like, just, just to pick
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:08.960]   at that a little bit is that, is that like the, the going fast goes too fast. Like you need one
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:12.640]   notch in between, you know, because you know, it's, it's one of those things. But so that, you know,
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:16.480]   that I think that that that, that, that, and I think the reason Apple uses a lot of this is because
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:19.120]   they don't want to put a lot of buttons in. They want to keep it simple. They don't want to give
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:23.120]   you every option like me. I want, I want to have this different kind of skid morphism for instance.
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:26.640]   I like it. But I think they use it up by creating a design to use it up. They just, they're just
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:30.640]   using up the blank space with something that looks cool because they don't want to give you any more
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:36.560]   buttons. I think it's, I think it makes sense, for instance, to have a turtle and a tortoise,
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:40.080]   perhaps on either side of the dial. I think you make an argument for that, that those,
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:45.360]   that's iconography that makes it easy to understand. But I don't know. I don't, I don't, I think the
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:49.840]   real to real is what's crashing it. That's the problem. The real to real is, it's not even a
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:55.360]   metaphor that people in the digital age can identify with. I mean, you might as well have a rotary dial.
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:20:01.040]   I miss my real to real. This is a big issue with icons because skeo morphism is, is kind of good
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.920]   for icons because you need some symbol that needs something to some.
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:09.600]   But now, but it's, you're kind of, there's a disconnect now because the icon for save is always
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:13.280]   a discount. And there were kids who don't have any idea what that is. That's a good point too.
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:15.680]   What the hell is that? Disget thing.
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:21.360]   Anyway, I'm trying, you know, Chinese characters used to be pictures. So, you know,
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:25.760]   picture grams make sense. Picture grams make sense and then they modify. They just slowly
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:28.240]   turn to something that's a very good point. Isn't that anymore? If you look at the Chinese
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:34.560]   character for man, you could see where it was a human. And then for woman, it actually has a little
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:39.280]   pregnant belly on it. Well, I like the, I think if I remember correctly, like the Japanese character,
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:44.000]   Chinese symbol for patience is a knife on the heart, which is, you know, it's like, you know,
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.400]   it's a, but I mean, it's like, it's like, that's it. But I find that that picture is very interesting.
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:52.160]   You know, I believe someone's going to correct me.
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:55.120]   So I think we should move along. Yep.
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:59.440]   You make your point and I'm glad you made that point. And I have to say, I've been
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:04.080]   complaining about skeuomorphism as it has gotten more and for some reason, Apple's made some
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:07.840]   decision at some point to get really aggressive in it. When we worked on interfaces, when we worked
[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:12.960]   on when I worked on interfaces, it came up every single every single title. There'd be a discussion
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:17.040]   about whether we make them look physical or whether we make them abstract. And so then we'd go do a
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:20.560]   bunch of whole bunch more tests and maybe it'd be different now, but it was like, but it would
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:25.520]   be do a bunch of more testing. People were just clearly felt basically they had a warmer relationship
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:29.760]   with with something that it felt like they were immersed into rather than, you know, you know,
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:33.440]   that then just something it made the device or made the interface feel cold.
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:38.080]   I think a little bit about this in in terms of the design of our video.
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:43.840]   And one of the things that I think a lot of technology shows do is they look modern and brush
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:50.960]   steel and and very polished. And we try to make this homey and warm. So we use warmer colors.
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:56.000]   We use retro steam punky kind of looks like the gear. The gear is there's nothing more
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:01.280]   analog than this gear behind my head. That is an analog very analog device. So in a way, we
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:06.960]   do skew morphism in in the in the design. I mean, look at this chair. This chair is that I'm sitting
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:14.080]   in his is aircraft. I mean, there's no reason for it to be an aircraft wing. Right. But that's what
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:19.280]   it is hammered hammered aluminum behind me. And all creates an experience. It creates an experience
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:24.400]   and it's supposed to make people feel more at home or homey, not so put off by the coldness of
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:29.360]   technology. I mean, that's my thinking. So maybe I'm skew morphic. Maybe I'm maybe that's what I do
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:33.040]   to that, but that's not that's not really what's I mean, I don't think that's quite what skew
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:37.520]   morphism is you're not rep you're not pretending that something is what it is. Well, it's not a gear,
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:39.680]   right. And I'm not riding an airplane wing.
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:46.560]   Well, I mean, well, it's different when you have like, again, came back when you say that
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:50.800]   using a turtle and a hair, a tortoise and a hair, people understand that it's doing fast and slow.
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:55.520]   It's not like you're saying just just as you wouldn't real life, you grab on to a to an animal
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:23:00.240]   and drag them. But that's not exactly that's not exactly. That's not exactly. Because
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:06.080]   real real players don't have tortoise, tortoise's hairs. They have the they have the real part of
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:09.920]   it is the skew morphic part. That's just good iconography. And I like that tortoise.
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:17.760]   Tortoise, exactly. I agree. I think we've already done our OS 10 tip, which is how to get ready for
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:24.080]   tomorrow's mountain lion release. Let's say Andy, you have some other OS 10 typology.
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:28.000]   Uh, I have a tip for that making I can say for next week.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:34.000]   Well, no, let's. Although, okay, well, actually, it might be a tip that's kind of set to expire
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:41.520]   because you bet now then. Yeah, exactly. You know that a lot that so many of the previous
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:49.680]   that Apple is has basically raised, uh, I work.com and mobile me.com to the ground,
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:54.560]   pulled the buildings down, plowed up crops, poured salt into the fields that would never grow again.
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:59.760]   All that sort of stuff that you remember from classical history. Um, but however, some of their
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:04.640]   leavings, uh, archeologically are left behind inside system preferences. If you look at system
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:09.200]   preferences, you can still see a panel for mobile me for instance. Um, there are two, if you don't
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:15.440]   like that or if you don't like that, you can dive into the library directory and physically remove
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:20.240]   that plugin, but that's really not necessary because there is actually a mechanism built in so
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:24.560]   that you can actually hide any system preference panel that you don't actually want to be able
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:31.200]   want to look at. If you just, you actually, here's two tips because you also forget because since you
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:35.920]   do most of your clicking inside the system preferences window directly, system preferences is actually
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:42.560]   an application with a menu. So what you can actually do is go into the view menu, click on
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:48.560]   customize and suddenly every single one of those system preference icons now has a checkbox next
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:53.440]   to it next to it. So if you just, so if you just uncheck the one next to mobile me, uh, and then
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:57.760]   click on the done button, then it will just simply disappear. It'll still be there,
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:02.560]   installed, but you will never see it again. And if you ever need to see all the ones that you have
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:07.360]   disabled, excuse me, but you have, uh, hidden away, they're all still available in the view I come
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:13.840]   on. How long has this been in there? Holy cow. Look at that. I could just uncheck. I don't need flash
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:20.640]   player control panel wasting my time. Wow. I don't need to software update control panel in my
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:27.440]   control panel. Wow. This is cool. Time machine go away. Now I can still access it. How?
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:32.240]   There's still there in the view menu. Okay. So that if you ever want to get at it, it's still
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:35.920]   still going to be right there because I spent a lot of time scanning this trying to remember
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:39.840]   where network settings are, things like that. So take out the stuff you don't use. I don't need
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:46.560]   mobile me anymore. This is great. Andy also, also you'll find that if after you just after you
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:52.320]   uncheck it, it disappears. If you ever ask for that again, if you go to view, customize,
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:56.640]   mobile me will reappear unchecked. So you can simply check it back again. But again,
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:59.920]   that we're talking about mobile me as an example, but this will work with anything that you've got.
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:05.040]   If you need to streamline your system, perhaps, particularly if you're in the family tech support
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:11.120]   guy and you want to see that's only I want only the system preferences that my cousin, my uncle,
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:15.840]   my mom will ever have to deal with. I don't want them to mess with the users and groups. I don't
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:20.240]   want them to have to ever mess with speech, time machine, the startup disk, or software update.
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:24.480]   I will just limit them to five. They can change the desktop pattern. They can change the volume
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:28.560]   and that's it. So that's another good reason to do this. That's great. That's a
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:32.560]   cool watch. They'll take it out in Mountain Lion. Now that I finally after how many years
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:36.560]   you told me about this, this is great. That's a that's a I could have had a V8 moment.
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:42.160]   Very nice. Thank you, Andy. I'm glad you didn't save that.
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:47.600]   Because you're right. We don't know what's going to happen. Well, he knows, but he won't talk.
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:52.480]   Alex Lindsay, do you have an iOS tip you would like to you don't have to. I do. You're giving me
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:57.920]   a funny look. No, no, I don't want to. What is it? It's just the charger. That's the iPad charger,
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:02.160]   the 10 watt charger. So here's the tip is you were actually discussing this with the Vorek
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:08.720]   on Sunday. So it's good tip. So here's the tip is is that the Vorek was was
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:14.880]   here. It took all day. It took all day. It takes like a week to charge that thing.
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:23.840]   So anyway, so so the the am amperage coming out of your laptop and your iPhone charger is much
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:29.520]   smaller than your iPad charger. And so if you use, you know, if you're going to charge your iPad,
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:34.720]   it's kind of hard to see this tiny letters. If you're going to choose your if you're going to
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:39.760]   charge your iPad, you always want to use your iPad charger and your iPhone charger. Your iPhone
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:43.680]   I find will charge a lot faster on it. Can I extend the tip a little bit? Go through because
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:49.760]   we all have now a bunch of USB chargers, right? All kinds, right? Look at the charger and look at
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:56.240]   how many volts and how many amps on the charger and and and watts. Well, volts, volt times amps
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:28:02.400]   is Watts. So this is five volts at two amps, which is 10 watts. Right. And but the truth is,
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:06.320]   many things will charge faster. Everything. So the thing is, is that you throw away all of
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:10.000]   those other USB chargers that you have. I have a ton of chargers that they have five volts,
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:15.360]   point zero amps, point zero eight amps, something like that. I mean, so what I do is I bought actually
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:19.200]   a bunch of these now you can also get great because they're two they're two amps. Right. And
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:25.200]   what I also have the plug bug. Yes. You know, that goes on your amps is you know, so that one
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:29.360]   has a lot more juice to as well. So you can use a plug bug, which I think I have. This is this
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:34.720]   is I just realized this and I went through my doors and I have hundreds of USB chargers. And
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:40.000]   I you don't want the ones that are, you know, 800 milliamps times five volts because it's going
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:45.520]   to take you twice as long or more to charge your stuff. So it so it's really important that you
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:49.280]   and you can it'll charge your mophies faster. It'll charge like everything faster. So you want to
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:53.360]   use that. And then my second little travel tip is a good tip to see this guy. What's that?
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:58.160]   Oh, it's pretty. So I it's a pocket Wi-Fi. So I got that in Australia. Pretty much whenever I go
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:03.440]   somewhere anywhere I any new country that I go to, I buy one of these because it's a lot cheaper
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:09.360]   than paying international rates. So that's a 10 dot com. That's your that's your that is your
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:13.600]   Wi-Fi. And I haven't a lot of them. Some of them you can change the SIM cards and some of them you
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:17.200]   you can't. So and they're not very they're usually not that expensive. But the main thing is is that
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:22.800]   is that I just turn that on. I paired up and then I'm using, you know, then I can make phone calls,
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:27.760]   you know, using any any Wi-Fi service and surf it. But you know, getting one of those when you go
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:33.040]   traveling, I do a lot of that out of country is that it really saves you, I mean, hundreds of
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:35.600]   dollars, sometimes thousands of dollars. You might go get how do you like the
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:40.240]   scumorphic design of this backdrop on this close up shot, isn't that? It looks like real wood.
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:52.240]   And realism. Anyway, so these are great. Everybody should. Yeah, my fives. Now, how about in Greece?
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:56.560]   What's your experience in Greece? Are you able to buy Sims and things like that to put in your
[01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:01.600]   iPhone? What do you do there, Mike? I haven't started yet. I've been here less than a week and
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:05.840]   I've been too lazy to go to go investigate it. But yeah, that's basically the
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:13.440]   the plan. And I need to I need to be grilling everybody. But nowadays, I'm what I understand is
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:19.120]   that that's really what you do. You go get a SIM card, you negotiate for a good rate and, you know,
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:23.520]   take it from there. Sarah Lane had great results in England. There's a company called Three
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:30.160]   that has very 15 euros, I think, for a month of unlimited data. Unlimited data, yeah.
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:35.200]   So you absolutely and she put that in her iPhone and she has phone. Now, the problem is you lose
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:42.160]   your US number, but you can always forward that to the the that's another trick is if you have a
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:48.480]   Google voice number as I do, I'm actually getting calls, which I didn't expect when I'm on a Wi-Fi
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:53.920]   network. I had read that you can't do that. Yeah. That what you can do is you can get voicemail
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:57.840]   and you can do texting via Google voice, but not receive calls, but I'm receiving calls.
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:04.800]   And you can associate also your Google voice number with Skype. So that's one of the advantage
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:09.440]   of using Google voice. That same number applies when you're trapped. Yeah. Sorry, I forgot to
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:13.760]   I forgot to do that when I was in Australia. I didn't say a lot of my mate with my Google voice.
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:18.080]   Well, the other thing is, is that my in Australia, they have a phone that is not it's like 2G.
[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:23.600]   It's like a cheap little phone, but it's it's $1 a call to the United States. Oh, no matter how
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:27.520]   a minute up to 10 hours. But all right. I say like, yeah, it's like,
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:32.480]   the photo call, I just walked I just walked up in the airport and bought it. And they said,
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:36.240]   Oh, I said, well, how much is the international rate? And he said, you should use this for your
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:40.880]   international calls. $1 dollar. It went on. It was a $1 trillion. It's at the to boots. Yeah.
[01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:46.400]   Wow. It's a dollar. The question I want to ask is that if you were to hook if you were to like
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:51.600]   wire in an acoustic coupler and use that to do a dial up into America online, could you get like
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:54.720]   10 hours? Like all day of internet access at like 1200.
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:32:01.520]   Bet you you could. But I don't know if you want to. I mean, I'll see if there's an
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:07.200]   instructive was about that for $1 for like 18 hours of international data access. You can't
[01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:12.640]   meet that. I am so I'm so gonna test that. I'm so gonna test that next year to Tumblr.
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:20.640]   Yeah. I am so I am whatever I travel in my briefcase. I keep a 300 bud coupler. You never know.
[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:27.680]   That's actually I really want to also I have an uncle who used to work for Boston Edison. He let
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:32.080]   me have his his climbing spurs was retired. So I can patch you had to pretty much anywhere you
[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:40.880]   want to do it in the world. If you've got a pole, I could climb it. Anyway, anyway, moving along.
[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:46.000]   So there was our iOS tip. By the way, Andy already on Twitter, they're going crazy. Ray says that
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:54.640]   is the tip of the year. Whoa. Doing this now. Thank you, Andy. The tip of the year. Wow.
[01:32:54.640 --> 01:33:00.960]   I love to serve. The thing is I deserve no thanks because I know no other way
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:07.760]   to be charitable and giving with my knowledge. You're very Zen. Thank you. Yes. He's a Zen master.
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:14.400]   Mr. Miyagi of this show. Let us get our picks of the week. Mike Allen. Do you want to do a pick?
[01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:22.320]   I know you're in Greece. Yeah. Okay. I have a wonderful thing from Europe, sort of. It's from the UK.
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:28.400]   It's an app called Chirp. And I recommend that everybody download it as I blather about it. It's a
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:35.840]   five person company called Animal Systems. And they have a delightful way to transfer data to and
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:42.400]   they do it by sound. I read about this. It sounds like birds. Here's let me show you what it sounds
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:51.360]   like. So this is a basically this is a picture of a dog. And if there were other Chirp users in the
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:59.760]   room, I would simply push this button. I don't know if you heard that. And the sound would actually
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:04.960]   convey the link. Wait a minute. Let's try it. Do I need to have Chirp running on my phone for that
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:10.800]   to work? Yes. Okay. So let's all install everybody at home. I'm going to give you a moment to install
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:16.320]   Chirp. Let's see if we can all this is like an audio QR code. This is awesome. Yeah. Yeah. It's an
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:22.880]   audio QR code. Audio. No, I think what you're trying to do is try to make sure that this app is
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:27.200]   not downloadable by anybody across the entire planet. We're going to bring that. No, Apple's got servers.
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:32.480]   They got servers. Let's see it. Let's see. Why you download it? I'm going to get a picture that you
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:37.520]   want to send everybody in the Mac. Wait, which company? Which I do. I have a trip.io. It's a it's
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:42.320]   a yellow icon. Looks like a little bird with a it's a dot V dot on the icon because there's a
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:47.520]   bunch of Chirp apps. So I'm going to launch Chirp right now. I got Chirp launching. Okay.
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:53.520]   Running. Okay. Now everybody everybody run your Chirp. Turn up the studio sound really loud. So
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:59.280]   what's that? Go away. Just leave it there. That'll it's like a it's like Twitter.
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:05.680]   It gives you a social stream. Oh, it's hearing. Go ahead. See it's hearing it.
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:13.600]   That sounds like R2 D2. Look, I'm getting the picture. It worked. I got a dog all the way from
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:20.960]   Greece. That's probably the first international Chirp. That is so cool. So it's the audio that does
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:25.760]   it. All right. Now everybody, I'm going to chirp that to you. Let's hand off the dog. I'm going to
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:29.680]   turn on my sound and I'll chirp this down the microphone and everybody can have your dog.
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:34.080]   Hang on. Waiting. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. That was an aborted Chirp. Also,
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:38.080]   I shouldn't have talked over your Chirp. My apologies. No. Well, just tell us when you're ready, Andy.
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:42.560]   This is so cool. This is going to be a transcontinental Chirp.
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:50.000]   Okay. Everybody everybody in the studio is firing up Chirp. This is iPad 2 or just iPhone.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:57.440]   This is this iOS iOS. It's free. All iOS devices and soon on Android.
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:02.000]   All right. You ready, Andy? Here you go. Everybody quiet in the house. Ready to go.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:15.440]   And there's the dog. It went from Greece to California to Massachusetts in a matter of seconds.
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:19.280]   Thanks to the R2 D2 Chirp. That's like the satellite of love.
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:25.680]   Now, this is, I feel like Marconi for crying out loud. That is super cool.
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:31.280]   And if you think about it, this is actually anonymous. You can exchange data and pictures
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:35.680]   with people without ever knowing their phone number. That's nobody knows anybody's phone number.
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:42.160]   You can do it. Did anybody in the audience get the dog? Look, look, and they're from Germany.
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:51.600]   So that's almost like going to Germany. So it's anonymous. Yeah, it's just the sound. If you
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:55.040]   have the sound, you get the picture or the text. And I'm watching the chat room and
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:57.840]   they've all over the world. They got it from.
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:02.640]   I mean, there's no addressing of text or anything like that. You just push a button.
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:07.440]   Where is this dog picture that we're sending to everybody in the world? Where did it come from?
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:14.160]   My sister's dog, Taya, taken on the beach in Santa Barbara, California. Taya is the
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:21.280]   Leica of the digital era. Okay, let's press. Okay. Quiet one more time.
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:27.040]   I want the chat room. Everybody in the chat room has a picture of Taya now.
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:31.200]   He's not the Leica. He wasn't abandoned to suffocate in orbit.
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:35.680]   He liked the Felix the cat, like that first televised image. Yeah.
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:40.960]   You'll remember this day. That is wild. Screw the moon landing.
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:46.560]   I'm not going to forget where I was. Well, I wasn't born yet, but I never forget where I was when
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:49.760]   the moon would. I'm going to I'm going to chirp something. Wait a minute. What do I have?
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:52.960]   I can chirp. This could be a new feature of the show.
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:38:00.160]   Wow. Our own version of chat roulette. This week in chirp. Trust us.
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:07.280]   No, no, no, what you should do is you should have you can have a radio show that is just a series
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:10.480]   of chirps. And so what you do is you just you literally just turn open your phone and just
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:14.240]   keeps on showing you images. So what kind of media can we send? Is it just pictures, Mike?
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:21.200]   I think it's it's it's basically like Twitter. I think it's 140 characters or last in text and
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:25.520]   pictures on their on their web page. It says share photos, web pages. So I guess you could send
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:30.800]   URLs contacts. So I could send you my contact. Is this supposed to do more than this?
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:37.840]   When you just stuck on the screen? I don't know. You broke it. You broke your chirp, man.
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:44.320]   Um, settings in it for my profile. So you can create an account, but it could be a nice job,
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:49.280]   Mike Ellington. That's Erickson. Whatever your name, Elkin. I just combined Mike Elkin and Mike
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:56.320]   Ellington. And I've made a new person who's who's a very nice a hole. There you go.
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:03.600]   And then you figure out which is which Mike Elkin. Very nice pick. Alex, top that. Oh, you know,
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:08.400]   there's one that I feel like I have to go ahead. Um, some of my pick is field runners too.
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:12.960]   Oh, there's a new one. Don't apologize. That's exciting. I love field runners.
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:16.000]   I'm a little addicted to field runners. You had to give me the field runners way back when
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:21.040]   it's a tower defense. Tower defense. Yeah. That's not tower defense. And obviously,
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:25.120]   what they did is they looked at, you know, they were very successful with the first field runners
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:31.920]   and they obviously had time and money to really design something great. And so they and they did.
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:36.640]   So, um, so it is the first one was free, right? So this is two 99. It's two 99. You know,
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:43.040]   it's two 99. It's already downloaded. It's worth every penny. So the, the maps there. So there was
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:47.280]   only, there was a handful of maps and they were kind of modal. And now there's really a guide and
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:52.720]   and they're the graphics are so much nicer. We crashed the chirp server. That's what happened.
[01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:57.760]   Sorry, everybody at home. That's what happened.
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:04.400]   We cr the folks at chirp are going crazy. Okay. So it'll come back in a second because it all
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:08.320]   goes through their server. Right. And so everybody in the chat room is having your experience,
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:11.360]   which is stuck at the start screen. It'll come back in a minute. That's funny.
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:13.520]   Hey, we're back break. We ruined things for everybody.
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:19.840]   We're aptly named ruining things for everyone. Right. Since 90 or since 2005. Yeah. So the,
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:27.760]   but anyway, some, um, uh, so field runners is, um, you know, so they have every single level is
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:32.640]   a different, is a different design with different challenges. Um, same, same great game, but a new
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:36.560]   field graphics are the graphics and the animation are, are stunning. You, the thing is you have to
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:40.480]   pull back so you can play, but you want to pull up because the new animations that they used and
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:45.840]   everything are just really, really, uh, stunning, you know, and, um, you know, and it's just, it's
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:53.040]   very challenging. There you go. I love field guys. Um, same music. I like that. Because there's a
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:57.440]   certain, you want, you know, a sequel you wanted to, well, you know, they just really, they really
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:02.160]   went through every little piece of this to design it well. And, and, um, you know, a lot of the things
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:06.080]   that I was, you know, you have ways of, you can, you can carpet bomb if you need to. They have,
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:09.920]   what is a rewind item? That's so there's a, you, on some of them, you can, you can load a level
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:13.440]   where you can go back three. Remember you screwed something up. You can go back three levels. Oh,
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:17.120]   that would be nice. Back three turns. Sometimes you make a mistake. Yeah. So you can go back and
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:21.280]   draw it and they have, they have, um, this viral poison that, you know, these little instructions
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:24.800]   so people get an idea of how to get started and be successful. You're the guy who taught me the
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:30.320]   intestine defense. Yes. It's all about the long intestine. So, um, forcing, forcing long months.
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:35.360]   Get them into the shoot, move them around. Um, anyway, then you got to get them into a kill box
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:40.720]   and you're sick. So, wow. And, uh, and they did a good job of, of making sure that you're clear
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:45.280]   that they're all clones. So you don't feel so, so you're showing you there. Showing me the path
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:49.840]   that they'll take. That's new. Yeah. And zoom in on it a little bit. Like just, just, uh, yeah,
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:56.240]   double. Look at how nice the retina, retina baby. Um, but, but also the animations, the, you know,
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:42:04.160]   the, the attention to detail is just really fantastic. So, um, anyway, you know, this is fun.
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:12.400]   This is awesome. Great game. And, uh, I think, I think the progressive nature of it is better so
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:16.320]   that you're much more, they, they're now they're giving away your intestines defense. I know they're
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:18.000]   telling people they're telling people how to do it. Well, they're making everybody successful because
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.200]   that's not, I mean, you want to be successful at the beginning and it gets, I'm still at a couple
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:26.320]   levels where I can't get through it. So, so I'm, um, so there's, uh, they're definitely,
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:30.320]   definitely gets a lot harder quickly. This is fun. That's how games should be easy play. But,
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:36.080]   there's enough levels there that you can really, you know, always find something that'll keep you
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:42.320]   busy. Yeah. And, um, it's a great game. One of the things about it is it's not, it's not modal. I
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:45.920]   mean, it's not a lot of times some of these games will take a long time to play and was great as
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:49.360]   I'll play them for a couple minutes and I just, I, and then I just close it and I come back to it.
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:53.200]   Right. Oh, so I can close it and, like you just close that you can save that game, you hit pause
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:56.400]   and then close it and then you can come back and finish the game later and you don't really have
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:59.040]   to remember anything because it's just level to level. You don't have to remember what, where you
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:04.240]   were or what you were doing before. Like, like you cannot pause scramble because remember what you
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:08.960]   already picked. Fun game. Anyway, it's, it'll keep you busy for a long time. I, I'm really,
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:14.880]   I apologize to everyone for, um, uh, taking what I just did. And I just wasted a lot of your time
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:21.360]   for, but it's great on a flight back from, uh, from, um, Sydney. Yeah. This is what you think
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:24.240]   that was like two hours. This is what you needed in a flight back from Sydney. I could tell you
[01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:26.960]   that right now. Well, my, my battery ran out. I couldn't do any more work. I was like, well,
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:33.520]   I guess I have no choice but to, uh, use to play field winners. Fun game. All right.
[01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:37.360]   Field runners to two 99 available now on the iOS store. Have you played on the iPad? Does they
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:41.040]   have an iPad? I don't think there's an iPad version yet. It's so cool on the iPad. You know,
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:45.760]   you think you'd think so, but you don't really need the iPhone is really where you end up playing
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:52.320]   it. Right. Cause you got that. It's noisy. You want things that blow up good. Andy and
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:57.920]   Ico, your pick of the week, sir. Uh, really awesome GPS app that got released last week,
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:03.280]   got a lot of good press, uh, and became, it's, it's rare you get an app that like you've never heard
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:07.360]   from, never heard about it. Then an hour later, it gets one of the coveted positions on the first
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:12.320]   page of your springboard on your iPhone. Wow. It's called, it's called twist and it's not
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:17.920]   designed to help you get to your destination. It's there to help the people who are waiting for you
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:23.680]   at your destination. Keep a prize of your progress. Uh, and so set one up right.
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:28.720]   That kind of like, um, glimpse reminds me of glimpse, but it's, it's, it's like glimpse,
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:32.080]   but it prosecutes that idea so much more cleanly and so much better. Oh, that's better.
[01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:38.560]   All you got to do is for any trip that you make regularly or even just as a one off,
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:43.920]   just tell the app. It's a free app. Tell the app where you're going. Tell app all the,
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:47.680]   tell the app all the people that you'd like to keep the, like to your meeting there that need
[01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:52.240]   to know, like your progress and then just simply tap that button and that's the last thing you
[01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:56.720]   ever do. Uh, because as soon as you tap, I just love the way that it's a very, very,
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:45:01.840]   it's very, very smartly done. When you tap the button, it sends out text messages to everybody
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:05.520]   on that list. Uh, tell them, okay, you're going to get some messages from me. I'm the
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:09.520]   Twitter server. Andy is about to leave and he's headed for this address. But then you know how
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:13.360]   it is like, you get a phone call on your way out the door. You have to go right back in.
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:17.840]   So it doesn't actually send the second message with the ATA until it can tell everybody,
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:22.480]   okay, Andy is now actually in motion. And now he's just,
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:29.200]   and then like, then like, I was like, Leo is still is digging around at home. Leo, Leo is in
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:33.520]   the front porch. No, he went back in. Leo forgot something. He's back in his bedroom.
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:37.760]   And then like the first, the first time I used it, because I often drive like, like 45 minutes
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:41.760]   away an hour away to like hang out with a friend and buy comic books or the best comic book shop
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:46.160]   in New England. Uh, and then, but then like, Oh, I forgot, I need to get gas when I'm pulling
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:51.280]   over. I got 10 minute, 10 minute, the delay as I'm gassing up because the delay after the
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:56.560]   delay stretches on to 10 minutes, the app suddenly says, Andy has been delayed. Here's a new ETA.
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:00.720]   Then you hit traffic a half hour later, Andy has been further delayed. Here is his ETA. Then
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:06.800]   when you get nearby, it's like Andy is, is, is, is, has arrived his destination. And here is the,
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:11.200]   you know, so glimpse is cool because you can actually sit and watch as the person approaches,
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:17.040]   but that takes a lot of attention. This kind of is more for you, friend, for you, the operator,
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:20.960]   you don't have to do anything. And you just, you launch it and that's it. And then like,
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:25.600]   it works with if you, if you're working with people who actually have the app, they have this really
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:29.920]   cool interactive app they can follow with. But even if they don't, they will just simply get
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:34.320]   text messages that have all this information. And each text message also has this,
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:40.480]   also has actually, when I, since there's people, since maybe the server has recovered by now,
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:44.880]   we can wreck it again. If here's, here's that screenshot behind me right now of what your
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:48.160]   recipient looks like. Three, two, one.
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:58.880]   And each, each one of these messages also has a link to a private release, you know, can't, can't,
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:05.280]   can't be served at randomly web page that will show them here is exactly where you are on the map.
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:09.840]   Here are all the messages that have been sent so far. The app was smart enough to know that the
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:15.360]   outer limits is actually a business. So it looked up the Google Street view of that, of that address
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:20.800]   also got like the Yelp reviews of it, pull up a phone number so that everyone that's waiting for
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:25.600]   you knows where you are, knows where everybody's going. If somebody says, hey, you know, actually,
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:29.280]   now that I think of it, I think that that place is going to be closed by the time he gets here.
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:33.600]   Let's do this place again. Everybody who was on that you put on that list will share that same
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:38.160]   message. But the fact matter is you leave that you press one button, you leave the house and it
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:46.000]   just plain works. And as someone who has to at least three times go back, oh, I guess I will need the
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:52.240]   metal device that you put in the thing in the car and put a torque on it that makes the motor do
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:56.320]   the thing where the wheels, okay, I should go back inside the house and get that thing. Yeah,
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:48:02.080]   I do that three or four times before I leave the house. So I took it out on its first real
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:08.160]   real test. And that was enough to say, okay, I'm sending twists up for everything that I regularly
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:12.400]   go to for the group of groups of friends and people that I normally meet there. And I feel
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:16.400]   as though I will be scow that a lot less when I show up there 12 minutes later than I told
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:20.080]   them I thought I would be just just expire when you reach your destination.
[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:24.400]   When you reach your destination, that's it. It's done. You can also manually abort. Also,
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:29.360]   I didn't mention that you don't have to be driving. It also worked with biking, walking,
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:35.040]   and public transportation. So if you're so if your bus is like 20 minutes late, it knows it
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:39.280]   figures out through Google what route you're going to take. It's not necessarily the most
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:45.120]   accurate map. It's as accurate as most GPS apps will pull it. I think it's getting its data from
[01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:49.280]   Google Maps. So whatever Google directions thinks it's going to take, that's what it's going to be.
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:53.360]   Or at least when I was testing it head to head against a couple of the navigation apps,
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:58.000]   it's initial estimated time of arrival is the same as Google's estimated time of arrival. So I'm
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:01.440]   guessing that at least it's getting a lot of this information from the same places.
[01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:07.200]   This is cool because I can have two different twists for walking and driving. So when I'm driving
[01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:12.640]   to work, you choose a different one than if you're walking to work and it keeps as favorites.
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:17.200]   So that's really, that's really neat. Right. And you can get one set up. So here's my commute home.
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:21.200]   So the so your spouse knows when you're coming home. Here's one for the monthly dinner that you
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:25.520]   have with that group of eight or nine friends. Here's the one for the community office. It's
[01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:29.040]   really well thought out. There's some it's a 1.0. So there's still some places where they can
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:34.720]   refine things. But for now, really, really nicely done. Again, I kind of rely on it already.
[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:39.360]   Very cool. That's called twist. And I am now three for three. I've downloaded chirp.
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:43.760]   I downloaded fear runners to and I've downloaded twist. Let's see if we can go four for four.
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:50.000]   If Leo can come up with an app that everybody wants to download, it'll be a first. I'm ready.
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:54.480]   Are you ready? Actually, this is an old app. You probably already have it, but it's saved my
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:58.960]   butt yesterday and reminded me how good it is. I think you've probably talked about this, Andy.
[01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:06.560]   And it's kind of related. It's called ways. And it is a social GPS app that is not been useful to me
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:11.920]   because I don't commute. But if you commute, this is a must. So yesterday, I was in Los Angeles and
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:17.120]   I was coming home from the airport and there was a massive traffic jam. In fact, there was a big
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:21.920]   accident. I had ways running. Now I have this in my iPhone on the dashboard. What time was that?
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:26.880]   It was about five o'clock last night. Oh, okay. Because yesterday, there was the present was here.
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:31.520]   Oh, maybe it was the president. I don't know. It was something, but it said there's no movement
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:39.040]   on I-80. So ways said, you know what? Don't go this way. We're going to save you time. It took me
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:45.280]   through the back streets around the traffic accident to 580, save my butt. And I realized how great
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:50.240]   this is. Now, what ways does is allows you, when you're running it, to notify other people, and they
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:54.240]   have a very simple way to do it via voice. So you don't have to type while you're driving about
[01:50:54.240 --> 01:51:02.080]   traffic jams, police. This is probably illegal in most states. Accidents, hazards, speed cameras.
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:08.160]   You can also chit chat. You can report mass issues, map issues. This is fantastic. Now,
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:12.560]   I saved some pictures just so that you can see what it looked like because I'm just sitting here.
[01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:16.640]   So there's no police button will save me a lot of blinking lights. The police is good. It actually
[01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:22.720]   works as you're driving down the street. You'll see is a thing that says, you know, a thousand feet
[01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:26.640]   ahead. There's a police and then you can confirm it as you go by. Yeah, that was there or he wasn't
[01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:34.160]   there. So this was this was one of the things I saw traffic at a complete standstill on Webster
[01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:39.280]   Street. And then now you can tap and speak to it. So that's that's kind of handy. Let's see if I
[01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:45.440]   have some more pictures here. Police visible here. You can confirm it by doing a thumbs up.
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:50.720]   It also shows you your ETA based on traffic. How many miles I had to go and what time I should
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:56.400]   get there. I mean, this is actually I should say that I think Justin recommended it last week.
[01:51:56.400 --> 01:52:01.360]   And the last time that I take a look at ways was actually two years ago, and I thought it kind of
[01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:05.280]   stank when I when I checked it out two years ago. So based on his recommendation, I checked it out
[01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:12.240]   again. And that was the second thing that found its home on my homepage. I mentioned earlier that
[01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:18.160]   I was doing I was doing some tests with the navigation. Ways was spot on every time I'm driving
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:23.200]   like a half hour to an hour. It's predicted ETA is within like one or two minutes of my final
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:28.320]   landing time. But the thing is everything that you do in ways is crowdsource, not not only like
[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:33.520]   the location of like traffic accidents, cops, pulled over cars, things like that, but also the map
[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:38.400]   info. So I really wanted I haven't on my to do list to do a blog post of the five things that
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:43.280]   really impressed the hell out of me when I was starting to use ways. One of them was less on
[01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:48.560]   Sunday, went out to dinner, got myself the lavish freelancer dinner of a Chipotle burrito.
[01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:54.160]   I mean, go back to my car, press the button, say, okay, guide me home magic voice. It didn't
[01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:59.920]   just say, okay, go on to route one, take route one all the way down to this. It's because it uses
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:04.400]   crowdsource information. And there are 20 million people who've downloaded this app. Many people
[01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:08.640]   apparently have navigated their way out of this Chipotle parking lot before, because it actually
[01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:14.320]   sent me now go past the Chipotle and left by the dumpster, another left for the exit.
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:17.360]   Because normally, like it will just leave you high and dry saying, I know that I know that
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:20.800]   you're in a mall parking lot. We're not going to give you any help whatsoever on how to get back
[01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:25.440]   to route one from this parking lot. But ways will be able to tell you exactly. Nope. If you go past
[01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:30.400]   the dumpster, you've gone too far. Now you probably want to have this on your dashboard as I did with
[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:36.000]   the rock form and plugged in to power the phone. Because I'm sure it's using it stays on all the
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:43.360]   time. But this blew me away just because it's the crowdsourcing. This is an amazing example
[01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:49.120]   of where crowdsourcing in real time. I'm not used to things like this actually working where the voice
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:55.840]   says, caution, a good disabled car coming up on side of road. And as soon as like, and like five
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:59.360]   seconds later, oh, there is the disabled car by the side of the road that had told me that was
[01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:03.280]   going to encounter sometime in the next 50 seconds. It told me there was going to be roadkill ahead.
[01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:08.320]   And there was there was and that was great. I got dinner. It was fantastic. No, no, I'm just kidding.
[01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:13.360]   But but but literally, he says roadkill ahead. I said, there's what roadkill ahead. And there's
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:18.560]   a barbecue around the corner. I have I have run into a lot of awesome. I have run into so much
[01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:24.080]   crap on the highway, mostly falling off of gardener trucks. You know, we there was a pizza in
[01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:29.840]   in Mountain View. This is going to save me so much money. And you're and it's amazing that how well
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:33.920]   it works. I didn't realize Justin recommended this last week. I think that was Justin's where was
[01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:38.640]   I? I don't know. And maybe I just I thought, Oh, I should try this. So here, I will. Okay, fire up
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:43.200]   chirp everybody. I'm going to I'm going to chirp you the screenshot. Everybody.
[01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:48.480]   And five, four, three, two, one.
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:58.960]   I hear all these bings in the audience. You're so great. Thank you for recommending our app.
[01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:01.280]   Please stop recommending it live on the air.
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:10.480]   You are loving us to death. So ways is I apologize. I didn't realize we talked about it last week,
[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:14.560]   but you're loving us the way the Glenn close loved Michael Douglas in that movie. We don't like
[01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:19.600]   that very much. By the way, the other thing is great about ways is Android or iPhone. And I've
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:24.880]   run it on both and it works great on both. It is a very interesting app. That's great. Yeah. And
[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:34.000]   I'm sorry, chirp. Is there server down again? One for me. They fired up some servers, I think.
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:39.120]   This is awesome. This is really great. What a great recommendation. Thank you, Mike Elgin. It's
[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:45.680]   great to have you from the Peloponnese. Great to be here from Peloponnese and a little plug.
[01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:50.000]   That's the boom, Mike, that he's wearing. And sure, it sounds fine in your kitchen,
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:54.080]   but when you were out at the cafe, it was flawless. There was no background noise at all.
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:57.440]   Yeah. It was amazing. The only problem with that was the
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:05.360]   Wi-Fi connection. But yeah, this microphone is just a miracle. And I really, really thank
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:11.760]   this show and Alex for recommending it. I use it a lot for the reason I got it was actually
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:18.640]   not do anything other than when I go to conventions or conferences at the Expo floor.
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:23.280]   And I wanted to use my iPhone to take and talk. And it was always too loud. And I didn't want to
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:26.640]   hold an SM58 up or whatever. And so I bought it just for that. And it's great.
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:34.000]   Well, during actually the during the keynotes at Google I/O, I was doing live hangouts on air
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:38.960]   with this thing so that their stage was going on and people were jumping out of blimps and all
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:44.080]   this kind of stuff. And I had a hanging out with my own opinions and nobody could hear the stage.
[01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:49.920]   They couldn't hear the crowd. Nothing. Yeah. So it's the boom.com. And which model are you using?
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:58.800]   It's model E. The boom. Model E. And they've been around for a while. In fact,
[01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:03.440]   I think Dick D Bartolo told me about the boom. First, there's the one you're using, the boom E.
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:09.680]   Cool. Thank you, Mike, for that as well. And we'll have you back soon. It's great to have
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:16.640]   you on from Greece. Enjoy your new life. Damn you. I shall. I shall.
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:21.840]   Thanks to Alex Lindsay for being here. You're off to
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:25.680]   DC Houston. Maybe back next time. I'll be back. That'd be great. I'm just
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:28.080]   just the only one couple of days. All right. Well, it's good to have you in
[01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:32.480]   studio. Pixelcore.com for more information about his work, Elgin.com for Mike, of course.

[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:42.720]   places. And Iannaco is at the Chicago Sun Times and his big review of Mountain Lion will emerge
[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:49.600]   when Mountain Lion does. Indubitably so. Thank you, sir. It's great to have you. Thank you all

[01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:28.400]   a quickie with five tips or apps every single week. Our first episode was yesterday. And it's
[01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:34.080]   great if you want to see it. In fact, she talks about the three SIM card that she got in Great
[01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:41.680]   Britain for 15 pounds with unlimited data on that show. That's a Twit.tv/i5 if you want to see
