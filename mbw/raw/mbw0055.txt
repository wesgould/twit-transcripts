[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the Algonquin Round Table
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   of Macintosh Wits.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   As sitting in for Dorothy Parker, it's Andy Enochko.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Pardon my dust.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Oh wait, had I known I was going to be playing Dorothy Parker,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   I would have gotten good and saw-stuffed.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   We're restarting good 43 minutes or something like that.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   How long did it take you to get some?
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   I got some rubbing alcohol downstairs and I could probably ferment.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Scott Born is our Alexander Wolcott. Hello, Scott.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Hello, excuse me, I've got to put my sunglasses on because
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   the blinding reflection from all 40 of my iPhones and my iPhone
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   does this.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Oh, we've got a lot of light in my studio.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   We've got some good suggestions for the Scott Born page, by the way.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   I've gone for a week and look what happens.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And I understand that you actually took the dome, there is a domain, right?
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   I did, I'm not as stupid as I look.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   I want to control over this process.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Yeah, well I have a bunch of our forums are rife, frankly.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   I tried to stay away from those places, but you can send me the ones
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   that are publishable and I'll put them in.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Well, we've got Alexander Wolcott, we've got Dorothy Parker,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   there can be but one, Robert Benchley, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Merlin T-Man.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Family Parker, we're going for a hoo-wrap.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   I feel proud of that.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   And I'll be Harold Ross and we're set, we're set, man.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   We need a, we need a, who is it, a Moss Heart?
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Moss Heart would be nice.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Every Georgia's Kaufman, like on the off hours.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Was that, was that John Tetero? Did he play him in the movie?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Was Kaufman part of the table?
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   No, but that, that movie is like full of people that are,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   you're surprised to find out that, oh my God, that's Luke Wilson.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Oh my God, that's, that's, that's, that's the guy who was in that
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   movie with that guy with the deal who had the hat.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   It's full of, it's full of that guy, guys.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   We're very abstruse here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   By the way, to bring it right down to my level,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   what the hell happened to Owen Wilson?
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I mean, I know he asked the media not to bother him,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   but we're not really the media.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Speculation?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Yeah, it's sad enough that I don't want to comment on that.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   You, you know?
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   I don't, I don't know.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   It's clear that he's going through some issues.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   It's clear that whatever issues he's going through,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   they're not going to be enhanced by people really talking about it.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And it's not really in the public interest.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   I think that's great.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   He's one of our greatest actors.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I'm a huge fan and we'll just leave it at that.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   It's not like, like when the, you know, the, the, the teeny-bauper girls,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   like get drunk and go out and, you know, don't wear underwear
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   and that sort of stuff, or they sort of bring this sort of stuff on themselves.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   You know, he's asked for some privacy.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   And even though I'm, I'm a nobody and we're collectively like one, one or.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Not the media he's talking about.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I know.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   One big nobody.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   He's the only man who could take on Blue Steel.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   That's all I know.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Oh man.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   I think the world of that guy.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Me too.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   He feels better than we wish you the best.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   And you know, I think he's going to be listening to a lot of podcasts.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   So.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I was listening to you guys and I just wanted to say thanks.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   So we'll save the Scott Born.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   What do you call that meme?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   The Chuck, this comes from a site.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   There was a site that cropped up fairly out of nowhere called Chuck Norris Facts.com.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And this guy just suddenly started posting all of these Bill Brasky-esque facts about Chuck Norris.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   And, and, and according, you know, some of the more famous one guns don't kill people.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Chuck Norris kills people.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Chuck Norris does not sleep.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   He waits.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   I like that.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   What is it?
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Oh, Chuck Norris doesn't go hunting.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Chuck Norris goes killing.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   How Norris's tears are so powerful they could cure cancer.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Too bad the man never cries.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Oh, there's a little.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Chuck Norris doesn't wear a watch.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   He decides what time it is.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I have to imagine that Chuck Norris is not interested in shutting this thing down for trademark violation.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Or the page.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   There's about 25 of them that he's personally picked as his favorites.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Well, we're going to have something similar for Scott Bourne.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Maybe perhaps not quite as witty, but I'll have a Twitter donor forums.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   We have a whole, whole thread devoted to Scott Bourne.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Well, I just want you know, I've heard a few of these and that I'm a little chagrin that some of the people missed the most obvious ones.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Oh, well, Save Yours.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Save Yours?
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   We'll get to that.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   We should talk though and it's so funny.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   This is the biggest tech story of the week.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   There's no way we cannot do it.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   It is a Macintosh show and yet there will be people who complain more iPhone.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   No, but it's a big story.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   There are now three, count them three ways to use the iPhone unlocked.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Allegedly.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Well, I talked to Ryan Block who's seen one of them and they did it for two of his songs.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   This would be the same guy around the story saying the iPhone was going to be delayed, right?
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Yeah, I trust Ryan.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I know you don't.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Right?
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Absolutely.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Ryan is absolutely trustworthy in this regard.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Okay.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   No, he's seen it.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   They came to his, are you thinking, are you saying he's lying to me?
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   I'm not saying he's lying to you.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I'm just saying I have no reason to believe anything he says.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   There's a difference.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Okay.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Well, I think you're in the minority there.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   He is saying that the, which one is it?
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   It's the iPhone.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   There's three of them.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   There's one.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   There's the kid.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   There's a 17 year old kid.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Let's start with the hardware hack George Hott's because that's a great story.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   That's awesome.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.440]   in your don right, well, it's just took him 500 hours. He's. It's not something anybody's going to do. Let's put it this way
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:18.000]   He's off now. I try to get an interview with him. He's off to a RIT is going to Rensler. He's a freshman. I don't him. Yeah
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.040]   Technology not RPI not figured this out
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:27.160]   It's eight point six seven hours a day since the iPhone launched to hack this thing using this method and
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.800]   You know so people shouldn't try stuff if it takes time
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.700]   Well, what's your point? That's always what I've collected from this. It's true. If I can't do it in an afternoon
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.620]   Screw it. I'm just not even wait a minute. Wait Merlin Merlin. You're about getting things done
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.580]   How many things I think I think creating a I think creating a phone you can use on any con it's a pretty good start
[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.580]   I mean, yeah, now I have to say this is I I
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:55.420]   Have the only this has been verified by an AP reporter because he brought the phone to AP
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.660]   headquarters unlocked, but this is another case of
[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:05.380]   Verified by you know, we're not sure it's it's completely verified. But anyway, he's got the hack. It's published
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.460]   It's a great story the the kid was had a choice between
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.420]   renovating a car
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:18.020]   And spending some money on what was it the stereo system or something or hacking the iPhone decided to spend a summer doing that
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.700]   Right now you're by here to buy a bunch of them too because obviously when you get to the point where
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:28.260]   having to jumper two connections on a circuit board that was designed only to be
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.020]   Only to be worked on by micro robots
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:37.700]   And your and it's your job to take a three dollar radio shack toggle switch and somehow get it into that circuitry
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.500]   That's pretty amazing. I would I would buy more than one iPhone for that just to make I'd hire him
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.420]   I would hire him today. I would be at his door with a huge offer if I were Apple
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.660]   He's gonna do just right needles and stuff cuz he's
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.620]   Drink coffee
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.260]   Did you see his pile of red bowls he drinks a lot of red ball?
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:59.480]   There's a picture of him with the red bowl built up some sort of a resistance to that
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:04.020]   Ant-man power. He just he just run some thousand nano size
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.900]   Now I should say that this you know
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:12.660]   It's funny all of these hacks have kind of come at almost identical time before George's was a sim hack
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.560]   They were using the turbo sim and I talked to a Franklin Harris up in the Toronto
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.020]   He's done that he's using his iPhone with a Rogers network
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:27.220]   But that requires you have to buy a turbo sim and you have to reprogram it for use on your iPhone
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:32.340]   Yeah, I kind of got bitten in the butt because I found out about the hardware hack
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.020]   And then I boarded a train
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.940]   And then I'm on my iPhone like on the accelo on the way to New York
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:42.300]   And I'm reading up message boards and we're starting to spread about some of these other hacks
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.180]   Which I haven't read about because I haven't really been following the news in the past two hours
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.660]   So I of course, you know smugly and indulgently said, oh, yes, it's unlocked
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:55.700]   But it's such a really non trivial hack. I don't think would be of interest to anybody
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:00.020]   Click post and of course by the time I go to the station to download all my bookmarks
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:05.820]   Oh, this someone has a software hack is and is gonna software unlock your iPhone remotely for 20 bucks
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.460]   now neither of the software hacks is one from Ireland one from Britain and
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.740]   neither of them have gone public although they said they would and
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.420]   They say it's because the AT&T lawyers have come a colon
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.180]   We should underscore that it's according to the Library of Congress
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:27.540]   unlocking your mobile phone is it specifically excluded from the DMCA oh
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.940]   so
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.940]   Yeah, but it's not technically not
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:36.020]   Negated by the user agreement that you saw you click through when you start phone now
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.940]   So long as like he had a camera running on him like all the time in which he could prove that no
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.780]   I never actually installed the the the iTunes software
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.060]   That then he's oddly enough. He's pure as the driven snow
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:50.020]   It's interesting to find out exactly what his liability will be if he's again
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:56.380]   Of course, how many people read through 14 pages of cling on boilerplate to just get their phone working
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:03.100]   Incidentally all of these hacks do allow you to continue to use the iPhone in almost every respect you lose the visual voicemail
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.940]   right because that's based on the based on the carrier service, right and
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:14.020]   but so I know I'm gonna I'm gonna include Scott your your disgust and
[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:19.980]   And incredulous horror at Ryan Block however, I do trust him and he has
[00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:25.660]   Well, you know, he may be he may be right. It was one storage Scott. You're holding this story against him for life
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:32.660]   Okay, well, that's not that's not focus on Ryan. Let's focus on the phone and the situation is I just want to ask a couple of simple questions
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.660]   and that is in
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:40.980]   The United States now. I'm just talking United States. What are your choices for carriers using the I mean mobile?
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:48.460]   So, you know T mobile actually somehow finds a way to rate lower than AT&T, which is not easy
[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:54.980]   I disagree. I'm a T mobile customer. I'm very happy. I'm telling you how it rates with customers in all this all the surveys
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.220]   I'm not saying well, I'm just saying I disagree. I've had very good response
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.900]   They're very everybody would I would say almost everybody would say T mobile's customer service is best
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:08.540]   You have to ask what is a survey asking is it coverage? Well, you're right. You're right coverage depends where you are
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:13.260]   But AT&T doesn't have coverage in Vermont. So if you're in Vermont you prefer T mobile if you're
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:19.220]   So you put a you put the soul deal breaker for the iPhone is I get one bar on T mobile in my in my house
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.380]   I get four bars and and singular and AT&T
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.860]   So AT&T is a good one for me. There are places where again
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.220]   It's exactly the opposite if I had a word is choice
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:33.260]   Yeah, the point is choice the point is not which is better the point is choice and in my case
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:38.860]   I'd much prefer to use T mobile. However, I've already got an AT&T account for the next two years. Thank you
[00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:45.420]   So I just I just wonder about the overall practicality of it. I'm just that's my curiosity
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.780]   I mean, oh, it's hugely practical. Are you kidding me? Let me let me finish
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:56.860]   Let me finish so you may you may or may not be able to ever update your iPhone again. Not so you may or may not be able to
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:02.740]   Well, here's the deal. It survives a restore. So let me let me let me talk a little bit about what happened
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.060]   There's two the one that
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:12.500]   Ryan saw was I to iPhone sim free at I to iPhone sim free calm. They brought it over they took his phone
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:17.060]   They actually didn't touch his phone. They gave him the software. He ran it himself and unlocked his phone
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:21.740]   He put the T mobile sim in he was able to restore now go to the iPhone
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.740]   iTunes and restore the phone and it survived a restore
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:29.860]   So now admittedly if they didn't survive an update though
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:35.580]   Well, it was yes, it would up it would restore to the current version one of them
[00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:39.740]   I'm saying is what I'm saying is in the next version. Well, they could push up your right
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.260]   They you know, don't you think that they could say oh, they're like they did like Microsoft did with the Xbox
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:50.300]   Excuse me. You've modified your Xbox. They could you're saying Apple is gonna deliberately put something in there
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.460]   That bricks your phone if you've tried to monitor never done it with the Apple TV
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:58.780]   But I know I understand Scott's point are you you're saying my point is that I point is it's possible
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:04.460]   Total I'm not totally I'm not predicting that they will do it and they have incentive to do it because they lose their revenue from
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:05.940]   18 they lose their revenue from it
[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:12.020]   So that's part one part two is if there is some discussion I have spoken with a warranty lawyer
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:16.500]   Actually this morning who says he believes that this voids the warranty
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:21.380]   Unless it's when it totally and that's but it's software
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:26.020]   So remember if you can remove the software and put it back you're not opening it in any way
[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:31.820]   Well, and he was specifically talking about the hardware. Yeah, of course that voice a warrant and yeah
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.380]   And soldered what into our and depending on where you're located
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:40.900]   You you made for instance find yourself completely out of luck if you need any kind of service
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.820]   Sounds like you're defending Apple. I'm no keep in mind. I'm okay
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.780]   My limit Scott is an Apple stock. Actually, it sounds more like I'm defending AT&T
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.540]   Which is ridiculous since I don't like them and don't own stock in them
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:57.300]   And I would also point out that the main interest in this is not in the US but worldwide where they can't for instance in Canada
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:02.060]   This is the only way they can use an iPhone. I don't know. I'm just skeptical. I can't help it
[00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:08.460]   I just think that there's like 10 people screaming really loudly about this and like tomorrow Rogers is gonna announce the
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:13.500]   Canadian iPhone and everybody that hacks it today is gonna go that was stupid. Well, that's one country
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:18.300]   There's several hundred that are other places. You cannot get the iPhone GSM is worldwide
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:23.060]   And let me point out something else AT&T is so rapacious
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.660]   They don't offer
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:30.100]   International data plans for the iPhone they offer it for other phones, but not the iPhone. I've talked to people now who have
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:35.540]   Huge international roaming costs one kid Alex Gisheh is two thousand dollars
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:39.620]   I got an email from a guy with a twelve thousand dollar international roaming bill on AT&T
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.460]   And we heard about a forty two hundred dollar one so far it appears AT&T
[00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:50.020]   Has has forgiven all of those no not Alex's they give him a hundred dollar credit. Are you kidding hundred dollar credit?
[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:55.340]   I'll connect you well everybody he should talk to me because everybody we've talked to we've been able to help get through a
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:15:00.460]   Complete credit. Well the point is they don't offer international. Well, I have a hand if you put an international
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.980]   Sim and then all of a sudden it's much more affordable
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.180]   Well, I think it'd be listen
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:10.140]   I think it'd be great if this could be worked out to where people who want the iPhone can have it
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.180]   I am an Apple stockholder and apples in the hardware business and
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:18.820]   No, no apples in the phone business. That's one of the reasons Apple hates this is because they're gonna lose those AT&T
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:26.460]   It's ten dollars of phone Leo. Is that do you know that? No, I have I have reason to believe that and that's been reported other
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.460]   $10 a phone once
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:35.300]   No, it's ten it's ten dollars a phone per month. Okay, that's ten million dollars a month now
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:42.260]   Let me finish but overall it's not as much on the average lifespan of the phone predicted that they're gonna make which is
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.660]   Somewhere around an extra ten dollars not a lot, but I'm just saying they want to sell phones
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:52.140]   They want to sell phones everywhere they can so they would this hack if this hack helps them sell phones
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:59.220]   I kind of in the back of my mind almost wonder if you know secretly they aren't happy about it interest so you're now
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:05.960]   Forgive me for being uncredulous in this because this is the first I've ever heard any dollar amount attached to their
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:11.160]   Subscription fees you're saying that I'm I fair I feel very strongly that that's an accurate number
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:18.340]   Yeah, you have I know you have some connections at AT&T ten ten dollars a month is what Apple is is probably not for the not for the life of the phone
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.660]   for a limited period
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:27.740]   Still no more no more than the two-year contract obviously well that would be 240 million dollars
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.820]   Yes, I agree and that's and that's a very significant number
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:38.340]   But I really think that you'll find that AT&T takes the lead on trying to stop this not Apple well they have
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.620]   The question is whether they can
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:48.020]   They smell right labeling rattling their sabers or labeling their saddle if you're this 17 year old kid's dad right now
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.500]   Oh, I don't worry about the 17 year old kid AT&T doesn't worry about the 17 year old kid
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.660]   It's the software because if you can go to a website
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.500]   Yeah, I see what you're saying and download software even it's 25 or 50 bucks
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.180]   Well, you know here's what I'd like to do
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.140]   I'd like for somebody to send us a phone
[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.100]   It's hacked and prove to us that this actually works
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.280]   You don't even need to do that just to send us the software
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:13.860]   percent this is software and and will use your phone Leo to test that's fine and and then and we'll put to an end wait
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:19.860]   I mean you have like so many phones you wouldn't sacrifice even one of your 7,000 iPhones not for a second
[00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:25.140]   Also, I mean I think it's worth mentioning here that the nature of somebody who does this I think understands the risk that they're undertaking
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.940]   You know, I I mean we're talking about a whole lot of different things here
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.380]   I think I mean for it sounds like what you're saying Scott
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:34.020]   You're coming from the standpoint of the kind of standard garden variety user
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:39.060]   No, I think the the canonical ants sue or whoever should not go out and screw up their iPhone
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:44.420]   They shouldn't but there's a there's a rich hacker culture of going in and trying to figure out what you can do to screw around with
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:48.180]   What you've got and I'm not saying that's great for Apple or great for AT&T
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:53.500]   But you know a lot of the technology that we see five years from now starts because some guy got a soldering iron opened up a machine
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:18:00.180]   So I agree. I think that I actually think that part is cool. I in my blog. I said I think it's a neat science experiment
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:04.180]   I do I think it's a very neat the big the biggest thing here is though
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:10.100]   This is a feature and this is a capability that the average user pretty much doesn't care about because
[00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:16.500]   Unlocking software that's an entire industry for every phone every blackberry every you know every motor roll every no-kit
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.540]   You can imagine and yet this is not a widespread problem
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.340]   It's very very easy to find the software for just about any handset that you have
[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:29.900]   Most people are either unaware that the software exists or they don't want to touch it or they don't feel that being locked to one carrier
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:33.180]   Is a big enough problem if they're gonna start doing that Google search?
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:38.260]   Well, I just I want I think the iPhone is different. I think particularly outside of the US the iPhone is different sure
[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.260]   I'm outside outside the US absolutely well
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.400]   Okay
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.700]   Let's not be do provincial here in North in North Dakota
[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:51.180]   Vermont and everywhere else in the world where you can't get an iPhone. This is a very big big story
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:55.920]   Okay, now here's some folks. How many how many people do you think actually?
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:00.820]   Do this sort of thing particularly Merlin relevant to your last statement?
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:05.600]   I mean out of a hundred people do four people know how to do something like this. I
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:10.980]   Think unlocked phones are very common. What are you talking about? I have I'm trying to find out. I'm trying to find out
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:16.120]   I don't have an opinion. I'm asking I have no way of knowing that. I would say I would guess that it's less than 1%
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.760]   Okay, I think in Europe. It'd be a far higher number. I think they're used to unlocked phones
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.100]   I think we in the United States are used to this notion of locked phones
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:28.820]   No, no, I'm talking about not used to unlock phone. I'm talking about unlocking a phone
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:34.140]   Well, if you could buy a phone and download a $25 program that easily unlocks it I
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:38.040]   Think that that's I think you're gonna see well, that's a good question
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.880]   But I have a feeling you'll see quite a few people buy it if it were just another Nokia
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.800]   I don't think it would matter
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.880]   Which by the way, there are very few phones you can't unlock
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:54.260]   Using some sort of hacking this that the iPhone with you know, Apple was I think trying very hard to keep it from being unlocked
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:59.400]   Well Apple had a contractual obligation to do that. Let's point that out
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:05.480]   Yeah, they might have you I said interesting theory that they might have kind of a secret agenda Don Locker
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:12.580]   Well, my opinion is based on information. I receive that they had a contractual obligation to demonstrate some
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:18.840]   Some level of unlockability to AT&T before the deal got done some level of
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.200]   I mean non unlock it right
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:28.240]   Look we've done all these 19 things to keep somebody from unlocking your your thing
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:34.400]   I think they had to do some level of that to get the contract now secretly in the back room some guys go in the
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.400]   But we didn't do number 20
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:43.800]   Don Rizinger writing a Tuesday morning and the CNET's news blog says this is Steve Jobs plan all along
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:48.760]   Steve did his part. He locked the iPhone down quite well kept saying that he's all right
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:54.360]   Yeah, he even talked up the fact that the blackberry does quite well in the AT&T service just to maintain the iPhones
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:57.320]   Significant buzz, but Steve Jobs is not a dumb man
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:01.120]   He knew that by making the iPhone exclusive he was losing out on a significant market
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.600]   So Rizinger is agreeing with you
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.920]   That it's about the hardware
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:11.000]   With the new unlocking procedure in place the iPhone will become as a ubiquitous overseas
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.880]   That is is in the US in the matter of days after the best iPhone unlock is released
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:19.360]   Well witness a flurry of sales that will create a watershed moment for Apple
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.880]   Should be in trouble now AT&T is as you as you point out
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:27.280]   Definitely doesn't want this to get out. I don't know how they're gonna stop it though
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.400]   They got 170 lawyers just going out that's right
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:35.040]   You could stop a commercial enterprise and I have a feeling that the I am sim free and the other one that will be stopped
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:42.240]   It's hard for me. It's got their iPhone. Yeah, who's got their iPhone. He's on airplane airplane. I'm an airplane mode. Who else who's got?
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:46.680]   Who's broadcasting have you checked just got have you checked all of them?
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:51.640]   That'll take a few days. I started turning them off yesterday morning
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:04.680]   Check thank you. I have I can't think that Apple really wants this to occur, but I
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:08.480]   Think you know, it's interesting just as somebody who could give a fig about any business
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:14.320]   I think it's fascinating just to watch from from a any point that you've got two people making some kind of worth
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:23.280]   Connection around a business development deal. It's so fascinating with these these partnerships form and fall apart and go out of date
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:28.760]   You know what I mean? I just think it's fascinating how this really depended upon these two companies as you note
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.240]   Doing everything in their power to keep things locked up
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:35.800]   But I think it is interesting where everybody knows that you can't you just can't right
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:40.840]   But I mean but the thing is the whole the whole point of having an exclusive agreement with somebody is that it's exclusive
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:44.760]   And that you're both going to do everything you can to make sure that nobody screws up your deal
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.440]   I just think it's it's really interesting to watch how these changes in technology end up
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:53.280]   You know the real offense that people take over this they pull out the law and they pull out the contracts
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.760]   Which is understandable because that's the way business works
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.600]   But I just I do think it's fascinating to watch though and increasingly, you know, there's
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.800]   You watch this kind of like well, what's that what's that book?
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:07.240]   You know with the early adopters bleeding edge, you know, you know the book
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:12.040]   I'm talking about the book about innovation that was really helpful for you. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, okay
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.040]   So this is and I think at Ecclesiastes
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:19.080]   I'm tipping down because you could say because you start out and you're and obviously these two are peers on the day that
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.840]   They shook hands and they signed on the very large dotted line
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:27.360]   They saw that you know they were for practical purposes peers, but it's just interesting as you have to wonder
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:33.920]   How does this change for Apple over time if everybody and their brother has this really trivial way to unlock their phone?
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:38.000]   How does that end up affecting the agreements that they make so even though it's still the law?
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.560]   I mean, how long can you enforce them enforce the law?
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:44.600]   I would be shocked if there isn't language in the agreement that says that if someone comes up with a method of
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:49.600]   Unlocking it and there's a capability to shut down that door that Apple has a responsibility to shut that down
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.600]   Same kind of deal they have with the record companies in fact. Yeah, I mean
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.280]   It's not like the situation with the Apple TV where you know
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:00.940]   You look at the architecture and you look at what is what has been played what barriers have been placed to
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:04.780]   Prevent people from hacking the Apple TV and you realize that it's just a post-it note
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:09.080]   It's it's about it's a little bit more effective than the sign that's on the iPod saying please don't steal music
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.560]   I mean you can make a case that with the Apple TV
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.920]   They kind of wanted people to see what this thing could do
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:19.200]   But there's really nothing to indicate that Apple would be willing to especially with such a big partner as AT&T
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:24.600]   To take that kind of a risk to put any sort of a backdoor any sort of an intentional weakness in the device
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:31.360]   I just have the language in the contract that has some kind of a nuclear option that they both have a certain amount of skin in the game
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.480]   Is that how does something like that get worded Scott in your experience?
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:41.400]   You know, it's it's hundreds of pages probably but you know, I just I'm gonna potentially put forth an unpopular question
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:47.080]   But I'm not used, you know, I'm not used to being popular on this show. So now I'm willing to take the risk
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:54.760]   I mean you say hated Scott born don't you know the hated Scott born read the hell are you talking about read the forums?
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.840]   They hate me
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:02.040]   So one guy hates you that's one guy. I would not derive self-esteem based on what people say wouldn't
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:06.880]   I just think it'd neckbeards is there a moral question here
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:12.960]   You have companies that devote millions of dollars in research and time and manpower to creating this product
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:17.760]   using various technologies and skill and then someone comes along and
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:22.680]   Clearly does something that's meant to undo all that is there a moral question
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:26.400]   There's absolutely a moral question if I'm not doing everything in my power to support the company
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.400]   That's giving my personal information away to the government
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:36.400]   Talk about morals I have to say the other is a moral question and I agree with Merlin not Scott
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:41.520]   I think that the real mandate is to unlock this phone the I was very disappointed
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:47.120]   I think this was a dark day for Apple when they made this deal with AT&T when they made said it's put out a locked phone like this
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.840]   And I know there are over a hundred locked cell phone for sale today. Yes
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:58.680]   I mean that it's not reasonable to say that Apple you above you instead of every other manufacturer are gonna be selling unlocked phones
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:04.360]   I know that that's that's gonna give AT&T absolutely no tactical advantage over everybody else except for with visual voicemail
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:10.080]   But we feel as though your obligation to the users is such that just basically to screw yourselves as badly as possible
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.080]   I mean we've seen what way do they screw themselves?
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:19.680]   Because they're they're all kinds of features that they can do with the with the iPhone that require them having access to a network to having a
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:25.960]   Provider that can work with Apple with applicants. They know we need this sort of a bandwidth at your rule to our stack not to other devices
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:30.560]   We want to be able to I don't think that having a phone or an open would make it less powerful
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:36.120]   It would make it less powerful, but it wouldn't make it less powerful, but it also will make it less stable
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:43.000]   You know, it would make it open in the sense that it is an unlocked phone that could be run on any GSM network
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.440]   I think that that was that was the right thing for Apple to do and I think they showed greed by saying well
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.360]   We're gonna make a deal with AT&T that's in our benefit to our benefit
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:55.440]   But not to our users benefit and I do think Apple has to be held to a high-level higher standards
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:01.080]   And if they if they become another Microsoft then I think people should move to Linux or some other open source platform
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:06.040]   Can I clarify my point and just because I don't want to be miss miss misunderstood
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:10.760]   I don't really have any skin in the game for this either way and I'm not encouraging people to go out and break the law
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.480]   And I'm not gonna I'm not gonna do this not breaking the law
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:16.680]   Well, yeah, okay, but you understand what I mean. I'm trying to turn your
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:21.640]   I'm not even trying to say I'm not I'm not even trying to say you should go out and quote unquote screw AT&T
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.560]   I'm not saying that at all
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.320]   I think that I think that what's interesting is the businesses
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.840]   They're gonna do the best in the long ones and the long long run are the ones that do not hang
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:35.760]   Their entire business model on pieces of paper if you're gonna really innovate innovate in an industry
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:39.160]   It's gonna have to be by constantly improving and not by just locking things up
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.160]   I'm not saying that's wrong
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:45.240]   But I'm saying that if somebody can figure out a way to make a better mouse trap that lets you have a Linux based mouse trap
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:50.000]   People are gonna go seek that out and it may be illegal and it may be wrong and it may be immoral
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.520]   But it's it's not toothpaste
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.480]   We're ever gonna get back in the tube and the upshot is it over?
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:00.320]   1015 years that ends up being the innovation look at the Sony the Sony suit from the 70s with the VCR
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:04.720]   I don't know. I'm just I just want to clarify. I'm not saying I think in a perfect world Merlin
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:09.600]   That's a really good point, but you know the entire cell phone industry find this world less than perfect in some way Scott
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:16.840]   I do I think the cell phone industry in general relies on you know locking people into two-year service agreements rather than performing
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:20.880]   If you did a great job as a cell phone company, you'd keep me as a customer forever
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:28.240]   So I understand the problem is that it's a monopoly of collusion. I mean they but that we've seen we've played
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:32.720]   We've played this tape before when Apple has decided to put their
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:39.400]   Hardware into stores and not given them any financial incentive to sell the Apple project instead of other people's product
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:45.240]   The basically the end result of that is that the Apple product gets ignored as the displays are not maintained
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:51.480]   They're not reordered the salesman who are getting again incentives to sell the competing product will talk down the Apple
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:55.040]   Product this is what this is one of the problems that Apple had in the 1990s
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:59.160]   It's not I think that it's ideal for Apple to sell an unlocked phone
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:05.640]   It's especially if they can do it through a limited channel like right now almost any handset that you want if you want to buy an international
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:12.360]   Version you can spend an extra two three hundred dollars and get it, but it's not practical to ask to demand that Apple
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:19.920]   Throw away the biggest commercial advantages they can possibly have when what they're trying to do here is to launch an entire new
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.480]   Computing platform that's a non trivial exercise and to not be partnered with a with a
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:30.400]   Communications company that's going to be really motivated to push this phone and support its users
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:35.040]   That's not something that Apple should be willing to give up now once I once I buy the iPhone
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:39.880]   I've I think that I have a right to do whatever I want with it as long as I'm willing to take the risks of breaking my phone
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:48.400]   But again, I just don't think it's realistic to say that Apple did a disservice by its users or did something immoral or did something contrary to their
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:54.080]   Their their mission plan to create cruel software for and hardware for users by not doing this thing
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:58.120]   Do you not agree that it's so you think it's bad business not to make it closed?
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:04.040]   It's that's bad business to make an unlocked cell phone in this world that we're living in right now
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:09.280]   Because again if you're saying if you're saying to T-Mobile look the lock it to your network
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:14.440]   You'll have an exclusive you will be make every iPhone that you sell will be making money for T-Mobile
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:20.840]   That gives them an incentive to sell more iPhones when you put when they have 20 different phones in the product line
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:27.140]   One of which they can can simply be taken out the door and never make another penny for that for that carrier ever again
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:33.480]   What is the incentive to give that iPhone the end cap space to give it the advertising to let to?
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:37.640]   Communicate to the salespeople that know we really want you to sell iPhones no
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:41.160]   I don't think you need a T&T as a marketing partner if you're Apple
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:46.760]   I think Apple knows how to market quality products. I don't think ATD is necessarily a valued marketing partner. I
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.520]   Disagree
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:54.000]   Let me just let me just remind everybody I said it earlier and I just want to make sure everybody understands that we did a check
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.400]   There there are 100 cell phones available
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:04.440]   That have been then in the last few years that have been sold locked to a single carrier
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.440]   I don't hear the hue and cry
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:13.920]   To get those phones unlocked I do the iPhone and and when you look at this guy who's filed his his lawsuit and built this
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.000]   Website around trying to you know free the iPhone
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.680]   He admits on interview that yeah
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:25.160]   There's almost all phones that are hot come out with something like this and this is kind of a funny switch for you Scott
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:29.040]   You were the one who was bitching and moaning about every phone in existence and looking forward to the iPhone
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:32.600]   And I think it was partly because it was a more open platform
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:37.640]   It's ironic that you're now saying let's go but let this is the way it should be done as the way other phones do it
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:42.620]   I'm doing your misunderstanding. I'm not taking a position. I'm simply pointing out all the facts
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:46.560]   I well I think this I agree. It's been that way. Does that mean that's the way it should be?
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:50.240]   I don't have that I don't have a strong opinion either way
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.640]   I'm almost sort of like for the first time in my life right down the middle
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:58.880]   I I'm ambivalent because there I see the user point of view. I see the business point of view
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:02.520]   I see the case for both sides, but I just think that
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:07.760]   Just like I did before the iPhone came out when people would attack it unnecessarily
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:13.840]   I'm just pointing out again that there appears to be an attack level that the iPhone that people have been unwilling to make at
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:20.600]   Other cell phones when they came out there wasn't such a big deal over those phones when they were hoping for more from Apple
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.360]   Well, I understand where do you want than an iPhone?
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:29.240]   I think thank you for the diamond studded wallet, but unfortunately
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:33.600]   $10,000 and hundreds in it an unlocked iPhone and open plan
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:37.240]   Well, you spend your I'm never buying you a Christmas present because you last to the receipt
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.120]   Well, and I think Merlin raises a very good point
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:44.480]   I think unlike you I know Andy that you believe that it's good business to team with AT&T
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:48.600]   I think it's I think the best thing best business plan at this point certainly in the in the world
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:52.600]   We're heading into is not to try to lock stuff down not to try to enforce DRM
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.800]   And I see Apple moving in that direction despite Steve Jobs, you know
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:59.760]   Proclamation that we don't like copy protection. I don't see Apple showing that very much
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:03.580]   And I worry that Apple's moving in that in that DRM direction
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:09.640]   I just make one like a mostly unrelated announcement that it felt really good to walk into the sprint store
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:17.400]   Behind the San Francisco shopping center and pay my final freakin bill with those guys because for what now for eight years
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:22.560]   I have paid my bill and I've been with sprint and they have I mean, I don't want to be unkind
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:29.360]   I've had probably a handful of insanely helpful tech people where they've escalated me to like the guy with the neck beard in the closet and
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:36.440]   It's been amazing helpful. They help me get Bluetooth up. That's so was the exception to the rule and I don't know
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:39.240]   I just feel like cable TV phone carriers
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.360]   This has this is like I say it's mostly unrelated to what you're saying
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:46.920]   But at the same time it's gonna be really refreshing to see a point when you're selling based on service
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:53.320]   and the ability to jet blew the experience for people and not just rely on the law to keep people locked into a really
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:56.600]   malignant contract and I just it felt so good to be rid of them
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.680]   I know AT&T is no bargain
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:04.040]   But I'm just saying I look forward to a future where I can tell Comcast where to put their coaxial cable because I found somebody
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:07.440]   That doesn't lock me in and makes it easier for me to do what I want to do
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.840]   That's why I pray for Google to get this
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:15.640]   700 megahertz frequency and open the sucker up and put the phone out there put an open phone out there
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:18.800]   Yeah, but then you guys will all be mad at Google for doing something that makes them
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.680]   Yes, as long as they move in an open direction and not a closed direction
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:23.600]   I think there's lots to be mad at Google for our day
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:30.600]   The last thing I ever want is for any piece of technology any hardware or any software to be controlled by the open source movement
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:37.280]   Because they are really really really bad at creating end-user applications and end-user hardware
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:41.880]   Oh, see that's not no and for once Andy I'm gonna say I think you're way out of whack on that one
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.760]   I think that's that would that was more true a lot more true five years ago
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:52.080]   I mean are you out there actively using like recent releases of stuff because it's a lot of a lot of stuff has come a really long way
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:56.960]   I've got the latest Ubuntu like just a foot and a half away from me. I've got the latest open office
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:00.600]   I got the latest pretty much everything and I still don't have a working Wi-Fi connection on that notebook
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:05.600]   Okay, and the open office is still the equivalent of what Microsoft Office was four years ago
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.200]   It's certainly not the equivalent of I work
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:14.320]   I mean this is yeah, all the really cool stuff all the really great stuff all the really innovative stuff is being created by companies like Apple
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:19.920]   The open source is great at standard building and they're great at creating alternatives for people
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:25.440]   But again the phone that's in my pocket the phone that's gonna be my connection to my email and to the outside world
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:30.120]   It's gonna be the clumsiest interface in the world open moco is a great idea
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:33.840]   And I wanted to survive and I wanted to thrive and I think in five years of development
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:40.000]   It'll probably be where maybe the iPhone is right now, but it's a very very slow glacial process to make
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:47.200]   I really don't think that open source developers by and large understand the needs of regular end users who just want a solution and want to go home
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.120]   I
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.440]   So I think that's that can that can be very true that can be very true
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:55.340]   And like I say a lot of the things that I've looked at in open source over the last five years in particular
[00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:58.920]   Yeah, I mean it's been it's been hard to use but um
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:04.620]   And right now I'm doing a lot of work with Drupal and this is an open source CMS application
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:06.720]   It sucks. Well, I just
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:12.920]   Smackdown on Mac break week. This is the last time we do Mac break weekly before noon
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:18.160]   We're all in each other's throats
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:22.000]   She's my sort of righteousness
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:28.960]   I want to say is that for the for I mean like first of all, I think it's you're right when it comes to stuff
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.200]   That's like the huge e-mic huge huge projects
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:31.800]   Yeah
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:36.320]   I think the more the more people that you have involved that it isn't always easy to maintain kind of quality control
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:41.120]   There's a lot of really awesome little open source widgets that do stuff really well, but when it comes to Drupal
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:44.480]   Yeah, I do disagree with you on that because that to me that that is a system
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:47.320]   It would have cost half a million dollars the last time I had a real job
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:52.360]   And and now the stuff that I'm able to build with Drupal that scales and handles load and
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:57.600]   And does the kind of stuff that I want to do is just it's mind-blowing and I find it I find it very easy to use that
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:58.640]   That's very very true
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:04.520]   It's a really powerful system all I can tell you is my own personal experiences because I'm rebuilding my my blog my website
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:09.080]   Yeah, we talked about that. Yeah, right exactly and I'm someone who wrote every time there's a new standard
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:13.040]   I had to write a new new piece of blog code for my Apple script blog to support it
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:18.960]   I've written an operating system. I have no no stranger to installing software configuring it. I downloaded Drupal
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.960]   It took me four days
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:29.120]   To figure out how to put a freaking picture inside a blog post because you know the build that was the current build didn't support that built
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:33.160]   And oh, but that's okay. Just download and install this plug-in. Okay. I downloaded how to install it
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:37.840]   Well, we're not gonna document that well just post on the forum. Okay three days later. No, it's still we're God
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:43.640]   And this this is exactly the thing there are people who who understand who whose primary language is
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:48.880]   Unix and networking and then and all these basic technologies and they can really adapt to
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:54.880]   Something like Drupal very very easily for other people WordPress is the only really good viable solution
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.040]   I was also open source
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:03.000]   So right but but I think that the majority of software out there that's in the open source community is reflected by Drupal
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.840]   There's no excuse unless you're unless you're creating a system that is going to be used by consultants who are going to charge
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:15.280]   Rightly so for their heavily for their time. There's no excuse for Drupal to be that difficult to build with
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.280]   I
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:22.720]   I want to get a cage match going on
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:29.800]   I want to Drupal cage match Merlin in one end. There's no one I would rather be smacked down by more than Andy
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:30.140]   I
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:36.880]   So three days at the garden Boston garden complex in Boston Massachusetts on the pay-per-view
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:41.080]   I'm calling you out you better be a lesson for you Andy and not go
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:48.040]   It's coming at the end of a folding chair much magic Merlin can really throw down when he faces these two twenty four inch
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.040]   Bifons
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:54.600]   On pay-per-view HBO it's the smackdown between Merlin the man and
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:57.920]   Andy the not I have to say you know
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:05.840]   The whole idea of usability is a whole rat's nest we could get into and I don't necessarily think that usability is so great in these
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:12.640]   Commercial products either in fact again the iPhone stands out because it's usable look how many look how many?
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:16.520]   Unusable phone interfaces have been generated by commercial entities over the last
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:23.440]   10 years maybe opens I agree that the Linux is still not as user-friendly as it ought to be but it's getting there
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:27.280]   And I I don't think that that's open source versus commercial. I think that that's a
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:32.000]   Very difficult thing to do to create interfaces that humans can use
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:38.120]   And it's not going into the lab and having a thousand users use your product and watching their eye
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:43.440]   You know pupil movement also, but it's also like just for me. It's it's a it's a before nap. Sorry go ahead
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:48.020]   I was just gonna say sometimes it means having one guy with the vision
[00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:53.280]   Optimally a Steve Jobs saying no this sucks. This is a piece of crap. We're not gonna release this
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:57.520]   But you know if you do that an open source for like okay, well, we're gonna have a way to that right
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:02.360]   You're just open sources by consensus and you're in your right that is it's
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.080]   That's a flaw
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.280]   I think trees you know
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:09.560]   Dries controls Drupal to a great degree and then if Dries doesn't you know want to do something?
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:14.360]   I think that he has a lot of weight Linus doesn't you know only has weight in the kernel. He doesn't have weight in the UI
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:19.960]   But I think that is I think generally open sources by consensus. I think that is perhaps a flaw
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:23.720]   So what would the iPhone look like if it were open source? Well look at open moku
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:29.320]   I mean, that's that's what open source wants to use these batteries because that's an open standard by having a sealed
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.520]   Sealed in battery that lasts for four days
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:34.280]   It would have a hand crank on the side
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:41.040]   What is the open moku open moku is is an attempt to make an open source cell phone?
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:49.520]   What is an offer if you go to open moco.com open of an mo co.com you'll see not only the wiki for the
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.760]   the software development projects it's OS and apps and also
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:58.640]   Not every obviously very few phones are going to be able to be flashed with a whole new operating system
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:04.240]   so the open moku organization is creating a brand new handset called the neo
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:09.520]   1973 named after the initials of the guy who placed the first wireless phone call in 1970
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:15.040]   And it actually made the screenshots look pretty good. It's not really working very
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:21.840]   They're shipping and right now. It's not even it's a little pre-alpha product. Yeah, it looks like a really nicely put together
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:25.000]   Sony phone very very conventional, but very very good
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.840]   I like the fact that it's all open. I like the fact that it's fully Wi-Fi we get full access to the files to the file system
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:34.480]   It has all kinds of things that I wish I'd like to see in the iPhone
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:40.260]   But again, and also by the way this open moco phone cost only 50 dollars less than an iPhone
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:44.840]   I'm not sure that a lot of people would be willing to well, they're making them ones eat Tuesday right now
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:48.440]   Kind of yeah, they don't have an embolke. Yeah, so I mean that price open now
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:54.000]   Right, I think that we're gonna see this is a very interesting experiment and we'll see what open moku dies
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   I mean open moku
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.960]   One very one very last thing just make sure that I'm not creating the wrong impression
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.920]   I'm the guy who like published a gleefully a series of columns saying oh, you know
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.920]   That that Ubuntu is finally good enough that regular users can use it
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.440]   It's good if you have a seeing I nerd handy to help you through it
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:13.440]   And I'm really really pleased that open source software exists
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.200]   I just disagree with a lot of people
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:19.840]   There are some people who have really gone up river with open source saying that you know
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:23.920]   So if we want to be free old copy rights or fascist, I'm saying okay fine
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.520]   Let's see the best saw the best image editor you can create
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:32.320]   We'll stack an extra the best image editor that that a private company can create and it's not gonna be any contest whatsoever
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:37.440]   Maybe I'm not sure I agree. I think I did think well
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:42.400]   I mean the other the other side of that wager sounds like a wager that needs to be placed between you two
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:47.400]   I think the other the other side of that question is who's gonna produce better software somebody who's working nine to five
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:51.880]   For the man or somebody who's doing it because he loves it and cares about it
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:58.080]   And I think in the long run there's no advantage held by commercial entities and in operating systems or user interface
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:04.560]   That's there's no native in here in advantage. I agree that the current state of the art is is superior rather
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:08.240]   Ride one horse across the west or would you rather try to move 400?
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:14.800]   Open source doesn't mean 400 people are writing the software opens you can write one guy can one guy can and often does
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:21.680]   Is create the open source product? That's not that's not different and by the way, how many people wrote windows?
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:27.440]   This might have perhaps become the largest rattle. No, this is actually very germane
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:33.120]   This is I think very much to the point it would be it would be interesting Leo to bring somebody in to talk about this to bring in somebody
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:36.480]   Who works on the with whatever the open source phone thing is not a moment?
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:41.280]   Well, we have an open source podcast we talk about this all the time and actually at one point
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:45.880]   We had talked about getting the Mac of floss people together Mac brick weekly and floss people together
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:49.080]   And doing a kind of a roundtable. Maybe we will do that
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:54.000]   But my fear is it would just descend into basically this polarized discussion. Well open source is better
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.800]   It's so it's not it's so it's not and I think there's a strong case to be made on both sides
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:03.880]   To bring it back to Apple. I think that really is an you know an interesting question for Apple
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:11.120]   You know, there's open source underlying OS 10. I think there is no question that the strength of OS 10 in terms of its stability
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:18.880]   Its security its reliability is is is found its foundation is open source. There's no question about that the open
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:23.480]   Apache Apache on the other hand the UI is totally closed source
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:25.720]   Maybe that's the best of both worlds
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:30.760]   My question is which direction's Apple gonna go and it seems to be heading more towards a closed platform
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:38.080]   And you know, this was a great fear when when OS 10 was announced that that Apple would take from the open source community and not give back
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:41.800]   And they have been doing pretty well. I think in the Darwin project giving back. Although there's some debate over that
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:46.800]   I just I you know Corey doctor removed off the Mac platform because he's afraid of
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:53.480]   TPM being built into the hardware. He's afraid of DRM or doesn't like the DRM or as he was a copy restriction
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:59.400]   Built into iTunes. I think we I think as watchdogs as as journalists covering Apple
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:01.760]   We have a responsibility to consumers to say, you know
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:07.000]   Pay attention to consumers. It's not about how much you're gonna make from AT&T in the long run
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.680]   It's about how much you know, what kind of and I think Steve Jobs has always said that hasn't he?
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:15.720]   Yeah, but you know, I'm sorry. I'm gonna take the capitalist view here
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:22.920]   You but it's not it's not anti-capitalist. It's it's saying what's best for what's the best way to be a
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:29.960]   Solvent Bible corporation, but you can't be a solvent viable corporation if you can't be in business and you can't be in business
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:36.480]   If you don't protect your intellectual property if you don't provide some competitive advantage to your product mix, but Scott
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:45.160]   OS 10 succeeds based on a totally open source platform without OS 10 Apple is back with OS 9
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:47.160]   Which is a piece of crap?
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:53.280]   But OS 10 itself is not what I'm getting at is you don't have the problems with OS 10 you do with windows
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:57.520]   Because it isn't open to everybody to mess with not so it's Darwin
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:03.640]   It's it's it's based on an open everything underneath aqua, but then you just say didn't you just say that the UI is closed
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:10.000]   Yeah, but that the UI is not worse reliability and stability come from and UI is just your interface to it
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.720]   Well, I'm just I'm actually making an appointment more to the to the discussion about the phone in particular
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:18.800]   I don't think companies are evil because they want to make profit
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:26.580]   Companies go into business to make profit. No, no, no, we're asserting that but you can't do you if you make profit by screwing your customers
[00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:28.580]   You won't be making a profit for very long
[00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:32.020]   Well, I don't I don't think that's going to be a question exactly
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:36.680]   I don't think that's happening and I and I think that you know the sales of the phone prove that
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:40.440]   I think that the response of the phone prove that if people thought they were getting screwed
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:43.680]   They wouldn't be lined up to buy the phone. It's only how much screwing they're getting
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:47.840]   I mean, I think really the nobody feels good about it, but they're gonna put up with it
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:50.640]   And I don't know if that's really the way I'd want to run business either
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:54.620]   Well, if it were up to me the friggin phone would work on Verizon and I'd be happier
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:59.980]   It'd be an open phone and you could choose your carrier. I would I would precisely my point
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:01.980]   I'm saying I'm saying
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:05.520]   What would I'm saying though?
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:08.620]   I'm just saying that from a business point of view I completely
[00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:15.080]   Understand what's going on here and I think sometimes we have to visit the real world and look at the cost of doing business
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:18.760]   the cost to do the development on this stuff is staggering and
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:24.240]   You're not going to get companies to do this kind of investment if they don't see a potential
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:29.540]   You know way to protect what comes out of it so they can get the rewards. I just think that's good with you
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:33.880]   I mean, we're not I'm not a communist. I'm not saying that they shouldn't make a money on it
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:40.480]   I in fact, I'm with Merlin and I let me not put words in your mouth Merlin, but I think that the it's it's good business
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:45.760]   To be open it's good. Yeah, I'm coming at it from a slightly different angle and I mean my again
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:50.040]   I don't know anything about this stuff. I'm talking about I'm talking about virgin virgin America
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:51.200]   I'm talking about jet blue
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.200]   I don't know if these guys going to be around 30 years from now
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:59.400]   But I know that what those two airlines get that it's much harder for these what they call in legacy carriers to get is that
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:03.840]   You know, they've learned the stuff that I really care about and seem to be minimizing the stuff that I don't care about
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:08.040]   They're figuring out what stuff I'm willing to pay a little bit more for and they're figuring out what stuff
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:14.160]   I kind of think should be included and I think I don't know if those are great examples from much for somebody who really understands business
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:19.640]   But those two those strike me as companies that get something in the same way that right now hotels are struggling to charge me for everything
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:25.680]   But soap, right? You know and and I and I just I wonder like it just seems to me. There's a new emerging kind of business that
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:27.840]   understands
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:34.440]   That there's a there's a service and a user experience component to this stuff something that I think Apple absolutely gets
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:40.440]   I think one of the primary ways you can distinguish Apple users from Windows users if I may say is that Apple users are more than happy to pay a
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:44.400]   Premium for a better experience. I think it like Andy says we all you know
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:47.000]   I don't steal my laptop from the store
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:54.040]   I buy it and I'm happy to support that but I like the idea of thinking about how how as a company can we go out there and make
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.040]   People love us, you know
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:49:02.160]   Rabbidly because we're servicing them on a level that nobody else can and how can we eat the lunch of all of our competitors because they don't
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:08.680]   We'll get Doc's curls on because that's really his specialty is talking about how companies can change and and the point Doc made in the
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:14.080]   Clute Train manifesto is businesses is in a different world in the internet world customers have more choice
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:18.100]   They are speaking up there talking back to companies and companies that don't serve
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:21.420]   Customers are in the long run maybe not in the in short run
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:27.440]   But in the long run in trouble and I think hotels that charge you for 1395 for internet access and airlines that
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:33.680]   Don't feed you are gonna see the results of customers talking to each other something they never did before
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:39.180]   What about those new mini bars? Man those things drive me crazy. We if you even move anything they charge you I know
[00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:46.160]   So are Leo are we leaving enough time for scotborn jokes? Yeah, we are well, there's not that much news the second story
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.960]   That's a big story and I don't I haven't got an invitation
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:52.680]   But the rumor continues that there'll be a special event September 5th
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:56.200]   Of course if there were a special event it would probably be to announce iPods
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:00.600]   Has anybody anybody got Andy got an invite? I?
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:05.820]   Have not actually have not checked my mail today because I've been swamped with book work last time
[00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:08.920]   I got while we were doing Mac break weekly was a phone invite
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:13.820]   so I haven't had any email or a phone invites from Apple and
[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:16.400]   Scott did you know anybody who had?
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:22.480]   No, I'm trying I'm trying to find out if it's real because we keep here in the rumor and I figured I think by now
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:26.200]   They would have sent out an invitation. It's only a week out. Yeah, I think they're gonna be
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:30.260]   It's gonna be poorly attended if there's not an invitation out by today, right?
[00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:36.520]   Let me interject here something. This is Leo shortly after we recorded this show in fact
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.520]   I did get an invitation from Apple
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:43.760]   To join them September 5th for a special event the beat goes on
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:46.120]   Hmm
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:52.400]   The beat goes on sounds like it might be a Beatles announcement. It is at Moscone West, which is a very big
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:56.840]   Venue much bigger than the venues apples used for the last two announcements
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:02.200]   This is where they have the keynotes for Mac world exponent can actually accommodate several thousand journalists
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:06.040]   It is invitation only and we will of course
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:09.800]   We're gonna said Scott born and we will cover it and we'll have it on Mac break weekly
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.360]   the same day
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:18.800]   Right after the event so look for a Mac break weekly Wednesday next Wednesday September 5th talking about whatever Apple
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:25.680]   Doesn't now and now I return you to the speculation already in progress. I think it's gonna be a fat nano
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:29.760]   I hope not that is that is one ugly man. Those are just mockups, right?
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:32.160]   I mean those are what we're seeing from people. Well, here's the interesting thing
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:38.160]   Okay, this started at nine to five Mac, which is a new Mac rumor site pictures of fat ugly and color nanos
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:43.980]   Which nobody would have believed especially since the picture itself was in a Photoshop window
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:50.560]   Until Apple sends a cease and desist to them and to others including in gadgets saying that's our property
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:56.040]   Kind of gives a set lens some credence to the story sounds like a like thought crime
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:52:03.280]   Well, you know, I think I think first of all I hear I'm just a little perturbed about the negative fat stuff happening as president
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:08.360]   Podcasters of America fat people not fat nanos
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:13.460]   Say there's a place for fat everywhere. It's a portly. It's point
[00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:17.720]   You like it has everybody seen the pictures of those the purported pictures of those new names
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:19.880]   I saw the Photoshop picture. What do you think?
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.760]   Look like chunky bars. I think they're key
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:26.780]   I have to admit to immediately dismissing it because I saw the Photoshop window and I thought now this is officially lame
[00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:28.780]   It looks like a zoom cut in half
[00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:33.480]   Yeah, anything resembling a zoom by the way is a bad my zoom and half I can tell you it doesn't look quite like
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:41.160]   Left-viewer sparks it's so strange that it's a Photoshop photo and I mean app maybe Apple
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:44.940]   Lawyers made a little mistake by asserting ownership of this image
[00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:49.460]   Because that kind of it is a counter counter rumor
[00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:59.020]   Interesting maybe it's a double spy thing. I do we all agree though. There should there should be a new nano or new iPod
[00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:05.180]   This next month wouldn't it just have to be crazy if there was a new iPod based on the iPhone minus the phone
[00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:06.580]   Wouldn't that be great?
[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:09.860]   That would be thrilling to pros and cons. Why would they do it?
[00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:12.980]   They wouldn't do it because it would hurt phone sales
[00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:19.960]   Maybe it's it's but also there's a lot of people who are probably about do to buy a new iPhone who don't want a new
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:24.240]   Oh, excuse me to buy a new iPod who may not want to drop that kind of cash and the experience
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:28.660]   I hate to say I hate to become one of you dorks, but it's really fun. It's really fun
[00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:31.700]   It's the best iPod ever no to flip around on your iPhone
[00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:36.920]   It's totally fun and the whole the whole video experience. I mean whatever I don't I don't think you would cannibalize
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:42.040]   I think this I think this whole phone things got steam and by the time they put it to whatever a 1.5 or whatever out
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:47.520]   I don't think it would cannibalize it. Do you guys one of you dorks? Yeah, you guys are huge dorks, but
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:51.880]   You know that I don't need me
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:56.560]   Who lives in a small room right Merlin leo and Scott our cruise door
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:10.320]   Now just because I call mine precious doesn't mean a thing I call mine douchey, but you make a good point Merlin
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:14.160]   Which it is regardless of the phone and everything else. It is an excellent iPod
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:20.160]   I don't know. I mean it the the user experiences the excuse me the playback in the video experience is great
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:25.520]   But I still have a big problem with but I don't think that the operation buttons near to be as tiny as that
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:30.320]   Often I have to step to you know, you're right clicking. Yeah, no, I like this shuffle
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:33.520]   I couldn't even find the shuffle it was so tiny
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:36.960]   I thought there's no shuffle control here and then I find somebody showed it to me and I could bear
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.280]   I have to use my the tip of my finger to click it
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:45.920]   It's the great thing is I mean since none of the buttons are mechanical they could just do a simple software update right to make to just overlay
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:50.360]   a big standard iPod click wheel like you know control panel easy to
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:55.200]   Solve 100% of my difficulties with the iPod application right but yeah
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:58.640]   No, we just that if they could sell that for $299 to as
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:00.560]   $149
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:06.960]   Without any phone features without the internet features just as a movie player just as an audio player that would be a killer product flash or hard drive
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:09.120]   flash
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:11.920]   I think I think apples real I think apples really doing a good good
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:18.160]   Good job of selling the idea that if you have eight gigs and you're using itunes the way that itunes was meant to be used
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:22.560]   You're not going to be able to you're not going to run through more than eight gigs of stuff and in any you know
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:24.560]   36 or 48 hour period
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:27.680]   Most people anyway, that's such an interesting paradigm shift
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:33.840]   I would try to cover this on 43 folders with some stuff about how to kind of do super smart smart folders that rely heavily on
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:37.600]   How recently you've listened to something whether it's something that you've added recently
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:42.640]   That really that's that's I think some people are still getting their head around that paradigmatic change and I if for me
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:44.640]   It started big time with the apple tv
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:47.680]   And it's definitely carrying over with the uh
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:50.640]   With the iPhone it's an it's a marketing change for apple
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:55.840]   I mean their original marketing's you know kind of deploy was your entire music library in your pocket
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:59.360]   That's right. Well, now people people have more than 40 gigs of music
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:04.640]   For me, I've always used smart playlists to manage my ipod only because it's just so much more convenient
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:05.840]   You dock the ipod
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:09.840]   It swaps out everything that you've listened to replaces it with brand new stuff and fresh stuff
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:11.840]   That's arrived in the past 24 hours
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:18.000]   It's just a convenience thing more than a size thing and now that I'm trying now that I've been using this eight gig iphone
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.960]   uh minus the os minus whatever else I've put on there
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:23.120]   As my primary music player
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:30.640]   I find that I just can't appreciate the difference between this iphone and my 60 gig ipod in terms of content
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:34.960]   As a matter of fact, most of the content on my 60 gig ipod is used as photo storage
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:38.000]   It's as external hard drive when I travel
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.640]   It's also great. I this is
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:45.520]   Rathole, but I love the way that um, how can I put this one of the complaints people have about you know
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:49.920]   Kind of the new the web 2.0 or whatever is this idea that we've lost the sense of discoverability
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:52.960]   And that we've all kind of gotten down our own little, you know
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:58.720]   These little well-worn pathways that we never deviate from and with smart playlists to me are great for this
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:00.480]   So one thing I love is I have a smart playlist
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:02.160]   It's things like I call it forgotten lovers
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:06.560]   And it's anything that I've given more than three stars to that I haven't listened to in the last month
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:10.400]   And so I get this great mix and he calls and he calls us dorks
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:12.160]   You know what?
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:14.560]   That's a total of a Neil Diamond song. I'm pretty sure
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:16.560]   I've got
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:18.560]   Lovers
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:21.760]   The lovers you forget forgotten lovers
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:29.920]   But you get in there you hit a button and just let it run and you get these nice little surprises. It's it's uh, so is eight is eight gigs optimal
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:31.920]   What's the optimal size 20 gigs?
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:38.880]   I think having big ass big ass movies being able to have a series. Yeah, I can't put like I can't put enough of a
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:45.680]   My video on there. I've got plenty of my music and even podcasts and even audiobooks because none of those are like going on
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:50.320]   I'm going on a long trip and taking like a big ass pile like James Burke documentaries, you know
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:56.960]   It has to be big enough to hold an entire season of the wire and then eight albums in a couple of books
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:00.000]   James Burke documentaries and you're calling me a dork
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.720]   Andy Andy and I go what would be the optimal size?
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:08.400]   I don't know if I put it in terms of actual gigabytes
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:14.480]   But all I want is I want to have the movie that I intend to watch on the plane and alternate a tv show
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:21.040]   I want to have all of the podcasts that were downloaded today and I want to have let's say
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:25.760]   500 600 700 songs that's eight gigs. I did the math as it is your turn
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:30.320]   I think I would bump that up to 10 just to give myself a little bit of wiggle room
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:34.880]   Fortunately, apple has thoughtfully prevented me from putting my own files onto the iphone
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:39.040]   So I suppose I don't have to worry about all those all those pictures and all those documents
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:42.000]   I'm going to be putting on the thing. Wait, wait, I would harm the experience Andy
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:47.760]   It really really but I would feel harmed. I feel protected and see you know, let's just people let you know when you're ready to have files
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:50.960]   Apparently if you have a wonderful
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:56.240]   Go door to door knocking on windows. I do you know that steve jobs has a wonderful plan for your life. I have a
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:58:59.840]   brochures. I'd like to leave with you. Hello
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:02.240]   Steve town
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:05.040]   Apparently Steve might be getting closer. There's a blog
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:10.640]   Somebody sent me a link. I want to thank hunter leith for sending me a link to the blog of huntob
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:17.120]   Uh in which it looks like apple is developing the blog of huntob huntob good
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:24.560]   Uh apple's developing application framework for the iphone. They've got a help wanted sign. Anyway, if you go to apple jobs
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:30.640]   Yeah, iphone application frameworks engineer is in the in the help wanted section
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:34.720]   They found a figure that maybe apple should get into the iphone software game
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:37.920]   It's stuck with all these high school kids. Yeah
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:41.280]   But a framework would presume
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:46.160]   A framework could be for internal use only of course, but if you have a good framework
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:49.600]   You might want to give it to others
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:51.680]   Well, you know and if you're going to follow along on this
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:57.520]   Capitalist model of working with others nicely, you know, how smart would it be to go go back to what we talked about before wouldn't it be great for
[00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:01.440]   iTunes to become all of the games become the way you get stuff on here
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:04.080]   Uh, I mean, what a fantastic way to work with your partners
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:10.160]   I mean there's all kinds of stuff they could do with yahoo and and google right that would be they could just start with yahoo and google
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:13.040]   I mean, but yeah who widgets on there if nothing else
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.880]   I by the way leo I decided this week
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:18.480]   This is officially going to become the thing that I talked about until it's tiresome
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:23.440]   Is my prediction that google and apple will be working extremely closely on this stuff
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:26.320]   This is my this is my completely crazy thing when i'm going to be obsessed with
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:34.000]   Not that crazy not that crazy and so putting like like a imagine a imagine this imagine an editor
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.640]   A button it's an editor for editing your google docs inside of iphone. That's all i'm
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:41.920]   Google's google's got the framework to do that already
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:47.840]   Yeah, i'd start with them before you get into the whole like, you know, right? Yeah, blockjack how to play blockjack and stuff like that
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.280]   Oh, that's fun too
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.120]   We still we still get into the problem of and again
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.680]   I saw this on the that that four hour train ride in new york
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:59.040]   That I just wish that it were possible to if I don't have any bars if I don't have access to the internet
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.920]   I want to be able to do something with this phone other than
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.720]   Multiply numbers together and listen to music
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:11.120]   Unfortunately disconnected connected to the internet. This is a great tool like i'm run any software access any document that I want
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:15.280]   Without access to the internet again, it's just an ipod with a calculator attachment
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.240]   I would give a 20 gig. I would we I said this last time
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:23.760]   But I think your dot mac account should have a 20 have one folder with a limit of whatever n
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:28.880]   And anything you put on there gets synced to your iphone in terms of basic, you know file types
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:34.000]   I think that's not right. I want to sync it through i2 is my bother bringing dot mac into the in the equation
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.720]   What should it be but I but I like that idea though of the portability?
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:39.360]   I think this is where this stuff is going so anything I put on dot mac
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.880]   I can get to from anywhere
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:44.960]   Including this stuff where I might want like my most important business documents or configuration files
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:49.440]   Could be in in one little kind of firewall fold not firewall, but one little folder
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:53.040]   That would be available on my iphone. I think that'd be really sweet or maybe
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:58.960]   You know what I would like just minimum. Okay, you don't have to give me the whole world just
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:04.400]   In the in the mail app give me one button that's in the document viewer that says keep
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:08.480]   So if I so if I email myself or someone emails me a pdf or word file
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:12.800]   I can push a button it gets saved to an internal store and if I want to call it up again
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:18.080]   I can do a I can do spotlight search. That's another thing I want and just and and recall it later because again
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:23.680]   It is such a bummer that I I've got a little snippets of okay. We're meeting the guy at the north west corner
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:26.720]   Okay, that guy is the guy with the weird hat and the weird hat in the mustache
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:31.440]   Uh little snippets of things that right now I use a tumblr blog for and tumblr works great
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:35.440]   As a as a notepad for my phone, but again if you're not connecting the internet
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:41.360]   You're just standing there taking out your your my my little wire notepad out of my my shirt pocket
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:44.480]   Where I desperately wrote down a couple of street addresses that I might need
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:53.040]   Well our friend jackie cheng writing in uh ours technica, which is not your typical apple rumor blog says she's darn sure
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:57.280]   According to sources within the company that apple will have a major unveiling
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:59.760]   September 5th
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:05.200]   Uh, she's told the reason for the date is the long holiday weekend. It's a wednesday not a tuesday
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:09.680]   Uh, she says that at least one of the things that will come out of the announcement will be a new ipod
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:17.760]   apple insider is also saying that ipods have started to dry up on the shelves at some of the big stores like best buy
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:21.440]   Four different models according to apple insider most of which will be
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:27.440]   NAND flash based and major evolutions of the ipod video and ipod nano lines
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:33.600]   Sources in the far east have allegedly seen full screen ipods that will have an os based on os 10
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:36.480]   Sources in the far east there you go
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:42.080]   Uh, some say that they there will be a click wheel on there still in fact
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:44.880]   That's those those those pictures had a click wheel on them
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:50.560]   I don't see why you do a click wheel if you could do a great touch screen, but that's uh, that's the rumor now
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:55.440]   My question and I think maybe even more important is moving away from the ipod
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:00.400]   os to os 10 which would make a lot of sense given that we have an os 10 based phone now
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:03.920]   All the devices should be based on os 10. Is there synergy there?
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:09.520]   I agree there's already a big blurring of lines between an ipod and a pda now my god
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:15.360]   I mean the ipod could be the that one you pick with a device that you just have with you even if it doesn't have a phone
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.280]   With or without a phone right you'd have a choice
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:21.520]   Take your ipod with or without a phone depending on how you whether you live in vermont
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:26.560]   Well, you know, there is a there is a shortage of flash memory
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:30.640]   So that's one thing to factor into this discussion. Oh apparently apple's cornered the market
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:37.040]   Uh, you know, but they may have enough of it ready to go. I happen to think eight gigs is a pretty good number because right now
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:40.640]   Uh, I I don't even use all eight gigs on my phone. Right?
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.360]   I would if I could get more video on there
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:48.560]   You know, I I have to do most recent five episodes and the truth this is another thing that bugs me merlan
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:53.440]   Can you fix this for me? Yeah with your super smart folders. Sorry fix. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. The choice
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:58.400]   Wow, you're good. You're good. Why you left you left a remote login and and I hear
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.400]   the choices
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:05.680]   Watch most five recent videos, but if I watch a series, I don't want to watch the most five recent
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:07.120]   I want to watch
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:11.040]   Starting with the oldest to the newest. I don't watch series with the recent to the oldest
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:16.880]   That's interesting. I can't think of a way to do that just out of the box. I could create a folder
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:20.320]   I guess special folder. Yeah, we do I mean that i'll attract this everybody knows
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:25.120]   But it's real easy is you know, just very quickly go grab in the right pane where all your stuff is grab it
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:28.880]   Command shipped in we'll very quickly make a playlist out of that. That would be the fastest way
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:33.520]   But then it doesn't have that kind of smart sinking. I know I know you're right and if you're gonna watch the wire
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:35.840]   You gotta watch it in order. Yeah, I can watch the wire backwards
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.480]   Yeah, that would be the ero
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:43.200]   If you guys are you guys visual hub users? Yes
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:46.800]   I just noticed something I posted this on flicker there too ago
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:49.280]   But you know the whoever the guy who does visual hub
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:52.720]   He has a kind of a funny sense of humor that he's always uh
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:55.120]   That pops up in different places in the visual hub interface
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:59.280]   And I just noticed for the first time I was making a a movie into an iphone movie
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:03.680]   And when you click the radio button in the ightunes area of visual hub to turn it into
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:07.600]   Um an iphone movie, you know, you get the little quality slider
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:11.040]   The highest level of quality is gonuts. The second highest is high
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:13.520]   The third highest is Wi-Fi
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:16.880]   The second lowest is tiny and the lowest level of quality is edge
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:21.120]   I
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:22.560]   Dig
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:25.360]   Uh or an AT&T dig as it might be yes
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:29.760]   Really should there should be a way to build a smart but i'm not sorry to rewind again
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:33.920]   But uh that should be a way to create that smart playlist you want when you create the smart playlist
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:36.960]   You just make it select items by the least recently added
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:41.120]   Yeah, but then but then I can't sync the top five out of it
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:44.080]   Which is what that sinking gives me and that's the issue I have
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:48.720]   That's probably the main reason why I want more memory in an iphone or an ipod with flashes
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:52.240]   That I don't want the most recent five episodes of the wire
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.760]   I wouldn't mind the first five or the first five unwatched episodes of the wire
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:57.120]   But I can't figure out way to do that
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:59.120]   So really what I want is the whole season
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:00.400]   Okay, so this this is good
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:04.080]   This is gonna excuse me a chance to get on my soapbox because this is something that happens on my on my apple tv
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:05.120]   And it drives me crazy
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:08.320]   But it goes back to a more fundamental problem with the ightunes store
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:12.880]   And it's got sense and you should go shake this up and go go walk upstairs and make people change this
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:14.960]   It drives me crazy that the date
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:20.720]   On anything on itunes is the date of its release of the date of that versions release
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:22.640]   Well, that makes sense doesn't it?
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:25.920]   No, it doesn't because if I go up if I go and get whatever revolver
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:27.920]   I can't buy revolver if I go up and I buy
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:32.880]   Whatever I go by and saw I go buy some zombies record that was released in 1969
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:36.720]   It's gonna it's gonna have the cd release date on it of of 2000
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.160]   You know, whatever
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:41.200]   Which is frustrating because then I got to go and fix all that because I mean all about that stuff
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:42.800]   What do you want it to say?
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:45.040]   I wanted to say whatever
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:48.160]   October 1st 1969. I want it to be the day that it was released
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.360]   Oh
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:51.440]   Oh, why are you great? It should be the day it was released. What is it?
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:53.120]   Is the day that they put it on itunes?
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:55.680]   Like that cd was released on
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:56.800]   You know what i'm saying?
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:01.680]   Yeah, and so what the key here would be okay wire the wire episode yamadork
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:04.720]   I'm just saying this is this is exactly this
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:08.000]   I can't I can't start thinking about that scene from high fidelity
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.760]   Yep, where the where the shop owner is like reorganizing his his record collection
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:14.240]   Say, well, what are you doing by by age by title?
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:17.120]   No, by the mood I was in when I bought it
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:20.640]   Awesome
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:23.200]   Data to add if there was like a multi-select list
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:26.480]   You sound new usb mood ring on your on your finger at all times
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:29.040]   You say wire
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:31.040]   Good. I just want to ask a question
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:34.160]   What page and iTunes are you able to buy revolver on?
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.560]   No, he said he couldn't but
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:40.960]   That came to mind because it was reissued in like whatever 88 or whatever, but um, no, but
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:45.760]   Wait a minute if you had the TV shows for TV shows, it should be the date at first aired
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:48.000]   Yeah, I agree. I mean that make it bad
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.920]   And I it's such a such a weird dumb thing
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:55.440]   I think it couldn't be that hard to do and the kind of people who are buying the stuff they care about this music and they care about this
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.840]   You know crap now. What do you do if it's a remaster though?
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:01.520]   Wouldn't you want the remaster because then you have the original and the remaster you'd want to have separate
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:06.800]   Station I just bought a Chuck Berry compilation where everything is from like 2000 and it's driving me crazy
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:09.760]   Oh, the compilation is driving me crazy because the name of the song
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:14.400]   I mean I have 14 different artists folders all of a sudden with the compliment that drives me
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:17.600]   That's really driving me crazy. There's all sorts of weird stuff with compilations
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:21.440]   They should have us come in there and mix things up a little now. There's no way to do it right. I think that's the problem
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:26.320]   Yeah, this would cause a tear in the universe. Let the Mac break weekly crude
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:30.720]   I can store and set it up the way we like it for a week
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:34.080]   It would be like went home or went home or got to design his own car
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:37.120]   It was all about cup holders and cost a hundred thousand dollars
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:40.240]   I would trust mr. Linde to do to organize my life
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:42.880]   I think it would be more like my like barber through mont
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:45.280]   Having that big like big society party
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:50.880]   Probably discovers like moths in the house. Thank god those three door to odd looking door to door
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.680]   It's happened by are you think we're the marx brothers?
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:58.640]   Nick shorn nobody knows you're here. You got a tuts. Come on. Let's grab a hois
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:01.120]   backpack

[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.480]   So wait a minute
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:09.520]   Apple sends out cheesy invitations hitting in a big announcement. This just came out uh tomorrow
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:16.000]   Wait, but this is bizarre. Oh, that's 2005. I'm looking. I'm looking at a 2005. I'm never mind

[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:54.800]   That old thing

[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.160]   Scroll down
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:51.200]   Scrolling is done with that thing on the right. It's kind of a vertical affordance
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:53.920]   And uh, it's awesome scott
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:57.760]   Is that irony or sarcasm rillan? I don't know. I invented sarcasm
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:01.040]   Uh, this is this is my second comic book appearance this year
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:04.720]   And I do want to say and i'm starting to feel like maybe I got a marvel series
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:10.160]   Were you in an act were you in an x-man or something? Where we're no we were all of we were in that thing with and he's

[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:24.320]   This was scott born by the way. He's in the iphone vest scott born i for an iphone
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:31.440]   The man with the phones is back and this time he's after the biggest hater of them all and you're kicking hitler in the butt
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:34.560]   Yeah, I like pretty good. I think that's pretty
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:38.960]   I've seen that picture and you're sucking in your gut worse than hasselhoff
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:44.960]   He's got a six buck and if you had any idea of the oxygen required to do that you would be impressed
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:50.720]   The head the head looks like you though the face is remarkable. It looks so much like a comic scott born
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:53.760]   It's really good and he's got he's got he's got his you notice he's got iphone numb chucks
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:58.720]   He's got like two iPhones on a chain. He's firing a gun and he's kicking hitler in the face
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:04.160]   So you know, I kind of do have I do do have generally an iphone like face

[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:10.960]   Yes, and the first advantage of this is that I know that the previous books i've been recommending have been sort of on the chintzy side

[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:25.440]   This is one of my favorite biographies
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:32.320]   It's the biography of dorothy parker the legendary would assist and playwright and reviewer for the
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:35.280]   uh, member the algonquin roundtable
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:41.360]   It's a biography by maryan mead and it does the job of every really superb
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:43.600]   Biography it uses the fact that
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:50.400]   The biographer has distance and perspective and access to every single possible source of information and uses that to
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:56.640]   Create a story that makes you think that you totally understand what this person's life was all about that you have
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:02.320]   You almost want to go back in time and hand dorothy parker this book can say this is every everywhere you're screwing up
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:08.400]   Here's the reason why paragraph 12 page 41 it all comes back to this come on but do remember
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:14.880]   Darothy once said i don't care what's written about me so long as it's true. It isn't true i should say so who knows
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:16.640]   Any
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:22.240]   Favorite darothy parker quotes we could have a new uh set a new feature on our show favorite darothy parker quotes
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:23.440]   i'll give you mine
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.440]   brevity is the soul of long jure
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:31.360]   Didn't she do the uh boys don't make passes at girls who are glasses this is not originally heard i have
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:36.160]   I know she said if all the girls who attended the yale prom were laid end to end i wouldn't be surprised
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:44.640]   Oh, that's a good one that is the one challenge use the word horticulture in a sentence and she said you can lead a horticulture
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:47.360]   But you can't make her think uh excellent
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:54.400]   She ran in a famous review of a kathryn hetbergen performance she ran the gamut of emotions from a to b
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:16:00.720]   This is not a novel. This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.720]   Great
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:06.560]   We where are those people where are the we need her more than ever
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:10.400]   She you know to be a smart ass. You really should have something smart to say and she was great
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:14.800]   Oh, yeah, I mean it's if this were a fictional character. It would still be a wonderful novel
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:20.560]   The story this person with this ungodly talent living in such fascinating times with such interesting people
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:26.800]   Who is always just at that precipice of becoming an absolute legend
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:32.480]   Uh, and just not quite making it. She's obviously she's her her anthology of poetry
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:36.160]   Is one of those perennial books that always sells a million copies every single year
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:41.200]   But you when you read this book you get the sense that there was this one place she wanted to write
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:44.640]   But she just couldn't get it out of her. There was this one serious novel
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:49.680]   She wanted to write but she just couldn't get it out of her and so in the end she was known for one
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:56.080]   Remarkable short story that one her international acclaim one book of poetry that collected all of her
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:01.520]   Really amusing little do dads. She said well, why do I write little do dads because New York is a do dad sort of town?
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:05.200]   Uh, it's it's she's not quite a tragic figure
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:09.520]   Uh, but she is a fascinating figure and you're gonna spend 17 hours just
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:12.800]   You're gonna see you're gonna it's gonna cost you an ex the book is free
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:15.440]   But it's gonna cost you about 14 dollars in gas because you're gonna be
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:21.520]   On the driveway just to get to the end of a certain scene to find out. Oh, no, she didn't. Oh my god
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:22.240]   I have to say though
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:25.920]   I've tried to read her prose and I think one of the reasons that arth darthi parker is not very well known today
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:32.640]   Is that her prose is uh very dated now. I mean it's of her of that time and period. Yeah, that's that's the sad thing
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:36.960]   I mean the members the algonquin roundtable you hear about these legendary writers and these legendary
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:39.520]   Columnists and then so I mean I sought out
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:45.680]   Uh, I read a harpo speaks which was harpo marx's autobiography and he was a member of the roundtable believe it or not
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:51.120]   And he had lots of stories about Alexander wolkat who was one of the central big owl-like figures of the roundtable
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:56.080]   So you go and you look up his stuff and it's so dull and it's so dry and it's so repetitive
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:58.880]   Uh, and it's sort of underscores. If you saw the movie
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:02.320]   uh darthi parker in the vicious circle, uh, it's sort of
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:06.480]   Kind of casts into a light the idea of all these people who who
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:09.760]   Existed off of each other they they reviewed each other's work
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:12.480]   They put each other's quotes in their newspaper columns the next day
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:18.880]   That's one of the reasons why they met every single day and they were spending so much time filling their output with these little trivial things that
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:22.960]   And then getting approval from each other that they maybe never pushed themselves to
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:28.240]   Achieve their greatest greatest potential sounds just like the mac break weekly roundtable as a matter of fact
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:33.680]   You know 20 years 30 years from now. This will sound very dated
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:37.040]   We can live with that
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:40.400]   about the time that this goes to the air there you go
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:44.160]   It's dated on wednesday chico with the man that was a great show last night wasn't it?

[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:11.040]   We do thank audible for their support
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:14.320]   I even we even win audible ads leave and actually I think they're going on forever
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:18.800]   But but if they ever were to leave I think we'd still do the book pics because that's just so much fun to talk about these books
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:24.320]   Yeah, just a blast let's get to uh, well, let's do let's first do some scott bornisms
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:27.680]   So how did this came about last week right when scott wasn't here?
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:34.000]   Yeah, I had suggested that maybe we should start tossing out some chuck noris fact ask
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.880]   Things about scott because scott is kind of some man who's he's he's such a
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:43.680]   Character that looms so large that you've got to capture
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:46.880]   Uh some of some of the uniqueness and power of him
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:50.720]   You know with these are the sad jokes again. No, no, no use actually mr
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:53.280]   Merlin started started off with some pretty good suggestions
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:20:01.120]   One was scott born has so many iPhones he uses the corner of one to tap out messages on the on another something like that
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:03.920]   Right never never even turn that one on he just uses it the dial
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:10.960]   Scott borne has a vest made of iPhones right so that's that was those are your freebies
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:14.160]   Yeah, but there's a thread uh first of all somebody sent you a
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:17.040]   Uh a site right scott. What was the that's the site?
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:25.680]   It's I think it's called scott born facts dot com and my uh my the guy that runs my server for me is uh setting it up as we speak good
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:30.720]   So uh so far scott borne uses the edge of one i-phone to dial numbers on his second i-phone
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:35.760]   That's from maryland wade rocket says before any application installs on an i-phone at pings
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:39.520]   scott borne's i-phone first for approval if scott says no you're at a luck
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:46.880]   Uh from the phone scott born never has to charge his i-phone. It's powered by his own sense of consumer satisfaction
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:52.880]   That's a simpson's reference there uh steve jobs is the fake scott born
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:55.520]   Thank you i like that
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:58.320]   In a darothy parker a kind of weird
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:01.040]   foreshadowing of darothy parker
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:05.520]   Aplasia pay says you can lead a horse to water, but only scott borne can make him use an i-phone
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:08.880]   I like that
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:11.760]   Uh, let's see scott borne's i-phone can divide by zero
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:16.000]   Thank you psycho and that's important
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.360]   This is kind of uh this one takes a little this is a little zen
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:23.760]   When scott's i-phone falls in the water. It doesn't get wet
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:26.400]   Water gets scott's i-phone
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:33.440]   I don't know if this is true, but i heard that scott borne plays jenga with a pile of 54 brand new i-phones
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:37.040]   Is that accurate sky is that really true
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:43.120]   Uh, i i would have to find such a small pile of i-phones to play with that i doubt that's true
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:47.280]   Okay, what about well i heard that i heard that uh underneath your mustache you don't actually have an upper lip
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:51.120]   It's just an i-phone plus two million dollars in turban barre bonds
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:57.920]   No, there's swiss barre bonds swiss barre bonds. Let's get this story straight
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:03.600]   What about what about the rumor what about the rumor that you hired 500 Ukrainian children to build you a set of nested i-phones is that accurate?
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:08.640]   No, they they were actually from the former Soviet union her teacher
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:12.000]   But i heard you put each one of those children through grad school. That's what i heard i did
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:18.080]   Um now here's the thing you guys you're you know there are some special i-phone things happening
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:23.520]   But there's a lot about my i-phone that's really special and you know
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:27.200]   So like i went to some churches recently and
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:33.680]   In visiting those churches i went to a catholic church and i went and talked to the head guy at the catholic church and he had a special
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:39.120]   Red cell phone on his desk i said what that's well set for he goes, that's my hotline to god
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:45.040]   And i said so how much is it cost you to call god? He says well, we're close to god so it's only a hundred dollars a minute
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:51.680]   I said cool and then i went to you know a bat church same deal red cell phone
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:54.240]   Hotline to god
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:57.360]   Hundred dollars a minute they're all bragging about this hotline to god hundred dollars a minute
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:01.600]   I didn't have the heart to pull my iphone out because if i would have i would have
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:03.840]   I don't know that for me. It's a local call. Oh
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:09.920]   It's a long way to go for very very little scott but i thank you for that for that journey
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:12.800]   That journey through scott's mind ladies and gentlemen
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:19.280]   So that's going to be scottborn facts.com coming soon to a browser near you and if you've got more scottborn's facts
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:21.680]   Should they send them to you scott?
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:25.360]   Yeah, just just sent just send me an email apple phone show at gmail.com and we'll put them up
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:32.080]   Excellent is there any i mean just one quickie is there any truth to the fact that the last woman you're you were with had a tattoo that said slide don't lock
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:37.680]   The winner and new champion
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:42.960]   Because that's what i read that and i don't know if that's slide to unlock
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:47.200]   Well, it's been so it's been so long Rowan i can't remember i owe
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:55.360]   Let's move on to our software picks ladies and gentlemen andi and not co i've pulled your name out of the hat
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:58.480]   So you get to start go ahead andi i'm so damn lucky
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:05.840]   Uh, i am in the middle of like building a brand new site and so i'm full he's gonna pick droople ladies and gentlemen
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:11.600]   Ruple i'm going to buy a dog i'm going to name it droople and then i'm going to shut the dog
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:15.040]   Soviet russia content manages you
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:19.280]   And kill me
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:26.400]   Uh, so so basically i've i've been having a round up of every tool to help me do things that i'm very very dumb about one of which
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:32.720]   Is to choose something that so is very very simple the color palette that i'm going to use for this blog for the site
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:38.880]   Uh, and i came i i have a friend who is actually a colorist for dc comics
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:44.240]   And she was talking to her about it and she said all the great thing is that i mean you don't really have to have a good color
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:48.640]   Sense you don't have to understand color theory walk around a supermarket walk around a move
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:53.840]   Uh, blockbuster movie theater find like a piece of artwork that you think works
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:58.880]   Well because someone had a good color sense there and put the right colors together and just take your colors from that
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:24:59.840]   Oh, that's a good
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:02.800]   And it's a great tip because it's very very effective as a matter of fact
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:09.280]   I was visiting her at her house and there was this glorious page of french comic book guard of this this this chic in the middle of this
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:12.240]   Golden desert sand that was just beautiful
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:16.800]   So I took a picture of it with my camera intending to just sample these colors with photoshop, but it turns out
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:21.440]   That big huge labs the guys that make these really awesome flicker toys
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:27.440]   Uh for they'll work on your your flicker photos or any other photo has actually a palette generator tool
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:33.200]   You either upload a pick a photo of anything be it again a photo of a campbell soup can or just a picture of
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:38.320]   Of anything that's that you've got uh, or you can just upload it directly to the service
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:40.480]   It will generate a color palette
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:46.800]   From the primary colors that the major color palette that's in that thing and when you when my site is unveiled
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:51.360]   You will see that it is based entirely on the colors found in this page of comic book art
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:55.760]   This these golds and rich blues and rich reds. That's a very cool thing
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:59.840]   But I would I would have happily paid someone a hundred bucks to decide for me
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:05.840]   I just took one digital picture went to big huge labs.com slash flicker and bank perfect
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:08.240]   Nido
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:10.000]   I really like that
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.040]   And they have a lot of other tools on there too. This is actually a great
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:15.600]   bookmark big huge labs.com
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:23.280]   Merlin man, you're a soft white pick that was zero allixes by the way. That's pretty good. That is so cool. Yeah, wow. Look at all the stuff
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:24.560]   Yeah
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:26.800]   I love this. Yeah, I can I can spend days there
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:29.840]   What I love is that they have a game called name that contact
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:32.960]   That is my usual reason for being late with something at the end of the day
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:35.200]   Because if you have a lot of friends on flicker
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:42.400]   What we'll what it will do is it will simply choose a a picture at random from all of your friends flicker blogs and give you three possible
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:46.800]   Candidates you have to figure out whose picture it is and sometimes it's really really easy
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:52.880]   But sometimes it'll be okay. It's a dog on the seashore so it could be it's probably Jim Hyde
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:56.160]   But well, it's it's a poodle, but it's not a standard poodle. So it's probably not him
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:01.520]   It's not shot well enough to be that guy. Okay, it's it's really incompetent
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:03.520]   So I'm gonna guess that guy right there
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:08.400]   And it's it's like and like 90 photos later. You're like, I've got to stop playing this
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:11.440]   This is fun. I like the hockney eyes or two
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:14.480]   I mean, it's fine. Again, you you will waste lots of time
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:20.960]   Clearly making their money off of volume because all of these tools are way way too good to give away what they are
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:23.920]   Merlin man, you have a pick
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:27.200]   I do I do. Uh, it's a pick. That's one of those tricky picks
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:30.400]   It's actually kind of more about something I did than the pick itself
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:34.720]   I've started using something called spanning sync. Oh, yeah, which is a which is a four pay app
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:37.920]   That does something that uh, there should be a sniggle it for this
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:43.200]   But I kind of wish the software would do built in but it what it does is it syncs your google calendars with your iCal
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:47.840]   Calendars and this has been a momentous week for me because this is the week that I changed
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:53.760]   My quicksilver trigger for command shift c to go from opening iCal to opening google calendar
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:54.880]   Wow
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:59.760]   More or less officially yeah, I'm more or less officially off iCal except for syncing and
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:05.520]   You know, I'm sure I'll come back at some point, but I have just been loving google calendar
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:10.960]   It's I it feels it feels more like an app than most apps to me and uh, but what I like about this spanning sync
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:16.880]   I mean it is for pay. I I forget how much it is. I want to say something like $35 a year or something, but um
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:23.200]   It just it just works you say this iCal calendar hook up with this gcal calendar
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:29.680]   And it syncs both ways the only the only hang up i've got with it and it's a known thing is that it doesn't sync
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:31.360]   um
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:36.240]   It doesn't sync reminders. So what what a reminder you make in one will not be reflected in the other
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:38.480]   I'm not sure that's something they could even ever get around
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:42.560]   But apart from that I love the idea that I can share a calendar with my wife and she can add items to that
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:45.360]   And that'll automatically get picked up by iCal and their for my phone
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:47.840]   Um, and I think it's a really interesting
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:52.400]   You know people talk about mashups a lot or people talk about you know how you can use api's in interesting ways
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:56.640]   This is one that to me is just a total no-brainer and and super useful
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:00.960]   Uh, I'd love to see more stuff out there like this especially for contacts
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:04.400]   Uh, but I guess you can do that with plaxo. Is that right?
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:09.360]   Yeah, I was using plaxo, but I had tried spanning syncing beta and it was kind of a complicated thing to get working
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:11.200]   Is it easy now to get it going?
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:15.280]   That's not a pretty easy. I mean it's one of those apps that it seems like it kind of controversial for some reason
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:21.760]   I'm not sure why but i've i've had good luck with it so far and uh, and it's i have it set to sync every 30 minutes
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:24.480]   So, you know, i'm on two computers all day long
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:29.120]   So I never I never miss a trick and it's all there and it's all on the iphone and if i make a change on the iphone
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:35.520]   It's reflected in iCal and the gCal and the music goes around so spanning sync which I believe is at spanning sync.com
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:37.360]   I will check
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:40.000]   Check it is $25 for one year subscription
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.080]   65 bucks if you want to just give them all your money at once for the rest of your life and well there you go
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:48.480]   If you do that you live less than three years
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:55.200]   It's the leo principle applied to buying ahead. I was that scary. That's a really scary
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:30:01.600]   So you would recommend that's good to know because i like i said i tried it and i really wanted it to be useful but i um
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:04.080]   Uh, it was just so hard to use in the beta
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:05.760]   Question
[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:07.440]   I'm sorry i mean you're up. It was hard to just call
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:10.480]   I was just gonna ask what do you like about
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:14.560]   Google calendars that you you're not getting off ikal good question
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:20.560]   Um, I just touch inside of a day and start typing it's not even a double click
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:24.240]   Because it's a part of quick silver. It's it's smart and it well there's that too
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:29.520]   There's plugins for it as well, but I actually go to the page a lot command shift c takes me a month to the current month view
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:34.960]   I click once and I type 8 a.m. Space call leo and select the call calendar and i'm done
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:40.160]   And that's actually fewer emotions for me than doing the same thing in um and ikal
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:44.880]   Um, and it's there's a little bit more i'm finding it feels more configurable to me
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:47.040]   There's still stuff I wish it had one thing I said the other day
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:50.480]   I really wish that I could have a default of 15 minutes for a meeting instead of an hour
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:52.720]   Just because that's how I want my brain to start working
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:56.240]   But uh, I'm enjoying it a lot. Have you had hang ups with it? Andy?
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:31:03.840]   I've tried it now the realize that I've got one really big blind spot with software like this that has nothing to do with the quality of the software
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:09.280]   I'm always really hypersensitive about putting anything that's that personal like a not like an appointment calendar
[01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:14.480]   Someplace where other people can access it. I do I do have strong passwords for stuff like this
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:20.160]   But you know how it is you forget to change these things and if someone happens to guess it or someone happened to grab your password
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:24.160]   For three weeks until you change it. You're I don't like the idea of everybody knowing where
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:29.600]   Exactly where i'm going. That's totally that's what totally kept me off it to tell you the truth
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:35.680]   Um because I had that concern too and and then as far as recollections, I I recall the first time I used google calendar
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:37.920]   I remember it feeling less
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:40.640]   Super obvious when we were making something public
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:45.840]   I think for me one of the biggest problems that it felt like a web app and web apps can be absolutely superb
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:50.240]   But it didn't feel like ikal didn't feel like this is this is actually that's a good point
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:53.680]   Andy because one thing is for example, you know like google reader
[01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:56.560]   It's it feels more like an app than most apps to me
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:59.040]   So if I guess my pickle week is actually google calendar
[01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:03.520]   I go in and I and I hitting p is previous hitting n is next
[01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:08.160]   Hitting w takes you to week view d day view t today and so on
[01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:10.320]   So that's actually faster to me than a command key
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:12.960]   It's like literally one button and it jumps me to where I want to be
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:17.600]   Uh, so for getting around quickly and also you can have a custom a custom view
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:22.320]   Like I have a custom view that shows me the next three weeks, which is kind of a good groccable period to me
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:27.680]   Uh, so yeah, I I would try it again. You know you might surprise you. It's very
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:33.840]   Well, it also also spanning sync. You could still use I sync. This would just be a way of getting it into google calendar
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:37.040]   Yeah, either way, that's the beauty part and then I want to clarify it's a two-way sync
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:40.560]   So it isn't like you're just putting stuff in ikal and that gets pushed over to gcal
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:45.360]   I can be out in the world and put things on my iphone and that'll eventually end up on gcal when I sync
[01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:50.880]   Anything I add on gcal ends up and I and so on and so on and and again, it's shareable unlike ikal right now
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:52.720]   I'm sure this is going to change in the future, but right now
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:55.280]   It's not super easy to share a calendar with somebody
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:57.120]   um in ikal
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:00.720]   And uh with gcal I just go in and per calendar I can go in and share stuff with people
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:06.240]   Yeah, it's it's it's not kind of awkward. I mean one of the great things about one of the most useful things about the iphone is that
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:12.400]   I don't have to worry about not being next to the computer that has my calendar on it because I always have my iphone nearby
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:15.920]   So if I'm answer the phone call and someone's a scheduled briefing I pick up my iphone
[01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:22.160]   It would be kind of cool to basically know that any any web browser window that I happen to be nearby anywhere in the world
[01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:24.400]   Let's meet check my appointments and add an update
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:29.120]   Yeah, and also, I mean if you use the g I personally I don't use the gmail web app too much
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:33.200]   I use mail dot app but when I do there's a nice little feature built in where you can associate
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:36.080]   I don't know if you associate you can create an event while you're inside of an email
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:39.120]   So it's really easy and you can invite people to stuff and things like that
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:44.560]   Uh, yeah, so spanning sync and gcal. That's my picks google calendar. Cool scotborn
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:50.320]   I would like to talk about my guilty little pleasure garage band
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:52.080]   Cool
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:59.600]   And part of garage band for me is I like to write music and one of my hobbies is pretending that I know how to score movies
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:05.120]   So I I use garage band to make my own little movie scores and the jam packs
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.960]   Are are something I rely on now realize that a hundred bucks a pop
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:13.840]   These are either reach is some hobbyists that are relying on a garage band as a free app that came with
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:19.120]   The computer, but if you look at the new one voices, which has 1500 apple loops in it
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:22.880]   You figure a hundred bucks for 1500 loops that are of that quality
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:27.840]   I'm telling you it is quite the bargain if you're someone who really wants to get into
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:31.680]   Building movie scores or doing soundtracks or making music
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:37.840]   Um, I've been playing with this new one and I have to say it's the best of the five jam packs that they sell
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:42.880]   It's got coral ensembles everything. I love the jam packs. Is it this is a new one?
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:46.880]   This is the newest one. Cool. And it is really amazing
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:53.280]   Uh the the voice they have different voices like they name the voice after the person that's saying like herb or jane or whatever
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:56.800]   But the quality and character the voice is is stunning
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:00.000]   And if you get in there and you do a little mixing and looping of your own
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:06.000]   You can create some pretty stupendous stuff the coral ensembles in particular are just really good
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:13.200]   So if you're trying to do something like create a movie score or another reason I use garage band is I do a lot of the music behind
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:16.240]   The voiceovers the jingles the bumpers in the promos
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:20.720]   We do here at my production company and I try to create a lot of them in garage band because it's easy
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:28.640]   And this gives me a pool to draw from that if I were to pay you know leo you may have seen the prices on some of these very expensive commercial
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:31.840]   Things that we get at the radio station. It could be thousands of dollars
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:34.720]   So for 99 bucks this particular one is one
[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:38.160]   I'd recommend people look at if you want to play with something that involves the human voice
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:40.640]   And it's it's still a seventh of an alix
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:44.160]   And the and the right you have all rights including commercial rights, right?
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:48.640]   Yes, that's that's the cool thing here. You have once you get this. It's what we call, you know
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:53.600]   Needle drop type music and it's it's royalty-free. That's the key thing
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:57.120]   So once you make something with it, you can do whatever you want with it. You can sell it
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:00.160]   You can do it now. You don't you cannot resell the loops themselves
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:05.680]   But other than that you have absolute ability to do whatever you want with it. That's marvelous
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:08.320]   So the new jam pack is called
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:14.880]   Voices voices. Oh, man. I have to I you know the the one caveat on just jam packs
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:18.960]   Which I found out because I installed them all is there they take a long room
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:22.160]   You need a big hard drive their gigabytes each
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:27.760]   How many like several gigabytes, right? Yeah, it's a that's the reason that's the reason my new
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:32.800]   24 inch iMac I ordered the one terabyte drive in because I knew I was gonna want to put all these guys on there
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:33.920]   Yeah
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:37.520]   My recommendation is something I'm sure you've all heard of and it's taken me a while to try it
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:42.880]   I've been a big big parallels fan for some time VMware has finally come out with VMware fusion
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:45.280]   Have we talked about this yet?
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:47.520]   I can't remember if we did I don't think so
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:53.520]   Um and it took me a little while to try it but uh the final release version 1.0 of VMware is out
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:59.280]   And I have to say it's it's an excellent choice and might even be a preferable choice to parallels for a couple of reasons
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:03.600]   So I wanted to let people know about it if you're running and now scott close your ears
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:06.240]   But if you want to run windows on a Macintosh, you know
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:09.040]   Of course you have the boot camp option, which is free
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:14.480]   But I prefer to run continue to run OS 10 and just have a windows window open
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:18.240]   And I've been using parallels and parallels is amazing and the guys have done a great job
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:22.480]   Uh every feature that's in parallels that I like is in VMware fusion
[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:27.920]   A price is the same at 79 dollars if you were part of the beta program. I think it's 50 bucks
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:32.560]   Um, you can't evaluate it just as you can parallels and you know
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:38.400]   There are a couple of things that are different parallels allows you to make unlimited backup or copies or clones
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:41.120]   They call them of your virtual drive
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:44.800]   Which is handy because you can clone it and don't have to worry if you've got a spyware of virus
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:46.800]   You just throw it out and use the clone
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:50.800]   VMware fusion does it a little bit differently. They they let you kind of set a uh
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:54.080]   A backup point seems to occupy less space
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:59.920]   But you can you set all can only set one but you can go back to that uh set point, which is very nice
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:03.120]   Uh the advantage of VMware fusion well a couple first of all
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:07.360]   Uh it uses all the processors. So if you have a multiple processor system
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000]   Parallel only seems to use one at a time
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:17.200]   VMware on my for instance quad zon could I could assign two processors to it and get better performance and bench marks?
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:18.880]   Uh, I can't remember who did the benchmark
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:23.200]   So it was a scene at her mac world's benchmarks showed it in fact because of this to be considerably faster
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:28.560]   Uh when you're running windows in vmware fusion and you're doing a windows task like photoshop
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:35.280]   Blurs and that kind of thing because it'll use the multi-processor. So if you're using a multi-processor program, you'll see a big benefit
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:36.880]   um
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:42.560]   It also does something that parallels does but but vmware has been doing it for a lot longer
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:46.320]   It's run these appliances vmware has been around for so long
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:54.960]   Uh as a virtual machine for pcs and there are hundreds of appliances that have been created free basically free
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:59.360]   virtual os as you can download every instead every version of linux
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:02.400]   Uh the star of security gateway and just tons of different
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:08.560]   Appliances and you can download these for free and run them so you don't have to install Linux you download somebody else's install
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:14.000]   And uh, you know, they're big downloads. They're 700 megabytes or whatever some of them are smaller and get damn small linux
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.840]   It's only about 40 megabytes
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:19.120]   Um, and it's just another virtual machine you open from vmware fusion
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:23.600]   And uh that's something they have a real advantage over parallels because they've been doing this for so long
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:28.160]   Uh tons of virtual appliances available and more all the time and they're all
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:31.760]   Uh free so if you're looking at running a windows on a mac
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:35.520]   I i'm not sure if you're already running parallels if it's good enough to
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:40.480]   A ban in parallels and spend the extra 80 bucks to get vmware. I did just because I wanted to review it
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:44.880]   Um, but if you haven't yet chosen, I think you should download trials of both and take a look
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:49.680]   Uh vmware has some real strong reasons to uh to prefer it
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:52.320]   Uh, they've been around a long time. They're a great company
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:54.880]   Do you get free spyware with either of those?
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:59.200]   Yeah, no, yeah, absolutely just surf to any site with windows spyware and boom you've got it
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:01.280]   But it doesn't go to your mac and that's the beauty of it
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000]   Um, it's the the feature
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.400]   It's interesting. I mean vmware came after parallels
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:08.960]   They could look at exactly what parallels was doing and copy it
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:13.200]   So it's got all the all the same features the coherence mode. They call it something different, but it's there
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:18.560]   Um all they've they've not only caught up. They've they've equaled parallels and now
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:24.000]   It's just a question of which is faster perhaps which works better with your system and I found vmware did a very good job
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:29.040]   That's vmware.com and that is a vmware fusion, which is now out
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:35.360]   For the mac. I have to say I tried the beta. It was so disappointed. I I didn't it took me a while to try the release version
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:37.600]   And I was very impressed very impressed
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:41.920]   Isn't that one of the biggest mistakes that developer can make going to beta way too early?
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:47.040]   I can't tell you how many times I missed the boat on something great because I downloaded beta all excited and it was either
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:52.960]   It was they just hadn't figured out what the product was yet or was not stable enough or useful enough to do anything
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:55.360]   That would have benefited from a from a public beta
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:58.000]   I hate to say that because I love public bait is so much, but you're right
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.920]   I mean that's spanning sync same thing
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:05.520]   It was so hard to install in the public beta that I didn't even look at the release and I just installed it while we were talking and it's great
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:09.840]   It's funny how I mean people talked about this at length, but uh, I think partly
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:15.040]   Going to our dear friends at google. I think the words alpha and beta have their meaning
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:19.520]   Almost meaningless and now I mean like for example when we're doing stuff with omnifocus
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:21.840]   We got to tell people hey, this is this isn't even a beta yet
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:23.920]   Right, you know, this is gonna break
[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:28.320]   And like everybody when they say beta what they really mean is we don't want to take responsibility for it
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:32.160]   You know and then you have this product that's out there for like a year in quote-unquote beta
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:34.400]   And I think that that's not a good idea
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:37.280]   But I do have to agree with Andy that maybe you shouldn't do public betas at all
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:40.480]   And unless you have such a good program that the now vm
[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:44.240]   We're probably benefited a lot by the public beta because they got a lot of you know test points
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:48.560]   And they were able to make it much much better much more faster product as a result
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:49.280]   I think it matters
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:52.640]   I mean at least just watching from the outside on the way omnigroup tries to do this stuff
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:55.600]   Is that they they base the number of people they put in an alpha
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:42:01.200]   I don't think this is a trade secret based on how much support they can they can provide to the number of people based on
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:05.520]   Their what they're constantly monitoring the number of open bugs on something to say well, okay
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:10.800]   We're at a point now where we feel like, you know, this is where our staff of n people can handle it makes sense. Yeah
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:15.440]   Well, it's worth pointing out that flicker has has broken this trend
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:20.560]   It was beta for like a number of years then it was gamma for a while then probably they threw up their hands and not if you
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:26.400]   To check the site or used to we're used to say flicker gamma now. It just simply says flicker loves you
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:34.480]   I love you too flicker. Thank you. We love you. So are they not beta. They're not alpha. They're nothing. They just love you
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:38.560]   They just love you. I'm I'm adding by the way, Andy
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:43.600]   I'm adding you to my flicker contacts because you just have so many great pictures on your flicker site
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:45.680]   Well, just I was a good photographer
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:50.320]   I have all the pictures for my my subtropical walk through central park on saturday morning
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:56.240]   If you you that that glass cube like apple store on fifth after it seemed like a great idea
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:42:59.040]   You have not seen it on a human day. They have squeegee guys
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:05.040]   Nothing but try to keep up with all the humidity all the perspiration that this clings to the inside
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:07.680]   It looks like frosted glass. It's a lot of nerd moisture
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:13.200]   That's what that is. I was about to yeah, I'm I'm sitting around there taking pictures of this because poor guy
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:15.840]   I'm like, you know, trying to combat all this stuff. I'm thinking my god
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:20.960]   What a horrible job to be like the mop boy at the at the glass apple enclosure
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:25.600]   Then I realized that no, but this man is getting a free iPod iPhone from Steve job
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:30.800]   How bad is like hey somebody had to hire the squeegee guys have been out of work since juliani. So it's time
