[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Renee Richie is out. He's getting briefed by Apple, but we got Doc Rock in his place.
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.700]   Rosemary Orchard's also here for Lori Gill and Andy Inako.
[00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.300]   And of course, what are we going to talk about? The Big Apple event.
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.000]   Lots of news. We'll discuss the M1 chip, the pros and the cons.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Should you buy a new Mac today or wait for new Macs tomorrow?
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.500]   It is going to be a big Mac break weekly. Most of the time I think we're just saying,
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.800]   "I want, I want, I want, I want." Mac Break Weekly is next.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.300]   Mac Break Weekly comes to you from Twitt's Last Pass Studios.

[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.400]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly and a big Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.700]   It's going to be, hello everybody, Leo Laport here.
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.000]   Right after the one more thing, event.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.400]   Renee Ritchie and Lori Gill are off getting briefed,
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.000]   but we've got Andy Enoco here from WGBH of Boston.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.200]   Andy and I don't get briefed.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.700]   We just do it.
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.600]   Well, we don't need to give you briefed.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.400]   We know.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.700]   We know. That's right.
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.700]   We know.
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.300]   Also, sources of Apple does.
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.800]   And I got work to do.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.400]   I can't be going off Gallivan around getting briefed.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.600]   I don't have time for that.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.900]   Nobody got time for that.
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.300]   Doc Rock is joining us in the Renee Ritchie seat.
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.500]   Hello, Doc Rock.
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.200]   Hi, I worked on the beard to kind of get it.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.700]   I like it.
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.800]   I'm just practicing my stories and my abodes.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.000]   Hi, Abut.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.200]   You do have the Renee Ritchie beard though.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.800]   That's pretty good.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.500]   That's really nice.
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.700]   I'm working on it.
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.500]   Doc's joining us from Honolulu.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.500]   Aloha.
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.000]   Aloha.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.100]   And from the UK, Rosemary Orchard.
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.900]   Love to have her on therosmaryorchard.com.
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.200]   Of course, she's the queen of scripting and shortcuts
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.200]   and the queen of our hearts.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.200]   Hello, Rosemary.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.400]   Hello, Leo.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.900]   Yes.
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.600]   We don't need to be briefed.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.100]   We just magically know everything.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.600]   That's how all this works, right?
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.400]   No mistakes.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.600]   So we just got off the event.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.800]   Michael Sargent and I watched Tim Cook.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.900]   And first of all, I have to say, I'm glad they're doing these
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.700]   recorded now.
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.300]   They should never go back to live because the density,
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.300]   the information density is really good.
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.000]   We don't have to wait for applause from Apple employees
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.800]   in the front row or anything like that.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.100]   There's a nice, you know, it's nice to have live.
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.600]   And I'm sure those who get invited get like to be able to go
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.400]   try the stuff.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.200]   But in this case, I think, especially being able to go
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.000]   down into the basement and see Johnny Shoruji.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.500]   And it's just really, really a lot of fun.
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.600]   Apple announced its new M1 Apple Silicon chip and three,
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.000]   not one, not two, but three new Mac computers available
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   today for delivery next week.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.900]   I'm going to start, or should I start?
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.500]   I'm going to start with the end.
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.500]   How about that?
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.100]   Yes.
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.000]   For those of you who haven't yet watched it, it was really
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.700]   was masterful.
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.900]   Tim Cook and the Apple cafeteria, they opened.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.300]   I'd never seen those big doors open.
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.300]   That was really cool.
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.700]   And then at the end of the show, Tim's wrapping up.
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.300]   And we back out of the Apple campus and the sun rising over
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.600]   the, what a beautiful shot that is.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.700]   And then we started to tune out.
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:29.600]   That would have been a mistake because somebody else broke in.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.100]   What?
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.900]   That stopped.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:31.400]   Hang on.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.300]   Wait.
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.100]   One more thing.
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.100]   Hi.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.900]   I'm a VC.
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.000]   Is there a time for questions?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.300]   Good.
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.000]   Because I have one.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.100]   Why?
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.700]   Why?
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.200]   Why many of those advancements?
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.700]   What's the point?
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.000]   Right?
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.100]   Oh, you're so quiet now.
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.100]   Look, I'm a machine.
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.600]   I'm proud of it.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.600]   Mm.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.600]   That's my fan.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.100]   Longer battery life.
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.000]   Plug it in.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.900]   Where are you going?
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.900]   Just plug it in fast.
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:53.500]   I'm fast.
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.100]   I'm still fast.
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.500]   Check it out.
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.500]   See, still got it.
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.600]   The great John Hodgman.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.500]   Always been there.
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.000]   I always will be fast.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.100]   Okay.
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.000]   My battery strain.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.800]   I got to go plug in.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.800]   Good luck.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.600]   Oh, they brought back.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.600]   So classy.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.600]   They brought that.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.600]   Same suit and everything.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.100]   Same suit.
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.500]   He must have saved that just for the occasion.
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.500]   Yeah.
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.500]   John Hodgman.
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.500]   I'm a PC.
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.500]   No Justin Long.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.500]   No Mac, but I'm a PC was there.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.000]   It was awesome.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.800]   Yeah, but I follow him on Instagram and I'm like, gee, what?
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.200]   He really loves that beer.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.400]   Why did he just shave his beard last week or couple weeks ago?
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.000]   All of a sudden, gosh, and oh, okay.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.200]   I guess we know now.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.300]   So inspired.
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.700]   Everybody's been asking for that switch campaign to come back.
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.200]   And now we know why.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.300]   Apple was able to, I think, pretty effectively.
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.900]   They never mentioned the word Intel.
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.700]   They never mentioned the word arm, but thumb their nose at the entire PC industry and say,
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.100]   hold my beer.
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.400]   The M1 ship is mind boggling.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:04.800]   Now I have saved the slides from the presentation because they go so fast and you're going,
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.800]   what?
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.800]   It's got what?
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.800]   It's got.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.240]   So here is the first big slide.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.800]   The all in one, everything you need to know about the M1 ship.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.440]   First of all, I guess we should mention that's now the designation makes a lot of sense.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:23.000]   The A chips are for the iPhone and the iPad.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.840]   There were some, you know, maybe they do an A14X for the Macintosh.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.640]   And for all we know, this is similar architecture.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:36.040]   It is a five nanometer chip, but the designations for the Mac chips will be M and this is the
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.040]   first one M1.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.720]   And it is no slouch.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.720]   Pretty impressive.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.480]   Unified memory architecture is something PC makers AMD has been trying to do this.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:53.000]   The idea that why go out on the bus to get to memory, to get to the GPU if you could
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.520]   put it all on one chip and this is all on one chip.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.280]   So everything with a unified memory architecture means everything.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.520]   All I owe is faster.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.480]   Everything's faster.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.880]   It's an eight core processor for performance cores, just like the iPhone for high efficiency
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.400]   cores, although they mentioned that the high efficiency cores.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.000]   What do they say faster than the...
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.480]   I think they said that each one delivers similar performance to...
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.120]   What am I looking at?
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.120]   I'm scrolling through here.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:29.400]   But yeah, they made a comparison between how each one of these cores is comparable to
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.160]   the speed of an actual Windows notebook at this point.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.680]   So that's what's really going to be interesting to see.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.760]   As typical with Apple, no mention of clock speeds.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.240]   Is there Intel SpeedStep analog?
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.480]   I guess that's the high performance high efficiency cores.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.480]   But we don't know what the clock will be at, whether it will go up or down.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:58.400]   We should point out there's no fan on the MacBook Air, so no cooling necessary.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.760]   But there are fans on the...
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:05.280]   They announced both a 13 inch MacBook Pro and a new Mac Mini, which was kind of a surprise.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.880]   I think there's a reason for that.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:12.800]   So I'm under the impression that with the i9, if you remember, their biggest issue was
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.040]   always this throttling thing.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.800]   And the throttling thing was generated basically by heat, right?
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.520]   So whenever triggered by heat, right?
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.520]   Yeah, who could for the...
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.520]   Too much heat generated.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.920]   The YouTuber who did the benchmarks in a freezer.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.920]   Right.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:34.600]   So my fellow patrons, if you would say, "Well, how is the difference in the MacBook Pro
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.280]   faster than the Air?"
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.760]   Because the Pro has cooling, it will perform higher.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.360]   So I think that's the difference, even though spec wise, they look the same.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.640]   They didn't mention clock speeds, but you have to figure that the clock speeds will be higher
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.680]   on the MacBook Pro and the Mac Mini.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.840]   And so they require fans.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.840]   That makes sense.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:57.520]   That's something that kind of surprised me, was that it seems as though they're not doing
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.560]   what they were doing with the Intel lines, which is, "Oh, we'll be having the i5, the
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.680]   i7, and the better version of the i7."
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.240]   It's no either one M1 CPU that is being put into all the different machines that were
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.240]   announced today.
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.640]   The only difference that I could see based on the store specs is that the really, really
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.760]   cheap $999, thank God, they kept the price the same.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.760]   That was wonderful.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.560]   MacBook Air has, they say it has seven GPU cores instead of eight.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:29.080]   And if you're looking at the M1 slide, it says up to eight core GPU, but next to that
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.600]   eight core CPU.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:35.840]   So one of my first questions to Apple is going to be, are you just taking the exact same
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:41.400]   M1 chip in the MacBook Air and putting that also in the MacBook Pro?
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.680]   That would be an interesting thing to say that, "Well, we're no longer really defining
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:53.840]   performance strictly by, excuse me, by clock speed and by CPU.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.560]   We're just basically saying here is a big ball of potential we're putting in there,
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.400]   and how it gets expressed depends on the support it gets, like Roxette, from cooling, from
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.760]   extra battery or from whatever."
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.760]   Thunder.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.760]   Go ahead.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.760]   Go ahead, please.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.160]   I was going to say, as far as I can tell, looking at the specs here, like the main spec
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:18.400]   rundown, picking between the 999 and the 1249, is an extra 256 of SSD and that one extra
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.160]   GPU core, like that's it.
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.760]   Now I haven't specked up the cheaper one yet to see whether or not how much the SSD adds
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.000]   price-wise, but that feels like it's got to be a fairly significant jump there.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.440]   They're still selling, it's kind of interesting.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.000]   They're still selling Intel-based Macs in some respect, but nobody's going to want to do that.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Yeah, side by side.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   I was going to say, I think because that question came up in our chat, I think the reason why
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.920]   they did that is because last time, especially from the music or the creator space, there
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:54.560]   are a bunch of people gun shy, so they want to be able to get one last Intel or like my
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.200]   CNC, my laser, they're a little fickle about things like that.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.800]   So I think you want to get one last Intel that I can ride until it dies, and then I'll
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.040]   work the transition as my hardware stuff catches up.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.760]   So I think it's really just a smooth you over kind of thing.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.720]   I think there's another thing at play though, because a lot of institutions, people aren't
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.800]   free to simply order whatever computer they want.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.960]   They have a list of things that the IT department has certified, and if they have certified
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:27.200]   i5, i7, Mac mini, but they have not certified M1, then they have to make sure that people
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.320]   can still buy, they can still sell Macs to people who want to buy them in volume.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:37.640]   But I have to say, I told you so, you should have waited.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.640]   Right?
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:45.000]   Wouldn't you feel bad if you just bought an Intel based MacBook Pro or Mac mini?
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:53.880]   Yes, I mean, I got my Mac mini last July, so I'm not feeling too bad about it.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:58.760]   Plus it has four USB-C ports on it, which the new one only has two.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:03.760]   And I am... But they're not USB-C, they're Thunderbolt 4 USB-4.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.960]   Yeah, which is great.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.800]   I'll give you, that's great.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:13.920]   But has anybody seen a USB-C hub where it has more than two USB-C ports on it?
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.920]   Oh, good point.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.960]   And doesn't have a much of a port on it.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.640]   Okay, that's good, because I need one of those.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.480]   Because if the new one only has two, I'm currently using all four USB-C ports.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.880]   Which one is that, Docron?
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.080]   It's a COW digit T3 Plus.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.080]   And it's the new one?
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.280]   I just want the USB hub.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.960]   Like the things that we used to have years ago, which had a power brick on it, and one
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.840]   USB port on the end, and then you plugged in a bunch of stuff.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.600]   Because my Logitech camera plugs in via USB-C.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.320]   And so does my hard drive that's plugged in, because I've only got a 5-talk gigabyte
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.320]   SSD.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.320]   And things like that.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.320]   USB-C hub.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.320]   Okay.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.000]   You know, there's a primary reason why that doesn't exist the way USB there is because
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.640]   it's not USB.
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.320]   It's unfortunate that that name kind of got stuck.
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:04.400]   But what's in the, I bring this up like every one, maybe twice a week on my streams.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:10.080]   The Thunderbolt-sized USB Type-C and USB-C are all different things.
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:14.280]   And the shape of the little smashed up D, that's USB Type-C.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:19.040]   Those can be USB 2.0, USB 3.0, 3.1, 3.1, Gen 2.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:24.000]   They just happen to fit in that little circular Smash D or vertical O.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.640]   But the USB-C, the actual USB-C and Thunderbolt, the difference in those protocols is they require
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.560]   chips because those chips then do a lot of stuff with certification and handoff.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.880]   There's so much information in HAP.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:37.880]   It's in there.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.720]   It requires a very specific chip.
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.180]   Those chips don't come cheap.
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.600]   So you can get one of these hubs.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.080]   CalDigit does make a USB-C hub that has extra ports.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:54.200]   But it's going to be still 150 to 199 because there's chips that control data flow, power
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.440]   management, power delivery, all of that.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.440]   So it is a thing.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:03.760]   And it's not as simple as old school extension cord, which is what most of our old USB hubs
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.760]   were.
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.000]   Yeah, they were really simple compared to what they are today, I guess.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.440]   But until somebody makes wireless webcams and wireless hard drives.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.200]   No, I'm with you Rosemary.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.200]   You're going to struggle.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.200]   You're going to need those extra points.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.200]   Big deal.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.280]   And so I had not neglected to note that, but they have cut down the number of ports on
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.280]   the mini.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.400]   Of course, the laptops have never had many ports.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.480]   So we've had to figure out a way to do that with the laptops.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.240]   I'm just looking at the other world computing USB 3 port.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:36.840]   And just as you say, there's only two rather USB-C ports.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.280]   There's three USB type A, but there's only three USB-C ports.
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:49.360]   And what you'd like is a hub that has like five USB-C ports on it.
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.160]   Especially because the Mac mini has already got HDMI, it's already got ethernet.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.840]   We don't need those other things.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:15:00.360]   And for something like that, I mean, satachi make a Mac mini dock, but that's got one USB-C
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:06.200]   port on the front, three USB-A, a headphone port, an SD card and a micro SD card.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.560]   And I'm looking down because it's under my monitor here.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.480]   So I'm just checking what it's got on it.
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:17.720]   So for those really just use a switch cable because you're not actually using USB-C in
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.040]   that particular case.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.040]   So you can just...
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.640]   It's going to adaptor, in other words.
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.640]   Here I got.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.280]   Can you read a C-A to C adapter?
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.280]   You can just use one of these little guys.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.280]   And these are super cheap.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.160]   Because in those particular cases, like on your Logitech, for instance, it's not doing
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.400]   anything that literally requires the proper USB-C.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:40.800]   So these little guys from Anker at like a three pack for 10 bucks, just throw that on
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.000]   and you're covered.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.840]   Let's face it, this whole Type-C connector thing has been a terrible nightmare for consumers
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.880]   because you can't look at the connector and know what it does.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:52.880]   You just can't.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:53.880]   Yes.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:58.920]   And they're supposed to silk screen on the connector in image that shows this is video,
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:03.640]   this is Thunderbolt, this is USB, but they don't, you know, most manufacturers don't
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.640]   bother doing that.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.640]   But you can't tell.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.680]   You just don't know what you got there.
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:16.240]   I'm kind of wondering if the two ports is a limitation of the M1 because I'm with you.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.720]   I think that it's Rosemary.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:23.240]   I think that's a really odd choice for the Mac Mini, which is a desktop bound machine,
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.000]   to say, "Well, no, you've got enough room for ports.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.080]   You certainly have enough capacity.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.640]   You could put as many ports in there as you want.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:34.620]   Why do you have me going out and buying dongles and buying adapters and buying bridge
[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:38.760]   bridges to get something instead of doing what I'm doing right here?"
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:44.440]   Like if I look at the Mac Mini I've got running right now, I would be really in dongle hell
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:48.400]   with this new Mac Mini because this is what you do.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.200]   You plug peripherals into these things and you don't take them out.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:56.960]   Also even with the MacBook Pro, the battery life is phenomenal.
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.360]   We'll talk about that later.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.160]   But the thing is, one of those ports is always going to be for power.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.480]   There's really no changing that.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:09.020]   Unless you are absolutely liberated from Lord Tesla, you are definitely going to be able
[00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.020]   to have to use that.
[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:14.980]   I've got one left for your attached storage, one left for taking in a video from a card
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.540]   or from a device.
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:17.540]   Again, you're stuck.
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:21.300]   I've got to bring this brick with me or this little harmonica sized device with me everywhere
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.780]   I go when maybe they could have put two on one side, two on the other.
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:25.780]   Oh, well.
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:30.140]   That was always the kind of, especially with the newer Mac Mini's, that was really the
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:34.660]   selling point was all of these connecting, connecting ports on the back of it.
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:38.720]   Yeah, I think Andy's onto something there that maybe it can only support those two Thunderbolt
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:43.880]   USB 4 ports because there's also two USB-A ports on there, but they're going to be limited
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.660]   to USB 3.0.
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:50.240]   And I can see Apple going, no, we don't want to put two different kinds of USB-C ports
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:56.260]   on there because something that also only supports USB like 3.0 in the USB-C.
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:01.020]   And then the other two support USB 4, that's going to be confusing to consumers.
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.380]   So it makes sense for them to split it.
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:08.140]   And I mean, I kind of am not super happy with the idea of the two USB-A ports because just
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:12.420]   like the adapters that Doc Rock was showing us just now, they're ones that do USB-A to
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.420]   USB-C.
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:17.460]   So surely you could just get a couple of those, but the positioning of the USB-C ports, of
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.060]   course, will not allow you to use multiples of those next to each other.
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:26.220]   Being an Apple user has for some years been about dongles.
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.220]   Let's just accept our dongles.
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:29.220]   Don't look at my desk right now.
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.860]   You're trying to get a lot of stuff to go wirelessly.
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.940]   You know, that is a thing.
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:39.460]   And yeah, Rosemary, actually you can do wireless web cameras really well using your iPhone.
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:40.460]   I do it all the time.
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.460]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:42.460]   Yeah.
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.100]   It's the prior average consumer.
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:48.420]   The thing that they bought on Amazon at the start of lockdown back in March is probably
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:52.340]   a USB-A, maybe a USB-C webcam.
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:56.580]   And they're not going to want to upgrade all of their peripherals just because they are
[00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:00.460]   considering a new machine because then they suddenly start to add up the money.
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.660]   And if they're anything like my parents, they'll immediately go, "No, this is good.
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:04.660]   It costs too much."
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:08.620]   By the way, Doc Rock uses Elgato's Epic Cam to...
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.620]   No.
[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:10.620]   No.
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:11.620]   What do you use for your...
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:12.860]   Because that is one solution.
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:13.860]   My virtual camera...
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.100]   Well, my virtual camera comes in through Ecamm and then...
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.780]   Ecamm accepts NDI signals.
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.060]   I just use the NDI app on the phone.
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:23.060]   Nice.
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.060]   And it just directs fancy.
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:29.980]   And then building this cool about NDI, my Mac mini can also be brought in as a source.
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:34.060]   And then the Mac mini down the hall in the recording studio with the music recording studio
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.060]   can also be brought in as a source.
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.060]   So just NDI.
[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.500]   I mean, you're the new tech guy.
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:39.500]   No, no.
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.500]   We use NDI for...
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.820]   You're on NDI right now for Skype.
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.180]   So that's interesting.
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:47.820]   Is it an Ecamm NDI app or is it a separate NDI app that you use?
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:48.820]   No.
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:49.820]   It's NDI app from NDI.
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.180]   I was going to say from NDI.
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.500]   I just forgot that they were from New Tech after I just said New Tech.
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.900]   But you literally go into...
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.500]   So New Tech makes an iOS NDI app.
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:59.500]   Yes.
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.500]   That's awesome.
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.980]   And then it basically broadcasts your screen directly.
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:09.020]   If I was going to use one of those apps for the phone though, Camo from Reincubate, really
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.780]   weird name, but an awesome app is the best in the game.
[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:17.100]   And it's weird because most people will skip over it because it is like 30 bucks.
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.740]   But it's gorgeous.
[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:19.980]   It's very smooth.
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.460]   But that one does require a cable.
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.500]   So the NDI Connect app from New Tech is this.
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.500]   That's...
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.500]   I hadn't even really thought about that.
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:33.260]   So if you're using Ecamm, NDI stands for Network Digital Interface.
[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:34.260]   I think so.
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.260]   Exactly.
[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.260]   Yeah.
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:41.980]   So instead of using a serial cable, which SDI uses, NDI can be used over Ethernet or even
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.020]   Wi-Fi, which is pretty cool.
[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.020]   All right.
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.380]   Back to the subject at hand though.
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.380]   You keep distracting.
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.180]   I think Rosemary has an interesting point.
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:56.100]   Apple, I mean, one of the things about M1 that Apple started off saying today was it's
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:59.820]   a system on a chip and everything is integrated on the chip.
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:04.480]   And it may well be, you know, when you look at Intel designs, whether they're Mac or
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:10.740]   PCs, you see a lot of support chips external to the CPU, including those USB chips.
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:16.020]   It may well be Rosemary that you've got something there, that there is a limit on how many USB
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:19.940]   4 channels there can be, for instance, coming out of that SOC.
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.380]   I wouldn't be surprised at all.
[00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:27.700]   Even if you have, what was it, 18 billion transistors?
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.700]   There is still, you know, a limit.
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:31.700]   It's pretty...
[00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.820]   It's 16 billion, pardon me, 16 billion transmittent.
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.780]   They have a 16-core neural engine as well.
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:42.780]   All of the new devices have neural engines just like the iPhones and iPads had.
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.700]   That shows you a little bit how machine learning is going to become important.
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:46.700]   And it's interesting.
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:53.540]   They didn't mention whether the cameras on these new laptops are still 720p.
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.020]   I suspect they are.
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:59.340]   But they did mention that we now, because we have this neural engine on here, we can
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:02.300]   do a lot more with these low-red cameras.
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:06.860]   I'll be very interested to see if there is good as 1080p cameras.
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:07.860]   Yeah.
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:13.140]   They're also mentioning on the card for the M1 processor, not the one for the individual
[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:17.940]   Macs, that there is a new advanced image signal processor, which is something that I really
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.700]   didn't think that much of when we were all the times we've been talking about Apple
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:25.860]   Silicon is, well, what if they put the same sort of signal processing on Macs that they
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.980]   put on the iPhone so that they can make up for having...
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.100]   For God's sake, it's 1080p.
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:38.340]   But at least if they're giving us a 1080 camera to be able to mimic the ability of having
[00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:44.860]   depth of field, about having a better skin tone, better frequency response than on a
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.660]   plain old webcam.
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:52.580]   And also, this was probably the biggest hit they've been doing for their neural engine
[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:53.580]   capabilities.
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:57.380]   Certainly, the biggest they've been doing on the Mac, you don't really hear about that.
[00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:01.780]   And so they're trying to make people imagine, we're used to picking up our phones and being
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:08.300]   able to do incredible things because of machine learning, such as natural speech, dictation,
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:12.740]   such as navigation, such as augmented reality, such as photography.
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:17.140]   And it seems as though they're trying to start to put out there that a Mac because of these
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:21.500]   advanced capabilities that's hot wired right into the SOC is going to be able to figure
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:26.700]   out things for you on the desktop, just like it's the machine learning can help you out
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.180]   in the handset as well.
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.180]   Well, because...
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.180]   The 720p camera is...
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.180]   Yeah, they're all 720p.
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.180]   It's still 720p.
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:34.180]   Yay!
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.180]   Sucks.
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.940]   I'm sorry, I'm just trying to be happy.
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.460]   Maybe that digital image processor will make a difference.
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.100]   It certainly doesn't the iPhone.
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.500]   So we'll see.
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.820]   And this is another thing is memory now is unified.
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:47.900]   That's a very good thing, unified memory.
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.620]   But it also means you're not going to be opening up any new Mac and adding memory.
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:54.940]   It's going to be what you get, it's been that way for a while.
[00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.740]   Now, it really is the case.
[00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:00.860]   It also means Apple can say whatever charge whatever they want from memory because you
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.860]   have to buy it from Apple.
[00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:07.340]   And so note here on the Mac mini going from 8 to 16 gigs is 200 bucks.
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.340]   200 bucks for 8 gigs memory is an outrageous cost.
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:15.740]   But there's no choice because it's now part of the system on a chip, right?
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.580]   Yeah, I think that's very disappointing.
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:23.460]   I've been specking out just for fun, but also with the name towards maybe this should be
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.660]   my super high performance desktop.
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:29.940]   Speccing out, well, what if I were to build a Windows machine with the idea that maybe
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:34.860]   I'll have one super high performance machine that's value value value oriented value per
[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:35.940]   per power.
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:39.820]   And then I'll have a Mac on my desktop, but back mini that's mostly just for my productivity
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:40.820]   stuff.
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:45.300]   And it's annoying to see how easy it is and how cheap it is to put these little tailor
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:50.660]   made upgrades where I want, I definitely want more application RAM.
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:55.500]   I don't care so much about this feature and to know that you're spending $200 on what
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.460]   is essentially an $80 sticker RAM.
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.460]   It's not.
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:24:59.460]   But it isn't.
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.060]   It's not a stick of RAM.
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.060]   Exactly.
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:07.580]   And you know, remember the iPhone comes with a surprisingly scant amount of RAM.
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:12.340]   I think it's four or if you get the Pro Max six gigs of RAM and it does fine with that
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:16.140]   compared to Android devices, which are up to 12 gigs of RAM.
[00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:22.940]   I wonder if now that it's all Apple hardware and its big Sir all Apple software, if they
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.740]   may not have the same RAM requirements, you may not.
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:29.500]   You know, I think there's a reason Apple didn't mention clock speeds.
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:33.420]   They don't want you comparing apples to Intel's.
[00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:38.380]   They really, they really want you to just say, you know, they're saying five X graphics
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:43.420]   performance, 2.8 X, you know, CPU performance.
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:48.540]   It may be that 16 gigs of RAM on Apple Silicon is the equivalent of 32 gigs of RAM on Intel.
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:49.540]   We just don't know yet.
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:50.540]   Right.
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:54.140]   So you know, this, this, this, this hard gets back to the analogy of power to weight ratio,
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.140]   right?
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:58.300]   As a, as a car nut, this used to be a thing, right?
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:02.020]   Everybody was saying, you know, well, this car only has a hundred horsepower.
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:05.900]   Yeah, but the car also weighs 2,200 pounds.
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:10.540]   Your car that has 800 horsepower comes in at almost 5,000 pounds.
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:16.260]   So yeah, it turns out that that smaller horsepower, smaller thing, AKA motorcycle even, is going
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.980]   to be faster than your car because the power to weight ratio.
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:26.220]   So someone in the comments just mentioned like, Oh, this might be a dead stop for pro apps.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.980]   And I want to add a different piece of gravy to that.
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:33.460]   I use LumaFusion on an iPad pro.
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:36.740]   And by the way, I suspect it's going to be amazing.
[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:40.180]   This new AI Luma.
[00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.180]   Right.
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.820]   Smiler must have been working with Apple.
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.260]   And it's not out yet, but I'd be very interested to see how it works.
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:52.020]   And so because that works so well on an iPad pro with no hiccups, right?
[00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.940]   And it like it flies.
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:27:00.820]   I think that what Leo just stated, the requirements for what pro apps do in an Intel architecture,
[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:06.220]   we're all thinking about this based off of our previous knowledge of the way the Intel
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.700]   AKA X86 architecture works, right?
[00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.940]   Whether it be Intel or AMD, whichever.
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:16.780]   So maybe this theory just quite doesn't match what we're getting to right now.
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:17.780]   I'm sure it doesn't.
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:22.460]   That's why taking away, like you said, the clock speeds and all that stuff is actually
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.780]   a viable situation here because it's different.
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:31.140]   And we mixed up Luma, Luma NAR, AI, I'll start my LumaFusion, the video editing.
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:32.140]   Oh, LumaFusion.
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:33.140]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.140]   I'm sorry.
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.140]   Not Luma NAR.
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.140]   Yeah.
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:37.140]   Yeah.
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.460]   I had a 4K on an iPad pro so fast that it's actually faster for me to do the basic cuts
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:40.460]   on the iPad.
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.460]   Yeah.
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.980]   And then using the XML, open it up and final cut and policy.
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:46.020]   Affinity, they showed affinity.
[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:51.540]   In fact, they had a very fun clip show of all the developers, people like Cable Sasser
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:59.620]   of Panic and Affinity was there and going like nuts over this new processor.
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:04.140]   And I think that was important because the biggest haul for Apple is going to be getting
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:08.900]   developers to start compiling for M1 instead of compiling for Intel.
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:12.380]   And they want the developers to really see what's going on.
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:13.700]   Somebody in the chat room saying, "No.
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:17.500]   If you're a developer and you're doing a lot of compiling, you need more RAM."
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.940]   And again, I think this is going to be the biggest thing Apple's fighting against is
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:22.780]   this Intel notion.
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:24.620]   Remember, Intel's segmented RAM.
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:27.060]   There's doing a lot of swapping.
[00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.940]   The RAM is on the I/O bus.
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.100]   It's not internal.
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:35.900]   I think a unified memory architecture, which means RAM is much speedier and optimized tuned
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:41.980]   software and tuned operating system may mean RAM demands are much lower.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.980]   I think we just don't know until we get these.
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:50.740]   You may be able to run 100 Chrome tabs in 16 gigs and it just works beautifully.
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:51.740]   Now that will only happen.
[00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:53.420]   So how many three of us feel older real quick?
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.420]   Yeah.
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:57.060]   You guys remember this exact conversation at risk?
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.060]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:04.260]   The 7,100, 6,100, whatever the original switchover from the motorline.
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:05.260]   16,000.
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:06.260]   Yeah.
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:07.260]   I love the motorola.
[00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:08.260]   I loved it.
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:09.260]   That was a flat memory architecture.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.260]   Didn't have that crap until second.
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.900]   This exact conversation happened.
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:12.900]   Yeah.
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.500]   It's not going to be enough because it's not going to work and it's not going to work.
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:16.860]   And yet we all use it every day.
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:19.900]   And half the people making those comments right now weren't around for the original
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:20.900]   conversation.
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:24.100]   So I guess the thing to say is it's not ARM.
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.260]   It's not until all bets are off until we get these chips.
[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.260]   Now I ordered a 13 inch MacBook Pro loaded.
[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:33.500]   So unfortunately, that's not coming for two weeks.
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:37.980]   You can most of these other ones you can order today for delivery in one week on the
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:38.980]   17th.
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.860]   Was that where did you run out and buy something?
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:42.860]   I didn't.
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:47.300]   I had to run to the bathroom and by then, you know, too late.
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:48.300]   Yeah.
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.300]   Yeah.
[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.300]   No, it's good.
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.420]   I actually did order the wallet for the Maxi wallet though.
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:57.560]   So you know, the Apple Store is definitely still getting my money, but I am very much
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:58.560]   on the fence.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.860]   I have a 13 inch MacBook Pro and pleases me they've kept the gold because they keep
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:05.940]   taking the pretty colors away from me and Apple please stop taking the pretty colors
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:06.940]   away from me.
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:12.180]   But Pro is two colors, silver and space gray.
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:13.180]   Yeah.
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:14.900]   Yeah, but at least the air still comes.
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:15.900]   The air is still in gold.
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:16.900]   Okay, good.
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:17.900]   We're like a rose gold.
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:21.740]   And I was actually using one during the live event, you know, to take notes and tweet
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:25.420]   about, you know, Craig Vetterigee and all the important things.
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:27.820]   And, you know, it's a great machine.
[00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.540]   And I'm there going, do I want to upgrade this?
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:31.540]   Yes.
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.020]   Do I need to upgrade this?
[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.020]   Probably not.
[00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:39.380]   But I justify giving this to my mom so that I can order a new one probably.
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:44.060]   So I'm probably going to get one, but I haven't got one just yet because it very much depends,
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.660]   you know, how are developers doing?
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:49.820]   So we saw loads of developers there in the keynote going nuts over this and having a
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:53.620]   great time and, you know, they've been the developer kits have been available.
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:58.820]   People have been compiling their apps stuff works, but does everything work?
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:01.780]   Like I use screen flow on an almost daily basis.
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:02.780]   Is that going to recompile?
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:03.780]   Good question.
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:04.780]   I'm a silicon.
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:05.780]   Yeah.
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.540]   Probably not straight off the bat.
[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.660]   And so I'm going to need to keep this machine around.
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:11.980]   And then I'm switching between two desktop machines.
[00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:13.460]   Does that make sense?
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.300]   Or do I just want to on the go?
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:19.780]   But then I still need to be able to use screen flow if this machine packs it in.
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.100]   And there's, there's a whole debate there.
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.620]   So I'm going to be a slightly later adopter for this one.
[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:28.780]   Doesn't mean I won't get first gen, but I'm definitely not going today.
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:33.220]   So a lot of it would be prudent for a lot of people to wait and see.
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:38.980]   For instance, it may well be that in that screen flow in Rosetta to runs as well, just
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:42.500]   because of the M one's capabilities, but we just don't know.
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:47.820]   And so it would be very prudent to wait and see if the thing that you need is going to
[00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:49.100]   run well on an M one.
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:52.340]   If you use all Apple software, well, you're fine.
[00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:57.780]   They mentioned Adobe mentioned, for instance, Lightroom next month, Photoshop early next
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:01.140]   year, but the Creative Cloud is going to be slow to move over.
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:05.300]   If you're using Illustrator and that's your day to day operations, you're going to want
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.300]   to see somebody benchmark it.
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:12.900]   But the thing is you're probably also using a Mac Pro or an iMac Pro for many of these
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:13.900]   people.
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:17.700]   So that's going to be later in 2021 or even 2022.
[00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:20.420]   They still say two years for the transition.
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.420]   Yeah.
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.620]   That was super interesting too.
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.380]   They said something that was absolutely gutsy.
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:29.700]   They said when they were talking about compatibility, obviously their big cell is universal apps.
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:33.580]   And it's also great that you can mention iPad and iPhone apps.
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:37.660]   But when they're talking about Rosetta too, they actually said that it runs thanks to
[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:43.260]   metal, some apps actually run better under Rosetta emulation than they did on a native
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:46.700]   Intel CPU, which is okay.
[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:49.100]   Another thing to test, but that's sticking your neck out.
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.660]   I think that has a lot to do with the memory lane.
[00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.980]   That sounds so weird when you say it out loud.
[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:57.940]   In my head, it made so much sense memory lane.
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:03.660]   I think it has to do with memory lane, but also transferring information back and forth
[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:04.700]   to the processor.
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:05.700]   Right?
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.140]   So wait, I just renamed it processor.
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:11.900]   The other one that comes up real quick, I'm just reading through this again, the eight
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.860]   cores based off of four performance cores, that's like what we're used to.
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.140]   And then there's four more efficiency cores.
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:21.820]   Like when you're doing something and you tell your friend, hey, hold this real quick, because
[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:22.820]   you just ran out of hands.
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.820]   It doesn't really have to do anything.
[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:29.180]   But just by getting that other stuff out of your hands, so you're not like, you know,
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:32.460]   octopus holding something, you tell somebody hold this, you can do this real quick and
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.660]   grab it back is more efficient.
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:38.780]   So it's saying that for those cores are like helper cores, and it puts lightweight running
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:44.460]   tasks that frees up the regular cores to actually do the gut work.
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:48.780]   So I think this also works with Rosetta too as well.
[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:53.060]   It'll also be interesting, you know, the UMA means that the GPU and the CPU are accessing
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:54.700]   the same memory.
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:58.140]   There's not a discrete memory for the GPU.
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:59.620]   So you don't have to move stuff around.
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:02.700]   You don't have to copy it.
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:06.860]   This is a new architecture, and I don't think we really know what it's going to look like
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:08.140]   in desktop computing.
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:12.540]   You can't compare it to Windows on ARM using a Snapdragon chip.
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:15.780]   You can't compare it to your phone or your tablet.
[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:18.820]   I think this is going to be something very different.
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:23.820]   And so it's just we're just going to have to, you know, wait and see.
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:30.300]   Really intriguing the way they're doing this unified memory architecture.
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:37.460]   Fabric is built in, so they're going to be able to have this very fast movement of data
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:48.140]   throughout the system, they say they're quoting 3.9 times faster video processing, 7.1 times
[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:50.820]   faster image processing.
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:55.260]   You know, even if you're using Rosetta too, if you have that kind of speed available.
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:58.380]   Rosemary, do you use Xcode at all?
[00:34:58.380 --> 00:34:59.380]   Yes.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:00.380]   Yeah.
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:06.900]   I mean Xcode probably every other day at the moment, but I'm using the JetBrains ID suite
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:07.900]   almost constantly.
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:08.900]   So there you go.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:09.900]   I difference.
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:13.500]   JetBrains, which is written in Java, it's probably not going to run well.
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.540]   I don't know what I would expect.
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:20.060]   Xcode, which is a big, big program, but will be is obviously going to be optimized for
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:22.060]   M1, will probably take that.
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:23.060]   That's one of the examples.
[00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:24.060]   Of course it is.
[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:25.220]   2.8 times faster.
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:26.220]   Yeah.
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:29.580]   So I think that they're going to use the memory better.
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.980]   You're going to, are you doing, what are you doing with JetBrains?
[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:34.580]   Are you doing Java programming?
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:36.540]   No, I am a web developer.
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:41.660]   So I could switch to Visual Code Studio or something like that, but I need something that's an
[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:42.660]   ID.
[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:43.660]   You know what you're going to like?
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:44.660]   You know something.
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:46.460]   And cable SAS with panic was there is Nova.
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:47.460]   Yeah.
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:48.860]   I'm looking forward to Nova.
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:50.300]   Nova's going to be great.
[00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:54.260]   I've just been using JetBrains because I also have it installed on Windows.
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:59.260]   So if my work machine is not available, I can promote into my virtual Windows machine.
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:03.580]   I've been using Nova both on the Mac and they have basically Nova for iPad, which is,
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:04.900]   they call code editor.
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:14.940]   And the integrated shell SSH, SFTP, and then editors is really great, but it's a brand
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:15.940]   new product.
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:19.940]   And so it doesn't have as many plugins as say, VS code or JetBrains.
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:25.940]   So it's coming on, but the fact is it's pretty clear panic is going to make it M1 compatible
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:26.940]   out of the box.
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:27.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:28.940]   Yeah.
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:31.860]   Pretty certain they wouldn't have had cable in the video talking about it.
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:32.860]   Exactly.
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:33.860]   Exactly.
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:37.540]   And the icon looks pretty too.
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:40.740]   I'm just installing a mixer on a very laptop.
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:41.740]   Cool.
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:43.220]   So I can give it a go on that.
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:47.380]   We should, by the way, mention big sir comes out in two days.
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.300]   I kind of didn't mention that.
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.300]   They gave developers twice as much notice.
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.300]   Two whole days.
[00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:58.140]   It's going to be very interesting to see.
[00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:02.180]   You know, I think maybe if you're using an Intel Mac, you might slow down, hold off,
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:07.340]   stay with Mojave, or I'm sorry, Catalina or Mojave if you're still on Mojave.
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:13.500]   But clearly, if you're using Apple Silicon, you're going to want to be using big sir.
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:18.700]   This is where Apple has such an advantage to be able to design the processor for the
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:24.180]   operating system and the operating system for the processor could make a huge difference.
[00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.180]   Yeah.
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:30.380]   We've seen this scenario play out on the iPad where people get tricked into thinking that
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:35.260]   it's not one of the most powerful ultra light notebooks on the market simply by virtue of
[00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:39.180]   the fact that, oh, well, it doesn't come with a keyboard, but it is an amazing price per
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:40.180]   performance device.
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:47.100]   When you get into the pro line, it is really amongst the best in class for $1,000, $1,100
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:50.140]   for this kind of a device.
[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:54.700]   It's going to be keen to see exactly how well these things perform in the real world.
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:38:00.340]   Also the other part, we've always been wondering about what kind of performance it's about.
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.580]   What's the advantage of where are we going to be getting?
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:06.500]   Secondly, what kind of thermal and battery improvements are we going to be getting?
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:11.780]   But also, what kind of things that are iPhone-ish, are they going to be able to bake right into
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:15.860]   the Mac now that they are being able to do the entire widget?
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:21.980]   And one of the most intriguing little squares on the Hollywood Squares sheet for the M1 is
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:31.980]   the cryptography acceleration, which kind of makes me wonder is this thing going to be
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:38.060]   number one as secure as an iPhone, which is pretty damn secure, but also as almost impossible
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:41.340]   to do anything that Apple doesn't want you to do with it.
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:46.500]   If they move to a point of view where every single piece of data inside this system is
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:51.220]   going to be encrypted and decrypted where it's practical and where it's possible, you
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:55.420]   can't and you're no longer able to really install the code that you want to, you're
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:39:00.060]   no longer willing to get access to the data that you want to.
[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:04.460]   That's something worth watching, both in terms of features that could be added and things
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:08.260]   that could be a bummer for people who kind of expect a no holds barred.
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.100]   I am the god of this machine experience.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:14.180]   Let's take a break and that's a good place to come back to.
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:18.180]   We'll talk about Windows compatibility and I doubt very much you'll be able to install
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:21.740]   Linux on these machines, but that's an excellent point.
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:23.140]   There is a secure enclave.
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:25.340]   We'll talk about that as well.
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:30.140]   Andy Anacos here filling in for an a Richie Doc Rock with the gray beard.
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:31.140]   Good.
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:32.140]   Like it.
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:33.140]   Great look.
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:38.220]   He's our Tube buddy from youtube.com/docrock and Rosemary Orchard, who we just adore from
[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:39.420]   rosemaryorchard.com.
[00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:45.480]   She's a developer and expert on scripting and Web Dev and coming all the way from the
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.820]   UK where it's the middle of the night.
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:50.220]   No, actually it's not unusually not.
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:51.220]   Just evening, right?
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:52.220]   Just evening.
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:53.220]   APM.
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:54.220]   APM.
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.220]   Not bad.
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:56.220]   Just evening.
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:57.700]   Our show today brought to you by how was the day?
[00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:58.700]   Was it a nice day?
[00:39:58.700 --> 00:39:59.700]   It feels pretty good so far.
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:00.700]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:01.700]   It was sunny.
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:02.700]   It was warm outside.
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:03.700]   It was good.
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:04.700]   You're going to have a great day.
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.540]   I showed today.
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.300]   I wish I'd called you on election day.
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:10.900]   You could have given us some heads up.
[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:14.380]   I mean, I would have told you it was going to go well and I'm very pleased to dip.
[00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:15.380]   You could have reduced some of this.
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:17.980]   Could have reduced some of this stress ahead of time for us.
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.320]   Our show today brought to you by LastPass.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:25.560]   Boy, I'll tell you what, I am so glad that I started using LastPass 12 years ago.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:30.620]   I'm so glad, even more so, that we moved the company to LastPass half a dozen years
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:37.300]   ago because with employees out in the real world no longer in the safe, comfortable confines
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:42.420]   of the office, but they still have access to all of our precious resources, our bank
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:45.300]   accounts, our website, our databases.
[00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:49.220]   I want to make sure they're just as secure out there and that's what LastPass does.
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:52.380]   LastPass has been our choice for identity and access management.
[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:54.900]   It really should be yours.
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:59.220]   They were named a leader in the G2 Fall Grid reports, which is, you're probably familiar
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:04.420]   with it, leading peer-to-peer review site, unbiased user reviews, leading software solutions,
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:10.220]   746 customers, 93% rated four or five stars as good as you can get.
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:12.180]   I mean, just really strong.
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:17.660]   But hey, just talk to your friends, talk to your IT guys, talk to your experts, the
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:22.220]   security gurus, people like Steve Gibson, they will all agree LastPass does everything
[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:23.940]   right.
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:28.380]   And for your IT department, with all those people out there working from home, they'll
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:29.900]   be very happy.
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:32.380]   They have control from a central dashboard.
[00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:37.580]   They can integrate LastPass into their existing workflows to onboard users, to delete users,
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:41.060]   to sync groups, to revoke access.
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:45.460]   Users can customize their admin privileges so that you can give privileges to people,
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:50.260]   but they have very limited access or access to just the parts of the system that you want
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:51.700]   them to access.
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:58.380]   You gain company-wide visibility into everything, even how well your users are doing in terms
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:00.340]   of making their passwords for every employee.
[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:05.100]   You can review password scores, gain access to shared accounts, monitor group memberships
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:06.100]   and more.
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.220]   Your employees can share passwords securely.
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:12.580]   They don't have to text them or email them, they can use LastPass, go right within LastPass
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:16.780]   and take advantage of LastPass's superior encryption.
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:18.060]   LastPass just is the best.
[00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:19.860]   You can require MFA.
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:24.940]   We require two-factor, but LastPass can even do contextual factors like geolocation and
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:26.440]   IP address.
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:30.740]   Their built-in password generator gives you long, randomized passwords that you could
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:34.380]   never remember, but fortunately, LastPass does.
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:39.140]   And I just think it's the best, so secure that I store everything in it.
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:41.700]   It's my secure enclave on every device I use.
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:44.980]   iOS, Android, iMac, Windows, Linux.
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:48.060]   I am a huge LastPass fan.
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:52.380]   There's over 100 policies that you can implement as an administrator.
[00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.460]   There's advanced security features.
[00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:59.380]   You can use the out-of-the-box configurations or you can tweak it to your heart's content.
[00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:01.540]   Eight awards so far this year for LastPass.
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:05.900]   PC Magazine's editor's choice, they were the Fortress Cyber Security Award winner, Business
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:10.260]   Insiders, best overall password manager just to name a few.
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:11.940]   We love LastPass.
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:13.500]   You need LastPass.
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:15.700]   Take control of your password security.
[00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:17.980]   Go to lastpass.com/twit.
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:19.220]   Lastpass.com/twit.
[00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:23.780]   I think you're going to like it.
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:25.620]   There's a free 14-day trial.
[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:28.020]   No credit card required.
[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:29.500]   I wouldn't even bother with a trial.
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:30.500]   Just do it.
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:31.500]   LastPass.
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:35.980]   Nextpass.com/twit for you and for your business.
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:41.780]   A press release came out right after the Apple event from Parallels.
[00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:45.780]   Parallels plus Apple Silicon.
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:49.340]   They've been working on it.
[00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:55.100]   They don't give an exact date, but they say that fortunately Parallels access, Parallels
[00:43:55.100 --> 00:44:00.500]   Toolbox and Parallels client software works smoothly with Rosetta even before we rebuilt
[00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:04.500]   them as universal binaries.
[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:09.740]   The current version of Parallels Desktop for Mac cannot work to run virtual machines on
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:15.020]   Silicon Mac, but, and this is the bottom line from Parallels, a new version that can run
[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:17.860]   on active silicon as an Apple active development.
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:19.700]   It's going to be a while.
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:22.100]   It's going to be a while.
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:27.900]   I'm surprised they've known this for six months.
[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:31.060]   They could have done better and getness ready.
[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:35.260]   VMware has also said we're doing it, but I don't know if it'll be available.
[00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:37.980]   Bootcamp, Apple's already said won't run.
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:45.340]   I suspect because of this secure enclave, and basically this is the T2 chip for it large,
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:49.300]   you won't be able to run anything like Linux.
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:53.020]   It'll be your Mac is a Mac machine period from now on.
[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.020]   Well, that's to be expected.
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:45:00.180]   We were always getting Intel compatibility free because it was running Intel chips.
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:01.180]   Right.
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:07.740]   VMware Fusion says we're not ready to make any announcements.
[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:11.100]   Any plans for VMware Fusion to run on Apple Silicon?
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:13.900]   We're not ready to make any announcements for or against this yet.
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:15.420]   I'm kind of surprised to hear that.
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:18.020]   This back in September.
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:21.180]   Apple did mention them specifically.
[00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:29.380]   I guess just like Rosemary shouldn't buy a M1 based Mac to run her jet brains.
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:34.340]   If you're running Fusion or parallels, you might want to wait.
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:39.460]   If you need Bootcamp, you definitely don't want to make this jump.
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:42.820]   Linux will run an emulation if emulators are available.
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:43.820]   Yeah.
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:46.020]   That was the thing that was heavy on my mind.
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:53.700]   I was giving up on Windows, but there are a lot of people who run Linux inside of VM
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:57.220]   because it's just the best hardware, the best balance of productivity software, but
[00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:02.380]   they can also use it for their web development and further development tools.
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:06.940]   If there is anything, again, perhaps regarding the secure enclave that says, "Well, no,
[00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:09.700]   we don't recognize this operating system you're trying to run and therefore we're going
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:11.020]   to block it from running it."
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:16.900]   For next step after that, we won't even allow a developer to compile a version of open-source
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.340]   Linux that will run in the M1.
[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:24.300]   That could be a problem for a certain percentage of the pro users I'm guessing.
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:25.300]   Yeah.
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:29.500]   You mentioned Craig Federegge, Rosemary Orchard.
[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:34.180]   He was back and he was giving that MacBook Air an interesting look.
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:35.700]   He had a great moment.
[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:36.700]   Yes.
[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:37.700]   A great moment.
[00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:43.260]   Boy, they couldn't have made it more Craig.
[00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:48.020]   He was ostensibly at this point demonstrating the instant on the MacBook Air, which they
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:51.260]   hadn't yet announced, so I guess they didn't want to go into detail.
[00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:56.060]   It did turn on immediately, but somehow it seems like that wasn't his primary focus.
[00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:57.060]   I don't know.
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:58.060]   Yeah.
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:46:59.060]   Yeah.
[00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:00.060]   It was definitely interesting.
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:05.980]   I'm glad to see their instant on because that is one thing I noticed with my machine.
[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:11.220]   I open it and you're waiting a little bit and then you wait a little bit more and then
[00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:14.540]   your wrist buzzes and it says "Unlocking with Apple Watch."
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:15.540]   Right.
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:19.180]   And then you put your finger on the touch ID because it's been there a very long time
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:20.180]   and then it unlocks.
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:21.180]   You need a new machine.
[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:24.340]   I hate to tell you, Rosemary, the newer machines aren't that bad.
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:25.340]   You definitely...
[00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:26.340]   Well, I mean, this is the new MacBook Air.
[00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:27.340]   Really?
[00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:31.100]   I think it's in March last year, but I've just got it fully loaded with a ton of stuff
[00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:33.500]   and I never quit and I think.
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:39.300]   So it's my own fault, but at the same time, I do exactly on this what I would expect
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:41.260]   to your average consumer to do.
[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:47.900]   The last time I checked my mom's iPhone, she had 387 tabs open in Safari because she didn't
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:52.420]   know that there are tabs in Safari even though I explained it like 80,000 times.
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:56.700]   So Safari now also closes her tabs after a week for her or whatever the minimum is in
[00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:58.220]   the settings.
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.380]   But that's what people do.
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:06.740]   They don't expect to have to close things to manage RAM and memory and to know that they
[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:10.740]   need to shut things down before it will do an update and leave it on charge.
[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:16.020]   They just expect it to work, which is good, but also not great if you want your machine
[00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:18.020]   to run really well.
[00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:20.060]   So here's the thing that's going to change about this.
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:23.260]   And I think this is very promising and very awesome.
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:27.180]   I think the number one reason why Instanton is going to work is because we already have
[00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:32.260]   multiple Instanton devices in our Apple ecosystem, that being our phones and our iPads, being
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:35.860]   that this architecture is quite similar, it's going to be different.
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:40.020]   And the key to that and then probably the number one reason why your Instanton doesn't
[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:46.500]   perform the way you assume it should is because if it is a network reaching app, network has
[00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:47.820]   to reconnect.
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:53.740]   If you were to just say open 20 more apps, but none of them are network oriented, it
[00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:56.340]   would open on all day, all day, all day.
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:49:01.380]   But Wake On Land is not in Apple's hands in that particular case.
[00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:06.420]   In this new case, because of the way it's built into the chip, Wake On Land is going
[00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:08.180]   to be a little bit faster.
[00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:12.820]   So therefore, when you open up the app similar to your phone, similar to your iPad, it will
[00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:18.540]   be able to reconnect even with a pseudo network first, which is what phones do.
[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:22.500]   Phones have this little pseudo network it connects to and it's like, okay, don't freak out.
[00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:27.860]   I'll let the other stuff catch up to me later, but I want to give the user the perception
[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:30.340]   that it's already connected.
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:31.340]   Is it what I'm saying?
[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:36.180]   So now that's going to go away because we are working with an iPhone, iPad or an Instant
[00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:38.340]   chip that's even bigger, better and stronger.
[00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:42.420]   So it's just it's your network stuff that's doing this low, nothing else.
[00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:43.420]   Yeah.
[00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:45.500]   And that was something else I found interesting.
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:49.260]   The NIMAC support Wi-Fi 6, which is great.
[00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:52.180]   I'm not sure how many reaches out there actually support that.
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:56.100]   I knew the new arrows do, which I just bought the old arrows because the new arrows aren't
[00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:59.540]   available just yet here in the UK and my network was dire.
[00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:00.540]   So it's better.
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:02.900]   But, you know, I have six.
[00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:05.340]   It doesn't make that big a difference.
[00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:06.940]   For most people, it won't make a difference.
[00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:10.820]   For some people, it absolutely will make a difference, but you've got to have the hardware
[00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:16.180]   on both sides to support it and how many people are using an ISP provided for you.
[00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:17.180]   Right.
[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:25.740]   So when I had the Orbi Wi-Fi 6s and the iPhone is Wi-Fi 6, you know, 10% maybe faster, but
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:30.900]   it wasn't so fast that when I put in the ubiquity, they don't have Wi-Fi 6 and I didn't miss it.
[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:36.900]   So I think a good a good a good router, as you say, is probably more important than Wi-Fi
[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.700]   5 or Wi-Fi 6.
[00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:42.460]   I'm just glad that app I get I wonder because all of the new ones have Wi-Fi 6.
[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:46.180]   I wonder that must be part of the SOC as well.
[00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:51.580]   You know, in the beauty pageants, they always ask the question for the participants, if you
[00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:54.180]   could change one thing about the world, what would it be?
[00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:58.300]   If I was having to be on the old ugly pageant and they ask me that question, I'd be like,
[00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:03.300]   I'd like to give everyone ubiquity networks because everything is not quite ubiquity.
[00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:05.860]   That would be my only answer.
[00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:10.140]   I could solve world peace because no one's mad at their network because ubiquity just
[00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:11.900]   but it's not Wi-Fi 6.
[00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:16.100]   I'm just saying don't feel bad Rosemary because your Wi-Fi 5, your hosts are probably
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:17.100]   pretty.
[00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:18.100]   Are you getting?
[00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:19.100]   Are they working pretty well?
[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:23.060]   You know, my only device is because support is the iPhone 12 for a max, which is arriving
[00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:25.740]   on Friday, theoretically.
[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:30.580]   And you know, one device out of all of the things I have connected to my network and
[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:33.220]   also I just hard wear everything I can anyway.
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:37.180]   I ordered the max too and now I'm very nervous because everybody like Neil Eipatel and the
[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:42.820]   other reviewers, the reviews came out a couple of days ago, say, it's really big.
[00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:45.740]   They're like, oh my, this is big.
[00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:50.740]   Renee hold them up side by side and you kind of debunk that a little bit.
[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.140]   Rosemary has the case.
[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:53.140]   That's huge.
[00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:54.820]   It says it's my head.
[00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:55.820]   Oh, wait.
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:56.820]   No, it is.
[00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:57.820]   But you know what?
[00:51:57.820 --> 00:51:58.820]   It is big.
[00:51:58.820 --> 00:51:59.820]   It is.
[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:00.820]   But I checked.
[00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:05.300]   I put my 10S max in this case and it's barely bigger.
[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:08.300]   The only reason why it seems bigger is because the sides are straight.
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:09.700]   Yeah, the screen is bigger too.
[00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:10.700]   I mean, right?
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:14.340]   Yeah, because it extends all the way to the sides because the sides are flat.
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:15.340]   Right.
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:16.340]   Good.
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:17.340]   I won't be.
[00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:19.340]   You obviously aren't worried, so I shouldn't be.
[00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:20.340]   I mean, I don't have a lot of.
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:21.340]   I am checking my orders.
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:22.340]   Taddis though.
[00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:26.740]   Rosemary said she said it might be coming Friday.
[00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:29.780]   I'm like, what might let me take my orders down.
[00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:36.700]   I mean, I'm always slightly dubious until something's actually out for delivery and
[00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:37.700]   this was well proven.
[00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:40.420]   I was supposed to have a toilet delivered last Wednesday and they told me in the morning
[00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:43.780]   it had been dispatched and was supposed to be coming and at eight o'clock in the evening
[00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:44.780]   it still wasn't here.
[00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:47.380]   Like, oh no, we actually don't have toilets in stock.
[00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:48.380]   It was never.
[00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:49.740]   I'm just going to share.
[00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:53.460]   It's too late for you, but I'm just going to share my own experience.
[00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:56.580]   Mail order toilets are not all they're cracked up to be.
[00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:58.900]   If you can get one locally.
[00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:03.420]   Not exactly just go wandering around looking, you know, wandering into every hardware store
[00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:05.580]   going, yes, I guess.
[00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:06.580]   I guess.
[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:09.820]   It feels like somebody should just bring you a toilet.
[00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:12.060]   I mean, you're going to have somebody install it.
[00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:13.780]   You're not installing it yourself, are you?
[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:14.780]   No, the plumber.
[00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:15.780]   The plumber is making.
[00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:17.540]   You ordered it all my behalf.
[00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:18.540]   Okay.
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:20.060]   Yeah, I guess that's all right.
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:22.780]   We ordered a we have those Japanese toilets.
[00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:29.180]   We ordered it one mail order and it came broken and because it's ceramic and it took us a
[00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:31.460]   while to get the thing replaced.
[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:33.620]   So they were so much alike.
[00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:38.580]   The other thing that I would love to give the entire world is Japanese toilets.
[00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:42.940]   I went to college and took out university and I was a fan.
[00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:48.300]   And yeah, until everybody, if you tell you experience the Japanese toilet, you do not
[00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:50.500]   know like that.
[00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:52.860]   Is it too late Rosemary to upgrade?
[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:54.860]   Yes, unfortunately.
[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:57.620]   The plumbing is not actually compatible.
[00:53:57.620 --> 00:53:58.620]   I did look.
[00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:01.900]   Oh, yeah, because you have to have a plug.
[00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:03.820]   You have to plug it in.
[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:07.620]   Yeah, UK bathrooms are extremely strongly regulated on the wall.
[00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:09.140]   Electric you can put in there.
[00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:10.140]   Everything has to be on a full court.
[00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:11.140]   You can't have a switch.
[00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:12.700]   Oh, that makes sense.
[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:15.300]   Yeah, they don't want you to shock yourself.
[00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:20.380]   Yeah, because we have those wonderful 240 volts, which means that we can do things like
[00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:21.980]   boil tea kill really fast.
[00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:23.940]   Electric can do so very easily.
[00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:28.380]   Is that why it's 240 in UK so that you could boil your tea faster?
[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:29.380]   I bet it is.
[00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:33.300]   I'm 100% serious based on the rate of water for tea.
[00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:34.940]   I never thought of that.
[00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:36.900]   I've always wondered we're 120 year to 40.
[00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:37.900]   I never understood.
[00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:39.100]   No, I get it.
[00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:41.300]   Yeah, it's all about the tea.
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:42.300]   Priorities.
[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:43.300]   British problems.
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:50.980]   The thing that we should probably pay the most attention to with the M1 is power, the
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:54.700]   power curve.
[00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:59.300]   I think people are reluctant to do that too much because it implies is great battery
[00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:01.500]   life.
[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:05.700]   But power curve is also tied to performance.
[00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:12.020]   In this curve that they show early on, they show the latest PC laptop chip.
[00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:15.420]   Notice no mention of Intel at all.
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:22.660]   In its power curve, well above 10 watts, the M1 at any power is faster than the latest
[00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:26.460]   PC laptop chip, whatever that is.
[00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:29.500]   By the way, Intel is also in Mac and Tasha.
[00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:33.860]   That could be an I9 16 inch MacBook Pro for all we know.
[00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:38.300]   At 10 watts, this is a very low power chip.
[00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:43.060]   The reason that's important is thermals, especially in laptops and small enclosures like the Mac
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:44.060]   Mini.
[00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:45.220]   The thermals can kill you.
[00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:49.980]   They can make a chip never operated at its full speed.
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:50.980]   True to.
[00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:51.980]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:55.060]   There's a reason why we mentioned before that they're not talking about gigahertz and
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:57.380]   are talking about statistics like that.
[00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:00.700]   But they are talking about things like performance per watt, which is something they could very,
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:04.820]   very easily explain and the benefits are also very, very easy to comprehend.
[00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:13.260]   They say the M1 will match peak PC performance using a quarter of the power and it's up to
[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:16.660]   twice as fast as CPU performance because of that.
[00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:18.900]   And of course the battery lives are impressive.
[00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:20.940]   It's actually what put me over the top.
[00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:26.140]   The top battery life is on the MacBook Pro 13 inch.
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:31.820]   They're claiming 20 hours of video viewing, which makes it basically like the iPhone Pro
[00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:32.820]   Max.
[00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:34.980]   It's the same spec.
[00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:38.380]   That's pretty, to me, that's pretty exciting.
[00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:45.120]   Yeah, that's an interesting statistic too because they were, again, this is why we screen
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:48.620]   capture every time they put on that big grid of pictures at the end of talking about the
[00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:49.620]   chip.
[00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:54.100]   But the M1 chip has a section that's talking about how it's doing a lot of onboard acceleration,
[00:56:54.100 --> 00:57:00.700]   a long, long, long onboard support for HDR graphics, onboard support for accelerated
[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:02.980]   accelerated H.264 and such.
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:08.860]   So I don't, Apple is usually very, very trustworthy when they come to battery life numbers.
[00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:12.100]   If anything, they tend to be a little bit conservative, but that could be an indication
[00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:17.100]   of how well it's taking on as optimizing for a lot of very, very popular activities,
[00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:20.860]   such as video streaming, such as video playback.
[00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:28.180]   Either way, when they went to the more conventional metric, which is basically Wi-Fi video access,
[00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:34.580]   that still gives you potentially an entire day free from a free from a power outlet,
[00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:37.060]   which is one hell of a nice thing.
[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:42.780]   It seems as long enough that so long as you're not waking up, pulling your Mac book into
[00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:47.620]   bed with you, starting work and then ending work, it was time to go back to bed again.
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:50.460]   It seems like there's a possibility that this thing could actually last you all day
[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:54.900]   without having ever see a power outlet, which is, again, that's the thing that is going
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:59.660]   to get a lot of people to buy first-generation hardware, that if they were already sort of
[00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:04.340]   to my Mac book is two or three years old or I've already gummed up the keyboard so bad
[00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:07.860]   that I've been sort of holding off until the next thing comes, that could be the thing
[00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:11.820]   that gets people to click that buy it now button, the idea of all day battery life just
[00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:13.380]   like you've got on your iPad.
[00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:16.140]   Rosemary, you use laptops.
[00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:18.260]   Is that because you want battery?
[00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:20.740]   Do you want to be mobile?
[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:26.220]   Well, work provided me with laptops because that's what they have Mac book, Mac-wise,
[00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:30.060]   they don't or at least didn't give out Mac minis as hardware.
[00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:31.060]   That's interesting.
[00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:33.060]   All our employees wanted laptops.
[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:34.060]   Yeah.
[00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:38.380]   And it's useful, you don't need a UPS because you've got one built right in, which is pretty
[00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:39.380]   nice.
[00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:45.420]   And there's some other benefits, especially I work with some fairly important systems.
[00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:48.900]   This is pretty useful to just be able to chuck it in the boot of your car when you're going
[00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:52.940]   somewhere and know that if something goes offline, you've got battery and you can tether
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:54.820]   and you're good.
[00:58:54.820 --> 00:59:00.980]   But my main personal machine is a Mac mini and it works great, but I do love all day battery
[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:05.780]   life from my iPad Pro.
[00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:09.300]   And I would be really good to get that on the MacBook Air, especially considering how
[00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:12.380]   much development work I'm actually doing.
[00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:16.620]   And the fact that doing it on an iPad means that I have to either remote into another
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:23.780]   machine or have a virtual machine running somewhere or Mac mini server is in Mac Stadium
[00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:26.500]   or something like that.
[00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:31.140]   So battery life is definitely something that is one of the things that has me looking at
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:34.700]   the new MacBooks going.
[00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:35.700]   Maybe I should.
[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:36.700]   I don't know.
[00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:37.700]   Yeah.
[00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:45.380]   I'm Mac, but I find that most of my computing is on the laptop because I'm at breakfast
[00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:50.500]   or I'm sitting down and the easy, you know, it's just a natural.
[00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:53.060]   So I do I'm very hyperware battery life.
[00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:58.220]   I hate it when I'm sitting on the couch and the, oh, I got to plug in towards the end
[00:59:58.220 --> 00:59:59.220]   of the day.
[00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:02.780]   So I guess it's not, it's not a deal breaker.
[01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:05.780]   But boy, the idea that I wouldn't have to plug in.
[01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:10.580]   Yeah, on the couch plugged in seems it's just not really the feed it.
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:13.740]   Yeah, because it's not bad plugged in.
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:15.380]   It's just it's just not right.
[01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:16.380]   It's defeated, right?
[01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:24.580]   So I recently, I never replaced the 2012 as my, you know, notebook notebook because I've
[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:26.940]   been iPad Pro since that came out.
[01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:33.220]   I do have a 2016 MacBook Pro, but it's primarily for events or things like that.
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:37.380]   But like for the most part, it sits on the table, like it's a very expensive sit on the
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:39.340]   table door stopper.
[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:46.020]   But I just prefer to work on my iPad because I just feel it's extremely fluid.
[01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:50.980]   And I was one of the guys who I made a video explaining that an iPad can be a laptop nowadays
[01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:53.500]   considering we do so much in the cloud.
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:58.860]   And I guess I just drank Federico, cool aid.
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:03.420]   And, you know, once editing came to the iPad, it's a thing.
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:07.940]   So like I kind of want one just because I want to have a first gen chip because it's
[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:10.420]   a historical thing and I want to play with it.
[01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:11.980]   But do I really need one?
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:14.100]   No way, shape or form whatsoever.
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:19.660]   Because it's I have that iPad Pro and they haven't brought that much more to the table
[01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:23.140]   than the iPad Pro other than the fact that it's ridiculously fast.
[01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:26.860]   So yeah, it's kind of a catch-swing too because I'd be missing my pen.
[01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:31.860]   That's a I though I think a really important point is what Apple's done now is unified
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:33.260]   the product line.
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:40.540]   So it's these Apple Silicon chips all the way, you know, from iPod Touch all the way up to
[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:44.740]   the Mac Pro and eventually up to the Mac Pro.
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:49.660]   And that's going to mean that the the the differences are less obvious and there'll be
[01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:55.380]   a kind of a linear move from an iPad to say a MacBook Air.
[01:01:55.380 --> 01:02:00.540]   This is the somebody I'm thinking is screen captured those beautiful animations as they
[01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:02.100]   built these machines.
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:06.940]   This is the motherboard I don't know on on which of these devices the T2 chip is still
[01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:07.940]   there.
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:14.220]   There's still is a separate IO chip, but there's the CPU the system on a chip memory right
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:16.900]   next to it and it's it's surface mounted.
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:22.660]   So that's definitely not upgradable and an outboard thunderboard a thunderbolt controller.
[01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:25.820]   This is though and I always try to grab this if I can.
[01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:28.340]   This is what Andy was talking about these chips.
[01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:31.740]   These slides went by go by so fast.
[01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:35.140]   This is all the features of the M1 chip.
[01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:45.020]   So we in as you point out HDR imagery is in there fourth generation PCI Express.
[01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:46.860]   High efficiency audio processor.
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:50.660]   They mentioned they're going to have multiple mics on the Mac book pro.
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:52.660]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:53.660]   Also, also.
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:54.660]   Yeah, it's a mix.
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:57.300]   I'm not sure about studio quality.
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:01.460]   Yeah, that's you have people who use actual studio mics are going to be testing that very
[01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:04.180]   I won't be using a laptop to do the show.
[01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:05.900]   Let's put it that way.
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:06.900]   But it's yeah.
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:14.740]   I mean, given how much we use zoom these days, again, the 720 P camera is going to be interesting.
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:18.140]   But the microwave thing makes sense because the iPhone mics are incredible and they're
[01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:20.620]   small and the iPad mics are also true.
[01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:21.620]   And they're small.
[01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:25.820]   So if they can bring that array into the notebook level, it's okay.
[01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:29.500]   Like, I don't know why people will be like, Oh, no, it's not going to be studio quality.
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:32.460]   There's so many podcasts recorded on iPhones with anchor.
[01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:33.460]   Come on.
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:36.860]   I actually have done voiceovers on the iPhone.
[01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:39.740]   So yeah, I will say that that is actually not bad.
[01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:41.300]   Your voice is special.
[01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:42.300]   We all can.
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:43.300]   Special.
[01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:44.300]   I was.
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:46.300]   Special is not necessarily good.
[01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:50.460]   I just want to point out high performance and VME storage.
[01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:54.580]   So they are using NVME for the RAM.
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:56.060]   There's a image signal processor.
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:57.260]   We mentioned that machine learning.
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:04:00.060]   We mentioned that always on processor.
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:06.020]   That's an interesting feature.
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:07.300]   When would it not be on?
[01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:08.900]   Who turns off their processor?
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:10.900]   I'm not sure what that means.
[01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:12.740]   That helps the instant on maybe.
[01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:13.740]   Maybe that's why.
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:14.740]   Yeah.
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:15.740]   This is to do with power nap.
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:16.740]   Yeah.
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:22.060]   So that only, you know, that wakes your machine up periodically for checking email, doing backups
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:23.140]   and stuff like that.
[01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:27.620]   Maybe instead of making your machine up, it just does it.
[01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:28.620]   That's interesting.
[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:32.620]   Maybe that's a good point because if it's such a low power chip, you could have it just
[01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:33.620]   stay on.
[01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:37.780]   Well, you could just keep one of those low power cores on all the time and let the rest
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:38.780]   of them.
[01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:39.780]   That's probably what it is.
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:40.780]   Yeah.
[01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:43.540]   HDR video processor advanced display engine.
[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:50.180]   The three graphics on both the MacBook Air and the P3 screen on the MacBook Pro and the
[01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:52.060]   MacBook Air, that's great.
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:54.100]   That and True Tone as well.
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:58.700]   So the screens are, there's not the mini LED that we're hoping for next year, but it's
[01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:02.100]   a step in the right direction on these displays for sure.
[01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:03.100]   Yeah.
[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:07.580]   I think the MacBook Air seems like it's become almost a mini pro now.
[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:12.620]   They even went so far as to boast about how many different streams of 4K video it could
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:15.220]   work on at the same time without dropping a frame.
[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:17.100]   Oh, I'm being corrected.
[01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:19.860]   That is the old circuit board.
[01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:21.860]   These are all combined in the SOC.
[01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:22.860]   Never mind.
[01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:23.860]   Yeah.
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:24.860]   I apologize.
[01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:26.940]   That kind of surprised me when I saw this.
[01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:30.060]   I thought, well, wait a minute, I thought the T2 was in there and yeah, this.
[01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:32.620]   So all of those are in one SOC now.
[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:33.620]   Holy cow.
[01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:34.860]   So that gives you an idea.
[01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:36.660]   That's how it used to be.
[01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:38.360]   Wow.
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:40.300]   I could not be more excited about this.
[01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:43.740]   This is living up to, I think everything we thought.
[01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:49.300]   For instance, you can run an XDR display now off the MacBook Air.
[01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:51.020]   If you wanted to, I guess.
[01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:54.820]   Except for the fact that stand costs more money than the Mac mini.
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.740]   They did lower the price.
[01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:57.740]   Good news.
[01:05:57.740 --> 01:06:00.940]   They you're right about the Mac mini, but they lowered the price on the stand.
[01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:02.660]   It is now $900.
[01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:03.660]   Good news.
[01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:08.740]   XDR display is also the more still more than the Mac mini.
[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:09.740]   It's okay.
[01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:12.940]   Just purchased, balanced the screen very, very carefully on your desk.
[01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:17.340]   So it's exactly upright and then never actually touch your desk just in case it falls over
[01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:18.340]   in special.
[01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:21.380]   One thing you don't want to do is have that thing fall over.
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:25.540]   Everyone loves taking the crack at that stand.
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:33.420]   The stand is to Apple with the bougie is to Volkswagen.
[01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:36.020]   It's just to show you our engineering capability.
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:39.180]   All in general consumers to buy them.
[01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:40.660]   It's going to visa.
[01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:44.980]   At the same time, you know, if you know it just snowed this morning and you're going
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:50.380]   off for a walk, if you choose to put on your big top, your big top Victorian black hat
[01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:55.100]   with a school kids are getting out of school, you just got to expect to have snowball snowballs
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:56.100]   thrown at you.
[01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:59.140]   And that's what Apple does when they say, and we have a $900 stand.
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:00.140]   You're welcome.
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:06.780]   Here is the revised circuit board that replaces that big honk and old circuit board from a
[01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:08.580]   MacBook.
[01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:09.980]   It is all in there.
[01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:12.580]   It is all in the M1 chip.
[01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:14.100]   That is just remarkable.
[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:16.980]   This is the motherboard.
[01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:18.460]   It's the size of an SODIM.
[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:22.540]   I mean, wow, you could see the benefits.
[01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:29.540]   And you know, we knew that Apple would get some price benefits about making its own chips.
[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:31.860]   And I'm glad to see that they did not.
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:35.220]   They probably could have raised the prices on these, but in fact, they matched the existing
[01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:41.420]   prices in some case, lowered the prices of their new M1 based devices.
[01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:46.020]   Jim Dalrymple at the loop says, "This is so much better than I expected.
[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:54.620]   The M1 puts the Mac in a class of its own CPU, GPU battery, and every other aspect of computing."
[01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:56.860]   And therein lies the curse.
[01:07:56.860 --> 01:08:01.560]   Because everyone will want to compare it to something that it can't really be evenly
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:03.140]   compared to.
[01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:06.980]   And this happens only a couple of times in computer world.
[01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:09.260]   But like, remember the iPhone?
[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:13.820]   Remember June 29th or 2007?
[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:17.140]   Like, oh, but then it's not like this kind of phone.
[01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:18.140]   No, it's not.
[01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:19.140]   Where's the keyboard?
[01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:20.140]   It's not like this.
[01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:21.140]   It's not that kind of phone either.
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:22.140]   It's different.
[01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:23.900]   Now it's a normal conversation.
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:27.460]   When the iMac came out, same exact thing.
[01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:28.460]   But it's not.
[01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:29.460]   No, it's not.
[01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:30.460]   This is this.
[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:31.460]   Just...
[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:32.460]   Yeah.
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:37.620]   It is a watershed, I think, in CPU and PC design.
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:38.620]   Yeah.
[01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:41.140]   And it's something nobody else can do, I think.
[01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:42.140]   Interesting.
[01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:46.380]   I was just looking at the pros because David Sparks just messaged me and said, "So, Aero
[01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:47.380]   Pro."
[01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:48.540]   And so I was like, "Oh, I'll just check the pros."
[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:52.340]   I realized it's the lower end map of Pro that they've replaced here.
[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:56.100]   It's the one with two Thunderbroke Plorts on, which points to Andy's theory again earlier
[01:08:56.100 --> 01:09:01.740]   that it can't support more than two USB 4 ports potentially with that M1 chip right
[01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:02.740]   now.
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:03.740]   Won't that be interesting?
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:06.540]   How will they solve that in the higher end devices?
[01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:07.540]   Yeah.
[01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:09.540]   Well, I think they have it solved already.
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:11.740]   It's not ready for public consumption.
[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:17.340]   We had that conversation this morning on BTN, which you and it's teasing me because I didn't
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:18.340]   say Bugatti.
[01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:19.740]   I like to say Bugatti anyway.
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:20.980]   Because it's Bugatti.
[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:21.980]   I understood.
[01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:22.980]   I got it.
[01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:23.980]   Yeah.
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:24.980]   So, there's...
[01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:26.780]   I had to say Volkswagen.
[01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:31.100]   My buddy Jeff, Jeff Gavin came up with the concept that the higher end stuff, it's already
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.780]   there, but it's not ready for public consumption.
[01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:35.860]   So it's better to start here.
[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:41.020]   And also, because of, again, the gun shyness from the Intel Switch and because a lot of
[01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:47.300]   the higher end Pro users have integrated systems, it's harder to get that stuff to move over
[01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:48.740]   smoothly, right?
[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:52.260]   But for the person that uses their laptop, like what they're actually meant to do, just
[01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:56.500]   be a laptop, go out there, shift the web, do your homework, send emails of the family,
[01:09:56.500 --> 01:10:01.100]   edit pictures real quick, use it as a video consumption device and things like that, you
[01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:02.100]   can go right now.
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:04.980]   Nothing's going to change in your world, right?
[01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:11.380]   For my niece, for my sisters, for my mom, for my brother-in-law, for them, this new product
[01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:12.380]   works.
[01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:13.660]   No problems with anything else.
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:15.140]   They don't even have peripherals.
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:16.580]   They don't use peripherals.
[01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:17.980]   So none of this stuff bothers them.
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:21.180]   They just have a phone and a MacBook and they're good.
[01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:23.220]   So that's who the today's event was for.
[01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:25.540]   For everybody else, well, it doesn't do pro stuff.
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:27.060]   It's not for you, yes, son.
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:28.060]   Wait.
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:34.940]   Behall in the chatroom says, you know, if you had a dual core M1 processor and one chip,
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:37.860]   then you'd have four USB four.
[01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:40.300]   I think the 16 core will be.
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:42.300]   I think the 16 core will be.
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:43.300]   Yeah.
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:44.300]   Yes, 100%.
[01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:50.580]   So there's lots of ways to solve that.
[01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:51.580]   What else?
[01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:53.740]   Dual processors even.
[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:56.340]   You can do just two 8 core processors.
[01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:58.340]   So you have the two M1s.
[01:10:58.340 --> 01:10:59.340]   Yeah.
[01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:00.340]   Yeah.
[01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:01.340]   Yeah.
[01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.220]   Although that presents problems with the UMA and everything.
[01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:05.020]   So I don't know.
[01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:07.700]   Just make a bigger SOC.
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:08.700]   That's all.
[01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:09.700]   They can do that.
[01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:10.700]   Goodness knows.
[01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:12.500]   I'm more jazzed about that.
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:17.100]   So if you think about what Apple's poised to do is have this kind of excitement every
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:20.500]   announcement from now through 2022.
[01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:25.180]   And now let's show you what the Mac Pro is going to look like and boom, right?
[01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:27.620]   So this is just the beginning.
[01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:30.980]   This was enough to get everybody juiced up.
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:34.980]   But that's just I think it's the beginning of a row of a road that's going to be very
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:38.420]   interesting to follow.
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:40.460]   Yeah.
[01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:43.740]   They did carefully point out that this is the start of a transition.
[01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:44.740]   They actually use the phrase.
[01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:46.820]   We still got a long ways to go.
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:48.540]   And they're sticking to their premonition.
[01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:50.860]   That's going to take them two years to complete the transition.
[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:56.340]   So it does look like in two years time, the idea of having Intel and M1 Mac side by side
[01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:58.260]   is going to be a thing of the past.
[01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:01.700]   I'm now there are two Macs that was most fascinated to see.
[01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:06.060]   One would be the low power 20 hour back books, which is what we saw today.
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:08.700]   The other would be, OK, but now you got to get.
[01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:14.540]   Now you got to sell us the $30,000 computational workforce that's based on M1 or excuse me,
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:16.460]   or excuse me, based on Apple Silicon.
[01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:20.180]   And based on the numbers they're giving us today, that really makes me wonder exactly
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:23.780]   how far up they can go with this.
[01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:26.500]   There are new markets they get entered to server.
[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:31.020]   There's a lot of markets that get entered with this that would be very interesting.
[01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:37.020]   If they can deliver the performance per per power, performance per dollar, it's when you
[01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:41.340]   get to scientific research, when you get into machine learning, training models, when you
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:46.740]   get into things like flow dynamic simulations, you're getting to people who absolutely don't
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:51.300]   care about how about the chamfer angle on the new rolling feet that you sculpted for
[01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:53.500]   the machine, all they care about.
[01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:58.940]   They will tell you, give me bare bare boards with hand done wires and sparks being thrown
[01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:00.100]   all over the place.
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:04.660]   If it will get me solutions faster and being able to do more work better.
[01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:07.020]   So it's a different market.
[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:11.580]   And this is why I'm doubly keen to see exactly how big an arm they can make.
[01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:17.820]   Well, here's how much, here's how much $8,000 worth of computing hardware will get you on
[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:24.740]   the Mac out the Silicon versus here's what even on an AMD processor, Threadripper, Kajillion
[01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:27.500]   is going to get you.
[01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:31.820]   They say two years, I'm going to guess the bulk of everything will be done next year,
[01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:34.540]   as they did with the Intel transition.
[01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:35.540]   We'll see.
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:41.660]   I mean, the next thing to show is IMAX and then higher end, maybe 16 inch MacBook Pros.
[01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:47.060]   And then after that, there is a rumor that there is a mini version of the Mac Pro.
[01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:50.140]   I would get that in a heartbeat, right?
[01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:54.820]   If we go by with currently released, I think the next is going to be MacBook Pros because
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:59.700]   if you go by the order, the MacBook Pros came out in June, the IMAX came out in August.
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:03.020]   So if you try to less cannibalize.
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:05.740]   So say maybe March for, you think?
[01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:13.340]   Yeah, I think new iPads and MacBook Pros, we're looking at Easter-ish, Easter time, Bunny
[01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:14.620]   Rabbit Max.
[01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:20.780]   And then I think IMAX will come in the summer and that Mac Pro will come this time next
[01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:21.780]   year.
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:22.780]   That's the two year.
[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:24.100]   I did not do jazz hands.
[01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:28.220]   Yeah, but something is going to come out in 2022 that is not out.
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:31.580]   So I think, and this is completely artificial at this point.
[01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:35.340]   I would guess Apple could probably put it all out at once.
[01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:40.940]   But it makes sense since you just got people to spend a ridiculously huge amount of money
[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:46.540]   for their Mac Pros just not so long ago, you're going to push that one into 2022.
[01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:48.820]   I think that's where two years comes from.
[01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:51.420]   Because I think most of this stuff will be out by next year.
[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:52.420]   Yeah.
[01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:53.420]   It's also the hardest.
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:55.420]   So because again, it's the proof.
[01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:56.420]   Yeah, it's the proof.
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:57.420]   It's the proof.
[01:14:57.420 --> 01:14:58.420]   Yeah.
[01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:03.500]   Well, the people who spend up to $30,000 on a desktop, they know exactly how much money
[01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:07.660]   they make per processing unit that they get on a desktop.
[01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:12.900]   And if Apple can't deliver that, once again, they're not going to care about how lovely
[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:17.700]   the feet are designed or how well touch ID works on a desktop, all they care about is
[01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:19.220]   processing power.
[01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:24.780]   But this is an area in which if they really do have a platform that scales up like that,
[01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:30.940]   can deliver just as good performance in the research computer range as it can on this
[01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:36.660]   ultra light notebook and middle range professional notebook range, they could really become a
[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:37.900]   force multiplier here.
[01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.660]   It's going to be fascinating to watch.
[01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:40.660]   Let's take-
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:42.300]   And you just gave me an epiphany.
[01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:44.860]   Sorry real quick, we couldn't run the break fast.
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:49.020]   The one thing that we couldn't do before was Apple has always been, as you can see by
[01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:53.500]   the video today with Finneas and so many other creators like Ikiko and things like that.
[01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:56.820]   They put it in the hands of professionals before they announce it to us, right?
[01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:57.820]   Yep.
[01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:04.740]   But with Apple Studios making products for Apple TV like Ted Naso, they can actually test
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:10.660]   bit lots of things in a real world space for their high level creators because they actually
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:12.940]   own a content engine at this point.
[01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:18.540]   Back in history, historically, we couldn't do that without worrying about leekids and
[01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:19.540]   things like that.
[01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:23.180]   But they actually own the studio now so they can test a lot of things in real time.
[01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:25.980]   Like a working lab.
[01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:27.700]   That's something they've been doing very, very smart.
[01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:32.180]   They've been hiring in a lot of professional editors, professional videographers, professional
[01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:37.340]   directors to create projects in-house at Apple just so that they can get an idea of what
[01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:40.180]   these high and professional workflows actually are.
[01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:42.540]   So there's a lot of work that we don't actually see.
[01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:44.460]   But yeah, you're absolutely right there.
[01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:47.420]   It's very, very smart for them to not just simply throw it out there and say, "Oh, well,
[01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:48.620]   we interviewed a whole bunch of people."
[01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:53.220]   It's like, no, here is somebody that whose name you know who actually has IMDB credits
[01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:59.740]   that you respect that ate our dog food for us inside the spaceship so that you would
[01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:03.220]   have a wonderful experience with your new $20,000 machine.
[01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:08.460]   >> The current Aqua hires have been industrial light magic visual engineers.
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:14.980]   I actually know a person, she's a female editor who got sucked in from a graphics house.
[01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:20.340]   I think it was Razorfish and she got pulled into Apple internally to be able to do not
[01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:24.940]   effects for the shows but how to make the machines work the way that those guys want
[01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:25.940]   to work.
[01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:28.180]   So that's something that people don't talk about right now.
[01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:29.180]   >> Same here.
[01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:34.340]   I'm sorry, I know that Leo wants to go to commercial, but yeah, it's over us four or
[01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:39.580]   five years ago, like the horror movie used to be, "Did you hear about Chuck?
[01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:41.860]   What happened to Chuck?"
[01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:45.780]   The editor who you've been working with and the writer who's been a friend of yours for
[01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:49.820]   10 years, he got hired by Apple as part of their communications team or part of their
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:51.500]   internal documentation team.
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:54.020]   And now it's, "Did you hear about Steve?
[01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:55.020]   What about Steve?
[01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:56.020]   Me and my friend at Pixar?
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:58.380]   Yeah, now he's working at Apple."
[01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:03.900]   It's like they've been doing a lot of interesting hires that are just about, "We can't just
[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:08.100]   simply turn our engineers into people or experts on video.
[01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:13.460]   We have to hire experts on video to say, 'Please make videos for us so we can make you wear
[01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:19.300]   though the skull implants with the electrodes and see exactly how angry you're getting by
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:20.660]   how this machine is working."
[01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:23.100]   >> Let's take a little break.
[01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:24.500]   Rosemary Orchards here.
[01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:26.100]   It's great to see you, Rosemary.
[01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:28.580]   Rosemary Orchard.com.
[01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:33.100]   She's doing her calculations on which Mac she's going to get, I suspect.
[01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:34.900]   >> Leading towards pro.
[01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:39.540]   It was a 20-hour battery life that got me.
[01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:41.340]   It's the same size as a MacBook Air.
[01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:42.340]   It's thicker, right?
[01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:43.980]   But it's still 13-inch screen.
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:44.980]   >> Yeah.
[01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:45.980]   Still portable.
[01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:46.980]   >> Still portable.
[01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:47.980]   >> Large hand-back size.
[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:55.260]   >> I could do without the touch bar, but it's kind of cool.
[01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:58.060]   I think the mini is really interesting, frankly.
[01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:01.420]   In fact, when we come back, I want to do a head-to-head with the old mini because it's
[01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:02.420]   pretty impressive.
[01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:07.380]   Andy Inaco here at WGBH in Boston, I think you'll have a few things to say when you appear
[01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:08.380]   this week.
[01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:09.380]   >> Indeed.
[01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:10.380]   >> Yeah.
[01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:13.860]   And Doc Rock, YouTube celeb, youtube.com/docrock.
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:16.940]   He's a TubeBuddy, man.
[01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:18.940]   Our TubeBuddy.
[01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:19.940]   He's here.
[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:24.020]   >> Now I want to go check out specs on the air weight versus the pro weight because I
[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:25.540]   kind of want to come back.
[01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:26.860]   I don't need one.
[01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:28.100]   You guys, you're Rosemary.
[01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:30.100]   >> We're bad that way.
[01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:36.740]   Our show today brought to you by -- well, here's one you know about.
[01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:37.740]   Peak design.
[01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:40.020]   Doc Rock and I are peak fans.
[01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:46.180]   I think I bought their very first peak carrying case for your cameras back in the day when
[01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:50.020]   Trey Radcliffe worked with them to design that.
[01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:53.060]   That's an amazing camera case.
[01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:55.140]   This is now their 10th campaign on Kickstarter.
[01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:56.820]   It all started in 2011.
[01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:59.900]   They've done it on Kickstarter one by one.
[01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:02.660]   The straps, the best camera straps made.
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:03.900]   They're fantastic.
[01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:08.020]   The attachment system is great because you can have it over the neck, over the shoulder.
[01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:09.820]   You can have it a sling.
[01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:11.900]   I just love everything they do.
[01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:15.940]   Most recently their Kickstarter was the travel tripod.
[01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:16.940]   Love it.
[01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:21.340]   It's got the arc ahead and I'll tell you why that's good news because their latest is
[01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:23.420]   for you phone folks.
[01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:26.260]   It's mobile by Peak Design.
[01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:32.660]   It's an ecosystem of cases, mounts and accessories to make your phone a better tool for everything
[01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:38.100]   you do from photo and video creation to biking and motorcycle riding to working in the home
[01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:39.100]   or office.
[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:45.620]   It all starts with this slim link proprietary magnetic mechanical locking system.
[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:52.140]   It uses a precision machined rounded corner square of zirconia ceramic and an array of
[01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:56.220]   magnets to provide intuitive no look connection.
[01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:59.020]   And it's compatible with MagSafe.
[01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:03.580]   So it's got wireless charging compatibility, hard locking security for those times you're
[01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:06.620]   bouncing around like on your bike and your motorcycle.
[01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:10.660]   I just think they've done everything right on this thing.
[01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:14.860]   Now it is not just for the iPhone 12 but it will work with the iPhone 12 but a variety
[01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:16.860]   of phones.
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:19.340]   The slim link is part of their everyday phone case.
[01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:22.500]   That's what you start with and you can buy pieces of this as you go.
[01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:26.620]   I, as soon as I went there I handed by the whole, I said I'll take it all.
[01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:27.860]   Thank you very much.
[01:21:27.860 --> 01:21:30.300]   Perfect balance of slimness and protection.
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:33.940]   And then when paired with your mobile device, this opens up this ecosystem of mounts and
[01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:34.940]   accessories.
[01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:36.140]   I love this idea.
[01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:39.300]   For instance, you saw it in the video, if you're watching the video, rugged and handsome
[01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:43.740]   wallet with a built in kickstand and it attaches magnetically.
[01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:49.940]   For you photographers, they've got an incredible machined aluminum tripod with a buttery smooth
[01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:55.980]   ball head built specifically for mobile devices and that magnetic connection is right there.
[01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:59.300]   They've got charging and noncharging mounts for the dash of your car.
[01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:04.340]   Now when you're biking or motorcycle riding and you don't want to risk the magnet releasing
[01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:10.260]   too easily, just a quarter turn and now that thing is really locked in and it cannot go
[01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:11.260]   anywhere.
[01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:13.700]   That's a hard locking mount for total security.
[01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:17.100]   They have a charging stand for your desk or bedside table.
[01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:21.140]   I got a couple of the low profile wall mounts because I can just see putting those in the
[01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:24.380]   workshop or in your office or in the kitchen.
[01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:28.080]   So when you get in there, you just boom, you put the phone on there and it's just exactly
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:29.300]   where you want it.
[01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:34.220]   There's also a kit of adapters that mounts as your phone to a standard GoPro or ARCA style
[01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:35.220]   system.
[01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:39.180]   And I'm definitely going to get that because my tripod, I can just be able to click it right
[01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:42.220]   on, which is fantastic.
[01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:44.100]   Works with the MagSafe system.
[01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:49.820]   You can count on Peak Design's family of accessories working seamlessly with all iPhone 12 models.
[01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:52.940]   These Peak guys, they're photographers and photographers.
[01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:54.380]   And that's the key on this.
[01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:58.740]   They are people who use their products day in, day out.
[01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:02.940]   They're the world's most crowd funded active company.
[01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:09.100]   And they found their stoked, loyal, passionate customers like me and Doc Rock on Kickstarter.
[01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:11.700]   San Francisco based, they've been doing it since 2011.
[01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:15.980]   In fact, the capture was created back then.
[01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:18.780]   That was their first successful Kickstarter.
[01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:24.620]   To learn more about mobile by Peak Design, just go to peakdesign.com/tuit.
[01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:29.020]   Check out all their other great products, but you're going to want to get this mobile.
[01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:33.060]   And like you, Doc Rock, I wish it was shipping today, so I'd have it with my iPhone 12 Pro
[01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:34.980]   Max on Friday.
[01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:35.980]   But I can wait.
[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:39.420]   I got the inexpensive Apple plastic case.
[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:43.220]   And I'll just wait until I get my mobile.

[01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:47.380]   These guys really know what they're doing.
[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:48.580]   PeakDesign.com/tuit.
[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:52.980]   Thank you Peak Design for your support.
[01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:58.700]   And thank you for supporting us, MacBreak Weekly, by using that URL that way they know you saw
[01:23:58.700 --> 01:23:59.700]   it here.
[01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:02.700]   PeakDesign.com/tuit.
[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:12.300]   Comparison, thanks to Apple Insider, between the Mac Mini of last couple of years, the
[01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:16.780]   Intel 2018, to the Mac Mini brand new Apple Silicon M1 based.
[01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:19.740]   First of all, $100 less expensive.
[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:21.260]   Exactly the same dimensions.
[01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:28.300]   But a third of a pound, less lighter, that's good.
[01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:31.980]   Let's say you got the i7, actually for the price.
[01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:34.060]   I don't think you'd get the i7.
[01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:36.380]   But compare that to the 8-core M1.
[01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:39.140]   I think you see it's much faster.
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:42.060]   They used integrated Intel UHD graphics.
[01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:45.500]   That's going to be nothing compared to what's on the M1.
[01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:47.300]   RAM, similar.
[01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:53.820]   You got Wi-Fi 5, 802.11ac compared to Wi-Fi 6, 802.11ax.
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:56.540]   Bluetooth 5 on both of them.
[01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:59.500]   Gigabit Ethernet on both of them.
[01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:01.460]   Storage, comparable.
[01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:07.700]   I think you're getting more Mac Mini for $100 less.
[01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:09.700]   That's unusual in the tech industry.
[01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:13.300]   I think it's great that Apple's passing along what must be saved.
[01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:14.820]   That's on licensing is over.
[01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:17.180]   You don't have to give Intel any money.
[01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:18.180]   Nope.
[01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:19.660]   Not even for Thunderbolt.
[01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:20.660]   Nope.
[01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:21.660]   Yeah.
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:24.260]   That's pretty impressive.
[01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:28.020]   It's not quite the same for the Mac Book Air.
[01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:29.300]   They kept the same price.
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:33.300]   But I'm thrilled they kept the same price because it looks like it's going to outperform
[01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:38.420]   the Mac Book Air by two or three times at the same price.
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:39.420]   That's a pretty good deal.
[01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:44.460]   I think that 899 education price point is very important for Apple.
[01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:48.420]   Do you suppose they pulled the 10GBE because of heat?
[01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:50.780]   10GBE does get hot.
[01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:52.780]   Yeah, it seems weird.
[01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:54.580]   Why would you not put that in there?
[01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:58.980]   Again, these machines are the lower side.
[01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:04.860]   It may just be, again, this is the SOTC thing that they were relying on an Intel chipset
[01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:08.380]   to give them 10GBE Ethernet.
[01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:11.580]   That chip's gone and they haven't yet put that in the M1.
[01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:14.860]   It could just be that simple, right?
[01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:15.860]   Heat is an issue.
[01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:16.860]   You're right when you get that.
[01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:23.500]   That many electrons throwing flowing through the wire can't heat up.
[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:26.420]   Energy efficiency, clearly a big deal on this.
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:29.540]   With cooling on the MacBook Air, no fan.
[01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:32.220]   That's pretty cool too, nice and quiet.
[01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:33.220]   Yeah.
[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:38.140]   They also mentioned that in the user testimonials, or at least the hands-on testimonials, about
[01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:42.820]   how it doesn't even get hot, the line that this person delivered whether it was spontaneous
[01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:48.860]   or written for was that the heat from my hand is hotter than the bottom of this machine.
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:56.300]   Let's hope that holds out because I think I still have a scar on my right heel.
[01:26:56.300 --> 01:27:03.300]   I'm sitting on the sofa with a cross-legged.
[01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:05.340]   Yeah.
[01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:07.140]   Really, really nice.
[01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:08.140]   Really exciting.
[01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:10.900]   Go ahead, Rosemary.
[01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:15.260]   I was going to say, the only thing that I'm looking at here with the Mac Mini is I've got
[01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:20.140]   32GB of RAM in mind and I could upgrade that to 64GB.
[01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:22.300]   That seems like that's not going to be possible.
[01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:23.820]   You're not going to have that choice.
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:26.700]   Yeah, they're going to be limited to 16GB.
[01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:31.180]   I'm not quite sure if the top end of the Pro Machines are quite area with the silicon,
[01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:34.540]   but we're going to have to wait for actual real-world testing where people are doing
[01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:38.580]   the same things that they've done on their regular machines before we'll actually know
[01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:40.420]   how any of this plays out.
[01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:41.420]   How important...
[01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:42.980]   You do a lot of iOS stuff, Rosemary.
[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:49.260]   How important is the fact that you'll be able to run iOS apps on your Mac?
[01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:53.780]   Not super important because for everything that I do on iOS, I've got a Mac equivalent
[01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:56.500]   even for shortcuts and everything.
[01:27:56.500 --> 01:28:01.740]   I mean shortcuts I don't, but I have a spare iPhone which I run push-cut automation server
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:06.780]   on so I can actually just ping the iPhone and have it run the shortcut, which is what
[01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:07.780]   I do.
[01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:12.740]   It's maybe not something that everybody would do, but for me that works and I don't think
[01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:14.460]   shortcuts is coming to the Mac.
[01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:18.140]   At least they haven't said it would and I'm pretty certain Apple will be making a pretty
[01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:22.300]   big song and dance out of that if they were bringing shortcuts to the Mac.
[01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:24.180]   Your question on Mac would be so good.
[01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:25.540]   Yeah, I wish I wish they would.
[01:28:25.540 --> 01:28:27.300]   I mean it's not that the Mac has...
[01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:31.060]   I think WWDC 2021 is when they're going to be like, "Oh, by the way, shortcuts is on
[01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:32.060]   the Mac too."
[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:35.740]   Part of the reason that's challenging is because they've got Automator and AppleScript
[01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:41.100]   and I think that they, at this point, that's going to be a big conversation to say, "Will
[01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:45.020]   they have shortcuts running side by side in parallel or will they?"
[01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:52.240]   I think they will because Automator has different functionality, but let's be honest,
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:55.940]   the support for Automator has drastically reduced over the last couple of years.
[01:28:55.940 --> 01:29:01.820]   Microsoft released a new build of their office suite which removed the Automator actions
[01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:05.740]   that were built in so you can't convert Word documents to PDF automatically and things
[01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:07.860]   like that anymore.
[01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:14.700]   And honestly, Automator, as somebody who was into Automation but primarily does shortcuts,
[01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:17.780]   it's just not very intuitive and it's not very easy to use.
[01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:24.840]   You can't easily insert variables in places which say, "Oh, hey, pick up this file and
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:28.840]   then do this thing with it and then use the name of the file to do this other magic thing
[01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:29.840]   over here."
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:33.480]   It just doesn't have the actions and the automation in it unless you farm it out to
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:38.400]   AppleScript which is not what average person who wants to start automating something is
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:41.160]   willing to do.
[01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:49.500]   And in the '95 Mac, as of now, Google has decided not to do Apple Silicon.
[01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:52.340]   Google Maps, Google Drive and Gmail apps will not be ported.
[01:29:52.340 --> 01:30:01.060]   Netflix will be, HBO Max will be, Facebook will not include its iOS apps on the Mac store.
[01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:05.420]   That includes Instagram WhatsApp messenger and Facebook itself.
[01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:09.340]   Snapchat, Amazon Prime, Video and Disney+.
[01:30:09.340 --> 01:30:13.720]   Any crush among us, real racing, no.
[01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:17.860]   However, Skychildren of light subway surfers and Temple Run might be.
[01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:25.660]   Now I have to think that may all change in two months or six months.
[01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:29.400]   But as of now, it isn't universal.
[01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:33.900]   A lot of iOS apps are not going to make their way to a Mac OS.
[01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:38.060]   But at the same time, do we really want Facebook on our Mac?
[01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:39.060]   I don't want Facebook anywhere.
[01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:40.060]   We have the website.
[01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:41.060]   I know.
[01:30:41.060 --> 01:30:42.060]   I don't want these.
[01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:43.060]   I can either.
[01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:44.300]   But we're going to get Chrome on the Mac.
[01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:47.620]   And I don't really want the iOS version of Chrome on my Mac.
[01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:49.820]   Same as I would want the iOS version of Firefox on my Mac.
[01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:52.620]   I have a more powerful version on my Mac.
[01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:59.380]   And I think that a lot of the developers who are looking at this are a lot of them.
[01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:05.260]   Greg Pierce, the developer of Drafts, for example, was already working on Drafts when
[01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:09.100]   they announced Catalyst and decided that it was the right direction to go in to produce
[01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:10.900]   a real Mac app.
[01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:14.740]   I'm not saying that the Catalyst apps aren't real.
[01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:19.460]   And therefore, the iOS versions running on the Mac aren't real.
[01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:22.780]   But a Mac app works differently to the way an iOS app works.
[01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:24.340]   Do you need Catalyst anymore?
[01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:25.340]   Right?
[01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:27.500]   Don't they run natively on M1s without Catalyst?
[01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:30.020]   I mean, they should, I think, as far as I'm aware.
[01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:33.180]   But it's still going to give a different experience.
[01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:37.820]   Just the tap targets, which are designed for fingers, will be very clunky to use with a
[01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:40.220]   mouse and things like that.
[01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:45.700]   And so, you know, having the exact same app is not necessarily going to give users a great
[01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:46.700]   experience.
[01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:50.340]   So I can see why some developers would say, maybe not.
[01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:55.380]   If there have been a touchscreen Mac book released today, we could potentially be having
[01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:56.860]   a very different conversation.
[01:31:56.860 --> 01:31:57.860]   Yeah.
[01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:02.980]   And also, a company like Google, a company like Facebook are very, very well motivated
[01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:07.380]   to get people to continue to use their products through the web where they don't have as many
[01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:13.100]   privacy and security limitations as an app that Apple is going to prove for the App Store.
[01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:14.100]   Yeah.
[01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:16.740]   Let's talk about discrete GPUs.
[01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:20.940]   None of the new Apple hardware have discrete GPUs.
[01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:24.700]   They're all using the GPU built into the system on a chip.
[01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:30.580]   And according to Apple, that GPU is five times faster than previous to integrating graphics,
[01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:32.460]   maybe fast enough.
[01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:35.340]   But I know a lot of people, I see a lot of people in the chatroom saying, oh, they got
[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:37.740]   to have discrete GPUs.
[01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:39.100]   Is that the case, Doc Rock?
[01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:41.060]   Do you think you need discrete GPUs?
[01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:44.340]   Will Apple support them?
[01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:45.340]   This is tough.
[01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:46.340]   Okay.
[01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:59.140]   We again, we're all, let's say, shy or gunshot because of the iris and the previous integrated
[01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:00.140]   graphics.
[01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:01.780]   In tells and it really wraps up.
[01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:06.860]   So it's hard to disconnect your brain and I fully get you.
[01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:07.860]   I'm right there with you.
[01:33:07.860 --> 01:33:10.140]   I am a GPU intensive person.
[01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:13.700]   I'm on 5700 XT with 16 gigs of RAM.
[01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:18.040]   So you're going to tell me the new computer that I'm going to buy has the exact same
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:19.860]   RAM as just my GPU.
[01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:23.740]   And it's supposed to scream final cut the way that I scream final cut.
[01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:25.420]   And yeah, because it's new.
[01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:26.420]   It's different.
[01:33:26.420 --> 01:33:28.020]   They talk to each other different.
[01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:30.140]   The language and stuff is different.
[01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:32.460]   Like it is just different.
[01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:39.380]   And I know it's hard to understand, but if you are an ESOL person, you get it because
[01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:44.100]   there comes a point when you pick up fluency in the other tongue.
[01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:49.740]   There is a spot where the switch goes from, I understand I can talk whatever to fully get
[01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:50.740]   it.
[01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:51.900]   The concept start the stick.
[01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:56.140]   The cultural reasons why we use this phraseology here and there starts to stick.
[01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:57.940]   You start dreaming in the language.
[01:33:57.940 --> 01:33:58.940]   Yeah.
[01:33:58.940 --> 01:33:59.940]   Yeah.
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:01.860]   So that is a level of fluency.
[01:34:01.860 --> 01:34:03.500]   Don't think a lot of people understand.
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:08.140]   And it's much harder to understand if you're not a say of a multilingual person because
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:12.340]   I think I understand is better because I can take it from the computer standpoint.
[01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:18.540]   I can pick up my various languages and move that to computer and know that once you get
[01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:24.580]   to that certain level of fluency where, yeah, you basically get angry in that language,
[01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:27.020]   then it runs smoother.
[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:31.140]   And I think it's hard for people to understand that because we don't have much to compare
[01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:32.700]   it to in our personal lives.
[01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:34.100]   It's hard to get analogous.
[01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:36.780]   So you're saying it's M1 as a second language.
[01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:39.900]   We're going from Intel to Apple Silicon.
[01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:40.900]   And it's a new language.
[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:46.500]   And so the things that we think about when we think about Intel discrete versus integrated
[01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:49.660]   graphics, it's just not the same.
[01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:55.700]   And yet if you're a gamer, I mean, unified memory alone is going to mean you don't have
[01:34:55.700 --> 01:35:00.580]   the same amount of memory available for graphics textures because everything's sharing that
[01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:05.260]   RAM and you only have 16 gigs.
[01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:08.060]   I have to think that there is a market for discrete.
[01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:11.020]   What do you think Rosemary for discrete graphics?
[01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:15.580]   I mean, they're definitely is because they sell the external GPUs, right?
[01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:19.540]   So you know, they wouldn't be selling that if people didn't need extra graphics processing
[01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:22.660]   that isn't available in the machine that they they want.
[01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:26.820]   But will there be a GPU for M1 Max?
[01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:27.820]   Maybe.
[01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:28.820]   Yeah.
[01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:30.500]   The standard plug-in shouldn't work right now.
[01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:32.260]   It should fight because they're different.
[01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:33.260]   Yeah.
[01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:34.260]   Yeah.
[01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:35.740]   So I think right now you just pick that what exists, it wouldn't work.
[01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:36.740]   Yeah.
[01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:37.740]   Yeah.
[01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:38.740]   Yeah.
[01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:40.460]   No, right now it's not going to work, but there's clearly a market for it because otherwise
[01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:42.100]   people won't be using these.
[01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:43.420]   Oh, I understand the market.
[01:35:43.420 --> 01:35:44.420]   You bet.
[01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:47.860]   But that was on Intel, you know, that was that other language.
[01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:48.860]   Yeah.
[01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:50.420]   And it's definitely going to be interesting.
[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:54.220]   I was very pleased that they were demoing and talking about Baloo's Gate today because
[01:35:54.220 --> 01:35:58.940]   I know that gaming on the Mac is a controversial subject.
[01:35:58.940 --> 01:36:02.180]   So I'm probably going to wait into a whole full of mess here.
[01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:09.820]   But you know, you need a good GPU for a lot of games and you don't just need it for games.
[01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:13.380]   You do need it for, you know, like video rendering and things like that.
[01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:21.460]   But you know, it depends on exactly what you're doing if you are, you know, producing a full
[01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:27.300]   length feature film with, you know, computer graphics in every scene, you know, a relate
[01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:31.700]   on top of things and you're probably going to need a GPU, I would say.
[01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:34.740]   But I am also not a feature film producer.
[01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:40.740]   So I couldn't really say, but my assumption is we're going to see something with more
[01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:47.300]   GPU later because this is very much, you know, the first generation of something.
[01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:49.780]   You know, Nvidia gave up, right?
[01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:52.220]   They said, I'm no, we can't forget it.
[01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:53.780]   That was before this.
[01:36:53.780 --> 01:36:55.780]   They gave up on Apple.
[01:36:55.780 --> 01:37:01.340]   AMD radiance have been a tight relationship between Apple and AMD on that for discrete
[01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:02.900]   graphics.
[01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:08.380]   Is there any room for an Apple AMD relationship, Andy, or is this is Apple just going to make
[01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:09.380]   their own?
[01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:12.260]   I think they're going to move towards making their own.
[01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:19.260]   I think that Apple makes a distinction between the sort of people that are absolutely counting
[01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:25.100]   frame rates and absolutely would spend extra for a GPU and the people that just want sort
[01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:29.980]   of normal user interface flow, they want to make Apple's going to make sure that if you
[01:37:29.980 --> 01:37:35.060]   want to edit 4K, if you want to preview in 5K, 8K, that you will be able to scrub through
[01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:40.860]   and not drop frames, I don't think that they're as focused on frame rates and that level of
[01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:44.460]   performance for the average user as the PC community is.
[01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:48.340]   Although this, this I did also my notes is that I think this is the first time that Apple
[01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:53.180]   even mentioned as a selling point that, hey, you'll get those high frame rates in your games
[01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:55.580]   that you're expecting.
[01:37:55.580 --> 01:38:02.580]   So I do think that they were trying to make a better pitch for gamers than they ever did.
[01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:08.460]   Maybe this has to do with their desire to compete at this level while these $1000 laptops
[01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:12.020]   are trying to sell a lot of these two college students to high school students.
[01:38:12.020 --> 01:38:14.740]   And one of the things they are going to care about when they're comparing this to like an
[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:19.300]   Alienware laptop or anything else is how well is this going to be able to play my games.
[01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:23.700]   Yeah, and of course, any discrete GPU will be kind of a disadvantage because it's on the
[01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:24.780]   I/O bus.
[01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:27.380]   It is no longer unified memory access.
[01:38:27.380 --> 01:38:31.700]   So it's going to be a mess.
[01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:34.140]   It's going to be interesting to see this.
[01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:42.500]   We probably underscore is the fact that these first three M1 based Macs are kind of low end
[01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:45.580]   and that the pro stuff is still they may call it a MacBook Pro.
[01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:49.860]   It is not the pro stuff is still to come.
[01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:54.540]   And that's we're going to have to see what Apple does in response that I can.
[01:38:54.540 --> 01:39:02.380]   And you have to remember to Leo the Xbox 360 the Xbox one the Xbox S one all the Xboxes
[01:39:02.380 --> 01:39:10.700]   have been basically using UMA from from for right Xbox 360 is 2004.
[01:39:10.700 --> 01:39:11.700]   Right.
[01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:13.940]   So I'm saying like we've been doing this for a while.
[01:39:13.940 --> 01:39:18.580]   And so it freaks is funny that everyone is panicking about this, but the console system
[01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:20.500]   has been doing this for quite a minute.
[01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:22.780]   So it's not because they're running on AMD.
[01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:26.020]   I mean AMD's been about UMA for a while.
[01:39:26.020 --> 01:39:28.660]   Yeah, and they use graphics.
[01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:32.100]   They use discrete graphics.
[01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:33.100]   But it's tighter.
[01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:37.820]   It's a tighter integration than putting a PCI card in.
[01:39:37.820 --> 01:39:39.460]   It's got to be.
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:40.540]   I think you're going to have to buy it.
[01:39:40.540 --> 01:39:42.980]   I think you're going to want to buy it from Apple.
[01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:44.780]   It's going to be an Apple technology.
[01:39:44.780 --> 01:39:51.940]   And PCI is probably also gone now to like in the way that we know it, right?
[01:39:51.940 --> 01:39:57.100]   Because most of what you need PCI for is in that graphic you showed us like 20 minutes
[01:39:57.100 --> 01:39:58.860]   ago, it's all in there.
[01:39:58.860 --> 01:39:59.860]   Yeah.
[01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:05.060]   So although they say they support PCI the fourth generation PCI, I'm not sure.
[01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:06.980]   That means there's a bus.
[01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:07.980]   There's a bus.
[01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:12.300]   I don't know what the bus is where the bus is connecting to.
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:15.980]   Instead of being like, you came out to six at the moment once.
[01:40:15.980 --> 01:40:17.460]   Here it is somewhere.
[01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:18.460]   Yeah.
[01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:19.460]   Yeah.
[01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:20.820]   So these ways are a great home bus.
[01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:24.500]   This is one of those where the rock, you know, guys got like six people and a big car
[01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:30.580]   table microwave, two sleepers in the back is that kind of bus now.
[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:37.340]   No, very notably, none of these Macs have slots, have any upgradability at all.
[01:40:37.340 --> 01:40:39.420]   So what you see is what you get.
[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:42.380]   And so there's no question there.
[01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:44.780]   I'm very curious what this is going to mean.
[01:40:44.780 --> 01:40:50.940]   But that's why this is the beginning of a process and there are going to be many more
[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:51.940]   announcements.
[01:40:51.940 --> 01:40:57.820]   And Siri, I guess you could use Thunderbolt four or USB four for something.
[01:40:57.820 --> 01:40:58.820]   Yeah.
[01:40:58.820 --> 01:41:03.620]   I think that's why a lot of people might consider holding back because the great thing about
[01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:08.100]   RAM on a lot of different systems is that if you under buy, well, if it turns out that
[01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:11.500]   you do need more, you do need the 32 gigs of RAM.
[01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:12.500]   Okay, fine.
[01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:14.700]   So I think that's a couple of sticks put it in.
[01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:16.180]   But yeah, exactly not here.
[01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:19.980]   It makes me wonder what they're going to be doing with the Mac Pro line given that the
[01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:25.540]   whole concept of the return to like the classic style Mac Pro was we were giving you a, we're
[01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:28.260]   giving you a rectangle just like you asked for.
[01:41:28.260 --> 01:41:32.180]   We're giving you places you can put RAM in places you can put storage in.
[01:41:32.180 --> 01:41:36.940]   If they're going with the unified memory architecture, if does that just apply to this
[01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:42.460]   one, this first M1 chip or does that mean that all future Macs going forward are going
[01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:46.580]   to have some former unified memory and that a memory upgrade is going to involve having
[01:41:46.580 --> 01:41:47.580]   a CPU upgrade.
[01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:52.260]   And if they decide to take the memory off of the off of the die, are they going to have
[01:41:52.260 --> 01:41:56.540]   a situation where they're going to be giving up a lot of the fast RAM performance that
[01:41:56.540 --> 01:42:00.020]   they're getting by having this all on the same SOC?
[01:42:00.020 --> 01:42:08.220]   Interestingly, one of the ways Fortnite plans to get back on iOS is in the browser via
[01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:13.860]   because Nvidia is going to take their GeForce now service, which also is not on the app store
[01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:15.860]   and put it in Safari.
[01:42:15.860 --> 01:42:21.180]   I don't know how well it'll run and Fortnite is going to be part of that.
[01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:28.820]   But ironically, that may actually end with Apple Silicon because I don't know what kind
[01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:31.460]   of they need WebAssembly, I guess.
[01:42:31.460 --> 01:42:36.500]   I don't know what they're going to be doing to get performant on the on iOS.
[01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:37.500]   Do you know Rosemary?
[01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:42.820]   How they're going to get the browser to give you that kind of must be WebAssembly?
[01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:49.460]   I mean, I presume so or yeah, I mean, I would assume it's either WebAssembly or Virtual Machine
[01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:55.380]   and Virtual Machine seem perhaps overkill for this.
[01:42:55.380 --> 01:43:01.860]   So that's yeah, it seems like if Apple's going to remain a gaming platform, it's going
[01:43:01.860 --> 01:43:08.460]   to be with Apple's own technologies like Apple Arcade and not with third party gaming apps.
[01:43:08.460 --> 01:43:09.780]   But I don't know.
[01:43:09.780 --> 01:43:13.020]   There are in other words, there are a lot of questions.
[01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:17.020]   Apple just began the conversation, didn't give us information in some very key areas.
[01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:23.700]   There are going to be a lot of questions that first wave of benchmarks and tests with coming
[01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:28.660]   starting next week with people who have M1 chips.
[01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:30.340]   And that's going to be over the next couple of months.
[01:43:30.340 --> 01:43:34.100]   People like Rosemary are going to be watching carefully to see, well, can this match what
[01:43:34.100 --> 01:43:39.060]   I'm doing now in the unique ways that I use it?
[01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:44.780]   And you should not run out and buy it if you don't know.
[01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:47.580]   Other news, is there anything else we should say about this event before I move on?
[01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:50.420]   There are a few other stories, not many.
[01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:54.940]   I think just as the code is should just be that we there's so there's this break so many
[01:43:54.940 --> 01:43:59.020]   of the rules that although like we've been discussing about Oh God, I hope that the 16
[01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:00.900]   gig max of RAM is going to be a problem.
[01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:02.900]   Well, maybe it's not a problem or the GPU.
[01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:03.900]   Maybe the hope that could be a problem.
[01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:05.620]   Well, again, this is a brand new thing.
[01:44:05.620 --> 01:44:06.620]   We may not be a problem.
[01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:12.180]   So I wouldn't be the I am I was so tempted to just say, Oh, this Mac mini looks like something
[01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:17.540]   that is I've got I've got an M1 Mac mini shaped hole in my office that I need to fill immediately
[01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:18.740]   with this thing.
[01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:23.460]   But between it's it's prudent to wait to see exactly what the performance profiles are.
[01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:26.580]   And for people who are considering the Mac mini, if you don't necessarily need one this
[01:44:26.580 --> 01:44:32.180]   here, if you can hold up next year, the idea of never buy based on rumors or not by based
[01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:38.860]   on rumors, but the idea of a lower powered Mac Pro that is not it's not the big box you
[01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:43.660]   can fill with drives and memory, but it is designed to have again, the thermal performance
[01:44:43.660 --> 01:44:46.660]   in the space that a larger desktop would take.
[01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:51.620]   And if you really do need super super performance without maybe spending $9,000 on it, there
[01:44:51.620 --> 01:44:53.540]   might be something better coming up in the pipeline.
[01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:58.060]   So if yeah, they're my well almost certainly will be.
[01:44:58.060 --> 01:44:59.700]   I mean, that's always true.
[01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:02.980]   But this is the remember, this is the first generation of a new platform said the new
[01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:05.780]   ones might be better in a way that made you want to wait.
[01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:08.260]   I ordered you this is really designed further.
[01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:09.260]   Sorry, Leo.
[01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:11.940]   No, this is really designed for the 100% early adopter.
[01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:12.940]   Yeah.
[01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:18.460]   Or the person who uses, you know, say that the I hate the quote unquote average user because
[01:45:18.460 --> 01:45:20.740]   it's such a horrible, you describe it.
[01:45:20.740 --> 01:45:24.060]   But I just use my computer for what computer people use computer for.
[01:45:24.060 --> 01:45:27.620]   I'm not making stuff for creating or doing all this other crazy things.
[01:45:27.620 --> 01:45:33.460]   But also it also stands the reason to that the initial investment, I'm assuming the way
[01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:38.420]   Leo did his probably came out to about 16, 1700 bucks.
[01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:42.900]   From a work perspective, I could recover that in two or three jobs.
[01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:45.860]   So it's not like I'm throwing money at the dirt.
[01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:49.900]   Like if I can recover that and say less than 90 days, oh, buy it.
[01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:54.140]   Just so that you know, so you can be part of the trend, you know, whatever.
[01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:58.460]   But if you can't recover that that fast, then maybe yeah, I buy it.
[01:45:58.460 --> 01:46:03.540]   You know, that's not that's kind of that's kind of not the way to operate.
[01:46:03.540 --> 01:46:05.660]   Say someone from a business perspective.
[01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:07.940]   But yeah, I think I don't want one.
[01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:13.020]   I don't need one, but I'll probably buy one because I can I know for a fact I could cover
[01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:14.620]   that in less than 90 days.
[01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:18.300]   Well, also Apple has 14 day return policy people.
[01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:20.060]   Like just try it.
[01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:22.940]   Yeah, that's another another solution.
[01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:28.540]   I wrote it to the MacBook Pro 13 because I really want to benchmark it against the Intel
[01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:32.020]   stuff and even against the iPad, frankly, that's going to be interesting if we can figure
[01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:35.500]   out a way to do a head to head comparison.
[01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:38.740]   So we'll have some review material.
[01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:42.820]   It's going to take two weeks because stupid me, I got the I maxed it out and that's going
[01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:46.020]   to add another week to do a BTO, I guess.
[01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:52.260]   But I, you know, I think it's foolish to order a non maxed out machine if you can't upgrade
[01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:53.260]   it yourself.
[01:46:53.260 --> 01:46:54.260]   Yeah.
[01:46:54.260 --> 01:46:55.660]   What are you going to do?
[01:46:55.660 --> 01:46:56.660]   I would agree.
[01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:59.260]   I mean, I that's what I did with my current Mac mini.
[01:46:59.260 --> 01:47:02.620]   I ordered higher SSD and everything like that.
[01:47:02.620 --> 01:47:05.420]   And then I replaced the round myself because that's the part you can replace.
[01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:06.420]   Right.
[01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:08.820]   So I just got eight gigs for Apple and then put my 32 in.
[01:47:08.820 --> 01:47:11.620]   Yeah, whenever you can do that, you want to do that.
[01:47:11.620 --> 01:47:13.220]   Obviously Apple over charges for that.
[01:47:13.220 --> 01:47:17.420]   So I was just looking at a curiosity, the refurb section on the Apple website, least
[01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:21.180]   here in the UK has a lot of Mac minis right now.
[01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:22.180]   That's great.
[01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:27.860]   So if anybody was on the fence and was like, but I really think I would prefer the Intel
[01:47:27.860 --> 01:47:30.420]   one refurb store right now.
[01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:32.620]   Actually, that's an excellent point.
[01:47:32.620 --> 01:47:37.660]   This would be a very good time to buy an Intel Mac anything new or refurbed because
[01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:42.220]   I am watch the prices because they're going to start going down.
[01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:44.300]   I'm sure.
[01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:46.340]   I know people think they want an Intel Mac.
[01:47:46.340 --> 01:47:48.780]   I just I've been holding off.
[01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:53.900]   I have saved every penny that I would normally buy anything new for the last six months knowing
[01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:58.060]   Apple Silicon was on its way because that's I think the future.
[01:47:58.060 --> 01:48:01.860]   And at minimum, make sure you come up a list of the most important apps that you use every
[01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:02.860]   single day.
[01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:07.260]   And if they're not Apple apps, make sure you know, are they going to be available
[01:48:07.260 --> 01:48:11.860]   directly for direct for M one or are they going to have to be running an emulation as
[01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:14.740]   that will also be the big trick for you to solve.
[01:48:14.740 --> 01:48:17.900]   Knowing that we haven't got one, we've only seen the Apple event and of course that's
[01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:21.700]   going to oversell everything.
[01:48:21.700 --> 01:48:26.900]   The big concern with Apple Silicon was it wouldn't be performant.
[01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:27.900]   There'd be bugs.
[01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:30.020]   There'd be issues.
[01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:34.060]   Do you think Apple's dodged that bullet, Doc Rock?
[01:48:34.060 --> 01:48:40.880]   I think so. And again, the very first line in the event, well, I'll say the very first
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:41.880]   paragraph.
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:48.380]   I don't want to see the first line was we've been making these chips for a decade.
[01:48:48.380 --> 01:48:49.380]   Yeah.
[01:48:49.380 --> 01:48:56.180]   Like he brought that up and I in the E-cam community, I run the E-cam beta community and
[01:48:56.180 --> 01:48:57.660]   the conversation kept coming up.
[01:48:57.660 --> 01:48:58.900]   Oh, well, it's not going to work.
[01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:00.940]   And we're going to have to wait like two, three generations.
[01:49:00.940 --> 01:49:02.620]   And I'm like, no, this is different, man.
[01:49:02.620 --> 01:49:08.260]   Like unlike the switch to Intel and things like that, these chips have been going on
[01:49:08.260 --> 01:49:10.780]   for quite a long time.
[01:49:10.780 --> 01:49:17.060]   So a lot of the things that would be the hassle have been already worked out.
[01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:19.740]   Otherwise they wouldn't make this move so loud.
[01:49:19.740 --> 01:49:22.300]   They made this move much louder than before.
[01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:23.300]   Yeah.
[01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:24.300]   Yeah.
[01:49:24.300 --> 01:49:25.300]   Rosmer, is that true?
[01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:28.900]   Do you feel like developers are comfortable with the Apple Silicon already because of iPhone
[01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:30.620]   and iPad?
[01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:34.980]   I think a lot more people are ready to jump onto the latest thing.
[01:49:34.980 --> 01:49:38.980]   So I've seen a lot of developers, James Thompson, developer of P-Cal, and so on saying that
[01:49:38.980 --> 01:49:41.020]   they're ready for this.
[01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:47.020]   Now, of course, he's an app developer who has just a few apps, but he's also one person.
[01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:51.060]   And that's pretty impressive if a person is an early adopter.
[01:49:51.060 --> 01:49:56.140]   I mean, James, he jumps on, he had widgets before anybody else had widgets on.
[01:49:56.140 --> 01:49:57.140]   Yes.
[01:49:57.140 --> 01:49:58.140]   Yeah.
[01:49:58.140 --> 01:50:04.100]   The thing is, is seeing these developers ready to do that and seeing other people who are
[01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:08.620]   games developers saying, "Yeah, I'm going to get one of these."
[01:50:08.620 --> 01:50:13.100]   I wouldn't say it fills me with confidence, but it makes me extremely optimistic that these
[01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:16.540]   people want to do, they want to use this stuff.
[01:50:16.540 --> 01:50:20.100]   And sure, there'll be some big companies out there who don't necessarily get everything
[01:50:20.100 --> 01:50:22.380]   right and straight off the bat.
[01:50:22.380 --> 01:50:24.340]   Slash, they don't ever get anything right.
[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:25.340]   But you know what?
[01:50:25.340 --> 01:50:30.380]   When you start looking for a new solution and you figure it out and you move on to a new
[01:50:30.380 --> 01:50:34.300]   app that actually supports the hardware that you want to use, because that's the choice
[01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:35.580]   you have, right?
[01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:37.540]   Either the app or the hardware.
[01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:40.500]   And at some point, you're probably going to have to upgrade your hardware.
[01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:48.980]   It was really smart of Apple to try out all those superstar developers and have them just
[01:50:48.980 --> 01:50:55.060]   squealing over the new chip that really helps, I think, both end users and developers go,
[01:50:55.060 --> 01:50:57.380]   "Okay, okay, maybe this isn't going to be that bad."
[01:50:57.380 --> 01:50:58.380]   What do you think, Andy?
[01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:00.500]   Has Apple dodged a bullet?
[01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:03.940]   People said, "Don't buy a first generation anything."
[01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:06.860]   Would you feel more comfortable now after having seen what we see?
[01:51:06.860 --> 01:51:07.860]   Yeah.
[01:51:07.860 --> 01:51:11.660]   I think they sent the message they needed to say to get people confident.
[01:51:11.660 --> 01:51:15.540]   I do think, I do agree with Doc that this is going to be an early adopter machine and
[01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:21.620]   not the best choice maybe for someone who has a three, four, five-year-old Mac Mini and
[01:51:21.620 --> 01:51:23.580]   is thinking, "Gee, maybe it's time for me to upgrade.
[01:51:23.580 --> 01:51:27.020]   That'd be a good time to wait for a year."
[01:51:27.020 --> 01:51:30.700]   I like the fact that they really did stick their neck way out here.
[01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:36.740]   I was expecting that maybe they would choose to just do a MacBook Air and put that one
[01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:40.660]   out there because it would be an amazing enough announcement if they just simply said, "Hey,
[01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:42.020]   there's a new MacBook Air.
[01:51:42.020 --> 01:51:45.060]   It's the exact same price, but oh my God, look at the three times of performance.
[01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:46.060]   Oh my God, look at that.
[01:51:46.060 --> 01:51:47.060]   Excuse me.
[01:51:47.060 --> 01:51:51.580]   It's not three times of performance compared to Windows, but three much more better performance
[01:51:51.580 --> 01:51:56.380]   compared to the previous MacBook Air, same price, much better battery life, same price
[01:51:56.380 --> 01:51:57.500]   on and on and on.
[01:51:57.500 --> 01:52:04.380]   They really did say that they really did try to cover the most, the greatest breadth of
[01:52:04.380 --> 01:52:05.380]   Mac users out there.
[01:52:05.380 --> 01:52:09.060]   They got the person who wants the cheapest MacBook out there, the cheapest and the least
[01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:10.340]   powerful MacBook out there.
[01:52:10.340 --> 01:52:11.340]   Good.
[01:52:11.340 --> 01:52:13.620]   You've got your $999 MacBook Air.
[01:52:13.620 --> 01:52:15.820]   They got the baseline MacBook Pro user.
[01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:16.820]   Great, you got that.
[01:52:16.820 --> 01:52:20.700]   They even got one for the desktop user.
[01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:26.060]   That's not a move made by a company that is keeping its fingers crossed and doesn't think
[01:52:26.060 --> 01:52:30.540]   that they are attempting to do something that they can't do completely successfully.
[01:52:30.540 --> 01:52:31.540]   Yeah.
[01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:35.140]   Let's point out, the rumor mill got it wrong.
[01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:38.020]   They thought there would be a MacBook Air and a 13-inch MacBook Pro.
[01:52:38.020 --> 01:52:42.580]   They were right there, but they thought there would be a 16-inch MacBook Pro wrong there.
[01:52:42.580 --> 01:52:44.180]   No one expected a Mac Mini.
[01:52:44.180 --> 01:52:48.940]   I remember two years ago when Apple updated the Mac Mini after a long drought, we were
[01:52:48.940 --> 01:52:52.980]   all thrilled because, oh yeah, they still love the Mac Mini.
[01:52:52.980 --> 01:52:54.860]   That's a really interesting form pack factor.
[01:52:54.860 --> 01:52:57.380]   It's the least expensive Mac you can get.
[01:52:57.380 --> 01:53:02.220]   I think they are doing it because they want to say, "Look, if you only want to spend $699
[01:53:02.220 --> 01:53:07.100]   and dip your toes in the water, you've got a Mac Pro, for instance, but you just want
[01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:10.060]   to see what it's like to run stuff on an M1.
[01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:11.660]   Here is the Mac Mini."
[01:53:11.660 --> 01:53:14.220]   I think that that's super smart.
[01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:16.540]   That was the form factor for the developer edition.
[01:53:16.540 --> 01:53:19.260]   They're effectively keeping that going, but with a new processor.
[01:53:19.260 --> 01:53:25.380]   Let me play the video just a little bit of it from the keynote of all the developers
[01:53:25.380 --> 01:53:29.380]   talking about the new M1 chip.
[01:53:29.380 --> 01:53:30.380]   Hey.
[01:53:30.380 --> 01:53:31.380]   Hi.
[01:53:31.380 --> 01:53:32.380]   Hey.
[01:53:32.380 --> 01:53:33.380]   There you are.
[01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:34.380]   Hello, Vad.
[01:53:34.380 --> 01:53:35.380]   Hello, world.
[01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:37.380]   I work for a company called Panic Cinema 4D.
[01:53:37.380 --> 01:53:40.740]   All is Gate 3, I have been at Adobe for over 20 years at Panic.
[01:53:40.740 --> 01:53:42.340]   We make Mac software.
[01:53:42.340 --> 01:53:44.180]   Encoding app for kids.
[01:53:44.180 --> 01:53:46.620]   Most people will be less boring on video.
[01:53:46.620 --> 01:53:50.380]   When we first heard about Apple's Silicon on Mac, we were announcing that the Mac is
[01:53:50.380 --> 01:53:54.220]   transitioning to our own.
[01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:57.740]   So I won't go on and on because I don't want to get taken down, but you get the idea that
[01:53:57.740 --> 01:54:02.860]   they now, of course, developers want the chance to be on the keynote stage, but at the same
[01:54:02.860 --> 01:54:05.660]   time, I think this was genuine excitement.
[01:54:05.660 --> 01:54:10.860]   I mean, at some point, somebody brought out a harp and started playing, definitely music.
[01:54:10.860 --> 01:54:13.140]   Yeah, that was Kankase of Omni Group.
[01:54:13.140 --> 01:54:14.140]   Wasn't that great?
[01:54:14.140 --> 01:54:15.140]   Yeah.
[01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:17.980]   That was really a, that was not famed.
[01:54:17.980 --> 01:54:21.380]   That was genuine excitement over this new platform.
[01:54:21.380 --> 01:54:23.820]   Also smart moves because these are the super-stylers.
[01:54:23.820 --> 01:54:24.820]   Super-stylers.
[01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:28.380]   The people who are consumers out there might not have been familiar with all these apps,
[01:54:28.380 --> 01:54:31.260]   but the developer could be in the nose all of these faces and all these names.
[01:54:31.260 --> 01:54:35.500]   So that was a big sign of support.
[01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:38.620]   This is super, super exciting.
[01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:39.620]   Just a couple more.
[01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:41.580]   I mean, I guess there's other Apple news.
[01:54:41.580 --> 01:54:42.780]   Who cares?
[01:54:42.780 --> 01:54:46.980]   But I'll mention a few more.
[01:54:46.980 --> 01:54:50.500]   Apple has suspended business with its, one of its big manufacturers.
[01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:56.420]   You always hear about Foxconn, but Pegatron makes the laptops a big, big company from
[01:54:56.420 --> 01:54:57.660]   Apple's point of view.
[01:54:57.660 --> 01:55:03.380]   They've suspended their relationship after discovering that Pegatron was violating labor
[01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:06.180]   rules regarding a student worker program.
[01:55:06.180 --> 01:55:08.940]   This is actually fantastic news.
[01:55:08.940 --> 01:55:10.540]   This shows that Apple walks the walk.
[01:55:10.540 --> 01:55:15.740]   They don't just talk the talk in terms of protecting their workforce in China.
[01:55:15.740 --> 01:55:17.580]   I think this is really, really good.
[01:55:17.580 --> 01:55:18.580]   I'm glad to hear it.
[01:55:18.580 --> 01:55:20.700]   I'm sure it's a big issue.
[01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:22.700]   Pegatron is Taiwanese, by the way, not Chinese.
[01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:23.860]   I should correct that.
[01:55:23.860 --> 01:55:25.580]   But this is, I'm sure a big issue for Apple.
[01:55:25.580 --> 01:55:30.820]   It's not an easy thing to take Pegatron out of the supply chain, but the fact that they're
[01:55:30.820 --> 01:55:35.900]   willing to do that because they want to make sure workers are protected is very encouraging.
[01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:41.860]   So I wanted to mention that if you wanted to get a HomePod Mini, you waited too long.
[01:55:41.860 --> 01:55:42.860]   Sales begin.
[01:55:42.860 --> 01:55:46.540]   Yeah, I made that mistake yesterday morning.
[01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:50.540]   So I ordered one HomePod Mini on launch day, and then I decided, no, I'm giving my son
[01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:52.900]   as one to my parents for Christmas.
[01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:54.900]   It's a real presence.
[01:55:54.900 --> 01:55:55.900]   Yes.
[01:55:55.900 --> 01:55:56.900]   Yes.
[01:55:56.900 --> 01:55:57.900]   Yes.
[01:55:57.900 --> 01:55:58.900]   All my sonuses are going out the door slowly.
[01:55:58.900 --> 01:55:59.900]   Yeah.
[01:55:59.900 --> 01:56:03.780]   And my second HomePod is arriving in time for Christmas.
[01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:06.220]   I just December 23rd.
[01:56:06.220 --> 01:56:07.740]   Holy cow.
[01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:08.740]   And by now, it's probably...
[01:56:08.740 --> 01:56:12.700]   You won't be able to walk in and get one because there's no way to walk in and get one.
[01:56:12.700 --> 01:56:14.500]   No, we're going to walk in two.
[01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:15.500]   Nope.
[01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:17.740]   What about Best Buy Target?
[01:56:17.740 --> 01:56:22.300]   I'm slightly optimistic that maybe it'll actually ship sooner than expected, and I'll
[01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:24.020]   get it earlier than expected.
[01:56:24.020 --> 01:56:27.500]   I'm also hoping that my iPhone magically appears on Thursday and Thursday and Friday.
[01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:29.460]   But you know, that's wait and see.
[01:56:29.460 --> 01:56:31.460]   We all live in Hope, don't we, Rosemary?
[01:56:31.460 --> 01:56:34.220]   I think there's my talking about this test goal.
[01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:36.060]   Iphone 10S Max.
[01:56:36.060 --> 01:56:37.060]   Yeah.
[01:56:37.060 --> 01:56:38.860]   The little gap right there.
[01:56:38.860 --> 01:56:39.860]   Look at that.
[01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:41.860]   That's the difference right there.
[01:56:41.860 --> 01:56:42.860]   Yeah.
[01:56:42.860 --> 01:56:45.940]   Poor woman, you got to play with your case because you don't have a phone.
[01:56:45.940 --> 01:56:46.940]   Yeah.
[01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:50.700]   At least I have the case.
[01:56:50.700 --> 01:56:52.620]   Apple's a MagSafe Duo charger.
[01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:54.660]   A price has been announced.
[01:56:54.660 --> 01:57:00.580]   As bad as I was worried, $129, still no release date, though.
[01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:06.780]   Slowly, MagSafe and other connectors and adapters for the new iPhone 12 are slowly
[01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:07.780]   being announced.
[01:57:07.780 --> 01:57:11.700]   I thought this was a cool one, the MagSafe Duo, because you could charge a phone and
[01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:13.700]   a watch side by side.
[01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:14.780]   Now, I'm just 29 bucks.
[01:57:14.780 --> 01:57:17.820]   I don't think that's so bad for that dual charging.
[01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:19.660]   I don't know.
[01:57:19.660 --> 01:57:20.860]   Stylers.
[01:57:20.860 --> 01:57:21.860]   There are people who buy it.
[01:57:21.860 --> 01:57:25.740]   There are people who will be insulted, but they will have lots of third party options.
[01:57:25.740 --> 01:57:26.740]   Yeah.
[01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:27.740]   It's okay.
[01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:28.740]   Plenty of third party options.
[01:57:28.740 --> 01:57:32.860]   I actually considered it because I used to spend a lot of time on the road.
[01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:38.380]   Like last May, I literally was out every single weekend.
[01:57:38.380 --> 01:57:42.220]   Then I realized that there's a global pandemic and I'm not going anywhere.
[01:57:42.220 --> 01:57:43.220]   You're not going anywhere.
[01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:50.060]   So, I'll save my 129 pounds in this case rather than dollars and wait and see.
[01:57:50.060 --> 01:57:51.060]   Yeah.
[01:57:51.060 --> 01:57:53.860]   I've gained 129 pounds in the quarantine.
[01:57:53.860 --> 01:57:55.860]   Is that count?
[01:57:55.860 --> 01:57:56.860]   I do.
[01:57:56.860 --> 01:57:58.860]   Maybe they can trim it off.
[01:57:58.860 --> 01:58:03.420]   I do like to stand up charger for the Apple Watch.
[01:58:03.420 --> 01:58:04.780]   I've always preferred that.
[01:58:04.780 --> 01:58:06.220]   This looks like it folds in half.
[01:58:06.220 --> 01:58:08.540]   So it really is a travel charger.
[01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:12.940]   I mean, it's very similar to that original watch charger that they had, the round.
[01:58:12.940 --> 01:58:14.300]   Yeah, I have that.
[01:58:14.300 --> 01:58:15.300]   I love that.
[01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:16.300]   Yeah.
[01:58:16.300 --> 01:58:17.300]   That was 79 bucks, I think.
[01:58:17.300 --> 01:58:18.300]   Yeah, it was expensive.
[01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:23.620]   And you had to, I think you had to provide your own cable with that as well as the charging.
[01:58:23.620 --> 01:58:24.780]   They still sell it.
[01:58:24.780 --> 01:58:27.060]   I bought it for my mom because she's 87.
[01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:30.140]   I just thought getting that puck on the watch is going to be tricky.
[01:58:30.140 --> 01:58:31.660]   This way it'll be a little bit easier for.
[01:58:31.660 --> 01:58:32.660]   So they do still sell it.
[01:58:32.660 --> 01:58:37.460]   I just bought it for this is going to be maybe I should have waited.
[01:58:37.460 --> 01:58:39.340]   What is insulting is you're right.
[01:58:39.340 --> 01:58:45.180]   There is no cable in the box for this hundred twenty nine dollar duo charger.
[01:58:45.180 --> 01:58:48.500]   I thought there was a cable, but there was no plug.
[01:58:48.500 --> 01:58:49.500]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:58:49.500 --> 01:58:50.500]   You're right.
[01:58:50.500 --> 01:58:51.500]   Thank you.
[01:58:51.500 --> 01:58:53.580]   There's no power brick.
[01:58:53.580 --> 01:58:55.420]   That's Apple's new thing.
[01:58:55.420 --> 01:59:03.100]   So to save the environment and avoid wasteful packaging or you're welcome to help anchor
[01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:05.100]   out a lot.
[01:59:05.100 --> 01:59:11.820]   Except the fact that the new Mac safe doesn't work right with any charger except the Apple
[01:59:11.820 --> 01:59:12.820]   twenty watt USB charger.
[01:59:12.820 --> 01:59:13.820]   What?
[01:59:13.820 --> 01:59:17.140]   Oh, no, at least that's what I heard it won't do the fifteen watts of charging on.
[01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:19.260]   Oh, you only get seven and a half.
[01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:20.780]   Yeah, a note.
[01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:21.780]   Ten.
[01:59:21.780 --> 01:59:22.780]   Ten.
[01:59:22.780 --> 01:59:23.780]   Okay.
[01:59:23.780 --> 01:59:25.860]   Seven and a half is the normal cheese speed.
[01:59:25.860 --> 01:59:27.940]   Fifteen is the mag safe speed.
[01:59:27.940 --> 01:59:31.020]   Oh, so you got to get the Apple guy.
[01:59:31.020 --> 01:59:32.020]   I think so.
[01:59:32.020 --> 01:59:33.020]   I mean, I've ordered.
[01:59:33.020 --> 01:59:35.540]   It's it's arriving right.
[01:59:35.540 --> 01:59:40.340]   If you don't need the speed fans, stay with the lower watt is because in the long run charging
[01:59:40.340 --> 01:59:44.660]   battery or lower water just bear for the battery, you know, writ large.
[01:59:44.660 --> 01:59:48.900]   So at that, I mean, honestly, no biggie, right?
[01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:53.060]   And that this this kerfuffle has come out about the brick.
[01:59:53.060 --> 01:59:55.020]   Nancy drives me nuts.
[01:59:55.020 --> 01:59:59.180]   And I know we take people aren't supposed to compare it to the way we do things.
[01:59:59.180 --> 02:00:04.860]   I don't think I've taken an Apple brick out of an Apple box since third party.
[02:00:04.860 --> 02:00:05.860]   Yeah.
[02:00:05.860 --> 02:00:06.860]   Game of thing.
[02:00:06.860 --> 02:00:07.860]   No, I even love box.
[02:00:07.860 --> 02:00:08.860]   You're right.
[02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:09.860]   You're right.
[02:00:09.860 --> 02:00:11.820]   And okay, I said, okay, you're weird.
[02:00:11.820 --> 02:00:12.820]   You're a tech guy.
[02:00:12.820 --> 02:00:14.380]   You got all kinds of ways of charge.
[02:00:14.380 --> 02:00:20.740]   I went through my family starting with my 11 year old knees and my 74 year old mother
[02:00:20.740 --> 02:00:23.660]   in law, like everybody, you know what?
[02:00:23.660 --> 02:00:25.460]   Nobody uses their break anymore.
[02:00:25.460 --> 02:00:26.460]   None of them.
[02:00:26.460 --> 02:00:28.580]   So I'm like, this is such a non story.
[02:00:28.580 --> 02:00:29.900]   It's not even funny.
[02:00:29.900 --> 02:00:31.740]   It's super obnoxious.
[02:00:31.740 --> 02:00:35.380]   And I had to double check because last year or year and a half ago when I renovated my
[02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:40.660]   house, Costco was selling two pack AC outlets with dual USBs.
[02:00:40.660 --> 02:00:46.860]   I switched every socket in the house to those because that two pack was like 12, 15 bucks.
[02:00:46.860 --> 02:00:49.180]   So I mean, I don't need a brick for anything.
[02:00:49.180 --> 02:00:53.140]   So I guess maybe I don't use them, but I just thought I would check and nobody I know really
[02:00:53.140 --> 02:00:54.140]   uses their brick.
[02:00:54.140 --> 02:00:58.940]   So that story just irritates me because people are like working it in YouTube.
[02:00:58.940 --> 02:01:02.340]   Oh, Apple, that is your bridge anymore.
[02:01:02.340 --> 02:01:06.300]   Stop.
[02:01:06.300 --> 02:01:10.860]   I distinctly remember the last time I spotted my dad using his iPhone charging brick.
[02:01:10.860 --> 02:01:14.940]   It was the day that he was complaining that his iPad wasn't charging right.
[02:01:14.940 --> 02:01:20.660]   Oh, he plugged his iPad into his iPhone charging brick and was wondering why I was
[02:01:20.660 --> 02:01:23.380]   trying to slowly that little five watt charger.
[02:01:23.380 --> 02:01:24.380]   Oh my God.
[02:01:24.380 --> 02:01:25.380]   Yeah.
[02:01:25.380 --> 02:01:29.100]   And he would say like iPads are really bad because they charged so slowly and I had to
[02:01:29.100 --> 02:01:31.620]   explain he's using the wrong charging brick.
[02:01:31.620 --> 02:01:33.940]   And he should just use the iPad one for everything.
[02:01:33.940 --> 02:01:38.580]   They're so lucky to be so lucky to have you as a daughter.
[02:01:38.580 --> 02:01:39.580]   It's okay.
[02:01:39.580 --> 02:01:43.300]   I got them onto the key charging bandwagon last year and there's now a couple of key
[02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:47.660]   charging stands just dotted around the house and they just put their phones on that.
[02:01:47.660 --> 02:01:48.660]   Okay.
[02:01:48.660 --> 02:01:51.660]   So my mom again, and she's pretty tech literate.
[02:01:51.660 --> 02:01:55.260]   She's older than your mom and dad, obviously 87.
[02:01:55.260 --> 02:01:58.740]   But I did get her, you know, the Apple Watch charger.
[02:01:58.740 --> 02:02:04.300]   But for some reason she was trying to attach the front of the watch to the charger, not
[02:02:04.300 --> 02:02:05.620]   the back.
[02:02:05.620 --> 02:02:09.380]   She said, well, isn't and she was wearing the watch with the round part out.
[02:02:09.380 --> 02:02:12.500]   She said, isn't that because the round part, that's the watch face, right?
[02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:16.860]   Said mom, flip it over the square part is a watch face.
[02:02:16.860 --> 02:02:18.420]   The round parts apart you attach.
[02:02:18.420 --> 02:02:20.060]   She said, Oh, it's got a little click.
[02:02:20.060 --> 02:02:22.940]   I said, yes, that's a sign.
[02:02:22.940 --> 02:02:23.940]   That's a sign.
[02:02:23.940 --> 02:02:27.820]   Well, my grandmother is 84 and she she is doing fine with her Apple watch.
[02:02:27.820 --> 02:02:29.020]   She's got two iPads as well.
[02:02:29.020 --> 02:02:30.020]   So she's pretty nice.
[02:02:30.020 --> 02:02:32.780]   Yeah, it's it's impressive.
[02:02:32.780 --> 02:02:38.460]   And I she's also not using a standard charger doctor because I bought her four USB port charger
[02:02:38.460 --> 02:02:42.340]   so that she could actually plug everything into one PowerPoint and just charge it all
[02:02:42.340 --> 02:02:43.340]   at the same time.
[02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:50.620]   I seriously was going to put the hyper juice again chargers as my pick for this week because
[02:02:50.620 --> 02:02:53.860]   they have a new one coming out and it's a kickstarter.
[02:02:53.860 --> 02:02:57.380]   But don't think them as a kickstarter company, they've been out forever.
[02:02:57.380 --> 02:03:03.220]   We all had hyper juice battery bricks for our Mac like eons ago when we were still able
[02:03:03.220 --> 02:03:08.180]   to go to Mac world and see Leo and Andy talking in the corner in those lovely chairs.
[02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:13.820]   So the new one you can stack them because they have a port a past new port to plug things
[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:14.900]   into.
[02:03:14.900 --> 02:03:16.380]   So get in charge of people.
[02:03:16.380 --> 02:03:18.020]   That's the best way to do all it is.
[02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:20.180]   And they're super light and they're small.
[02:03:20.180 --> 02:03:22.540]   Yeah, I have a ton of them.
[02:03:22.540 --> 02:03:26.300]   So Rosemary, you may not be you may be getting your phone a little earlier.
[02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:28.620]   The Apple is a little bit ahead of the game.
[02:03:28.620 --> 02:03:33.260]   According to nine to five Mac, you can't tell from the Apple website.
[02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:41.300]   You have to go to the UPS site and use apparently use the phone.
[02:03:41.300 --> 02:03:45.620]   I don't know the phone number listed on your Apple order or your own order number without
[02:03:45.620 --> 02:03:49.980]   the last two digits because if you look as mine is, it says preparing a ship.
[02:03:49.980 --> 02:03:51.980]   So I have no tracking information.
[02:03:51.980 --> 02:03:59.060]   But when people do that, apparently, good news, some of them anyway are getting theirs earlier.
[02:03:59.060 --> 02:04:00.300]   Are you have you done that?
[02:04:00.300 --> 02:04:05.620]   Rosemary, is that no, I believe mine is coming with DPD here in the UK and I've not yet received
[02:04:05.620 --> 02:04:09.260]   a notification from them to say that something is on its way.
[02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:15.940]   But I also have recently since moving house had DPD packages turn up without notice at
[02:04:15.940 --> 02:04:18.460]   all, which was great because they were three days early.
[02:04:18.460 --> 02:04:20.420]   So I'm I'm crossing my fingers.
[02:04:20.420 --> 02:04:26.500]   Well, this scares the hell out of me because I see my one iPhone 12 pro max, the one for
[02:04:26.500 --> 02:04:31.860]   Lisa arrives Friday, November 13th, but mine in blue shipment delayed.
[02:04:31.860 --> 02:04:33.860]   Wait a minute.
[02:04:33.860 --> 02:04:34.860]   Don't say that.
[02:04:34.860 --> 02:04:36.420]   Wait a minute.
[02:04:36.420 --> 02:04:40.020]   Then when I click on it though, it says arrives Friday.
[02:04:40.020 --> 02:04:41.700]   So I don't know.
[02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:42.700]   Okay.
[02:04:42.700 --> 02:04:43.700]   I know.
[02:04:43.700 --> 02:04:44.700]   I give you.
[02:04:44.700 --> 02:04:45.700]   It's not me.
[02:04:45.700 --> 02:04:46.700]   It's not me.
[02:04:46.700 --> 02:04:47.700]   You Apple gave you the heart attack.
[02:04:47.700 --> 02:04:49.900]   I'm just reporting what I'm seeing.
[02:04:49.900 --> 02:04:52.500]   What heart is fresh and delayed?
[02:04:52.500 --> 02:04:58.100]   Well, I've noticed whenever the Apple website goes down in a bounce of an event, you can't
[02:04:58.100 --> 02:04:59.100]   track your parsley.
[02:04:59.100 --> 02:05:00.300]   Oh, that's what you're thinking.
[02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:01.300]   You can't check anything.
[02:05:01.300 --> 02:05:06.420]   So they knock everything out because the deliveries app by June cloud usually does a
[02:05:06.420 --> 02:05:11.380]   great job of tracking everything like they split out my different orders so that, you
[02:05:11.380 --> 02:05:14.060]   know, like one order has two things in the case is already here.
[02:05:14.060 --> 02:05:16.300]   The phone is not yet here.
[02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:18.020]   And they do a pretty good job.
[02:05:18.020 --> 02:05:22.060]   And during the Apple event, if you hit refresh, then it just goes, can't find it.
[02:05:22.060 --> 02:05:25.700]   I will be angry though, if Lisa's comes before mine.
[02:05:25.700 --> 02:05:26.700]   I will.
[02:05:26.700 --> 02:05:28.260]   You can just borrow her is temporarily right.
[02:05:28.260 --> 02:05:29.260]   Yeah, good luck.
[02:05:29.260 --> 02:05:30.500]   For science.
[02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:31.500]   I need both hands.
[02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:35.300]   I can't, I can't do that.
[02:05:35.300 --> 02:05:41.900]   Apple did threaten to remove ish and a bunch of other Unix shell iOS apps and they have
[02:05:41.900 --> 02:05:42.900]   now backtracked.
[02:05:42.900 --> 02:05:45.180]   Thank goodness.
[02:05:45.180 --> 02:05:48.700]   I'm not sure what their rationale was.
[02:05:48.700 --> 02:05:50.860]   They said it was a mistake.
[02:05:50.860 --> 02:05:58.220]   A shell and ish allow you to do things like W get and pip in iOS.
[02:05:58.220 --> 02:05:59.700]   Have you ever tried any of those Rosemary?
[02:05:59.700 --> 02:06:00.700]   I don't know.
[02:06:00.700 --> 02:06:01.700]   Yes.
[02:06:01.700 --> 02:06:07.660]   I personally use prompt, which comes from panic here in the keynote today, but I know
[02:06:07.660 --> 02:06:13.340]   a lot of people who use ish and other terminal type apps and they seem to work really, really
[02:06:13.340 --> 02:06:18.300]   well and make the iPad into a much more capable development tool than it would otherwise
[02:06:18.300 --> 02:06:19.300]   be.
[02:06:19.300 --> 02:06:23.820]   So I personally think that these belong in the app store and they belong on the iPad,
[02:06:23.820 --> 02:06:29.840]   just like LumaFusion and Fairight and all of these other creativity or creative tools
[02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:30.840]   and apps do.
[02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:31.840]   I agree.
[02:06:31.840 --> 02:06:35.340]   Ish and the others have said, oh, it's okay.
[02:06:35.340 --> 02:06:39.820]   The removal threat according to developers was due to the team believing the app was not
[02:06:39.820 --> 02:06:44.660]   self-contained and has remote package updating functionality.
[02:06:44.660 --> 02:06:49.700]   It thought ish might be a security concern if it allowed users to import code into the
[02:06:49.700 --> 02:06:50.700]   app.
[02:06:50.700 --> 02:06:57.340]   Ish responded and as did A shell and I think they got, I think the curl.
[02:06:57.340 --> 02:07:01.700]   That doesn't explain why they were going to remove all of the terminal apps at the same
[02:07:01.700 --> 02:07:02.700]   time.
[02:07:02.700 --> 02:07:03.700]   Yeah.
[02:07:03.700 --> 02:07:05.780]   Because surely only one of them would have come to it.
[02:07:05.780 --> 02:07:09.780]   I think curl was what scared of the A shell was told that you were going to do that.
[02:07:09.780 --> 02:07:17.780]   You need to remove curl, which is downloads, C URL allows you to download files, PIP, which
[02:07:17.780 --> 02:07:19.060]   I don't know what their PIP is.
[02:07:19.060 --> 02:07:20.900]   I presume it's the Python installer PIP.
[02:07:20.900 --> 02:07:21.900]   I don't know.
[02:07:21.900 --> 02:07:24.740]   And Wasm, which is the WebAssembly package.
[02:07:24.740 --> 02:07:27.580]   Have they used terminal on a Mac recently, the people in App Review?
[02:07:27.580 --> 02:07:28.580]   Yeah.
[02:07:28.580 --> 02:07:29.580]   Yeah.
[02:07:29.580 --> 02:07:37.900]   Anyway, this was an update in the app store review guidelines.
[02:07:37.900 --> 02:07:40.700]   They said that violated it, but they have Apple as back down.
[02:07:40.700 --> 02:07:43.580]   So that's good news for people who use those tools because they are good tools.
[02:07:43.580 --> 02:07:44.580]   They're very handy.
[02:07:44.580 --> 02:07:47.820]   I like having them available.
[02:07:47.820 --> 02:07:51.900]   FDA has cleared, and I would love to know more about this, has cleared an app for the
[02:07:51.900 --> 02:07:58.740]   Apple Watch called Night Watch, which is designed for people, or I'm sorry, Night Wear,
[02:07:58.740 --> 02:08:05.020]   which is designed for people who have PTSD related nightmares.
[02:08:05.020 --> 02:08:11.220]   So FDA's permitted marketing this device intended for the temporary reduction of sleep
[02:08:11.220 --> 02:08:17.300]   disturbance related to nightmares in adults 22 or older who suffer from nightmare disorder
[02:08:17.300 --> 02:08:20.180]   or have PTSD related nightmares.
[02:08:20.180 --> 02:08:26.420]   The device provides gentle vibration through touch based on the analysis of the heart rate
[02:08:26.420 --> 02:08:27.940]   and motion during sleep.
[02:08:27.940 --> 02:08:31.980]   So you start thrashing and your heart rate goes to 200.
[02:08:31.980 --> 02:08:34.460]   It'll buzz you and wake you up.
[02:08:34.460 --> 02:08:35.460]   Interesting.
[02:08:35.460 --> 02:08:37.700]   It could be huge.
[02:08:37.700 --> 02:08:41.340]   If you have these kind of night terrors, you know, there's no fun.
[02:08:41.340 --> 02:08:42.340]   There's no fun.
[02:08:42.340 --> 02:08:43.340]   Yeah.
[02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:44.340]   It's interesting.
[02:08:44.340 --> 02:08:51.940]   I get the sleep paralysis and it happens, you know, once every couple months, and it
[02:08:51.940 --> 02:08:56.140]   freaks you out because they say the way to make it go away is to stop thinking about it
[02:08:56.140 --> 02:08:58.020]   and just naturally go away.
[02:08:58.020 --> 02:09:01.300]   But it's hard to stop thinking about it when you're freaked out.
[02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:02.860]   Someone's pressing you in the bed.
[02:09:02.860 --> 02:09:03.860]   Yeah.
[02:09:03.860 --> 02:09:06.940]   It's from I know I haven't been, you know, diagnosed.
[02:09:06.940 --> 02:09:08.460]   They can't say where it comes from.
[02:09:08.460 --> 02:09:12.860]   If it's hereditary or dietary, whatever, but my doctor does believe is most likely due
[02:09:12.860 --> 02:09:14.500]   to my time in service.
[02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:17.940]   But yeah, it's just it's just super weird.
[02:09:17.940 --> 02:09:20.140]   You're like, I can't move.
[02:09:20.140 --> 02:09:22.380]   And then tell me what that's I have heard about this.
[02:09:22.380 --> 02:09:25.820]   So you're you feel like you're awake, but you Andy and I holding you down in the bed
[02:09:25.820 --> 02:09:29.380]   and you really want to move like you really want to get up, you know, go grab drink of
[02:09:29.380 --> 02:09:31.100]   water, take a whiz, whatever.
[02:09:31.100 --> 02:09:32.260]   You cannot move.
[02:09:32.260 --> 02:09:33.260]   Wow.
[02:09:33.260 --> 02:09:39.340]   It lasts for say anywhere from say 30 seconds to as long as about three minutes.
[02:09:39.340 --> 02:09:41.820]   But again, the harder you fight it, the more you press down.
[02:09:41.820 --> 02:09:44.260]   And it literally does feel like someone's pressing you down.
[02:09:44.260 --> 02:09:45.260]   That's scary.
[02:09:45.260 --> 02:09:46.900]   You can't move anything in your body.
[02:09:46.900 --> 02:09:49.260]   It just yeah, that's really scary.
[02:09:49.260 --> 02:09:50.260]   Yeah.
[02:09:50.260 --> 02:09:51.260]   It's free.
[02:09:51.260 --> 02:09:52.860]   Did you do you serve in combat?
[02:09:52.860 --> 02:09:54.420]   Yeah, quite.
[02:09:54.420 --> 02:09:55.420]   Wow.
[02:09:55.420 --> 02:09:57.180]   I didn't know that.
[02:09:57.180 --> 02:10:01.060]   Do you have related nightmares or other issues?
[02:10:01.060 --> 02:10:02.060]   Just that.
[02:10:02.060 --> 02:10:03.060]   Just that.
[02:10:03.060 --> 02:10:05.980]   My knees are jacked from jumping out of planes.
[02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:07.980]   Oh, were you airborne?
[02:10:07.980 --> 02:10:09.980]   Doc is a paramedic.
[02:10:09.980 --> 02:10:10.980]   Yeah.
[02:10:10.980 --> 02:10:11.980]   Oh, you were an airborne doc.
[02:10:11.980 --> 02:10:14.140]   Good for you.
[02:10:14.140 --> 02:10:16.180]   That's why they call you Doc Rock.
[02:10:16.180 --> 02:10:17.180]   Exactly.
[02:10:17.180 --> 02:10:19.340]   I didn't understand that.
[02:10:19.340 --> 02:10:20.420]   Nobody filled me in.
[02:10:20.420 --> 02:10:22.620]   I need my briefing booklet on you.
[02:10:22.620 --> 02:10:27.620]   Well, yeah, it's a it's just a really, really weird sensation.
[02:10:27.620 --> 02:10:31.900]   And I wonder if this would help like, yeah, but I charge my watch at night.
[02:10:31.900 --> 02:10:32.900]   I don't wear it.
[02:10:32.900 --> 02:10:33.900]   I do too.
[02:10:33.900 --> 02:10:35.580]   Lisa tried to wear watch last night.
[02:10:35.580 --> 02:10:38.340]   We were all kept awake by the brightness of the light.
[02:10:38.340 --> 02:10:41.980]   But in theater mode.
[02:10:41.980 --> 02:10:44.540]   She just took it off and thrown away.
[02:10:44.540 --> 02:10:47.420]   Time-based automations automatically put it in theater mode.
[02:10:47.420 --> 02:10:48.420]   Oh, really?
[02:10:48.420 --> 02:10:50.900]   Oh, this rosemary right there.
[02:10:50.900 --> 02:10:53.140]   Where can I get those rosemary orchard?
[02:10:53.140 --> 02:10:59.820]   Surecuts app automations tab, time-based trigger, set Apple Watch Cinema Mode to on and then
[02:10:59.820 --> 02:11:01.820]   disable us before running.
[02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:02.820]   Perfect.
[02:11:02.820 --> 02:11:08.740]   So that's that's the solution, right?
[02:11:08.740 --> 02:11:10.060]   Cinema mode, then your watch wouldn't.
[02:11:10.060 --> 02:11:12.940]   I mean, actually the sleep mode on the watch should also do it.
[02:11:12.940 --> 02:11:14.580]   If you put it in sleep mode, yeah.
[02:11:14.580 --> 02:11:17.620]   Yeah, I mean, mine automatically jumps into sleep mode.
[02:11:17.620 --> 02:11:23.620]   But I decided that I wanted cinema mode as well because I use cinema mode automatically
[02:11:23.620 --> 02:11:28.180]   when do not disturb is turned on, which is actually quite useful because then if I'm driving,
[02:11:28.180 --> 02:11:31.620]   it enables do not stirple driving and my watch is in cinema mode.
[02:11:31.620 --> 02:11:35.300]   So I won't see my screen lighting up and stuff when I'm turning corners.
[02:11:35.300 --> 02:11:40.700]   It's too bad there's nowhere we can go to get shortcuts that would help us use our devices
[02:11:40.700 --> 02:11:44.420]   better all the time.
[02:11:44.420 --> 02:11:46.260]   RosemaryOrchard.com, maybe?
[02:11:46.260 --> 02:11:47.260]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:11:47.260 --> 02:11:48.260]   It's maybe.
[02:11:48.260 --> 02:11:51.260]   The Automators podcast and also MatthewKessinelli.com.
[02:11:51.260 --> 02:11:52.260]   Matthew Dusbury.
[02:11:52.260 --> 02:11:56.180]   Great show here onto it.
[02:11:56.180 --> 02:11:58.340]   Yeah.
[02:11:58.340 --> 02:12:00.820]   Final story before we get to our picks of the week.
[02:12:00.820 --> 02:12:07.940]   Panasonic has built a vacuum to rescue air pods that have fallen out of the train.
[02:12:07.940 --> 02:12:09.780]   Of course, it's only in Japan.
[02:12:09.780 --> 02:12:16.660]   A special vacuum designed it's they worked with Japan's JR East rail group, a special
[02:12:16.660 --> 02:12:23.940]   cordless vacuum that's designed to nab a straight pair of wireless earbuds.
[02:12:23.940 --> 02:12:28.660]   Normally they would use a mechanical grabber to pick up things like shoes or larger devices,
[02:12:28.660 --> 02:12:32.980]   but the buds are so small they just can't get those grabbers in there.
[02:12:32.980 --> 02:12:37.140]   So now see there's a little air pod on the end of it.
[02:12:37.140 --> 02:12:42.420]   I love the fact that one of the comments on this article is like pretty much all these
[02:12:42.420 --> 02:12:46.620]   wireless headphones are magnetic so couldn't they just use a stick with a magnet on it.
[02:12:46.620 --> 02:12:47.620]   Oh clever.
[02:12:47.620 --> 02:12:48.980]   I kind of want to try that now.
[02:12:48.980 --> 02:12:49.980]   Yeah.
[02:12:49.980 --> 02:12:52.220]   I have some very powerful small magnets.
[02:12:52.220 --> 02:12:54.860]   In New York you lose your earpuds.
[02:12:54.860 --> 02:12:59.500]   That's your problem buddy, what do you want me to do about it?
[02:12:59.500 --> 02:13:01.260]   Fan they rescue them.
[02:13:01.260 --> 02:13:10.500]   Apparently JR East said they had 950 incidents of dropped earbuds between July and September.
[02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:14.980]   They try to pick them up after the last trains of the day so that I don't know if they return
[02:13:14.980 --> 02:13:15.980]   them to consumers.
[02:13:15.980 --> 02:13:19.420]   There must be just a big box of air air pods.
[02:13:19.420 --> 02:13:22.860]   I don't know how you'd figure out that one's mine.
[02:13:22.860 --> 02:13:30.100]   So the person who commented about just using a magnetic stick, yeah they don't go to Japan
[02:13:30.100 --> 02:13:31.100]   very often.
[02:13:31.100 --> 02:13:33.620]   What does the train do on those trains?
[02:13:33.620 --> 02:13:35.820]   It's not a friction wheel.
[02:13:35.820 --> 02:13:37.220]   It's a magnet.
[02:13:37.220 --> 02:13:43.660]   So it's a problem to the train if it happens to get sucked up into the magnet.
[02:13:43.660 --> 02:13:46.100]   Oh that's why they have to do it.
[02:13:46.100 --> 02:13:49.860]   They actually have to do it at the end of the not to return them just to get them out
[02:13:49.860 --> 02:13:50.860]   of there.
[02:13:50.860 --> 02:13:55.380]   They're not going to use a magnetic stick but when you have a giant magnetic rail there
[02:13:55.380 --> 02:13:57.940]   all that stick is going to do is bump.
[02:13:57.940 --> 02:14:01.100]   That sounds like a fun game.
[02:14:01.100 --> 02:14:03.900]   It's going to be like a non-spersion of go fish.
[02:14:03.900 --> 02:14:07.660]   Carson says in New York they train the rats to pick them up.
[02:14:07.660 --> 02:14:08.660]   That's the way.
[02:14:08.660 --> 02:14:10.660]   That's probably more accurate.
[02:14:10.660 --> 02:14:13.380]   Yeah we got a rat down there right now.
[02:14:13.380 --> 02:14:15.420]   Don't worry about it.
[02:14:15.420 --> 02:14:19.380]   He's working on it.
[02:14:19.380 --> 02:14:24.900]   Alright I think it's going to be time for our picks of the week next.
[02:14:24.900 --> 02:14:26.980]   I hope they prepared you for our picks of the week.
[02:14:26.980 --> 02:14:31.380]   Rosemary Orchard you must have something you're excited about these.
[02:14:31.380 --> 02:14:35.940]   So I've just been doing a lot of file management over the last couple of weeks and the app
[02:14:35.940 --> 02:14:40.220]   of my choice that I've been using for this is forklift which is from binary nights.
[02:14:40.220 --> 02:14:41.860]   It's a great app.
[02:14:41.860 --> 02:14:43.300]   It's dual pain.
[02:14:43.300 --> 02:14:47.380]   You can connect to SFTP service and all sorts of things with it.
[02:14:47.380 --> 02:14:49.580]   Is this like a finder replacement or?
[02:14:49.580 --> 02:14:54.700]   Yeah it can be a finder replacement or you can just use it for remote servers.
[02:14:54.700 --> 02:14:58.780]   But I love that you can connect it to all these different file providers because it
[02:14:58.780 --> 02:15:00.140]   just makes life easy.
[02:15:00.140 --> 02:15:05.420]   You can save favorites all sorts of things and I like the fact that I can have different
[02:15:05.420 --> 02:15:09.420]   favorites on different devices.
[02:15:09.420 --> 02:15:14.100]   Sorry different favorites in forklift to on you know in finder so that I can easily jump
[02:15:14.100 --> 02:15:18.740]   around between different things but I've got connections saved there all sorts.
[02:15:18.740 --> 02:15:19.900]   It is great.
[02:15:19.900 --> 02:15:24.660]   It works really well and if people have a set up subscription it's part of set up as well
[02:15:24.660 --> 02:15:27.060]   which makes it you know free for those people.
[02:15:27.060 --> 02:15:28.060]   Nice.
[02:15:28.060 --> 02:15:29.420]   Or part of the subscription price.
[02:15:29.420 --> 02:15:34.500]   When you copy with forklift you don't get that irritating thing where one file just creates
[02:15:34.500 --> 02:15:39.340]   a problem and then finder says alright forget it I don't send the rest.
[02:15:39.340 --> 02:15:43.700]   Or when you can skip around that file and keep going.
[02:15:43.700 --> 02:15:44.700]   Exactly.
[02:15:44.700 --> 02:15:46.420]   That is worth every cent.
[02:15:46.420 --> 02:15:51.220]   Yeah that is actually 100% the reason why I was there I was trying to copy a bunch of
[02:15:51.220 --> 02:15:56.100]   files to a hard drive hard drive is formatted and it can't take files bigger than four gigs
[02:15:56.100 --> 02:16:04.140]   and I had one file that was 4.01 gigs and I finder was driving me crazy forklift just
[02:16:04.140 --> 02:16:09.140]   fixed it.
[02:16:09.140 --> 02:16:14.660]   So I've played with pathfinder and I noted the forklift was out there as a finder replacement
[02:16:14.660 --> 02:16:19.140]   but this looks more like something like transmit or something it's more about.
[02:16:19.140 --> 02:16:23.780]   Yeah it's halfway between pathfinder and transmit I would say it feels really polished it's
[02:16:23.780 --> 02:16:28.540]   got a nice UI it's got you know a sidebar so that you can see previews of your files
[02:16:28.540 --> 02:16:29.540]   and things like that.
[02:16:29.540 --> 02:16:31.660]   Oh I'm gonna have to get this yeah.
[02:16:31.660 --> 02:16:36.540]   I keep trying pathfinder thinking I like it and then I go and it's not really I like the
[02:16:36.540 --> 02:16:38.140]   finders the finder.
[02:16:38.140 --> 02:16:43.580]   Thirty dollars for a single use license family license is fifty dollars.
[02:16:43.580 --> 02:16:44.580]   Good choice.
[02:16:44.580 --> 02:16:47.060]   I thank you I'm gonna take a look at that.
[02:16:47.060 --> 02:16:48.940]   I've been looking for something like it.
[02:16:48.940 --> 02:16:51.220]   Andy and I go pick of the week.
[02:16:51.220 --> 02:16:55.660]   I don't have anything that is like a thing or a piece of software pick of the week so
[02:16:55.660 --> 02:17:01.100]   instead I'm gonna give it give a tip that actually worked really well for me.
[02:17:01.100 --> 02:17:06.820]   When you're at your desk wherever you do your work just open up a window for eBay or whatever
[02:17:06.820 --> 02:17:12.220]   online store usually shop at and just turn your head from like this way to this way looking
[02:17:12.220 --> 02:17:16.740]   for little things that you need to buy the cost ten dollars or less to solve problems
[02:17:16.740 --> 02:17:22.100]   I've been driving you nuts for months because every time because I'm saying it sounds stupid
[02:17:22.100 --> 02:17:26.500]   but there the number of times where like I'll give you a good example like this very very
[02:17:26.500 --> 02:17:28.940]   simple little desk lamp okay.
[02:17:28.940 --> 02:17:34.220]   And it's big because the clocks turn forward now like at the middle of the afternoon it's
[02:17:34.220 --> 02:17:38.780]   too dark to work in my office without a desk lamp and I've been turning on like my studio
[02:17:38.780 --> 02:17:43.260]   lights because when I sit down to get work done I'm just in the mood to get work done
[02:17:43.260 --> 02:17:47.660]   that's it and I don't think about it and it wasn't until like because of something else
[02:17:47.660 --> 02:17:51.980]   I'm just like oh that's right if I want to if I want that I keep meaning to buy like a
[02:17:51.980 --> 02:17:55.860]   new bracket for my for my camera so I can mount it to this thing and then like I'm on
[02:17:55.860 --> 02:17:59.500]   Amazon said you know what I'm gonna buy that desk lamp that keep money to buy it you know
[02:17:59.500 --> 02:18:04.500]   what I really do I still need that that longer cord for my for for this monitor and by the
[02:18:04.500 --> 02:18:09.900]   time I was done I spent 90 something dollars on again little things that cost ten dollars
[02:18:09.900 --> 02:18:15.420]   or less that have solved like almost every super annoying irritating problem that I've
[02:18:15.420 --> 02:18:20.820]   been that's easy to solve this $10 dollar device so do that right now look around even
[02:18:20.820 --> 02:18:24.380]   if it's like your kitchen this is a problem that every time you go to cook something you
[02:18:24.380 --> 02:18:28.660]   oh I wish there is a it was a holder for this knife right there if you're in the living
[02:18:28.660 --> 02:18:32.700]   room where oh I wish they were another power outlet or power strip right there just sit
[02:18:32.700 --> 02:18:37.220]   down to the places where you sit let's spend 10 minutes just looking around point by point
[02:18:37.220 --> 02:18:41.940]   by point find everything that makes you the the disappointment of the frustration and the
[02:18:41.940 --> 02:18:46.540]   futility and the rage of daily existence well up inside you and when you recognize it oh
[02:18:46.540 --> 02:18:51.660]   that's right I just need to buy that little eight dollar pack of cable ties by the cable
[02:18:51.660 --> 02:18:54.900]   ties it'll work out so you're not saying go to eBay and look around you're saying look
[02:18:54.900 --> 02:19:00.140]   around the house and then go to eBay I'm saying I wouldn't have done it if had I not
[02:19:00.140 --> 02:19:05.260]   just simply had that window open in front of me oh I've just made it just making it as
[02:19:05.260 --> 02:19:09.620]   easy as possible or no I'm not gonna write down a to do list I'm not gonna remind myself
[02:19:09.620 --> 02:19:16.100]   to later on do this I'm just gonna I was it was literally a case of oh yeah that's right
[02:19:16.100 --> 02:19:21.260]   I wish that I had like another USB hub specifically for my keyboard my mouse keyboard for my
[02:19:21.260 --> 02:19:25.660]   mouse but bought oh oh that's right I need another waste basket just for this test of
[02:19:25.660 --> 02:19:29.780]   people don't get cluttered but it bought and then of course I had this big pile of stuff
[02:19:29.780 --> 02:19:34.220]   from Amazon coming in three days later but that that's not it it's I used to do that
[02:19:34.220 --> 02:19:39.340]   with Ali Baba but the I'm still waiting for stuff two years later so you can probably
[02:19:39.340 --> 02:19:44.140]   it's a good idea it's cheap on Alibaba but maybe yeah maybe not go to the public Baba
[02:19:44.140 --> 02:19:49.660]   for that kind of stuff oh yeah I like it I ended up buying a second apple or a third
[02:19:49.660 --> 02:19:54.180]   apple watch charger the other day because I realized that I would put my watch on charge
[02:19:54.180 --> 02:19:58.460]   in the bedroom when I woke up get into the flow of work and then like five hours later
[02:19:58.460 --> 02:20:02.060]   I still wasn't wearing my watch because I was in the flow of work and it was in another
[02:20:02.060 --> 02:20:05.940]   room so I got another watch charger for my desk and I've got one in the living here
[02:20:05.940 --> 02:20:10.380]   I've got a watch charger in you know the three rooms where I spend my the most of my time
[02:20:10.380 --> 02:20:17.980]   and it's great on the other hand I just bought a manual snap pressing machine for home crafting
[02:20:17.980 --> 02:20:23.900]   that I really don't need so you gotta you know you gotta consider you know they were
[02:20:23.900 --> 02:20:29.540]   where am I gonna put this you know what where am I where am I gonna put this Doc Rock pick
[02:20:29.540 --> 02:20:37.060]   of the week okay so I got one that's kind of crazy I discovered this app maybe a lot
[02:20:37.060 --> 02:20:44.140]   two three months ago and I am absolutely in love with it the application is called Discrypt
[02:20:44.140 --> 02:20:51.180]   oh yeah and I want to call it Discrypt but Discrypt and what is so dope about it is I
[02:20:51.180 --> 02:20:56.420]   do a lot of content creation and so that requires a lot of screen recording and so they recently
[02:20:56.420 --> 02:21:01.860]   added the ability to do screen recording as well as podcast like recording but what I
[02:21:01.860 --> 02:21:08.220]   love about it is the fact that it automatically turns what you have said in your audio recordings
[02:21:08.220 --> 02:21:14.100]   into text okay sure that's easily done enough with Dragon and Siri and some other tricks
[02:21:14.100 --> 02:21:20.340]   but what's really cool about this one is it becomes a visual text editor so if I actually
[02:21:20.340 --> 02:21:27.220]   visual video editor yeah really now it's a visual video editor as well so if I accidentally
[02:21:27.220 --> 02:21:32.620]   say hey guys don't forget check me out you know next week on Mac beak weekly and they'll
[02:21:32.620 --> 02:21:38.420]   be like what I can actually go in and change beak into break what and it will it will fix
[02:21:38.420 --> 02:21:45.620]   it okay it changes it to break yeah I can go and how does it know what your voice is
[02:21:45.620 --> 02:21:52.620]   it go take guys tune into work work weekly no it does a really good job so okay the free
[02:21:52.620 --> 02:21:57.540]   version you only just editing words taking words out the number one arm is it on knows
[02:21:57.540 --> 02:22:04.060]   how to remove filler words on right which is in itself and we just the video then jump
[02:22:04.060 --> 02:22:08.980]   whenever you would say oh it jumps yes my final cut can fix that because we now have
[02:22:08.980 --> 02:22:15.820]   flow in final cut so yes that's not even that big until either but if you have the pro plan
[02:22:15.820 --> 02:22:23.860]   I could actually have completely forgotten to say this Maxine charger works best at seven
[02:22:23.860 --> 02:22:30.460]   watts or ten watts I can type in that and it will generate my voice because it requires
[02:22:30.460 --> 02:22:37.540]   you on the pro version to read a script and the script picks up all of the phonics and
[02:22:37.540 --> 02:22:41.820]   you know pneumonics and the Johnny mnemonics and whatever that you do with your face it
[02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:48.140]   picks all that up and it generates an AI version of your voice what most people cannot tell
[02:22:48.140 --> 02:22:54.660]   when you change now for security reasons I can't fake Andy because if I could oh I would
[02:22:54.660 --> 02:23:02.180]   generate it's deep fake audio but it can only be you yeah you can do audio but it can only
[02:23:02.180 --> 02:23:08.380]   be you but it is fantastic if you do double ender podcast game saver I mean game changer
[02:23:08.380 --> 02:23:13.780]   save your life will completely stop you from screwing up podcast you in your fellow podcast
[02:23:13.780 --> 02:23:19.860]   person rosemary you guys can edit together and I know how fast David can type I'm assuming
[02:23:19.860 --> 02:23:24.820]   you're like him you can type that as well you guys could fix your podcast any little
[02:23:24.820 --> 02:23:33.860]   mistakes and David dad jokes boom take them out sorry you know like yeah it's it's it's
[02:23:33.860 --> 02:23:39.420]   mind blowing what the script can do and this thing is just getting better every time so
[02:23:39.420 --> 02:23:43.940]   yeah the pro version doesn't come cheap but if you're a content creator never mind is
[02:23:43.940 --> 02:23:50.020]   paid for because they save you so much time it's probably annually is about three to four
[02:23:50.020 --> 02:23:55.380]   hours work for a true content creator but you can you try to free one just to play with
[02:23:55.380 --> 02:23:59.460]   it now if you can only make a video edit if you can only fake your voice that's fine
[02:23:59.460 --> 02:24:03.460]   if you're the only person on there but what if I wanted to edit Mac break quickly I would
[02:24:03.460 --> 02:24:09.660]   only be able to fix my stuff I think because you are especially you case use case they do
[02:24:09.660 --> 02:24:15.060]   have a case where you would do yourself you would do andy you would okay anybody on the
[02:24:15.060 --> 02:24:20.740]   show okay yeah I think they do have a plan that allows you to do that too but yeah you
[02:24:20.740 --> 02:24:26.460]   can completely fix all of the things that you skip out on that's really cool the audio
[02:24:26.460 --> 02:24:32.860]   I mean just what it records is beautiful you can remote record yeah it's it's a whole
[02:24:32.860 --> 02:24:37.740]   lot of gorgeous you just got to check it out I can't I can't properly explain it because
[02:24:37.740 --> 02:24:45.100]   I get so excited and I got a week so yeah actually Kevin Rose tweeted about this some
[02:24:45.100 --> 02:24:50.220]   time ago he was an investor and I take took a look and I thought it's really amazing and
[02:24:50.220 --> 02:24:55.540]   you're right for somebody we have editors we have too many people involved I'm not going
[02:24:55.540 --> 02:25:01.980]   to give the editors the chance to put words into my mouth so I think I think maybe not
[02:25:01.980 --> 02:25:06.620]   for twit but boy yeah I could see how this would be huge for any YouTube creator this
[02:25:06.620 --> 02:25:14.180]   would be fantastic descript d e s c r i p t dot com and I you know I've been holding
[02:25:14.180 --> 02:25:19.420]   on to this pick for a while but since we were talking about cable sasser and you were talking
[02:25:19.420 --> 02:25:25.900]   about your finder replacement I should mention Nova because it is really an interesting native
[02:25:25.900 --> 02:25:33.060]   Mac code editor it will be running on M1 I bought it immediately because and when I
[02:25:33.060 --> 02:25:37.060]   use it for you you would use a rosemary for web development because you do use it as a
[02:25:37.060 --> 02:25:42.500]   JavaScript editor which can then upload the files you can even run a browser instance
[02:25:42.500 --> 02:25:48.180]   within it it's all within it so that you could have a very quick development cycle for web
[02:25:48.180 --> 02:25:54.540]   development they support extensions but not nearly as many extensions as the free visual
[02:25:54.540 --> 02:26:01.020]   studio code I think VS code for a lot of people is the right choice for now but in time this
[02:26:01.020 --> 02:26:04.420]   could be really good and if it does work for what you want to do it works for me because
[02:26:04.420 --> 02:26:13.380]   I have a a blog that runs in Hugo and so the workflow on that is to edit the markdown on
[02:26:13.380 --> 02:26:18.580]   the server and then to have a shell to the server to run Hugo to build the website and
[02:26:18.580 --> 02:26:22.460]   then have a browser open to make sure everything built properly all of that can be done within
[02:26:22.460 --> 02:26:28.380]   Nova it is absolutely the best workflow I've ever had for Hugo and I have tried all sorts
[02:26:28.380 --> 02:26:34.340]   of ways of doing it with SHFS and and emacs and so forth this is really really nice they've
[02:26:34.340 --> 02:26:41.500]   done a nice job it does support a lot of languages already coffee script CSS HTML JavaScript
[02:26:41.500 --> 02:26:49.660]   JSON Lua markdown per old PHP Python Ruby and more I'm sure to come TypeScript I love these
[02:26:49.660 --> 02:26:55.020]   guys I do I love panics stuff and I've been watching this with real interest is it develop
[02:26:55.020 --> 02:27:00.620]   Nova.app it is not free but you can try it for free and probably worth doing if you're
[02:27:00.620 --> 02:27:06.140]   doing any kind of online development and I think for you Rosemary it'd be a lot better
[02:27:06.140 --> 02:27:12.220]   than Jetbrains I would have mentioned I used Jetbrains because it's free for education
[02:27:12.220 --> 02:27:17.980]   and I work for university so if because we're using it for educational purposes it's free
[02:27:17.980 --> 02:27:22.580]   and my colleagues use it as well and they're on Linux and Windows it's quite useful being
[02:27:22.580 --> 02:27:26.860]   able to you know have things set up for everybody but for my personal stuff I'm going to be
[02:27:26.860 --> 02:27:31.140]   switching to Nova I just I downloaded it earlier and while the breaks and I had a look at it
[02:27:31.140 --> 02:27:38.380]   and when yes yeah and they've now added prettier for code formatting view supports in there
[02:27:38.380 --> 02:27:43.220]   they extensions are getting added rapidly which is a good thing because when it first
[02:27:43.220 --> 02:27:48.820]   came out it was so a little bit bereft but you can see now they can do a lot of stuff
[02:27:48.820 --> 02:27:54.740]   more all the time this is the this is the way editors should be and now they have swift
[02:27:54.740 --> 02:27:58.540]   syntax highlighting as well this is the way editors should be and it's really very
[02:27:58.540 --> 02:28:04.820]   mackish and the fact that it'll support the M1 makes me happy happy that concludes this
[02:28:04.820 --> 02:28:10.220]   very exciting one more thing addition of Mac break weekly I thank you so much Rosemary

[02:30:31.340 --> 02:30:37.500]   open for tourists. How's that been? It's actually good it's a little scary like you
[02:30:37.500 --> 02:30:41.420]   know people were afraid that the tourist was going to like bring up the cases or whatever
[02:30:41.420 --> 02:30:45.380]   but you know the cases are going to happen anyway it's just sort of what's happening right
[02:30:45.380 --> 02:30:53.020]   now. But I think our economy requires tourism so much whether we like that or not. Right
[02:30:53.020 --> 02:30:58.260]   that it it helped calm some people's nerves down that they can go back to work and you
[02:30:58.260 --> 02:31:04.260]   know hotels up it. I just enjoyed Waikiki empty for a while. I like that. And our waters
