[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.400]   We've doubled our capacity and quadrupled our throughput.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.640]   I think that's awesome.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.320]   That's great.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.040]   So Alex, you're out there for work.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.960]   I was out here, yeah, we're doing another stream out here
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.400]   in Boston and I figured I'm in the area,
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.760]   so I thought I'd come and see Andy
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.240]   and we had lunch and here we are.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.400]   Fantastic.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.720]   And I'm really pleased to say also joining us
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.520]   on the panel today for Veronica Belmont from techsilla.com
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.840]   and Sony and about.me/Veronica
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.680]   to find out all the things she's up to.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.360]   Hello, I'm jealous you guys are in Boston.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.280]   I love Boston.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.320]   In Boston, you're from the East Coast, aren't you?
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.440]   I am from Connecticut and I went to school in Boston.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.440]   Connected to get me.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.280]   Connected to get me.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.680]   I'm an up-megger.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.480]   Then that makes date.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.080]   So great to have you all.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.920]   Now, wait a minute.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.960]   Now, the World Wide Developers Conference was Monday.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.640]   We covered it.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.080]   We actually covered it live.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.520]   Alex, thank you for doing that.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.320]   I couldn't be here that day because I was down in LA
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.360]   getting ready for E3.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.640]   But I understand some stuff happened.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.400]   There was some things, some clouds mostly.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.240]   Mostly cloudy.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.160]   Scattered clouds here.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.800]   And most clouds.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.880]   We do have WWDC, the musical, if you'd like to.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.920]   Maybe get a quick recap of everything that happened at WWDC.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.560]   Just listen and watch.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.880]   Live coverage of the World Wide DC, crowd cheering song over Stee Texas
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.240]   stage, standing ovation.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.960]   And Steve looks good.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.960]   Someone shouts.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.040]   Steve sounds exasperated.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.160]   This is really quite a part of center change.

[00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.340]   was at the very end of WDC,
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.660]   like if you stay to the very end,
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.900]   that was even better.
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.260]   (laughing)
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.420]   It was the kicks.
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.260]   - Well, there you go.
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.900]   The WWC in three minutes and 48 seconds,
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.540]   the only thing I have to say is need some more cowbell.
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.380]   - More cowbell.
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.660]   - More cowbell.
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.820]   So now we've had a week to think, reflect,
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:48.660]   and cogitate.
[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.020]   Let's start with iCloud.
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.780]   Any thoughts about iCloud?
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.180]   We're already starting to see a debate.
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.540]   John Gruber, of course, as always defending Apple, saying,
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.740]   'cause Apple, I think we're basically hearing Apple's
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.740]   gonna kill the web interface to mobile me and to June.
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.460]   Gruber saying, "No, don't worry about it.
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.740]   "There'll be a great web interface by the end of June."
[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.980]   - I think there's gonna be something,
[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.340]   they're definitely gonna kill mobile me with fire.
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.380]   They're gonna bury it, they're gonna bury its head
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.900]   at a crossroad as it reports to mobile people.
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.980]   - Nothing can ever--
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.460]   - Nothing but cheers from Veronica.
[00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.380]   - And they're killing iWeb permanently, too, right?
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.220]   - Oh, that would be.
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.100]   There's no reason for iWeb.
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.140]   - I'm pretty sure that they are killing iWeb.
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.980]   - Wow.
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.580]   Unless you're one of the many people,
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.780]   I presume who made websites with iWeb
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.300]   that can only be modified with iWeb.
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.780]   And i warn people from day one, do not use iWeb.
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.820]   This is the front page problem all over again.
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.140]   People use Microsoft front page and they were stuck with it.
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.940]   - I do hope that they put together an as good solution
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.980]   because iWeb was always the easiest way to get photos
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.780]   and videos to grandma, grandpa, and aunts and uncles.
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.500]   And when I'm tallying up all the different responses
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.980]   I've gotten to the keynote from just ordinary civilians,
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.220]   that's a big worry for them because that's how they keep,
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.380]   they don't really want to have a real website,
[00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.940]   they don't even want to have a Tumblr blog.
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.620]   They just like this idea that they click a button
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.460]   and iPhoto and suddenly they have a URL
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.900]   that they can email to people.
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.900]   So hope they replace it with something.
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:17.780]   - I have to say, as far as the rest of the web interface,
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.540]   I just don't know anybody using it.
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.180]   Even people who had, like I have mobile me,
[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.980]   I've had it since the day it was released,
[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.300]   but I've never, I mean, every once in a while,
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.940]   I go up and check something, but it's very, very rare.
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.340]   - Yeah, it's a good place for me to check out
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.820]   like where I was and what I was doing four years ago
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.460]   when I was writing about mobile games for like you.
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.460]   - That's all the content that's there right now.
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.100]   - I never used mobile me at all actually.
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.020]   And I actually, I cautioned a lot of people
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.820]   against buying it when they got a new Mac.
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.540]   So I'm not sorry to see it go.
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.660]   I hope they do improve the whole cloud experience.
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.220]   Apple hasn't had a great track record with that in the past.
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.100]   So hopefully they'll add some features
[00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:56.940]   that'll be really nice.
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.460]   The iTunes thing I think is probably the biggest thing,
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.340]   but I'm not gonna use that personally.
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.660]   - The iTunes match capability.
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.140]   - Right. - Yeah.
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.300]   - So Joshua Topolsky writing in my next,
[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.140]   what is it?
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.300]   This is mynext.com.
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.060]   I never can get that right.
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:15.340]   Says that he thinks there will be no web interface
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.300]   in Apple's iCloud.
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.500]   There was no web interface in the announcement anyway,
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.620]   but you know, Gruber, and I think this is merely
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.460]   an act of faith.
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.940]   I don't think he's actually saying I have evidence,
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.980]   but he says I would wager that sometime between now
[00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.380]   and June 30th, 2012, oh, it's 2012.
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.620]   It's not June 30th, 2011, it's 2012.
[00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.620]   iCloud will offer a web interface just as good.
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.100]   If not better than MobileMise.
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:41.660]   Quite possibly under the hood based on MobileMise.
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.900]   The only thing that would hold that up
[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.300]   is that Apple's not notorious for having
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.740]   a lot of extra developers.
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.980]   And...
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.620]   - Yeah, it's like they have a fixed quantity
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.460]   and they do keep shuttling them from project to project.
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.940]   There've been a couple of famous instances in which
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:01.820]   a certain project B got delayed because everybody got pulled off,
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.460]   pulled off of it to be put on project A.
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.420]   - They have a year.
[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.860]   - They have a year also.
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.420]   I don't think that they're making,
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.420]   they haven't really made the point that iCloud
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.780]   is a destination that anybody is supposed to go to.
[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.180]   They're really making the point that
[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.500]   it is just an invisible conduit.
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.780]   I mean, I've used this before,
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.740]   we're talking about this morning that my vision
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.620]   of iCloud is that there's the theist view of God
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.060]   and there's the deist version of God.
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.100]   iCloud is the deist version where he has his influence
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.540]   upon your life, but you can't observe him directly.
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.460]   You only feel the things that he has done.
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.740]   So what I'm metaphor.
[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:37.580]   - Exactly.
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.740]   So we're asked, Google really does want to be the theist God
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.420]   where I am the Lord, your server,
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.420]   you shall client know what the server is, but I.
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.860]   Here we will hold all of your information.
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.500]   You will use a web interface or a client
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.700]   to access this interface,
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.180]   this data that we've put on our servers.
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.900]   iCloud really is just a conduit for making sure
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.540]   that a file that you want to be available to you anywhere
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.420]   or a piece of media that wants to be available
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.140]   anywhere will automatically be deposited everywhere.
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.420]   So it's not, so that was the difference
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.780]   that kind of tripped me up 'cause I'm on the Google music
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:16.020]   data and it's really, really cool to go into my Google music
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.580]   page and find out that every single piece of media
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.820]   that I've acquired from everywhere and as long as it's
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.300]   in iTunes is available to me everywhere.
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.860]   Whereas when I go into my phone now, it's great
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.580]   that the George Harrison tracks that I bought
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.820]   a few days ago are available there, but I can't get like
[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:32.740]   all the stuff I bought during the Tony Awards
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:33.860]   a couple days ago.
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.260]   So it's definitely two different views
[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.860]   of what the cloud should be like.
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.500]   - So basically it just works is the same thing
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.500]   as trust the guy with the beer that you can't see
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.140]   in the sky, right?
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:44.980]   - The magical.
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.140]   - The magical.
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.940]   It just magically works.
[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:48.780]   - You're gonna be condescending,
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:49.940]   let's be completely condescending.
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.500]   (laughing)
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:57.500]   - David Chardi says that about 50% of Apple store customers
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.020]   who need to get their iPhone swapped
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.780]   have never plugged them into iTunes at all
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:03.620]   after they either made it.
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.060]   - I find this completely believable.
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.540]   - Yeah, I do too.
[00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.740]   - I know they don't have any specific source for this story,
[00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.620]   but I thought it was totally believable.
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.420]   I actually know people who have done that myself.
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.900]   One of my best friends actually, I picked up her iPhone
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:21.460]   the other day and she had like 30, 35 apps on her phone
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.540]   that had never been updated.
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:23.900]   She doesn't even do it from the app store
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.020]   when she's on wifi.
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.300]   And so I just realized like she has like the oldest
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:31.220]   possible version of iOS 4 running on her phone right now.
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.380]   And she doesn't upgrade her apps ever.
[00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.500]   And it made me wonder actually how many people
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.300]   go through life doing that.
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.900]   I think it's gonna change a lot.
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.860]   Once you're able to get the wireless syncing
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.700]   done on your iPhone, I think that's gonna improve
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.540]   the experience for a lot of people out there.
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.180]   But it's not shocking to me that people never sync it
[00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.700]   with their computer.
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.620]   - So you have really two things happening.
[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.420]   One, Mobile Me, obviously from that Forbes article,
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.500]   Steve Jobs hated it, thought it was a flop,
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.300]   everybody else agreed.
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.140]   And so they had to re-architect that.
[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.860]   And then you had the issue of in a post PC world,
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:10.060]   how do we solve this activation backup problem?
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.620]   So they start building a couple of years ago,
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.260]   this North Carolina data center.
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.260]   Now we're finally here.
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.860]   It kind of all fits together.
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.380]   Like this is what was, this is where they were headed all
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.300]   along.
[00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.900]   - I'd like to know what the trigger for that decision
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:23.740]   was though.
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.500]   It was that actually seen as a problem
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.620]   that people aren't hooking up their devices
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.740]   back to their desktops to do syncs and backups and updates.
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:35.340]   - Well, they're kind of back into it because it's just,
[00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.220]   it's that's post PC thing.
[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.020]   You have to have that.
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.820]   - Well, I absolutely believe that this was probably
[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:45.620]   the impetus for doing this because so many people
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:46.820]   complain of having issues.
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.580]   And yet once they bring it into the Genius Bar,
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:49.660]   they're like, well, you haven't updated
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.220]   to the most recent version of the software.
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.820]   We need to do that for you now.
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.380]   So not only does it make it easier for people like us
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.420]   who use our phones all the time,
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.700]   it just don't want to have to have our phone tethered
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.700]   to our computer, but it also makes it easier
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.660]   for people who aren't power users, who aren't using
[00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.980]   their phone every single day or ever syncing it.
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.340]   I mean, they're using their phone every single day,
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.780]   but they're not syncing it with their machines
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:11.140]   and getting the most recent version of the software that way.
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.780]   - And you can't credibly make the argument
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.820]   that we're in a post PC era if you have to hook up
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.940]   everything to a PC before you use it.
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.620]   And back it up and do everything.
[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.460]   So I think this was, so it's two things.
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.260]   Mobile Me is a flop and in order to go post PC,
[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.340]   we have to have this thing called iCloud.
[00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.140]   And then I think the music matches,
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.500]   kind of iTunes matches kind of like out of nowhere.
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.900]   I think maybe Apple does, let me ask you this.
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.620]   Do you think Apple was pressured by Rhapsody,
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:41.100]   Mogg, RDO, Spotify, Lala, all of the services
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.940]   that allowed you to subscribe and stream to music
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.860]   that was hurting Apple?
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.820]   - I think it's a very elegant solution to a problem
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:54.820]   that both the users have had as well as the industry
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:58.180]   is that it's a way that they've approached this.
[00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.580]   It is unlike every other service that's out there,
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.620]   which is that we're gonna look at your library
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.380]   and then we're just going to give you access
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.140]   to all of those things, but it means that they don't have
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.900]   to store everybody's library individually.
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.700]   They're able to just simply know that they all have
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.460]   these IDs and they all have access to those
[00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.940]   as they need them as they download to their devices.
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.100]   It allows people to, there's a lot of people
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.860]   that have been kind of living in this cloud of,
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.780]   they've downloaded all the stuff from Napster,
[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.060]   LimeWire or BitTorrent or whatever it is,
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.220]   and they always live in this cloud
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.780]   where they don't want to take their computer in
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.340]   and they don't want anyone to see it.
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.180]   They don't want to do all this,
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.140]   and this allows them to legitimize their entire library.
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.580]   And at the same time, Apple's gonna,
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.940]   they've already written some big checks
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.740]   to the music industry and they're probably gonna write,
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.060]   my guess is they'll write checks for half a billion
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.820]   to a billion dollars to the music industry
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:45.940]   over the next year.
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.500]   That they wouldn't have gotten otherwise.
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:50.500]   You know, that's the whole thing.
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.020]   The thing remember is that the music industry
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.580]   is getting half a billion to a billion dollars
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:58.180]   is my guess on something that wasn't gonna come
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.580]   in any other way.
[00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:01.940]   Will they ever offer streaming on iCloud?
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:06.820]   I think a subscription service is eventually going to happen.
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.180]   I think Apple's gonna figure out how to do it.
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.540]   That's essentially a subscription service.
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:11.540]   Yeah, I mean, I think we're so--
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:12.540]   A streaming subscription service.
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.820]   When you look at Ping and when you look at the,
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.460]   this music service that's here,
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.900]   Apple now has, you know, they haven't built the whole bridge
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.900]   to get to subscription, but they've gone like half of it built.
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.820]   You know, and so they could do it whenever they wanted.
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.340]   I don't think it's gonna happen anytime soon.
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.100]   I think it could be two or three years away if they did it,
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.180]   but I think that it's, they could do it if they wanted to.
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.020]   You think so, right?
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:30.860]   I think that--
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.380]   I think they could definitely do it.
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:33.820]   It's not something I'm going to switch to.
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.500]   I've been kind of phasing out iTunes
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:36.900]   for the past six months or so.
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:37.900]   Really? Four Amazon?
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.620]   And then go on, throw out audio.
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:40.780]   Audio, yeah, me too.
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:41.620]   I love audio.
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.340]   I'm almost 100% on audio now.
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:47.340]   And I sync those tracks to my phone for when I'm not in an area
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.100]   where I have connection.
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.980]   So, but I think it's great that you are able to up the bit rate
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.900]   on your tracks and get in higher quality music from that.
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:57.540]   And I didn't know that that they're paying out a lot of money
[00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:58.780]   to the music industry as well.
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.620]   It's almost like they're paying for our indiscretions.
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.140]   It's piracy tax.
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.740]   It's the piracy tax.
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.140]   That's the only way they could get them to do it.
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.140]   Just said, here, here's 100 million.
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:11.020]   And we'll give you 25 bucks a year.
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:11.860]   And that's--
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.780]   I can download these tracks to your devices.
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.380]   This is also great because sometimes streaming doesn't work.
[00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.900]   Sometimes you're not in an area where you can stream.
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.660]   So being able to choose which tracks
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.220]   you want to put on all of your devices,
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.940]   I think will be really convenient for a lot of people.
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.620]   Well, and I think a lot of people have stacked up.
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.340]   I mean, I think that one of the arguments also
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.060]   is that once everyone gets a clean collection,
[00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.780]   I think that they are far more likely now that a lot of them--
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.420]   a lot of people built up that collection
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:37.940]   when iTunes didn't exist.
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.700]   They got thousands of songs during Hapster.
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.900]   And they've got--
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.900]   and they've got this huge ball of illicit material.
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.180]   And I think that one of the arguments that Apple had to have
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.900]   made was once everyone legalizes all of that,
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.460]   once they legitimize their library,
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.820]   they're probably far more likely to kind of want to keep it
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:57.740]   clean now that they're out of the cloud, so to speak.
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.980]   I think that they might be more likely to buy.
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.540]   But it seems like this is a game that's
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.020]   going to be really tough for Apple to win,
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.660]   because there are so many other streaming services out there.
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.620]   We're not just talking about stuff that Amazon's doing
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:09.740]   and that Google's doing.
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.740]   If you go just to the App Store, you'll find at least three
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.420]   or four or five apps, many of which
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.380]   link up to open source streaming software--
[00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.100]   Aren't it kind of commoditized, though?
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:18.780]   Totally.
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.060]   Where totally does not discriminate.
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:25.340]   My fear is that it'll create an economy where all the music
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.940]   that you should be listening to is music that Apple already
[00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.540]   has somewhere in the iTunes library.
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:30.620]   What about mashups?
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.740]   What about stuff from independent bands that
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.100]   hasn't been available on the iTunes store?
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.220]   I was thrilled after--
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.700]   it all sounds really, really weird.
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.820]   But one of the things I was really waiting to come to,
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.180]   the Amazon store and the iTunes store,
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.980]   were all my Bob and Ray CDs.
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.300]   Because that's the one thing where I have $100, $200
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.500]   of Bob and Ray tapes on cassette.
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.580]   I'm trying to avoid ever having to actually just put those tapes
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.580]   in and convert them into digital audio.
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.020]   Those are the sort of things where, if it
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:58.860]   means that it's going to be too hard to get access
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:04.660]   to off-catalog content and if access a driver towards iTunes
[00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.940]   content, Apple's going to have a hard time competing
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.900]   with all these other services.
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.340]   I have to say that the streaming services feel,
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.340]   maybe they're not, maybe you've tried them all,
[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.220]   like kind of commoditized.
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.020]   It's all about 8 million songs.
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.140]   Are there significant differences between audio,
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.900]   mall, rap city, Spotify?
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.100]   I think the newer services might have less access
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.300]   to the wider libraries.
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.980]   But I've been pretty happy with the selection on audio.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:34.140]   What do you like about audio?
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:35.540]   Why did you choose audio?
[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:36.740]   I like the interface a lot.
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:40.500]   I like the ability to save tracks to my iPhone
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.860]   and mark them for syncing.
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.740]   And I like the playlist features.
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.300]   I mean, a lot of these different sites
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.460]   have similar features.
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.540]   It's kind of just like which one you happen to fall into.
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.540]   And they're all the same price.
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:50.420]   When you have to like the best.
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.460]   They're roughly the same price.
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:55.620]   Yeah, I'm paying the $9.99 a month fee for audio,
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.340]   which means that I can do as many tracks,
[00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.940]   sync as many tracks as I want to to my phone.
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.220]   But it's just a great service.
[00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.740]   And they're adding more and more music every day.
[00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.180]   And MOG is similar as well.
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.060]   It's another one that people really like.
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.820]   And I just think they're better for me
[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:14.860]   than my kind of moderately sized iTunes library.
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.260]   I don't remember the last time I played music for iTunes
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:17.660]   anymore.
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:18.380]   I just don't do it.
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.820]   I use the desktop audio app.
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.220]   Yeah.
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.780]   Audio, I think, has better social features.
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.060]   Like I can follow Veronica, see what she's listening to.
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.580]   And then so you've got some good taste.
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:29.460]   It's great.
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.100]   It does music matching as well.
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.060]   So it'll match your current iTunes library.
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.580]   So you can stream that stuff as well.
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.620]   I switched to MOG, which has actually
[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:37.420]   been around a long time.
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.900]   I just had never heard of it until recently.
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.540]   Because for two reasons, they have high quality streaming.
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.660]   I think they go really--
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.740]   I think 256 or 320.
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.420]   And then the other thing I like about MOG
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.980]   is they have a Pandora style radio.
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.660]   So you have a slider that you can slide.
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.980]   So you say, I want to hear prints and prints radio.
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.340]   And the slider goes from only prints.
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.780]   And it's just random prints tracks
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.420]   to sliding it over for more artists, more artists, more artists.
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.580]   And you can see it build a playlist adding prints like artists.
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.340]   And so it's kind of rhapsody like--
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:10.500]   and I like rhapsody.
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.860]   I mean, not rhapsody, Pandora like.
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:12.660]   And I like Pandora.
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:13.580]   I still use Pandora.
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.460]   So maybe I don't need MOG.
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.260]   But my main point is they're all kind of similar.
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.740]   They're minor differences.
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.340]   It's so user specific too.
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:24.500]   I've never really gotten into music subscriptions.
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:28.020]   Because oddly enough, it's just too much choice for me.
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.740]   I don't want to simply say, great.
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.540]   Here's 20 million songs.
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:32.060]   Have at it.
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:34.140]   Because now I have a new job, which is to find music
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.100]   that I'm interested in.
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.500]   Usually for me, it's because I saw something on--
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.140]   I heard something in a soundtrack someplace
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.620]   where I heard something in a store
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:41.860]   or a friend recommended me a track.
[00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.420]   And now I'm specifically looking for those couple of tracks.
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.460]   Well, that's kind of why the social features on these sites
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.700]   are really great, because you can see what your other friends
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:49.460]   are listening to.
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:52.020]   You can see what they've added to their library recently.
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.460]   You can see the top charts and what's new.
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.980]   So I've actually discovered a lot of music that way.
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.580]   And that was one of my problems with iTunes,
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:02.020]   is that I was just listening to the same music over and over again.
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.740]   So this has been a great music discovery service for me as well.
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.500]   And Pandora just seems to play the same tracks for me
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.380]   over and over again, no matter what I choose,
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.380]   I get the same stuff.
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.500]   So it's been nice to kind of expand my horizons a little bit.
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.460]   And I think that's because you're young.
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.660]   Because I think as you get older,
[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.060]   I just want to hear the same stuff over and over again.
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.860]   I know it and I love it.
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.220]   Give me more cream.
[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.820]   I love that ginger baker.
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.740]   We've got Crosby Stills and Nash.
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:33.900]   Isn't it funny that old folks like me,
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.900]   because when I was young, old folks like Perry Como,
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.980]   and now old folks like Metallica,
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:40.580]   it's just a very different world we live in.
[00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:43.780]   You'll have none of the Stephen Foster nonsense with that.
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:44.740]   34 times.
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:45.660]   I mean, who needs that?
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.460]   Way down upon this one.
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.380]   Yeah, River.
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.100]   We're going to take a break, come back.
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.620]   Andy and I, to hold the thought, I know you can hold it.
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.060]   Just keep it right there.
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:56.900]   Yeah.
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.420]   Alex Lindsey is here from the Pixelcore.
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.180]   He's actually not here.
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.820]   He's in Boston with Andy and Notco.
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.820]   Andy, they are asking in the chat room
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:08.100]   that you switch that screen to a roaring fireplace.
[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.780]   I'm sure you can.
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.180]   It's a wood table.
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.180]   I'm sure I could fix that.
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:13.860]   Just lighting, which you lighted on fire there.
[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:16.380]   Andy and Notco is also here from the Chicago Sun Times,
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:22.940]   Veronica Belmont from Tekzilla and from Sony, the core show.
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:26.380]   You were at the E3 doing a lot of stuff with core, weren't you?
[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:26.900]   I was.
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.220]   It was a very busy week.
[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:31.060]   So I had to catch up on all my Mac news, like today.
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:34.260]   Today, it's weird, you know, because exactly.
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.820]   I came back from LA and then I went to food camp and it's like,
[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:37.900]   what happened?
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:38.980]   I missed everything.
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.540]   So this is why you listen to shows like this.
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:42.980]   So you don't have to worry.
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.140]   We will cover it all.
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:46.780]   But right now, I want to tell you about our friends at Citrix,
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:48.900]   the folks who do the great go-to meeting.
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.460]   If you've, we use, you know, it's funny.
[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:55.300]   Lisa, who does all of her biz dev and partnerships and stuff,
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.820]   has gotten to the point now where she doesn't say,
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:59.700]   let's have a phone conference or let's have a meeting.
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.340]   She says, I've set up a G2M.
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.820]   We just all know.
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.620]   Go-to meeting is the best way to meet, even if you're only
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.580]   doing a phone conference because it's got built in.
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.780]   Part of the whole go-to meeting service
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:15.980]   includes a conference bridge, automatically sets that up via phone.
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.820]   And of course, you can use VoIP.
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:20.300]   So if you're on a computer or even an iPad,
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:21.940]   you can use a built-in mic and speakers
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.140]   and you don't even need a phone call.
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.060]   And so we do that just for the phone conferences
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.340]   because we know anytime I want to show a screen
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.660]   and this often happens, let me show you
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:31.580]   what I'm talking about.
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:32.140]   You could do it.
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:32.700]   Go-to meeting.
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.980]   It's the best way to do online meetings.
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.620]   And if you've ever hosted an online meeting with the other guys,
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:39.900]   you know it's complicated.
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.460]   It's set up, complicated to get going.
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.820]   Let me tell you, if you're making a sales pitch to somebody,
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:46.340]   you can't make them jump through hoops
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.580]   to see your presentation.
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.020]   It's got to be easy.
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:49.740]   Go-to meeting.
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:52.380]   It's the easiest, most reliable online meeting service.
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.460]   It just works.
[00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.140]   You could start your first meeting in seconds.
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.340]   Everyone can join in seconds, even if they've never
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.380]   installed the software before.
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.100]   They just click the link in the email.
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:04.780]   They say, I think the use they accept or allow
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.980]   because it's Java and it's going to download the Java file.
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.540]   And boom, it's running.
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:12.260]   No headaches, no routers to configure, no time wasted.
[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:16.500]   It will reduce meeting relating expenses like flying
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:20.180]   somewhere but also even exchanging meeting materials
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.020]   because VoIP's included saves you money on that.
[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.500]   And of course, because it's brought to you by Citrix,
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.940]   you know, it's 128-bit SSL secure.
[00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.340]   Great support and service.
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:28.100]   It's just really good.
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.700]   I want you to try it free.
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.140]   30 days, free.
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:38.340]   Go to meeting.com, G-O-T-O, meeting.com.
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:39.820]   Click the try it free button.
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.740]   And I want to give you the promo code for this.
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:45.180]   So we get credit, not that Tekzilla show or anything,
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.060]   not that I don't want them to get credit,
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.260]   but the offer code is MAC break.
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.060]   So go to meeting.com.
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:54.020]   Click the orange try it free button.
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.860]   Very simple to sign up free for 30 days
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.220]   and then just put MAC break.
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:02.420]   MAC, B-R-E-A-K in the offer code.
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:05.820]   And boom, you're there for 30 days, absolutely free.
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.300]   I thank the folks at Citrix for supporting.
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.740]   MAC break weekly.
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.940]   So when does the iTunes match start?
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:14.940]   When can I start doing that?
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:16.340]   Did they say?
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:20.420]   I think that's going to be reserved for when iOS 5
[00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:22.540]   first comes out along the rest of the iCloud.
[00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:23.780]   Well, that makes out.
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.340]   So we have some iCloud features now.
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:29.780]   I was just-- iTunes and the cloud are still working.
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:33.260]   At MAC's thinking of software and audio purchases
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:34.900]   and iTunes is already working.
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:35.740]   OK.
[00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:36.180]   OK.
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:36.700]   I like that.
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.060]   And you get a little download button.
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:42.580]   So this is the new iTunes, which you downloaded last week,
[00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:43.100]   of course.
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:43.620]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:44.580]   I have that one too.
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.300]   So you can look and see, for some reason--
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:47.660]   I don't know.
[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:51.980]   I've never heard of this group, haiku-de-ta, abstract root.
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.260]   It's probably something abby because she likes
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.420]   strange music, God.
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.860]   So it's not-- it's like something we bought.
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.780]   This is purchased music.
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:02.700]   And now, if I want, it's got a little cloud icon.
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.820]   Scroll in and show you.
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.260]   I said, let me scroll in and show you.
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.380]   It's got a little cloud icon.
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:11.580]   And I could just download these and put them on my computer.
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:12.180]   So that's nice.
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:15.700]   Already, that was like formally a super top secret thing.
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.580]   You could get through Apple customer service
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.260]   or you had a hard drive crash and you lost everything you ever
[00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:20.620]   bought.
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.500]   They would allow you one magic undo of redown loading
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.140]   everything.
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:27.300]   Now, everything you've ever bought from the iTunes store
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.780]   is specifically redown notable.
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.780]   That's kind of a lifesaver, frankly.
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:31.780]   Yeah.
[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:35.380]   And there's also now a new option in the settings file--
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.340]   excuse me, in the settings for your iPad and your iPod
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.620]   that will just simply say, make sure that every time that I
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.380]   buy something on iTunes, you automatically let iCloud sink
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:43.300]   it down.
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.740]   So you don't have to hook anything up in order
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.420]   to get that new George Harrison track.
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:48.980]   It's a lot of stuff.
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.180]   That's nice.
[00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:51.700]   Does it do that with video, too?
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:52.900]   Because it seems like that would be the--
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:53.820]   Not yet.
[00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:54.340]   Not yet.
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:55.500]   Because that would be--
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:59.100]   I've downloaded a lot of movies and TV shows.
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.540]   And that would be it.
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:01.900]   And that's really what I'm looking for.
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.620]   That's what I love about Google Music.
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.460]   You don't have to think about what's being supported
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.300]   with not being supported.
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.780]   It's just that simply magically whatever landed
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:09.740]   in your iTunes library--
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:10.260]   I'm sorry.
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:11.060]   I should be specific.
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:13.180]   I don't believe that they support video either.
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:13.780]   No, they don't.
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:14.540]   It's just music.
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:15.140]   Yeah.
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.020]   But the implication is that it doesn't care where it came from.
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:20.140]   It's going to be a sync to every single device you have.
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:23.700]   Inevitably, somebody owns iCloud, the word.
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.580]   iCloud communications.
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:26.340]   They're suing.
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:29.420]   Why does an Apple check?
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.860]   Well, I guess they never registered iCloud communications,
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.220]   never registered iCloud as a trademark.
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:34.700]   Oh, you need with?
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.980]   So Apple actually just owned the trademark for iCloud.
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:40.540]   Well, I don't think they're going to have a chance.
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.140]   The Arizona-based company points out
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.460]   that its own trademarks have been in use since 2005.
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:48.140]   Apple is in fringe on its name.
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.300]   The company focuses on VoIP solutions
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.180]   for business and residential customers.
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:55.980]   And one thing I've learned through massive lawsuits
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:00.180]   that I myself have filed is that you
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:03.620]   can have duplicate trademarks in different areas
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:06.300]   as long as there's no confusion.
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.300]   So a court may say, well, you're in VoIP.
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.260]   Apple's doing music or data.
[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:13.700]   And so it's not confusing.
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.140]   I think a good practice is just not to stick an eye
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:17.140]   before your name.
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:18.180]   Yeah, yeah, it would be dumb.
[00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:19.900]   Apple owns eye.
[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:20.780]   It actually doesn't--
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:22.620]   But you can count on the fact that they're
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:23.420]   going to launch something.
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:24.820]   Some point.
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:26.220]   I think it's a very good practice
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.020]   to go through the dictionary and find any word that you
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.500]   can stick an eye front of the market and have
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:31.940]   the domain name sold yet.
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:36.100]   Eye bulb, eye lacquer, eye drywall.
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:39.100]   If you can register their name for $4 a whack,
[00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:40.900]   I think there's at least a 1,000 chance
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.020]   that eventually Apple will get around you
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.820]   and offer you at least a 17-inch Mac look protocol away.
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:47.860]   And the reality is there's millions of people that now
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:49.980]   know that they exist that didn't have any idea that they
[00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:50.500]   existed.
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.740]   Yeah, that's what people tell me about Twitter and Twitter.
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.740]   Oh, you should be glad Twitter took you.
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.140]   Oh, I don't buy that one.
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:57.940]   You should be glad.
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:59.020]   Now people know about Twitter.
[00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:00.380]   No.
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.340]   No, no, no, I'm saying in the beginning that that's the case.
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:03.780]   But I think that what's going to end up happening
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.420]   is that Apple's going to pay them a couple million dollars
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:07.700]   to change their brand.
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.340]   I mean, I think that you-- well, just your iCloud
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.660]   communications is now blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:12.500]   I don't think that--
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:13.980]   Yeah, that's why they're going to court.
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.900]   Even though they don't have a trademark,
[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:18.260]   it'll be mitigating circumstances.
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:19.460]   They'll get less out of it.
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:20.900]   But I think that in the end, Apple's
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.980]   going to find it cheaper and easier just to--
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.180]   Apple lost a couple of bunch.
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:24.620]   You all right.
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:25.500]   Was it mighty--
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.100]   Mighty Mouse.
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:29.100]   Remember they called the original Magic Mouse Mighty Mouse?
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.500]   Here I am to save the day.
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.660]   It was a terrible cartoon anyway.
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:34.140]   So--
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.100]   Oh, I know!
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.580]   Mighty Mouse!
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:37.660]   Next, he's going to--
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:38.900]   I'm going to tell you what the cartoon's
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.260]   version of the Ralph Bakshi version, because--
[00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.100]   Terry Tudes.
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:42.620]   I don't know.
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.300]   The one that was on TV.
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.620]   Yeah, Terry Tudes.
[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:46.700]   Here I am to save the day.
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:47.940]   Mighty Mouse is on his way.
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.420]   Your mouse is on his way.
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.580]   Hey, who-- dude, that--
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:51.780]   Herman Cat was no Bugs Bunny.
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.220]   You could outwit Herman Cat with three
[00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:56.820]   ends of a shoelace and two pit trucks.
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.020]   So I don't know where he's getting all this mighty stuff
[00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.460]   from.
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.420]   I could take any of those chipmunks out there right now.
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:04.780]   Veronica, you could beat the crap out of that.
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.340]   Should we just take him down right now?
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:07.300]   They're not terribly clear--
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.380]   Clerver-eater.
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:10.300]   Sounds like we need to have a karaoke off.
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.420]   Oh, hey.
[00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:13.140]   OK, so Veronica, I've been trying to find a song
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:14.260]   that the two of us could sing.
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.100]   I think the Mighty Mouse theme--
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:16.900]   sounds like a joke.
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:18.940]   I don't know if that's good for karaoke.
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.260]   I do have one of those minds for theme songs, though.
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:24.020]   I remember every single theme song from my childhood
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:25.980]   and from shows I never even watched.
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:26.700]   It's kind of creepy.
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.340]   OK, Night Rider.
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:29.740]   Oh, I don't know that one.
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.540]   Digging, digging, digging, digging, digging, digging, digging,
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:32.580]   digging, digging, digging, digging, digging, digging.
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:33.580]   He's right.
[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:34.260]   He's right.
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.580]   It's very easy to remember, because it's one note.
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.380]   Over and over and over.
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.580]   Like the gummy bear theme songs.
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:42.340]   That's just like David Hasselhoff's acting.
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.300]   One note.
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.380]   What is famous--
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:45.820]   Oh!
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:47.700]   Famous Alexander Wolcott or somebody
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.060]   like that review of a play.
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.660]   So they ran the gamut of emotions from A to B.
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.140]   B.
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:54.740]   Sorry, I've derailed us.
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:55.580]   No, no.
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:56.860]   You should never apologize.
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:00.620]   We even have a theme song for do railing.
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:01.620]   Did you know that?
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.940]   Play the theme song.
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:05.780]   I haven't played it in ages, but now that Veronica's here.
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:08.580]   We used to for so long it was actually mastered on 78.
[00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:09.260]   Yeah.
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:10.260]   That's how old--
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.820]   It was originally a victory disc recording by Bing Crosby.
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:15.140]   Sometimes Leo accidentally plays it on 33,
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.140]   and it kind of goes, "Rooooo."

[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:46.620]   Is there an Alzheimer's medicine we could plug?
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.580]   Twitter, Facebook.

[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.380]   One thing that was kind of funny at FUCA--
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:11.580]   I don't want to keep the laboring this,
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.340]   but I was at the Friends of O'Reilly camp.
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:14.100]   But Veronica's been there.
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.180]   It's really fun.
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:16.740]   But everybody there is ADD.
[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:18.460]   I mean, everybody.
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:22.580]   So it's just one long rat hole, the whole weekend.
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:23.100]   At one point--
[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.980]   No, sessions just evolve into people talking
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:26.260]   about something completely different.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:27.260]   Completely different.
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.940]   It's a lot of fun, though.
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:29.940]   You learn a lot.
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:30.780]   You're learning a lot.
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:31.100]   Yeah.
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:32.260]   But you're exactly right.
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:34.980]   The session-- you'll go to a session that's
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.780]   about big data and data visualizations.
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.580]   And you'll end up talking about fried foods.
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:42.060]   And it's like, OK.
[00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:43.060]   OK.
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:46.620]   There was one session about big data and visualizations.
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:50.620]   And I guess she had all her slides for the visualizations
[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:52.220]   on her iPad and no way to connect it.
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:56.060]   So we all gathered around the speaker and she showed us.
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.620]   See this?
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.500]   That's what I like about Unconferences.
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.300]   They're very relaxed.
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:05.980]   So word coming now that Rosetta is data.
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:10.060]   No Rosetta in Lion, which means if you've
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.660]   got any older--
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:15.780]   does Rosetta carbon or Rosetta's for OS 9 stuff?
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:17.380]   It's OS 9 stuff, isn't it?
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:18.580]   Yeah.
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:21.900]   Basically, all the legacy stuff that we were still
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:22.980]   trying to drag along.
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:24.980]   Occasionally, I'll run a program.
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.740]   I don't have Rosetta installed on my computer.
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:29.740]   Finally, HyperCard, you've got to find a new solution, folks.
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:31.500]   HyperCard's not going to make me sad.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.420]   And I don't like it.
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:35.180]   And I think that for us, we'll probably
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.460]   end up having one computer that just has that stays
[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:40.020]   on the old system just so we can open things if we need to.
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:41.860]   If it turns out to be a file that we need,
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:44.860]   there's like, oh, take it over to the old Mac Mini over there.
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.260]   It's still running that.
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:49.020]   I got to recommend people, but sometime before Lion,
[00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:52.980]   make sure you just drive around the streets of your neighborhood
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:57.100]   prior to Trash Day until you find a good Mac LC3, let's say.
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.540]   And then just pull it out of the trash, you're good to go.
[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:02.380]   It was power PC, according to the chat room.
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:03.940]   OK, so it's not the operating system.
[00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:06.820]   It's supported power PC applications.
[00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:07.340]   I got it.
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:08.340]   So everything's Intel now.
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:09.140]   Thank you, chat room.
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:10.700]   They're very good.
[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:13.020]   Very good for correcting me when I'm stupid.
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:18.700]   I have to say Apple's kind of aggressively pushing you
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:21.180]   into the new world because you can't even get Lion
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:23.260]   unless you have the App Store and you can't have the App Store
[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:25.260]   unless you have Snow Leopard.
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:27.100]   But with the price points that they're doing,
[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:28.580]   they're making it pretty easy.
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:31.340]   It's $30 to upgrade your operating system.
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.140]   $60 total.
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:35.220]   Like if you're at Leopard, you'll have to $30 for Snow.
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:37.740]   What do you do if you have a bunch of computers
[00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:39.620]   that you need to update?
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.060]   Do you just have to all--
[00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.780]   we were talking about this on TechSillow this week,
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:45.220]   actually, for the episode that comes out on Thursday.
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:47.860]   And one guy wrote in saying that he doesn't have a very fast
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:50.540]   internet connection, and he has five computers at his house
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:55.500]   and to download all of the Lion copies would take a really long time.
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.900]   And he's wondering, are they going to offer it on a disk?
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:00.380]   Or is there some way that he can copy it over to his other machines?
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:03.140]   It's unknown, but I'll tell you what you can do now.
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.940]   The developer version, I suspect they'll be an automated way
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:09.060]   of doing this, but you can open the package in the developer version.
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:12.100]   There's a DMG file that is actually an image
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:15.860]   that you could then put on a CD or a USB key and carry around, not a CD.
[00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:18.580]   Yeah, I think you can burn it to a thumb drive or something like that, too.
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:21.020]   So I presume, because that's in the developer version,
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:23.540]   that Apple will probably have a button.
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:24.980]   I'm going to guess, but we don't know.
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:29.540]   But on a button on the-- you'll download it on your App Store.
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:31.020]   And then I'll have a button that says burn a CD.
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:33.700]   And you want that, because what if you have a crash?
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.140]   How are you going to reinstall?
[00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:37.540]   What if you're supporting 100 Macs at a school
[00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.700]   where you don't want to have to click download 100 times?
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:40.220]   Right, right.
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:42.060]   That's kind of the point I was getting at, too.
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:43.220]   Yeah.
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:45.340]   Well, there's a lot of reasons why you have to have a CD.
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:46.940]   So-- I'm sorry.
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:50.180]   I keep saying CD, it won't fit on a CD, a DVD or a USB key.
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:53.060]   And you know, my MacBook Air has that great little USB key that
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:54.300]   has the OS on it.
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.460]   I think that's a great way to go.
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:58.780]   It's carry around a USB key that's got your operating system on it.
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:01.220]   Well, it's going to sound like I'm being snarky here.
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:04.300]   But I almost wish that thing came attached to a big block or two
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:07.700]   by four, like a mensroom key, because I've
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:09.660]   been loaned two different Macs with MacBooks.
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:12.700]   They have never gone back with the Macs.
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.780]   It's like it's a stick of pride and gum.
[00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:17.780]   And unless you just tape it to something big,
[00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:18.980]   you are going to lose it.
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.700]   I keep it on my key chain.
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:21.700]   I think a large speed--
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:23.540]   Actually, so small, I've lost it on my key chain.
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:24.540]   I can't-- it's somewhere here.
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:25.700]   I don't know.
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.140]   Here's a mustache.
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.500]   What's that doing on my key chain?
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.340]   You keep that on your key chain all the time?
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:32.420]   Well, you never know when you might need a mustache.
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:32.900]   That's true.
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:33.380]   That's true.
[00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:35.780]   I don't even know what you guys are talking about anymore.
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:36.100]   All right.
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:37.060]   This is actually--
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:37.900]   I'm talking about Mac--
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:38.380]   This is not it.
[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:39.300]   Talking about--
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:39.820]   Yeah, Mac--
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:40.460]   Welcome.
[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:43.340]   I played the rad-hole music, but I lost it on my key chain.
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:45.420]   This is a similar size.
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:47.020]   This is a tough and tiny from verbatim.
[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:49.180]   But this is very similar to what they use
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:52.340]   that comes with the MacBook Air.
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:53.460]   You don't have an Air Veronica?
[00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:53.900]   It seems like--
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:54.400]   I don't.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.500]   I'm going to wait for the next one.
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:56.740]   I'm going to get one.
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:57.740]   You're so fashiony.
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:59.220]   You're a fashion like 13-inch MacBook Pro
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:01.380]   with the new Air, I think.
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:02.380]   The rumor--
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:03.380]   It's like a plan.
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.740]   --digitimes rumor there's a new Air coming in a month or two.
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:07.180]   That's what I'm waiting for.
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:10.380]   Air with Thunderbolt is going to be one on Mammajama.
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:11.380]   Yeah.
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:13.660]   I had the possibility--
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:16.060]   I had a little extra money laying around,
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:19.020]   and I was thinking about using it to buy an 11-inch Air,
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.900]   because that was one of the-- one of those times
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:22.860]   where you send back the loader and you're like,
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.660]   my life is somehow less perfect now
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.180]   that I don't have an 11-inch Air.
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:28.180]   So hold on, my life.
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:30.980]   But I think that-- but I was able to talk to myself
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:32.340]   a lot of it about, oh, yeah, but it only
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.340]   has these couple ports.
[00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:35.100]   You can't do it for high speed anything.
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:36.900]   But now that I know that-- excuse me-- now
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.860]   that it's pretty much an accepted deal,
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:41.380]   that this thing is going to have that super incredibly cool
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:45.460]   Thunderbolt port, and also that the next edition of Mac OS
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.700]   is going to simply say, oh, well, if you don't--
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.180]   if you don't have a whole lot of storage,
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:49.740]   we don't care.
[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:51.700]   We'll help you leverage the small storage
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.580]   that you have to have access to everything
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.580]   that you might ever actually own.
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:58.180]   That 11-inch Air is starting to look pretty deep.
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:58.980]   I love my Air.
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:00.380]   I love my Air.
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:02.340]   And that's why I thought for sure, because Veronica--
[00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:04.780]   baby, people don't know how fashion forward Veronica is,
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.300]   but she actually-- she has a blog.
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:08.220]   Well, the little--
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:09.260]   I do have a fashion blog.
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:10.660]   --the lady likes fashion.
[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:13.260]   That's kind of a backhanded thing, I think.
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.620]   Oh, you're showing my fashion blog.
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:15.140]   That's cute.
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:15.180]   There it is.
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:16.460]   The lady likes.
[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:17.700]   Oh, I like that watch.
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.420]   Some of the photos aren't working.
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:20.180]   I like that watch.
[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:20.180]   Reload.
[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:21.180]   Reload.
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:23.660]   Ooh, that's the-- that's like Mr. Excel.
[00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:27.380]   I had a clock with Excel formulas for each number.
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.860]   But this is even like, you know, for noon--
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:30.700]   That's pretty hot, right?
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:33.940]   --you get the cube root of 1728.
[00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:35.580]   Oh, man, I like that.
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:37.660]   I found that on a laughing squid.
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:39.020]   Beauty-ous.
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:40.940]   I don't even know what some of these are.
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.460]   What's that?
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:43.220]   Is that binary?
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:45.500]   I can't see what you're looking at yet.
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:46.620]   It's binary.
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:47.780]   It's what it is.
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:49.700]   Oh, you're looking at the-- OK.
[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:50.340]   Yeah, the binary.
[00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:51.380]   That's a much.
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:51.820]   Yeah.
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:53.980]   Very nice sight, by the way.
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:55.300]   Everybody should go there.
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:56.980]   Do you know about fab.com?
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:57.420]   Do I--
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:58.940]   Yes, I'm a big fab fan.
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:00.060]   Me too.
[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:00.500]   Me too.
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:01.500]   I sent out invites to everybody.
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:02.060]   I haven't got anything yet.
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:02.580]   No, me neither.
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:04.340]   I just like looking at it.
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:07.180]   Oh, I'm going to post my invite link in the chat room.
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:08.460]   Yeah, because I'm already--
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:10.860]   I already got to like the top level of fun,
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:12.420]   because I tweeted it.
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:15.700]   Oh, see, I don't-- I don't abuse Twitter that way, Leo.
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:16.820]   I do.
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:20.540]   I've got free shipping for six months.
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:24.020]   But I won't give out my invite code.
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:26.020]   You look a canork.
[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:27.780]   I can't do that.
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:29.260]   This is like-- this is not fashion.
[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:30.180]   This is design.
[00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:34.260]   But it's just kind of fun.
[00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:35.700]   Now, they've got some good stuff.
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:37.740]   That outdoor furniture is really, really cute.
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:39.980]   It looks like the DWR stuff, actually.
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:42.940]   But now you have to get an outdoor.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.180]   I have a deck.
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:45.700]   Oh, there you go.
[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:46.780]   I do.
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:50.060]   OK, now I have to play the rat hole theme.
[00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:51.620]   Moving right along.
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:52.300]   You started it.
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:54.900]   You talked about fashion back to MacBook Airs.
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:56.060]   I totally started it.
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:59.420]   And I am never, ever going to deny that.
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.300]   I'm the king of rat holes.
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:05.020]   Now that Merlin's moved on, Nokia and Apple have settled,
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:08.580]   apparently with a big check for-- who would you guess?
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:08.980]   Apple?
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:09.420]   Nokia?
[00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:12.380]   They were both suing each other over patents.
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:13.580]   Nokia wins.
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:14.060]   Yeah.
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:16.580]   They didn't say how much, but they said it's enough to affect
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:18.740]   our bottom line.
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:21.500]   Not only that, but they are actually now getting a royalty
[00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:23.300]   off of the iPhone.
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.500]   So anybody who's now holding Nokia stock
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:26.780]   is now really happy about that.
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:28.380]   In fact, a stock went up.
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:31.700]   Yeah, and you also have to figure that any patent that Apple
[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:34.060]   was infringing on--
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.500]   I've used a Nokia phone.
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.540]   I've got--
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:40.020]   Nokia phones holding up wobbly table links in my house.
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:41.660]   If they're infringing on that patent,
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:43.820]   that basically means that any smartphone is infringing
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:44.940]   on Nokia's patent.
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:47.060]   And the fact that Apple has simply said,
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:49.740]   if we give you money in a royalty, will you go away?
[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:52.420]   Means that Nokia can now ask that to pretty much anybody.
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:55.580]   So they're going to be-- they're going to be like that kid
[00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:58.980]   at the Kitten College whose dorm room has the 60-inch plasma
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:01.820]   display and like the eight game consoles
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:03.220]   and all the really expensive furniture.
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:05.220]   And you don't know where his money is coming from
[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:07.940]   because he never seems to actually work at a job.
[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:09.940]   That's going to be Nokia for the next five years.
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:15.380]   I mean, you get to where Nokia is simply just holding patents.
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:16.140]   I think you may.
[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.340]   I think you may have any squatter.
[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:21.860]   Unless you believe that Windows Phone 7's going to save Nokia,
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.260]   what do they got?
[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:24.180]   It's not Symbian.
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.140]   I mean, and I get hate mail for people
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:27.860]   when I say anything bad about Symbian.
[00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:29.140]   I love Symbian.
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:31.380]   I was a Scion user, but it's just not kept up.
[00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:31.980]   I have to say.
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:36.060]   I actually bought an N8 hoping and praying and a no.
[00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:37.020]   I thought--
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.020]   no, never mind.
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:39.500]   They're not phasing out Symbian, are they?
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:39.700]   Or are they?
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:40.380]   Yes, yes.
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:40.860]   They are.
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:41.580]   OK, that's what I thought.
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:41.860]   Yeah.
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:42.740]   Migo is dead.
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:48.380]   The guy, Nokia's CTO is missing in action.
[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:49.860]   But they're not expected to return.
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.260]   I'm not kidding.
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:54.700]   The board took him to a farm or he could roam and free.
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:56.380]   But he was the guy behind Migo, which
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:59.500]   was their Linux kind of operating system on the N900.
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:00.620]   I bought that too.
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:02.300]   I am such-- just get it.
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:02.900]   Ow.
[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:03.500]   I'm going to hit my--
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:04.380]   Who does like trying new things?
[00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:05.660]   It's OK.
[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.700]   Well, I keep thinking Nokia will come back
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.780]   because I'm a Nokia fan, but no, I don't think so.
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:15.060]   Although some estimates are that this may be as much as $130
[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:20.580]   million a quarter and a $600 million payment to Nokia.
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.060]   We don't know because Nokia's not saying,
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:23.340]   but that's a lot of money.
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:24.900]   A lot of--
[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.820]   I hope we get to find out exactly what areas
[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:29.940]   Apple conceded on and what Apple-- what areas Apple simply
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:31.260]   said no, this is not your technology.
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:32.740]   Oh, I'm sure we won't license this.
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:37.180]   I would love to see that because every time that I read
[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:39.300]   one of the findings on one of these patent hearings,
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:42.580]   I have to lower my understanding and expectations
[00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:45.500]   of what actually constitutes patentable technology.
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:47.540]   It's absolutely shocking.
[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:48.340]   It's a mess.
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:50.780]   It's just an ugly mess.
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:52.460]   You're putting the nine next to the eight.
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:55.420]   Well, unfortunately, we developed that at AT&T Bell Systems
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:56.660]   in 1971.
[00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:57.700]   You could patent that.
[00:42:57.700 --> 00:42:58.180]   Number eight.
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:42:58.860]   You could patent that.
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:02.420]   A system for sequencing numbers by incrementing by one.
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:05.900]   It's an infinity symbol turned around 90 degrees,
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:07.620]   so it doesn't use your patent.
[00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:11.980]   However, we've patented printing an infinity symbol on its side.
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:16.820]   I went to a great talk on physical insecurity,
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.740]   in which the guy who is a hobbyist who collects locks.
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:22.380]   You want to know how crazy the patent world is.
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:22.900]   Locks.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.300]   We haven't had-- there haven't been really
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:26.820]   many improvements in locks in 150 years,
[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:28.860]   mostly because of patents.
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:29.820]   It's gotten to the point now where
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:33.900]   locks are really just a symbol of security, not actual security.
[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:35.260]   You can put them in the locker door
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:38.700]   and it's basically saying, please, don't come in here.
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:42.700]   There wasn't always that time in almost everybody's history
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:45.380]   when suddenly they got the answer to the question of,
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:49.420]   how come I often see so many disposable white-bick pens
[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:51.980]   with the ends plugged out and the ends kind of stretched out
[00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:53.860]   just lying in the middle of the side of the month?
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:56.420]   And you think that you're, oh, people are just chewing on the pen.
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:57.700]   I guess they're doing that a lot.
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:00.380]   Then you realize that no, each one of those pens
[00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:03.620]   represents another bike lock that was defeated in about three seconds.
[00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:05.940]   By the way, Veronica is now very happy because you are--
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.860]   what did you get to prime?
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:08.620]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:09.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:09.820]   They all joined.
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:11.020]   You guys are awesome.
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:11.220]   See?
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:14.140]   So she has compunction about using Twitter for that.
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.300]   But she'll use our IRC.
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:16.580]   I'll use your chat room.
[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:17.420]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:23.940]   FAB.com/UPOQ3B.
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:24.780]   Why do they do that?
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:25.420]   That's the invite.
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:26.260]   It's all lowercase.
[00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:30.780]   UQ-- UPOQ3B.
[00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:34.660]   If you're not a member of FAB yet, use that invite code.
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:38.420]   It's like guilt or all of those other--
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:39.900]   where you get daily fashion mails.
[00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:40.820]   It's better than Groupon.
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:42.100]   I think I just read an analysis.
[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:42.620]   It's different.
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:45.260]   It's totally different because it's a flash sale site
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:48.900]   as opposed to a Groupon Ponzi scheme.
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:50.180]   It's a different kind of thing.
[00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:51.580]   Thank you for describing it that way.
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:53.700]   I really do think it's starting to look like that, isn't it?
[00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:55.500]   It's a little bit.
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:56.860]   A little bit.
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:58.060]   But it's great design stuff.
[00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:01.140]   And they just launched a couple of weeks ago.
[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:03.100]   And I've been a big fan.
[00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.660]   Haven't bought anything off of it yet,
[00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:06.740]   but I have come pretty close.
[00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:08.660]   It's a drool site where you look at--
[00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:08.660]   Yeah.
[00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:10.060]   --you know I want that.
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:10.580]   And you know what?
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:12.380]   I have an either-- and I know why Veronica,
[00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:15.420]   because the minute I buy my first thing, it's all over.
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:18.020]   I will now start buying a lot of stuff there.
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:18.940]   Yeah.
[00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:20.780]   That's why I don't have any tattoos.
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:22.220]   Yeah, don't get the first one, because then it's easy.
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:24.220]   I know I get the first one on my back and my shoulder.
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:26.060]   And the next thing you know, it'll be all up my arm.
[00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:28.500]   By the way, Andy, I want to thank you for the roaring fire.
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:29.940]   I didn't notice.
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:30.500]   There you go.
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.340]   You rock.
[00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:34.100]   That monitor is going to have to--
[00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:35.940]   the room is filling with noxious fumes,
[00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:37.740]   because there's nothing ventilated here.
[00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:39.180]   But all for you--
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:40.740]   --you need a carbon monoxide monitor.
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:42.500]   So Apple has decided--
[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:48.180]   now is this a sign of the iPhone 4S or 5 coming or what?
[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:50.220]   Apple has decided to start selling
[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:51.980]   unlocked iPhones in the US.
[00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:53.260]   They've never done this before.
[00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:54.020]   They're not cheap.
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:57.620]   They start at $650.
[00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:01.020]   But you can get them now unlocked.
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:02.460]   It is GSM.
[00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:04.460]   It's not the Verizon version.
[00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:07.460]   And it-- which means it will run on AT&T and T-Mobile,
[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:09.740]   but not exactly, because it's not 3G on T-Mobile.
[00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:11.660]   It doesn't have T-Mobile's 3G frequency.
[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:15.180]   Just their 2G frequency, their edge frequency,
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:17.220]   which means it would be slow data.
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.780]   More importantly, though, I think there's no contract.
[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:24.300]   So you could get it from AT&T for $80, $100, $80, $100.
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:27.820]   And if you travel, you could pop the sim, go to France,
[00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:32.380]   buy a sim from Orange, pop it in, and use it there.
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:34.700]   And I have to say, I'm actually seriously considering
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:36.020]   something like that, because I--
[00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:37.420]   You try to have time overseas.
[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:38.060]   Yeah, me too.
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:41.060]   And it's really expensive.
[00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:41.940]   Would you use it?
[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:42.900]   You go to-- where do you go?
[00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.060]   Japan a lot, right?
[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.020]   I go to Japan a lot.
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:45.540]   Yeah.
[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:46.460]   And Europe.
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:46.820]   Europe.
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:48.020]   But mostly Japan.
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:49.100]   So I'd have to figure it out.
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:50.540]   I think it would work over there.
[00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:52.340]   Oh, there's iPhones everywhere now.
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:52.900]   So just--
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:56.180]   Yeah, we've swapped sims in Japan before without any trouble
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:57.180]   with the older 3GS.
[00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:58.180]   You know, 3GS.
[00:46:58.180 --> 00:46:59.180]   OK.
[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:02.780]   I wonder how at what point they'll offer iPhone 5 when it
[00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:04.260]   eventually comes out unlocked.
[00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:05.700]   If they'll do that right off the bat,
[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:07.500]   or if they'll wait for a while, like with the iPhone 4.
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:08.460]   It's not interesting.
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.820]   The point is, maybe, that they've been selling unlocked
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:12.780]   in Europe and around the world for a long time.
[00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:14.660]   And I think since day one, but that was mostly, I think,
[00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:16.900]   because regulators required it.
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:19.580]   But I also think-- but I think now that, obviously, they
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:21.780]   were locked in AT&T for some period of time,
[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:25.060]   then I think that they gave Verizon a window of protection
[00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:27.940]   so they could get some money out of the relationship,
[00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:30.260]   and then drive that.
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:31.300]   And I think now we're going to--
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:33.740]   I think we're going to an unlocked iPhone world, where
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:35.460]   companies may underwrite it, but I
[00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:37.460]   think that we're going to see it on all the services
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.300]   at this point.
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:42.180]   Is it a sign that the iPhone 5 is--
[00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:45.420]   or I'm calling it the iPhone 5 generically, the next generation
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:47.500]   iPhone is going to be out.
[00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.980]   You think in the fall with iOS?
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:51.340]   That's what people are saying.
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:53.660]   They're saying it might go into production in July
[00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:56.260]   and then be ready for shipping in September.
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:58.900]   It seems a little bit soon, but who knows?
[00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:00.540]   Yeah, there's some rumors floating around
[00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:02.820]   that there's now hardware in the hands of Apple employees
[00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:04.900]   that are using it as their daily driver.
[00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:06.260]   But that's just a rumor.
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:08.860]   We're definitely looking at-- if that were the case,
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:10.380]   we're looking at a window of what?
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:11.620]   Four or five months before.
[00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:14.060]   I'd say it's a rumor until someone finds one in a bar.
[00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:15.100]   I got to tell you something.
[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:16.340]   I got to tell you something.
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:18.260]   There was a guy in here who shall remain nameless,
[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:19.420]   showed me a picture.
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:21.060]   He said, I saw the iPhone 5.
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:22.700]   I saw it in a bar.
[00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:23.580]   He said--
[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:24.420]   Guy--
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:24.920]   No.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:25.580]   Get it back to him.
[00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:26.140]   No, he didn't--
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:28.060]   He was by a priest.
[00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:29.300]   A nun and a duck.
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:32.220]   He spotted a guy who had what he thought was an excess S
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:34.540]   because it was slightly curvy, very thin.
[00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:36.340]   He said very black.
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:38.100]   And then he saw the iPhone interface on it.
[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:39.260]   It was sitting here.
[00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:41.260]   And the guy, as soon as he noticed--
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:43.580]   this was in the Silicon Valley area.
[00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:46.220]   As soon as he noticed this other guy looking like that,
[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:48.100]   he went, nah, you're not going to see that anymore,
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:49.220]   put in his pocket.
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:51.900]   So this does confirm the rumors that we've heard.
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:53.380]   And he showed me a picture.
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:55.500]   And it looked just like an excess S, slightly curved,
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:56.700]   very thin--
[00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:58.420]   But you got a picture of it?
[00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:00.820]   He snapped a picture of it.
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:01.460]   And he showed me.
[00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:02.460]   But I'm not going to say his name,
[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:04.180]   and I'm not going to say who saw it.
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:04.860]   But I--
[00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:05.360]   But--
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:06.180]   Because I don't want--
[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:06.680]   No.
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:07.740]   Another gizmodo on our hands here.
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:11.300]   I don't want the police coming and taking all our computers.
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:14.700]   Actually, they may now, because I know who it is, right?
[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:16.700]   I forgot.
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:17.700]   I really did.
[00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:19.460]   I didn't steal it and take it apart.
[00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:21.220]   And he just took a picture in a public place.
[00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:22.420]   He's allowed to do that.
[00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:24.220]   Oh, really?
[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:26.460]   Well, it's still partly American.
[00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:30.700]   Isn't he allowed if somebody leaves it around to pick it up?
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:32.620]   And take it home and take it apart?
[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:33.180]   Not so much.
[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:35.140]   It's technically illegal.
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:36.140]   Yeah, it's like theft.
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:36.640]   I would have--
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.020]   Let's make sure we can just go around
[00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:39.980]   and horn to a sound check so that we can identify the law
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:41.540]   enforcement who is making those comments
[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:42.860]   and who is not making those comments.
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:43.540]   Andy Naco.
[00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:44.380]   I'm not making those comments.
[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:45.380]   Andy Naco.
[00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:47.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:50.580]   It's kind of cool, though, because there's a whole community
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:52.500]   of Android users that are reflashing the ROMs
[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:53.580]   and we're substituting--
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:54.620]   It could be.
[00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:55.980]   Really elegant ROMs.
[00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:57.300]   Well, there is one--
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:58.940]   I think it's called the Me ROM, something like that,
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:03.780]   M-I-R. If you can see demo videos of it on YouTube,
[00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:07.100]   that is just the slickest, most elegant fluid thing
[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:09.460]   you would ever see on an Android device.
[00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:12.340]   That if someone promoted that as, hey,
[00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:16.140]   we just got some sneaky video of the next version of iOS 6,
[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:19.780]   you would think-- you wouldn't say, oh, OK, yeah, right.
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:20.780]   When I see it.
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:22.420]   But somewhere in the back of your head,
[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:26.180]   it would say you would expect Apple to do something as--
[00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:28.620]   this is not the way that I would expect an Android phone
[00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:28.900]   to look.
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:30.860]   This looks the way I would expect an iPhone to look.
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:33.540]   But that's interesting that if someone is saying that they've
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:35.300]   actually snapped a photo, they're definitely
[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:37.260]   putting their neck weight on the line.
[00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:40.420]   So at least he makes him a bold idiot,
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:42.900]   as opposed to just--
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:45.700]   either way to be honest.
[00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:46.900]   But we do hear rumors.
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:50.860]   This is from 9 to 5 Mac that the next iPhone is
[00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:53.020]   in final testing stage.
[00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:56.860]   And the Verizon won't support 3G FaceTime this year.
[00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:02.660]   This is all from people looking at iOS 5 and so forth.
[00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:05.260]   Apple and Verizon have yet to strike a deal regarding FaceTime
[00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:05.900]   over 3G.
[00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:09.780]   Will we have FaceTime over 3G on the AT&T iPhone?
[00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:12.060]   I wonder.
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:20.020]   So the iOS SDK apparently indicates
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:24.740]   there will continue to be a 5 megapixel camera.
[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:27.700]   So that 8 megapixels that we were thinking about after Howard
[00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:30.620]   Stringer implied that there would be Sony's best camera
[00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:32.420]   will be in the iPhone.
[00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:33.620]   Maybe not so.
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:34.780]   I've never been convinced by that.
[00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:36.700]   I think that Apple is always going to simply--
[00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:39.220]   they're not going to be swayed by numbers.
[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:42.220]   They're always going to be swayed by what processing software
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:44.460]   can we put in behind it to make--
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:47.020]   what can we do to make sure the photos that come out of there
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:48.660]   are going to be the best photos possible?
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:49.580]   It's not always necessarily--
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:51.300]   And they do a damn good job right now.
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:53.460]   I mean, there's just no question that that iPhone has a--
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:55.140]   the iPhone 5 is still at the top of the heap.
[00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:59.020]   Unless you're buying a camera that actually has Carl Zeiss glass
[00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:02.300]   inside it and is designed to be a really good 5 megapixel
[00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:04.820]   digital camera with-- oh, by the way, we also managed
[00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:05.900]   to cram into GSM phone.
[00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:09.820]   You mean like this fine Nokia N8 with a Carl Zeiss lens
[00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:12.220]   and a 12 megapixel camera?
[00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:15.780]   You mean like that, Andy and I go?
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:17.460]   Oh, he's a crap.
[00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:18.460]   Yeah.
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:19.460]   Awkward.
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:20.460]   Awkward.
[00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:21.460]   Awkward.
[00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:22.260]   It's nicer.
[00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:25.660]   Children in Vermont would love to have a phone like that.
[00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:28.020]   Well, and I still think-- especially with these phones,
[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:31.180]   I think that paying more attention to the sensitivity
[00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:33.820]   of the chip and the low grain and everything else
[00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:35.700]   is way more important than resolution.
[00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:39.540]   I think on my-- on a pocket phone, I'd much rather--
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:40.380]   I agree.
[00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:43.700]   --have them take that precious real estate and play with,
[00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:46.180]   how do we make it so that it works better in low light?
[00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:48.420]   Because that's what the average user is really using it for.
[00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:49.220]   They're indoors.
[00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:50.380]   They're taking pictures of their family.
[00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:51.700]   They're taking pictures of stuff.
[00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:54.540]   And having to handle that low light information better
[00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:56.580]   is far more important than making it any bigger.
[00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:58.180]   If you want to bigger, get a snapshot camera
[00:52:58.180 --> 00:52:59.140]   or get an--
[00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:00.140]   Or get an answer on it.
[00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:01.140]   Or get a Nokia.
[00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:02.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:04.420]   I'm surprised by how many people tell me
[00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:06.980]   that they're using their iPhone 5 camera just
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:08.020]   as a regular camera.
[00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:08.780]   I still--
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:09.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:09.860]   And I still--
[00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:10.700]   It's a good camera.
[00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:13.740]   It's the camera that I happen to have with me when I didn't
[00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:14.820]   plan to take a camera with me.
[00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:17.460]   But I still have at least a real pocket camera when I think
[00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:17.660]   it's going to--
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:20.780]   I'm embarrassed to say I don't even take my S90 with me
[00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:21.740]   anywhere anymore.
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:22.240]   Really?
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:22.740]   Really?
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:22.740]   Yeah.
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:24.220]   I feel kind of bad about that.
[00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:26.020]   But it's just one more thing to pack now.
[00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:26.500]   Right.
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:28.380]   And I'm not like a serious photographer,
[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:29.220]   like a lot of you guys.
[00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:30.620]   So it's not that important to me.
[00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:31.120]   No.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:33.640]   I just like to snap moments and put them on Instagram,
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:34.340]   that kind of thing.
[00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:34.740]   I agree.
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:38.020]   And it's the combination of a decent--
[00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:41.680]   not great, but decent camera with great software
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:43.780]   selections and abilities and this social stuff,
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:46.500]   like Instagram, that really puts it over the top.
[00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:49.280]   I have to admit that services like Instagram really
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:53.400]   schooled me on how to step a lot of my assumptions
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:54.920]   about photography, mobile photography,
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:59.080]   were because I've never warmed to these services where--
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:01.560]   even if you're taking a picture on a camera phone,
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:04.400]   your iPhone 5 can take some excellent photos.
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:06.360]   Why would you then want to take that picture
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:08.640]   and put it through a piece of software that makes it look
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:13.000]   like a Fisher Price 1971 plastic lens distorted camera?
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.480]   And unfortunately, the answer to that question
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:20.200]   is that because some people regard photography as something fun.
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:22.960]   Whereas at least even when I'm just taking camera-- even
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:24.800]   when I think I'm taking pictures for fun, part of it
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:27.680]   is that I want to capture the best data I can at the scene
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:29.040]   before this moment passes.
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:33.040]   So it just goes to show that sometimes society makes
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:36.040]   its own decisions that are more appropriate for society.
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:38.200]   And it doesn't matter that something is not technically
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:41.200]   advanced as long as it fits in with how people are reacting
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.440]   to this stuff.
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:45.240]   I have to say, the number one reason that I miss an SLR
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:48.040]   or want to have something that's beefier
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:50.000]   is specifically in low light, which I just talked about.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.160]   But I mean, I think that I'm in an indoor situation.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.120]   I really wish I had something a little bit faster.
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:55.920]   And that's why I think it's so important for them
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:58.080]   to keep on moving that forward, because the rest of it
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:58.920]   kind of works for me.
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:54:59.560]   Look at the rest of the--
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:00.800]   12 megapixels.
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:02.480]   Carl Zeiss glass.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:04.880]   Who wants to buy my Nokia N8?
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:05.880]   Look at that.
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:06.880]   That's so personal.
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:08.640]   It only has seven digits on the keypad.
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:11.480]   But so long as you're very selective about who you want to call,
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:12.960]   you're doing pretty good.
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:14.920]   It's really-- you know, I wanted this phone to be good.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:16.600]   Hey, by the way, Andy, thanks to our chat room,
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:20.520]   you can now charge your iPhone from that roaring fire behind you.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:21.360]   Nice.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.720]   Isn't that good?
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:25.840]   This is the Hatsuden Nabe.
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:29.760]   Basically, it's a pot with a USB cable coming out of it.
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:31.960]   When it's heated up, cooking beans or whatever else
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:33.720]   about camping, you plug in your phone.
[00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:35.040]   Takes three to five hours.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.200]   That's a lot of beans.
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:40.160]   Well, you've got to cut down a lot of old-growth trees
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:41.200]   and learn to get them.
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.560]   I've got two bars better.
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:44.360]   I'm not sure how green it is.
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:46.120]   Oh, I got to talk about your carbon footprint.
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:47.080]   I mean, yours.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:49.600]   Well, if you're camping, you're doing it anyway, right?
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:51.520]   I mean, I wouldn't recommend this at home.
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:53.480]   Well, to keep the bears away, I'm sure.
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:57.280]   Well, the good news here is that if you have that with you
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:59.000]   and you get lost in the forest, we've
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.400]   had these people who get completely lost.
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:01.240]   And your phone dies.
[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:02.200]   Now you don't have GPS.
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:03.320]   You can't call anyone.
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.280]   At least you know if you go out and find some Bramble,
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.840]   you can light a fire and--
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:07.600]   I see.
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:09.480]   We don't talk about this often enough.
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:13.040]   This is part of the dark, rear side of Kickstarter projects,
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:15.880]   because anybody can come up with a dumbest idea.
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.880]   And then if just 1,000 people think, you know what?
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:20.880]   I want to see this guy make a fool out of himself.
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:24.280]   I'm willing to spend $5 to cause this guy to waste four months
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.960]   on a totally unmarketable product.
[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:27.920]   Yes, please, put me down for $10.
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:28.240]   Definitely.
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:31.160]   I feel like I'm seeing a lot of Kickstarter abuse lately.
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:31.560]   Really?
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:33.560]   And I feel like a lot of people are just
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:35.800]   kind of starting projects and putting them on Kickstarter.
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:38.200]   I don't know if they would have had these ideas pre-kick
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:41.720]   starter, but I feel like now that that's around, it's--
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:43.240]   yeah, exactly as he was just saying.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:45.760]   It's making a lot of projects that people
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:49.160]   are putting a lot of money into that maybe are not
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.000]   the best ideas.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.600]   This was one of the best.
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:55.640]   So look at this, this is that watch band that the guy put out.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:58.760]   And that's an iPod nano in there.
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:00.360]   Isn't that clever?
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:02.040]   It never exists, though.
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:06.600]   It's great to turn time-telling into a three-step process.
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:07.600]   There it is.
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:08.100]   You got it.
[00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:08.600]   There you go.
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:09.100]   There you go.
[00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:12.120]   I pushed the button and the light came on.
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:12.760]   Isn't that cool?
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:14.920]   Actually, I should thank Paul Saltzman, who's
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:17.840]   in our audience today from Washington State, who's actually
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:19.040]   was wearing that.
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.760]   It is super cool.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:25.640]   That's the one that everybody went, wow, Kickstarter works.
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:28.680]   For five years, I wore watches that at some point.
[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:31.400]   I had a Millennium Falcon wristwatch where--
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:33.680]   it was a die-cast model of the Millennium Falcon.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:36.520]   And you have to actually pop a pocket watch sort of spring
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:39.320]   to get the dome section to pop up so you could see the time.
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:42.360]   And I'm on up resting the button because I'd always be--
[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:43.640]   I'm walking through an airport.
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:44.680]   I've got my bags, my hand.
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:46.240]   The only way to find out if I'm going to miss my flight
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:49.040]   is to go like that to the watch to see if I can find out
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:49.960]   what time it is.
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:51.640]   So as cool as that idea is, I don't
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:54.080]   want to go back to those dark times ever again.
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:55.120]   Have you ever--
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:57.440]   Veronica bought a Kickstarter?
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:02.280]   Yeah, I've given two three different things for Kickstarter.
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:04.520]   I did one for Padpivot.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:08.440]   I did one for radiation detection devices for Japan.
[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:08.920]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:12.720]   And I did one for a local farm, actually, a local urban farm.
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:14.720]   So you treat it kind of as a charity?
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:16.480]   Yeah, in a way I do, definitely.
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:16.960]   Yeah, I do.
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:18.080]   Except for the Padpivot one.
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:18.960]   I mean, that was--
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:19.960]   And did you get a Padpivot?
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:20.760]   It's a cool product.
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:23.680]   They're sending them out soon, I believe.
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:24.880]   So I got the one--
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:26.880]   I can't think of the name of it right now.
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:29.600]   It's the one that you put your iPhone into that you put it
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:30.760]   in a bunch of different angles.
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:31.760]   The glyph.
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:34.320]   Which had turned out to be fantastic.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:36.880]   I think that was the big example of what
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.120]   works about Kickstarter.
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:41.080]   These guys thought of an incredibly elegant solution
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:41.960]   to--
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:43.560]   a simple solution.
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:45.640]   They printed it on Shapeways.
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:47.080]   They put it up there and showed everyone
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:48.240]   what they would do with it.
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:49.800]   And they raised like a quarter million dollars.
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:53.320]   And it's actually a very useful device.
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:55.040]   And they started a little company.
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:59.040]   We had one, actually, one of our interns from Texas,
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:58:59.760]   Danny Fakuba.
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:01.920]   He was working on a project called the Una.
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:06.800]   And they actually raised over $130,000 for their project.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:09.160]   And it's a tiny little iPod.
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:11.840]   Or actually, it works for any phone, I'm pretty sure.
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:13.920]   It's like a suction cup on one end, a suction cup
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:16.920]   on the other end, and a little pinot arm on one side.
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.680]   And it works fabulously.
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:20.160]   He showed it off on the show this week.
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:22.160]   And they raised a ton of money.
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:24.800]   And now they're trying to keep up with all their orders.
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:27.920]   They're going overseas for people to make the product.
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:30.680]   And it's a really good success story, actually,
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:32.840]   about how Kickstarter can find good projects
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:36.600]   and then make them really successful right off the bat.
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:38.120]   I did Diaspora.
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:39.760]   That was my first Kickstarter project.
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:42.560]   That was the one that was supposed to replace Facebook.
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:44.640]   That's gone well.
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:45.720]   That's gone very well.
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:48.760]   And then I just today, actually, I bought a Kickstarter thing.
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.760]   See, you do charity Veronica.
[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:52.640]   You do like good things.
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:54.600]   I bought these like this Dias game.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:57.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:58.200]   It looked really cool.
[00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:59.040]   I thought I'm wing wing.
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.160]   I'm trying to find it now.
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:03.640]   Kind of a Dias game that you have--
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:06.040]   I don't know.
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:08.360]   I was going to give them a plug, but why the hell?
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:10.040]   They already-- by the way, that's
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.800]   what's the other thing that's weird about Kickstarter.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.760]   They already way exceeded their amount.
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:17.040]   I mean, they're going to collect like 30 grand on this thing.
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:20.160]   But that's, I guess, the success, right?
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:21.880]   Yeah.
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:22.440]   Let's take a break.
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:25.480]   Come back with more Veronica Belmont is here from Tekzilla.
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:28.360]   It's great to have her as always.
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:30.200]   Somebody's in the chat room to crucial waxes.
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:31.800]   Hey, Diaspora's still an alpha.
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:32.560]   Just you wait.
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:35.880]   Someday there'll be a beta.
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:40.440]   Also here, Andy and Ico and Alex Lindsey and a rowing fire.
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:41.960]   It's beautiful.
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:45.720]   Oh, here's the Dias.
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:47.240]   These ain't your Grandpappy's Dias.
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:53.640]   This is a game with like kind of weirdly sculpted Dias,
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:54.160]   like this.
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.480]   And then you-- I don't know.
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:58.000]   You shake them or something.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   But see, they want a 10 grand.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.200]   They've raised $23,000 already.
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:06.000]   They better make these damn Dias.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.120]   Anyway, I'm going to get some.
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:10.400]   So if you guys want to come over and play a strange game
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:18.600]   with weird ass Dias, I'll be the first to my block.
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.480]   Are people glad now to support our sponsors
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:23.120]   knowing that Leo is doing such a good job using the money
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.400]   that you give us?
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:24.920]   No.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.440]   This is my personal money I spent on that crap.
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:29.440]   The money you give us actually goes to things
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.280]   like our new Twitch cottage.
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:32.120]   And you know what?
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:35.000]   One of the things I like about gazelle.com?
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.240]   They give you money.
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.680]   You don't give them money.
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.120]   Now you got to like that.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:39.920]   Have you tried gazelle?
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.040]   We've all got gadgets that really are frankly just
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.200]   taking up space.
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:47.120]   Things we thought were a good idea at the time.
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:50.920]   But perhaps just aren't so hot anymore.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:54.120]   Things perhaps we'd like to get some money for.
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.560]   But there's somebody who can use these.
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:02:01.240]   And that's why you go to gazelle.com.
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.120]   Don't sell it.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.760]   Gazelle, I like their tag like keep it moving.
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.080]   Pass the gadget along.
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:09.240]   It's good for the ecosystem and good for your pocketbook.
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:13.240]   You know, on average, the average gazelle customer
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:16.440]   gets more than $100 from gazelle.
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:18.280]   And I'm going to tell you how you can get even a little bit
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:18.540]   more.
[01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:20.040]   They've got all sorts of categories.
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.400]   Here's how it works.
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.240]   You enter in what you've got.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.000]   Let's see what I have.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.720]   A Nokia N8.
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:28.880]   And then you search for that.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:29.760]   There it is.
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:32.440]   And then they'll ask you a couple of questions about what--
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:33.360]   is it working?
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:33.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:35.200]   This thing is in perfect shape.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.720]   Continue.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.240]   And then let's see here.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.120]   I've got all the boxing and everything.
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:41.000]   Software cables.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:41.520]   Yeah.
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.480]   I got it all.
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:43.520]   Free of water damage.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.640]   You bet it's free of water damage.
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:47.640]   You better believe it because frankly, it's just
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.000]   been in my drawer for the--
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.320]   161 bucks.
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:51.440]   I'll take it.
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:52.400]   So here's what the deal.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.040]   You see this button, add the box.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.800]   You just throw it in a box.
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.160]   Once you get all your stuff in there,
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:00.440]   put it all-- jam it full of stuff.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:03.760]   Then they give you a printable mailing label you put on there.
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:04.560]   They pay the postage.
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:05.920]   You send it to gazelle.
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:06.720]   They look at it.
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.680]   Here's the interesting thing.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:10.080]   Often, they give you more money than they
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.080]   said on the estimate.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.760]   Sometimes last-- if you said, yeah, it's perfect condition
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:17.120]   and it's not-- the class is broken, though.
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:18.560]   Of course, lower their estimate.
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:19.840]   But they're very honest.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.440]   And frequently, they will actually give you more money.
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:21.920]   Saying, you know what?
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.480]   This is worth more.
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.800]   They will wipe your data, by the way.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.080]   You never have to worry about your data.
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:28.760]   That's one of the things they do as a service.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.160]   And then they send you a check.
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.600]   Or you can get a credit.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:34.560]   I think they have PayPal, Amazon, and Walmart gift cards.
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:36.320]   In fact, if you do the Amazon gift card,
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:38.640]   you get a 5% additional bonus.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:39.680]   You get more money.
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:42.800]   They kind of give you the rebate back, I guess, on it.
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:45.720]   And now here's how you can make more money.
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:48.760]   If you use the code MAC BREAK when you check out,
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.240]   you'll get an additional 5%.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:52.560]   So get all the quotes.
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:55.040]   Enter MAC BREAK another 5% on your gadgets.
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.520]   It's a great way to get rid of-- clear out the garage.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.080]   Get rid of old gadgets that you're not using.
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.000]   Get ready for the Wii U.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.280]   Sell your Wii.
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.920]   So you're going to have a Wii U.
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.120]   Your iPad 2-- because I guess I'm hearing rumors--
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:08.680]   iPad 3 is coming this year, maybe.
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:10.560]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:12.920]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:13.480]   Don't sell it.
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:14.080]   Gazelle it.
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:17.000]   By the way, if your device is just really--
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.760]   can't be sold, is really too old,
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:21.640]   or is it such a bad occasion, you can still put it in the box.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.400]   And they do responsible recycling.
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.360]   They guarantee not to export it to use green recyclers.
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:28.120]   You can read all about it on the Gazelle page.
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:29.560]   Also, great way to raise money for charity.
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:30.600]   You don't have to have a bake sale.
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.000]   Have a gadget drive.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.640]   Gazelle.com.
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:34.360]   Great.
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:35.440]   One of my favorite sponsors.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:39.200]   And one of the few sponsors we have where they give you money.
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.560]   I like that.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:44.120]   They pay you to use them.
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:45.640]   What do you think of the rumors?
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:48.240]   iPad coming 3 coming this fall, Veronica.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:50.680]   Are you an iPad 2 user?
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:55.040]   I am an iPad 2 user, but I'm not really ready to upgrade yet.
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:56.960]   That's the question.
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.560]   I guess I'll just have to enjoy it when it comes out,
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.720]   and wait a while, and then get one eventually, I guess.
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.040]   OK, what if?
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:04.040]   What if?
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:04.880]   Too many updates.
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:05.600]   What if?
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.160]   And this is the rumor.
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:10.160]   The screen resolution is four or five times higher.
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.160]   And like--
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:12.840]   Like retina.
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.240]   Like retina display.
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:16.600]   It wouldn't make that much of a difference to me.
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.680]   I'm happy I upgraded to iPad 2.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:21.240]   I'm giving my mom my original iPad.
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:25.320]   But if that's the only major change,
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:28.040]   I don't think it would be worth upgrading for me at least.
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:28.400]   Yeah.
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:29.840]   I think that I think going from--
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:32.240]   I think that people ask me about,
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.480]   should I upgrade to iPad 2?
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.920]   And I have to say, I said, if you already got an iPad 1,
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:38.280]   you're probably fine.
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:41.120]   There's not a lot in iPad 2 that you're going to really need.
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.920]   Now, jumping from-- if you already have an iPad,
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:46.720]   going from iPad 1 to iPad 3, I think makes sense.
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:50.560]   Going from iPad 2 to iPad 3, unless you're in the industry
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.600]   and you have to pay attention to it, I'm not sure if it--
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:53.120]   Yeah.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:55.440]   I typically skip a generation with things like that,
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.360]   especially with iPhones.
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:59.960]   But yeah, the iPad doesn't-- I don't use it enough.
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:01.920]   I guess I use it every day.
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:04.360]   Now, I'm just stumbling over my words.
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.680]   Because I'm trying to really let you know how I feel
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:07.440]   about this situation.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:08.600]   How do you really feel about it?
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:11.680]   How do I really feel?
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:15.240]   There's often not enough of an update for me between phones.
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:16.880]   I never upgraded to the 3GS.
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:19.440]   I went from 3G to 4.
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:22.240]   And I don't think I will upgrade to the iPad 3, unless--
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:24.680]   like I said, there's a major change.
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:25.040]   I think--
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:25.760]   I think what's wrong with you--
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:27.960]   It's a software that really matters most to me.
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:30.840]   I think the big thing to wait for is now 4G,
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:33.840]   especially as a matter of fact, 4G.
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:37.400]   If there's an iPhone 5 with 4G, I think not only would that
[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:39.840]   get me to upgrade immediately, but it also would get me to switch
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:41.840]   from AT&T to Verizon.
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:46.000]   So we take you now to the Cupertino City Council,
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.120]   where Steve Jobs is about to speak.
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:51.960]   We think that would-- we do very well with that here.
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:52.960]   This is the day after--
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:53.360]   So those of you--
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.960]   WWDC on Tuesday of last week.
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:58.920]   Steve went to the Cupertino City Council
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:03.040]   to present pictures of the new Apple spaceship
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:05.920]   that he would like to put on the ground.
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:08.160]   This is actually a very cool building.
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:11.280]   They say now that he's been thinking about a kind of signature
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:13.360]   building for Apple since 1983.
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:17.880]   They've now got the money in the bank to do this thing,
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:19.960]   this amazing curved building.
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:22.160]   It is for just--
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:23.240]   There's probably be a reason--
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:24.600]   How do I get a job at Apple?
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:25.120]   No kidding.
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:26.680]   I mean, you just look at the building.
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:27.640]   I mean, it's just--
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.440]   Well, you got to think--
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.240]   He kind of thinks this is as his legacy.
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:32.360]   This is the old Apple campus.
[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:36.680]   They bought a parcel from Hewlett Packard,
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:40.480]   and they're going to put in more trees,
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:44.440]   take out surface parking, build underground parking
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:45.520]   for 12,000 cars.
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.800]   This is their expectation that Apple will go to what it was,
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.600]   at 18,000 employees, something like that.
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:50.040]   13,000.
[01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:51.480]   13,000.
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:55.880]   And so they'll all be housed in this new circular spaceship
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:58.560]   that looks like the Pentagon without any edges.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:07:59.000]   It's like--
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:07:59.880]   No, no, no.
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:02.920]   It's like the Pentagon with an infinite number of edges.
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:07.520]   He says, there's not a straight petus of glass in the place.
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:08.360]   There it is.
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:10.360]   It's the Pentagon properly translated.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:14.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.400]   My thought was interesting, though, is that--
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:18.680]   and obviously, all of the questions that
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:22.120]   came from the city council were properly fawning
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:25.360]   as is only proper for the person who brings 13,000 jobs
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.240]   and ungodly numbers.
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:31.480]   Is it proper, though, to ask for free iPads and Wi-Fi?
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:32.480]   Well, no, they said they said--
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.040]   I can only--
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:33.840]   Yeah, go ahead.
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:37.000]   They said that, yeah, he had the proper response.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.200]   Someone said, one of the city councils said, well,
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:41.280]   what's the community getting back from this?
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:42.720]   We give us free Wi-Fi.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.240]   And Steve, just like Pause for a second,
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:46.800]   has said, we think we pay a lot of taxes.
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:47.320]   And that's--
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:48.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:51.400]   We're-- I think the actual-- something close to the actual
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:53.240]   quote was, I like simple solutions.
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:55.200]   The simple solution is that we give you a lot of money
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:58.080]   taxes, and then you install free Wi-Fi for everybody.
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:58.560]   Good idea.
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.120]   He said, it was great.
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:02.600]   He said, if you want to bypass the taxes that we pay,
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:03.920]   we're happy to give you Wi-Fi.
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:06.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:07.880]   Quick thinking, Mr. Jobs.
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:08.640]   Well played.
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.280]   You can see it going on in his head, though.
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:12.760]   You can see the anger.
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:13.640]   Like, when they're asking--
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:14.640]   Yeah, very Wi-Fi.
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.920]   --building this outrageously cool building that's
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:19.200]   going to bring more work and more construction
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:20.400]   and more people into--
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.440]   Well, and they're not going to Wi-Fi.
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:23.440]   And you're just like, oh.
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.120]   And be ecologically sound, too.
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:25.640]   Yeah.
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:26.440]   I really kind of--
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:27.440]   --anneal--
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:28.120]   The same thing.
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:31.480]   The question that I would have liked them to ask is,
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:34.360]   he made a lot of boast about how they're replacing all these
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:37.200]   really ugly looking corporate buildings with open grassland
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.040]   and they're putting all the parking underground.
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.760]   But he also pointed out that he's
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:43.000]   using all the buildings that are frontage
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.320]   to the public roads around the property.
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:47.280]   That's where they're going to be putting the power plant.
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:48.640]   That's where they're going to be putting
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:49.960]   the theater for events.
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.560]   And if you look at the elevation,
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:55.120]   it looks like if you have no business inside of Apple,
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:58.440]   you will be seeing a big sheer wall of just buildings.
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:01.320]   I wonder-- I would like to know how much of that open grassland
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:04.240]   is going to be-- are there bike paths that people can just
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:06.160]   cut through to go from A to B?
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.360]   If I lived in that area and had a dry pass it every day,
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:12.200]   would I be seeing just sheer walls of granite?
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.000]   Or would I be seeing lots of trees?
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   Would I be seeing this beautiful arc building?
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:16.800]   You're too--
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:17.760]   It's only three stories.
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:21.200]   So it's not as though it's going to be a beautiful object
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:22.920]   on people's skylines.
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:24.120]   You're just angry.
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.080]   You're just angry, Andy.
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:25.880]   I don't understand.
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:27.920]   Why wouldn't you want a giant spaceship in the middle
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.360]   of your town?
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:30.520]   Because you can't say it.
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:30.920]   Oh.
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:31.840]   Well, it looks great.
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.320]   It looks great on Google.
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.880]   Maybe it's a little close.
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:35.320]   Maybe it's close.
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:37.320]   They know that they want everybody at Google
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.800]   to see what a big building and beautiful building they can
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:40.800]   build.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.440]   Wouldn't it be nice if you worked here?
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:45.080]   Well, I was kind of amazed that they
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:47.000]   couldn't find a price that would work for the apartment
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.520]   building that they said there's this little cutout.
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:51.080]   There's a little bite in there.
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:52.200]   It's like Nevada without--
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:53.680]   and then they cut this little bit out of it.
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:54.880]   This thing here, this triangle.
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:56.280]   He said there was a little apartment complex
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:57.160]   and it wasn't for sale.
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:59.600]   And I was like, really?
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.960]   I think somebody very smartly said that, gee,
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:05.120]   so we're going to be the only building left next
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.200]   to this beautiful, huge building that everybody's
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:08.280]   going to want to come to.
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:10.160]   We think that it would be a good idea for us to hold on
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.120]   to this property as a matter of fact.
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:15.520]   And just to show Apple how much we don't like the problems
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.920]   we're having with our new iPhone,
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:19.920]   we're going to rent out billboard space facing your building
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:25.480]   for phone sex lines and for money, money, $100.
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:26.480]   Yeah.
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:28.000]   I just think that it had to have been--
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.240]   I guess Apple decided it wasn't worth whatever the price is.
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.600]   But it has to be a price of the lifetime
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:33.720]   of those apartments.
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:36.680]   I mean, they're going to spend $1 to $2 billion on this thing,
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:37.680]   I think.
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:42.320]   So it seems like some a little bit more for the apartment
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:42.480]   comp.
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.880]   According to Mashable, Steve Jobs is going to become--
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.680]   well, there's two Steve Jobs biographies.
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:50.040]   One is nine months out the actual official biography.
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:53.480]   Then Mashable says there's a comic book biography of Steve
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:54.000]   Jobs.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.480]   I know which one you're going to buy, Andy.
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:00.480]   I've already added it to my pull list at my local comic shop.
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.600]   This is a company that will put out
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:05.320]   a biographical comic book about everybody.
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:08.800]   So every political figure, every day of Charlie Sheen comic
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.720]   coming out, they have a comic book about the person who
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:13.520]   invented Barbie.
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:17.400]   And I'm really curious to see what kind of intellectual property
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:18.840]   lawyers they have working for them,
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:21.840]   because the Barbie comic has a picture of Barbie on it.
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:24.920]   The Steve Jobs comic has a picture of Steve Jobs on it.
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:28.360]   People have tried to use Steve Jobs's image in a way
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.520]   that they didn't really work that well.
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:33.160]   Everybody remembers that really super awesome, cool action
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:36.200]   figure that someone made and managed to sell 400 of it
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:38.680]   before Apple put the fear of God into them.
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:40.720]   So I'm wondering if this isn't just
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:42.280]   like the apartment building, just like Nokia.
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:44.520]   All we have to do is see how much they're going to pay us
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:46.160]   for us to not publish this comic book.
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:49.200]   And we can retire very healthy men and women.
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:49.960]   It's hard to say.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.360]   I mean, it's from a literary point of view.
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:52.680]   I think it's one thing to make a little thing.
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:53.600]   But I think when you write a book,
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.760]   I think there's going to be some freedom press issues.
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:56.320]   We won't see--
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:58.400]   They said the Mark Zuckerberg comic too, right?
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:59.520]   Oh, did they?
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:00.040]   I believe so.
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:01.040]   Yeah, they did.
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:03.920]   If you go to their site, they put out
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:06.680]   like 18 of these every single month.
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:09.640]   The art is not particularly good.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:11.160]   The writing is fairly linear.
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.240]   And I think they've only recently switched from comic
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.680]   stands for the lettering.
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:16.120]   No.
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:18.840]   We're not talking about Neil Adams based on Mark
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:19.800]   Mallar script here.
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:26.160]   You're probably not going to see any insights in this one.
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:28.440]   I'm guessing that the Wikipedia page on Steve Jobs
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:31.040]   will be well represented in this comic.
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:33.600]   What do you think now we're going to see in this one?
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.600]   This won't be out till March, by the way,
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:39.480]   is already selling like hotcakes in pre-order.
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:42.080]   I, Steve, the book of Jobs.
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:44.440]   I don't think you really should be allowed to have two puns
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:45.600]   in one title.
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.800]   Man.
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:47.840]   That's a lot of puns.
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:48.840]   You're right.
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:53.280]   I think they've overloaded the title just a slightest bit.
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:55.680]   Did I come from the Tom Merritt School of puns?
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:57.760]   And that's a lot of puns for me.
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:00.280]   You know where have you speak?
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:02.560]   It's about 1/100 of resultsmen.
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.280]   It's like one mic resultsmen.
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:07.280]   As far as pun content on that cover.
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:09.360]   Walter Isaacson will write.
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:10.760]   He's a well-known historian.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:11.920]   This is his first--
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:14.960]   He did that really great biography of Albert Einstein.
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:15.440]   That's right.
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:21.400]   And he's the serious biographer whose biography is really
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:23.840]   entered to the historical record.
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:26.280]   It's not like one of these tell-all books about the Octomom
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:28.560]   that comes up three weeks after the National Enquire headline.
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.640]   CEO of the Aspen Institute.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.920]   He--
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:34.560]   Former editor-in-chief of Newsweek was it?
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.000]   Yeah.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.520]   And he's done biographies of Kissinger, Franklin,
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:38.640]   and as you said Einstein.
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.520]   So this guy is pretty heavy duty.
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:43.680]   But you got to wonder is this going to be as told to Walter
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:44.160]   Isaacson?
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:46.920]   How is it-- it is the official biography.
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:49.320]   So I presume Steve will have some input into it.
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:51.440]   Is it official or authorized?
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:52.440]   It's authorized.
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:52.960]   Yeah.
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:54.400]   So there's a difference?
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:54.960]   There's a subtle difference.
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:55.920]   And it's a biography.
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:56.640]   So it's not--
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:57.160]   Autobiography.
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.160]   Autobiography.
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:58.680]   Right.
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:01.240]   So I think we can all expect it to--
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:02.920]   if it's Isaacson, it means that it's not
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:06.200]   going to be a as dictated to job.
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:07.920]   But it's going to rely pretty heavily
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.640]   on what they can get access to and what Steve is going to tell
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:11.160]   them.
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:13.240]   So it's going to be a definitive biography.
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:15.080]   But we're still going to have to wait for another five or 10
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:17.720]   years before we really have the freedom to see
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:18.560]   the entire story.
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:22.240]   But it's truly going to be a must read.
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:24.000]   I already pre-ordered my copy.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:24.500]   Yeah.
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:25.760]   It's just I found out about it.
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:26.720]   It's a best seller.
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:27.280]   Yeah.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:27.760]   On Amazon.
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:30.080]   I'm going to find out who's going to read the book.
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:32.440]   Who's going to do the audio?
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:33.840]   I'll do it.
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:35.240]   Amazon.
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:37.520]   Audible and I have been looking for a title to read.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:38.480]   That would be great.
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:38.920]   Yeah.
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:39.320]   I'll do it.
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:40.160]   You should do that.
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:42.600]   I'll read it like this.
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:44.800]   And then I totally all apart.
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.680]   He should never come into my door,
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:49.040]   he's knocking my door again.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:50.880]   It's written by the old prospector.
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.080]   No prospector.
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:52.600]   Yeah.
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:53.760]   Who could you look out for?
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.400]   You know what's called for poo-froes.
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:56.400]   Yeah.
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.240]   Yeah.
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:00.040]   Until you're born, who'd pack it for a free part for a free
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:00.840]   what you calculated.
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:03.000]   Actually, I want to ask you guys because Audible,
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.120]   I would have to read it in the next two weeks,
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:07.920]   asked me to do a book for them.
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:12.720]   On the Double Helix, it's James Watson's biography about,
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:17.960]   memoir about discovering the keys to life.
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:18.600]   What do you think?
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:19.560]   He's to life.
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:20.160]   What does that mean?
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:23.040]   Well, he discovered the structure of the art of the nouns.
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:23.880]   Oh, that's great.
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:26.080]   Yeah, the Double Helix.
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.800]   I think it'd be kind of fun.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:31.200]   Salzer properly reflects how it was God who created the helix
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:35.520]   to begin with and created in Watson and Crick the intelligence
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:40.000]   to discover and uncover God's methods in creating DNA.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.560]   I'll be sure to add that.
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:42.680]   I don't think you're in.
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:45.120]   I can still continue to work on these podcasts.
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:45.520]   I'll do that.
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:47.680]   There was a footnote, OK?
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:49.840]   By the way, Veronica, do you press a button or something?
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:52.200]   I think that every-- I had random issues, select sentences,
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:55.680]   to just say in like in a sarcastic mocking tone,
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:59.040]   just be reading it completely straight, completely OK.
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:05.160]   And then suddenly say, but in day of 1938,
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:10.880]   there were no cars available for sale in Michigan.
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:13.800]   You can just go because of gas rationing.
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:16.440]   So no, you just all of a sudden, you're
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.760]   anamorphic of Veronica.
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:19.920]   I didn't do anything.
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:20.280]   Wow.
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.800]   See, I don't have to squeeze you anymore.
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:24.920]   I look OK on my end.
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:25.760]   I was so confused.
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:26.160]   No, definitely.
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:28.120]   And now you look-- yeah, you look normal now and squeezed.
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:28.800]   Oh.
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:29.320]   Wow.
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:30.560]   Was I squeezing you unnecessarily?
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:31.040]   You're running a--
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:32.040]   Don't squeeze this arm in.
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:33.440]   I had her like that.
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:34.800]   And all of a sudden.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.640]   And this is the point which Mr. Rope are hearing.
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:37.760]   He's squeezing her.
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:39.400]   And that was against the sinner.
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:40.800]   Oh, go back to the three-by-four.
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:41.400]   That makes me look--
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:42.600]   It's getting a lot better.
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:44.920]   I think they're running a badger game.
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:46.320]   Come on, knock on my door.
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:47.680]   I could do that one.
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:49.600]   Apple, according to the economists--
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:52.640]   yeah, now she's going to launch into it.
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:53.560]   No, I'm done now.
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:57.040]   According to the economists-- by the way, this week, IBM
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:00.520]   will celebrate its 100th anniversary.
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:02.480]   And according to the economist, Apple
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:04.320]   can expect to do the same.
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:08.480]   In fact, here's Leander Kaney put a great picture in his cult
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:12.960]   of Mac blog of Steve Jobs, pointing at the IBM logo
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:15.600]   in the late '70s.
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:18.400]   So the economists took a look at what other high tech companies
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:19.680]   might survive 100 years.
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:23.120]   You know who didn't?
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:25.280]   Microsoft.
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.800]   Yeah, but I just agreed with one thing.
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:30.400]   They said they had only one great idea, and that was Windows.
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.760]   But Xbox has been doing well for them.
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:33.920]   No kidding.
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:36.000]   So I don't really take that as a point.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.160]   I think they'll probably still be around.
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:40.800]   They got enough money to fund themselves that long, right?
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:43.200]   Also, when you're one idea is the OS that
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.560]   runs 90% of the computers on the planet.
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:45.080]   Exactly.
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:45.600]   Exactly.
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.720]   I think your company's got a few legs there.
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:50.240]   One of the reasons IBM survived is because they have
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:52.920]   a lot of patents that are still good.
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:54.440]   And that's very valuable.
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:55.720]   And Microsoft has a lot of patents.
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:56.720]   They don't last 100 years.
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:59.840]   They'll have to keep making them or acquiring them.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:02.360]   They said Google is a little sketchy, built on a good idea
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:08.240]   about how long can search and add a search succeed.
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:10.840]   They do say Facebook and Amazon are a good shot
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:13.280]   at the Sentry Mark.
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:15.000]   I think it's an interesting article.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.720]   But of course, who knows?
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:18.160]   Who can tell?
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:20.000]   Now you're unstretched.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.440]   Did you do something again?
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:23.440]   I swear I'm not touching anything.
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:25.680]   Now I do squeeze you.
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:27.680]   Maybe it's us.
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:29.600]   Now I have to squeeze you again.
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:30.480]   See?
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:31.400]   She was for a while.
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:32.280]   She was fat.
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:33.440]   Now she's thin.
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.320]   Hey.
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:35.280]   I mean, just your picture.
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:36.720]   You're always skinny.
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:37.600]   Not skinny.
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:38.800]   Slim.
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:39.800]   Slender.
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:40.400]   Slender.
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.320]   Skinny's a bad word.
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:42.320]   Slim is a good word.
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.240]   It's the same.
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:44.600]   I don't know whether it's the animal.
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:47.320]   You got the horizontal stripes plus the anamorphic distort.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:47.960]   I know.
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:48.680]   I know.
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:51.480]   That's a double optical illusion.
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:51.840]   I don't know.
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:54.200]   Maybe my camera's getting tired.
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:57.400]   Apple costs $1.3 billion--
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:02.600]   or spends $1.3 billion a year to run iTunes.
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:04.000]   And we've talked before about it.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.000]   It's barely profitable.
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.040]   Now I can understand why.
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.040]   Content margin by month.
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:15.040]   This graph comes to us from a simko curated market
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:17.520]   intelligence.
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:19.200]   And it's-- I don't know what it means.
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:21.560]   Andy, would you explain?
[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:22.640]   I have not read this chart.
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:23.520]   I don't understand it.
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:23.520]   OK.
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:24.680]   I'm not talking about it.
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:28.920]   So the blue is the song gross margin.
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:31.280]   There's a big groundhog outside this.
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:32.360]   Squirrels.
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:34.640]   So it starts on the left of 2004,
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:37.200]   the beginning of the iTunes store and goes to current times.
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:38.840]   The one's the place is how we're sitting.
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:39.360]   I'm sorry.
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:43.160]   So the margin, the gross margin on songs on the blue axis--
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:44.800]   look at apps, the red axis.
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:46.040]   Whoa.
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:48.040]   Apps the gross margin has--
[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:50.600]   in just a couple of years already,
[01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:54.760]   much exceeded the gross margin for music.
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:58.680]   Here's the monthly content margin as it goes up, up, up.
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:03.960]   But most of that cost $1.3 billion a year, which
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:07.960]   has been deduced from this graph--
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:12.360]   $113 million a month-- goes to serving the content,
[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:13.880]   traffic and payment processing.
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:16.160]   They use Akamai, which is quite pricey.
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:18.800]   So I wonder how that's going to go once they factor
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:22.560]   in the iCloud money.
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:23.200]   Well, that's true.
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:24.880]   Now, I think that, of course, they've
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:27.400]   been building this North Carolina data center.
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:28.720]   So some of that money may actually
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:31.360]   be the North Carolina data center, maybe
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.520]   built, rolled into that.
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:37.000]   And speaking of fashions, an Apple engineer
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.200]   has rolled out some fashions made out of--
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.760]   I don't know if you'll like this or not, Veronica.
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:44.400]   Legos.
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.120]   Do you think I have a problem with Legos?
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:48.920]   No, well, I think you might like it because of that.
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:49.280]   I don't know.
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:50.800]   I love Legos.
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.120]   This is the difference.
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:54.000]   This is the difference engine in Lego.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:59.120]   2,000 Lego parts.
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:01.720]   I don't know why they said fashion-- oh, I get it.
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:03.240]   Fashions.
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:05.040]   See, I thought it was about fashion.
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:07.740]   But in fact, Wired Magazine's using
[01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:10.080]   those fashion as a forib.
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:10.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:14.320]   Apple engineer fashions computer out of Legos.
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:14.520]   It is the--
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:16.680]   I actually have a Lego bracelet speaking of Legos in fashion.
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:17.600]   Do you really?
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:18.560]   I do.
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.840]   I like Legos.
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:22.760]   From a designer named Amiko.
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:24.360]   What did you think of the Lego star?
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.160]   Well, we should talk a little bit about E3 since you're here.
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:29.000]   What do you think about the Lego Star Wars game?
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.440]   All the Lego games are always awesome, so--
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:31.940]   Yeah.
[01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:33.040]   Did you like Connect?
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:35.000]   Now, I got to say, you work for Sony.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.400]   I can't talk about Connect.
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:38.360]   So you can't talk about-- you can't even review it.
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:41.440]   You can't even say, oh, that Star Wars game on Connect
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:42.280]   was super lame.
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:43.720]   You can't say that.
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:45.480]   I like Dance Central.
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:46.720]   That's all I'll say.
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:47.360]   Died you two.
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:49.200]   And they showed Dance Central too.
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:52.320]   And now, both of us could play.
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:52.820]   Yes.
[01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:53.960]   While we carry Okey.
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:54.440]   Dance through.
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:55.480]   Yeah.
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:56.160]   They had a dance.
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:57.800]   What's happens on the road will do carry Okey
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:59.120]   and Dance Central?
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:01.560]   It's Fradik Adleo, the Sogadance team.
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:04.800]   It's a great game.
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:07.520]   I guess you kind of have to recuse yourself, don't you?
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:08.520]   Little bit.
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.480]   Yeah.
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:09.980]   I am seeing--
[01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:10.760]   I saw some great games.
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:12.440]   So I can talk about titles, game titles
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:14.160]   that I really enjoyed, that Okey platform.
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:15.640]   Please.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:17.000]   Bioshock Infinite looks awesome.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.000]   Yeah, you can't wait.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.880]   3, Battlefield 3, Elder Scrolls 5, Skyrim.
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:23.120]   Looks unbelievable.
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:23.840]   Do you come down--
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:24.400]   Which one?
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:26.840]   --on the Battlefield 3 versus Modern Warfare 3.
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:28.360]   Which side do you come down on that?
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:31.000]   Well, I didn't get a demo of Battlefield 3, unfortunately.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.760]   And I did of Modern Warfare 3.
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:34.920]   So I'm leaning towards Modern Warfare 3 only
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:37.240]   because that's the one I've seen the most of so far.
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:39.120]   And it looks stellar.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:42.280]   But I think the gameplay options of Battlefield 3
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:44.760]   and the different kinds of vehicles and weapons you can use,
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:48.120]   I think that's going to stick a much needed needle
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:50.760]   into the arm of first person shooters.
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:52.280]   Shot of adrenaline right to the heart.
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:54.160]   Speak of needles in the arm.
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:56.600]   Did you read the review of Duke Nukem Forever?
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:59.120]   Well, not good.
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:00.760]   You know, we wait 10 years for this game.
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:02.960]   It sounds horrible.
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:06.360]   Sexist, scatological.
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:09.240]   We covered it for core, but I wasn't the host on that one.
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:12.520]   It was our Audrey Cleo, who works down in LA
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:15.120]   and does most of our entertainment and Blu-ray stuff.
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:16.320]   She went to the shoot for that one.
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:19.440]   So I hadn't seen it until I started seeing it at E3
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:22.000]   and started seeing the reviews coming up.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.800]   A little concerned.
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:25.160]   A little concerned.
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:27.200]   I've heard a pretty bad--
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:29.200]   Pretty bad things about the storyline.
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:30.680]   But wait and see, I guess.
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:33.080]   I can't make a judgment until I've played it myself.
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:36.480]   A lot of penis jokes, a lot of bathroom humor.
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:38.160]   And then I think the worst indictment,
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.800]   gameplay doesn't sound very good.
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:42.640]   It's basically you're on a track.
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:43.000]   Right.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:43.320]   I know.
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:45.080]   It was more open world in the original one.
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:45.080]   Yeah.
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:46.640]   You got to do a lot of exploring.
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:48.560]   That was what was so cool.
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:49.560]   Yeah.
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.520]   Not the case this time.
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:53.200]   Yeah.
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:56.040]   I think the problem with there was that it's
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:58.360]   been so stripped of its original context,
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:02.240]   where back when it was new, there
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:06.160]   were things you would accept about the character, even though
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:08.560]   if you were to look at it fresh, you'd realize, oh, man,
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:12.240]   we're really going back here with this sort of topic anymore.
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:14.240]   So I think that at the time they could have gotten away
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:15.960]   with this as simply the next version.
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:18.560]   It's sort of like a new season of Family Guy, where you're like,
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:19.800]   OK, it's poorly written.
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:20.520]   There's no plot.
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:21.280]   There's no story.
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:22.960]   They spend most of their time just running
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:23.520]   around in circles.
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:26.480]   And any time they can make something come out of some orifice
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:28.880]   or have someone beat the upside of somebody else,
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:29.840]   it's going to happen.
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:33.000]   If the show went away for 10 years, then came back.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.400]   And you're suddenly used to not seeing that kind of show.
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:38.480]   It seems doubly or triply even worse.
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:39.000]   Yeah.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.520]   I don't even want to-- at some point,
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:43.000]   at some point, is these properties more valuable?
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.520]   I mean, this seriously, isn't it more profitable as a write-off
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:49.680]   than as an actual working product, where they can simply
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:53.280]   use that loss to offset their tax liabilities
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:55.360]   for other properties that they're developing?
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:56.280]   Well, it's like--
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:58.080]   the history of the genesis of this program, too,
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:00.880]   is part of the problem, which is people got worked on it
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:03.400]   for a while, got fired, and got transferred around.
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:05.120]   I mean, it's not-- it doesn't bode well,
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.440]   but that's a little disappointing.
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:08.520]   I liked the original two days.
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:09.200]   A lot.
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:13.200]   And it's funny, because when we went to cover it,
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:16.360]   we were allowed to go in with a camera and look at it.
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:18.320]   But they said, you can't take your microphones in.
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:20.280]   We don't want any commentary.
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.280]   Mm.
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:21.800]   Mm.
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:24.560]   Telling.
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:25.160]   Let's take a break.
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:27.880]   When we come back, our picks over the week.
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:30.160]   Your favorite hardware or software of Veronica,
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:31.760]   you may recuse yourself.
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:33.520]   But if you've got something you like,
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:34.840]   we'd like to hear about it.
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:35.560]   Oh, yeah, I have.
[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:36.240]   I can talk about that stuff.
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:37.720]   It just has to be a Mac thing.
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:39.800]   That's all we ask.
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:40.360]   They're probably--
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:42.040]   Just all we ask is a Mac thing.
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:43.640]   And you know what I'm going to talk about right now.
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:44.600]   I'm very happy to do so.
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:47.600]   And by the way, why got to find a picture of this?
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:48.560]   Smile software.
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.720]   We love them, of course.
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:53.080]   I've been a big tech expander user for years,
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:56.240]   and I've discovered this fantastic PDF pen, which
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:00.680]   is a must have right now for me on the Macintosh.
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:01.840]   You can get it at the App Store.
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:08.760]   You can get it from Smile software directly at smilesoftware.com/macbreak.
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:10.560]   In fact, if you would do us a little favor,
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:13.000]   go to smilesoftware.com/macbreak
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.880]   so that we get a little credit for you checking it out.
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:17.360]   And you can buy it anywhere you want.
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:20.280]   They know that when you buy it on the App Store,
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:22.880]   you bought it because of us.
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:24.200]   I want to talk about it in just a second.
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:27.760]   But first, let me find what the smile people did that
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:29.600]   makes me so happy.
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:34.880]   Gene McDonald over there ordered a brick with the Smile software
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:35.840]   logo on it.
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:36.680]   I'm so happy.
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:38.080]   This is our brick.
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:40.640]   It's going to be on the wall of the brick house.
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:42.400]   And I'm really thank you, Gene, for doing that.
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:43.720]   That's just awesome.
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:46.200]   And that's one of the features we offer on the bricks,
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:47.720]   by the way, at bricks.twit.tv.
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:50.920]   You can get an 8x8 brick, one of the larger bricks,
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:53.160]   with your company logo on it.
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:55.200]   But let me talk a little bit about PDF Pen Pro,
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:58.800]   because this is-- and PDF Pen, this is a fantastic program
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:01.800]   that lets you open PDFs and edit them,
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:04.320]   make changes without going back to the original document.
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:06.240]   It has optical character recognition, too,
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:08.160]   so you can get the text out of a PDF.
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:10.520]   You know, PDF is really just an image.
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:13.480]   So you need OCR if you want to get to the text.
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:15.920]   You can also add text, images, signatures.
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:17.040]   And I do that all the time.
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.920]   You have a library, and I have the signatures
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:20.360]   of my whole family in there.
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:22.200]   So I can paste them in.
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:24.480]   Which really is very handy.
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:27.600]   You can redact information as well.
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.680]   So if you want to pass along a PDF,
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:32.520]   but black out something-- and actually black it out,
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:34.360]   by the way.
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:37.240]   There are ways to do it with the other programs that, in fact,
[01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:39.560]   people can see what was underneath.
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:41.240]   It is just-- if you deal with PDFs,
[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:44.600]   if you're in the business, where
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:48.720]   you do a lot of contracts, a lot of realtors, use this,
[01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:50.120]   anytime you deal with PDFs.
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:52.560]   I do it just because I have to fill out forms for my kids
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:53.840]   for camping, all that stuff.
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:56.120]   Winner of the Macworld Editors Choice Award,
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:57.200]   a couple of years back.
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:58.160]   It's gotten better and better.
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:04.680]   PDF pen, $59.95, PDF pen pro, $99.95.
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:05.880]   But you could try before you buy it.
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:07.520]   I think you will absolutely like it.
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:09.240]   Smile does the best Mac software.
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:10.360]   They're just the nicest people.
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:11.720]   They really are.
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:13.400]   This is how I want a company to be.
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:16.600]   They're members of the community.
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:18.640]   They really participate in the Mac community.
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:21.440]   They're party at Macworld Expo every year.
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:23.720]   You see Gene everywhere.
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:25.680]   And they're just really the nicest people.
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:31.400]   Smile software.com/macbreak.
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:32.960]   Why do they also check out Text Expander,
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:34.560]   which is another great program.
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:36.960]   I cannot live with that.
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:37.760]   Get the free trial.
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:39.800]   You'll see how useful this is.
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:43.080]   Welcome, Macbreak Weekly audience.
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:49.200]   PDF pen, about a tenth the cost of Acrobat Pro, and it does more.
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:52.640]   All right, time for our picks of the week.
[01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:55.560]   And I think we'll give Veronica a little more time to thank.
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:57.840]   Well, I get Alex.
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:00.160]   Well, let's start from left to right.
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:01.480]   Andy and not go.
[01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:03.360]   Your pick of the week, sir.
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.200]   My pick of the week, he said.
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:07.640]   The look he's rolling through for it.
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:10.680]   It's a really cool-- it's an iOS app.
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:12.680]   And now we're going to use the high tech zoom
[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:17.000]   into the middle thing feature of the studio.
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:21.120]   Roger Ebert for a number of years has been doing another set
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:23.840]   of reviews alongside his regular weekly reviews
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:25.120]   and new movies.
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:30.000]   Because a lot of Casablanca came out about 30 or 40 years
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.840]   before he started reviewing movies.
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:34.640]   So he does the series called The Great Movies,
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:37.920]   usually referring to movies that are really wonderful
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:40.240]   and absolutely recommendable that he may not
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:41.120]   have reviewed the first time.
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:44.240]   Sometimes he even goes back and takes movies like Goodfellas
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:45.400]   that he just absolutely loved.
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:46.720]   He did review that the first time.
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:49.360]   But he wants to put that in the series.
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:51.160]   Because he reviews so many movies,
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:53.160]   if you really want to see the cream of the cream,
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:54.920]   the movies you really have to see,
[01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:57.880]   you really want to go to The Great Movies
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:01.120]   list on Roger Ebert.com or buy one of his great movies book.
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:04.240]   And now there is a great movies app for iPhone.
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:05.680]   Not available for iPad yet.
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:08.960]   But it is a single app that will list alphabetically
[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:12.040]   every single one of the great movies that he's reviewed.
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:14.480]   Here's Amercord.
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:16.880]   It will give you the full review.
[01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:19.520]   There you go.
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:20.680]   - That's cool.
[01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:24.520]   - The full review also including media and pictures.
[01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:26.680]   Also, if you look in the very, very bottom here,
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:29.040]   there are a couple of really nice features.
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:31.800]   I don't think you can zoom in close to what we got right now.
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:33.120]   But oh wait, here you go.
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.320]   At the very, very bottom,
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:35.480]   there are a couple of really cool buttons.
[01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:36.760]   If you can just simply say,
[01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:38.800]   click the spot and it says, "Want to see it."
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:42.080]   And it will be added to a list of movies that you've selected.
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:44.600]   This is on my personal want list.
[01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:45.920]   You can also send these.
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:48.360]   You can also have the export button.
[01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:51.560]   We'll let you go to RogerEbert.com and read the full review.
[01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:54.240]   There are links to adding it to your Netflix queue.
[01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:56.040]   I recommend it on Twitter and Instagram,
[01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:57.960]   buying it on Amazon.
[01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:00.200]   It's just the sort of thing where you wind up.
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:02.520]   I've seen so many of these movies,
[01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:04.280]   but just going through this app,
[01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:05.400]   just made me want to say,
[01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:08.640]   "Oh, I've never actually seen the Appu Trilogy."
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:10.760]   Now I actually have something that is adding to my list
[01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:12.000]   to make sure that I get to see it.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.320]   Plus now it's actually,
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:17.160]   now I've actually found the resources that I can actually,
[01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:19.640]   instead of just seeing it someday,
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:21.560]   I've actually got it in my list and in my queue
[01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:23.480]   so I can see it completely.
[01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:25.360]   So it's a really cool app because
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:31.520]   curation is a topic that's widely talked about
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:35.200]   when it comes to the best ways of managing lists
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:36.960]   and managing stores.
[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:38.600]   And if you're looking for movies,
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:41.080]   there is no greater curator of a movie library
[01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:42.040]   than Roger Ebert.
[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:46.120]   If you only movies you ever see are Roger Ebert's great movies,
[01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:48.080]   that's really all you ever need to see.
[01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:49.600]   - I agree. - You don't have to see
[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:50.720]   Mr. Popper's Penguins.
[01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:53.200]   Just get the Fargo, Fauce, the Fireman's Ball,
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:55.280]   Fizz Corraldo, five easy pieces floating wings,
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:56.960]   Forbidden Games, Gates of Heaven,
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:32:58.560]   the General, the Godfather, Godfather.
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:00.040]   Just looking through this, it's like, "Damn it,
[01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:01.640]   "seen it, seen it, seen it, seen it, seen it,
[01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:02.960]   "seen it, see it, need to see it, need to see it,
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:03.460]   "seen it, see it, need to see it, need to see it,
[01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:05.120]   "oh, I've never seen the grips of wath wrath wrath.
[01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:06.960]   "How come I've never seen that?"
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:10.720]   It's a buck 99, but it's worth a buck 99.
[01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:11.560]   - Absolutely.
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:13.640]   And I just want to give it to Roger
[01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:15.440]   'cause I love him so much.
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:16.280]   Oh, you know?
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:17.120]   He's just great.
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:17.960]   - Yeah.
[01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:20.280]   - I wonder if there should almost be like another button
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:22.760]   that says, "Just give the guy an extra 20."
[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:23.760]   (laughing)
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:25.080]   - Exactly.
[01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:25.920]   - You know.
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:26.760]   - Exactly.
[01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:27.960]   - And by the way, if you're listening to this
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:32.360]   and you somehow have not fallen into the follow Roger
[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:35.000]   on Twitter trap, you really should.
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.280]   'Cause it's, he's prolific.
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:40.760]   And there are just so many great links and so many.
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:42.760]   And it's not just about movies, just about all kinds of stuff.
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:44.000]   He just, he does it really well.
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.040]   So I would highly suggest, I want him to.
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:47.480]   - Agreed.
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:49.560]   Alex, you're pick of the week.
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:51.840]   - So I have the occasion on the eat to take,
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:56.120]   to get stuff off of YouTube and save it
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:58.960]   and convert it into things that I can't do that.
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:33:59.800]   - That I eat to use.
[01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:00.800]   - No, you're not allowed to.
[01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:02.240]   I'm sorry.
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:03.400]   - Yeah, well, so if you--
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:04.520]   - I'm not gonna get into so much.
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:06.440]   - There's a grease monkey.
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:09.320]   There's think code keeptube.com
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:12.200]   and mixed with grease monkey on your Firefox.
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:13.440]   Of course, you can pull the movie out,
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:15.280]   but it's in whatever format it's in.
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:16.760]   And then you wanna convert it to something else.
[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:17.720]   And so I had to find something.
[01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:20.320]   And now I'm finding myself using this all the time.
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:23.800]   And that is called, it's Wonder Share's Video Converter.
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:26.280]   So this is about, I think it's about a $30 application.
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:27.280]   Are you using this?
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:28.600]   - No, in fact, I need it.
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:29.440]   Go ahead.
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:30.280]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:31.720]   So this is just a great little, remember we had,
[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:33.560]   what was the name of the app that went away?
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:34.400]   - Oh.
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:36.760]   - Monkey, what was it?
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:37.600]   Two.
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:38.440]   - You know that, yeah, I know what you mean.
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:40.880]   - The app socket or something.
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:41.720]   Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:42.640]   - So there's another one.
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:45.400]   This is, so video converter is just a general conversion.
[01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:46.240]   Remember the conversion?
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:47.080]   There was a conversion to all the stuff.
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:47.920]   - Yeah, so great.
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:48.760]   I know exactly what you're talking about.
[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:50.400]   - That anyway--
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:52.240]   - Visual Hub, thank you, chamron.
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:53.560]   - Visual Hub, right, Visual Hub.
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:55.600]   And so this is kind of, I don't know if it does everything
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:57.000]   the Visual Hub does, but it does all the things
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.320]   I needed from Visual Hub, which is that you can simply,
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:01.720]   you can set up, you know, this is how I want it to go out.
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:03.960]   You simply drag it on, you can grab a couple of them on,
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:05.600]   you can just throw it on there and it converts it.
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:08.400]   - No, it doesn't, it's not complicated, not expensive.
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:10.920]   It's not, you know, it just kind of sorts that out
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:11.760]   for you quickly.
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:12.600]   - How much?
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:13.440]   - They make a lot of other tools.
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:15.440]   It's like 30 dollars, you know, and it's--
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:18.680]   - No, I recommend a YouTube converter
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:20.200]   or you work with a phone converter.
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:21.200]   - A video converter.
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:23.640]   So it converts video from, and here's the important part,
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:25.760]   it converts them from the flash format
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:29.120]   to your iPhone, iPad, iPod, so on and so forth.
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:30.880]   And that's the number one thing that I needed was to be able
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:33.040]   to open that up and save it out quickly.
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:35.320]   And I just want to be able to drag and drop it and make it go.
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:36.320]   And it's really--
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:37.400]   - But it's not just flash.
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:39.040]   I mean, it's a lot of formats.
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:39.880]   - That's six.
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:40.720]   - It's a lot formats.
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:43.800]   It's basically sits on top, it'll convert,
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:46.960]   it'll like video hub, it converts many, many formats
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:48.720]   to many, many other formats.
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:50.440]   And it's called video converter.
[01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:51.520]   Oh, you have a different one?
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:56.080]   - Yeah, I don't want to, I don't want to throw a bushel
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:57.880]   on your glow.
[01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:02.880]   But when that other app up and went away,
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:05.560]   another group of people sort of jumped in
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:07.320]   and tried to create a replacement for it
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:09.360]   that was also free called VideoMonkey.
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:10.520]   Is there a difference between the app
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:12.080]   you're recommending in VideoMonkey?
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:13.160]   - I haven't used it so I don't know.
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:16.360]   - VideoMonkey.org even tries to be, I think,
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:21.360]   exactly like the way that Virtual Hub looks.
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:23.400]   - Yeah, I remember when they--
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:26.440]   - I guess I would say, I actually like video converter.
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:28.360]   What I will say is I like video converter better than--
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:30.960]   - There's actually an ad for video converter.
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:31.800]   - Is it?
[01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:32.640]   - It's funny right there.
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:33.840]   - Yeah, VideoMonkey.org.
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:34.680]   - Yeah.
[01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:38.000]   - And I also like FFmpegX, which is also free.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.080]   Both VideoMonkey and this and Visual Hub
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:44.320]   were front ends to FFmpeg, which is a command line tool.
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:48.200]   So really, I don't know if yours is though, Alex.
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:51.440]   - I actually don't know.
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:53.600]   What I know is that I look for a lot of things
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:54.920]   and I try to get it all working
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:57.080]   and I just found that--
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:36:57.920]   - This is the one.
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:00.960]   - This was something that just did a lot of useful things
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:03.040]   very quickly for what I needed.
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:04.280]   And it just converted a lot of videos
[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:05.360]   and they have a bunch of different versions.
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:08.800]   So you have a Ripper, converter Platinum, converter Pro,
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:10.920]   converter Ultimate, and converter Ultimate does
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:13.440]   just about everything you'd wanna do to a video.
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:19.360]   And so anyway, so I found myself,
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:21.640]   the reason I'm recommending it
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:23.480]   is that I found myself using it all the time.
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:25.560]   It was one of those things I downloaded
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:28.240]   and I was like, oh, I don't know if I should spend $30 on it.
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:31.000]   But I'm just finding myself doing it
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.920]   as this quick converter just constantly.
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:37.400]   And so anyway, so I'd suggest checking it out.
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:39.760]   The interface is much better than Visual Hub.
[01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:41.360]   (laughing)
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:42.360]   This is like, here's the thing,
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:44.120]   is this is something I could hand to somebody
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:45.560]   and just say go do this.
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:48.080]   And I set up the preference and then someone just drags it on
[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:49.280]   and it goes out the other end.
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:50.840]   And they drag it on and it goes out the other end.
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:52.240]   There's not a lot of little drop downs
[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:53.240]   and there's not a lot of figuring out.
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:55.720]   So if you just wanna convert files over
[01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:56.880]   and you don't wanna think about it,
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:59.480]   I found that this would be a great application to do that.
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:03.120]   - It's funny because I was going through this weekend
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:07.360]   or maybe earlier because now if you guys experience this,
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:11.080]   I had a video that I shot with my camera,
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:13.800]   my digital still camera, it was an MOV file.
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:17.160]   And I opened it in QuickTime Player 7 and trimmed it.
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:18.840]   You know how you can, if you have QuickTime Pro,
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:20.600]   you can trim it.
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:21.880]   And then I did two things.
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:25.920]   I saved it in place and then I saved it as.
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:27.560]   The save in place and I did this twice
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:29.120]   and it repeated it twice,
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:31.560]   ended up being unplayable by QuickTime.
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:34.600]   The save as worked fine but I munged it somehow.
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:36.360]   And so as a result, I have this file
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:37.880]   and I had thrown out the other ones.
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:39.520]   So I had this one file that I just couldn't play.
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:41.600]   It was the only copy of the video
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:43.000]   and I ended up having to,
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.560]   I downloaded every converter I could find,
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:45.400]   nothing could read it.
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:47.040]   It was just like a weird bug.
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:49.400]   - Yeah, once you hack the header,
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:54.160]   I mean, once there is a rare thing that happens
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:58.160]   with QuickTime that if you cut off a little bit of it,
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:38:59.000]   it's very easy to act.
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.320]   - That's what I did, I cut off the beginning
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:02.200]   and it must have deleted the header.
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:04.240]   - And there's no way back.
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:05.680]   - You wanna see the video?
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:06.520]   (laughing)
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:08.160]   - Like that we found, because we've had,
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:09.960]   we had somebody delete a big chunk of it.
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:12.120]   And the funny thing is it's still the same file size
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:14.200]   because it's just setting up that player.
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:15.920]   And there's a couple of little like,
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:18.280]   don't cross the beams kind of thing with.
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:20.760]   - And it should do that. - And that's one of them.
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:21.920]   - Seems like it shouldn't do it.
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:22.920]   So this is the video actually.
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:26.240]   I shot this when we were in LA for the E3 gaming show.
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:28.400]   This is the CEO of Twit, Lisa Kenssel,
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:30.800]   showing an amazing skill.
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:32.480]   I think she's part monkey.
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:34.080]   (laughing)
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:36.640]   She, I couldn't believe she could do this.
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:38.080]   Look at this, she's just swinging through the air
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:39.040]   on those rings.
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:41.040]   - She's training for American Ninja Warrior.
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:41.880]   - No idea.
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:42.720]   - Look at this.
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:43.560]   - Look at this.
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:45.240]   - She was actually a circus performer.
[01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:46.760]   - I mean, I couldn't, I was like,
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:50.760]   I can't believe I just saw that, fortunately.
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:52.240]   - I can't believe I just filmed.
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:53.360]   - I had the camera out.
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:55.680]   So I didn't miss it, but I was, I didn't want to lose it.
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:57.760]   So that's why I was looking at all these converters.
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:59.800]   And actually I kind of like this FFmpegX.
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:00.680]   It is free.
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:02.600]   It's pretty simple.
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:04.080]   It doesn't do a whole lot of stuff.
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:05.000]   You were nodding Veronica.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000]   You use that one or?
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.240]   - Yeah, we talk about that and use it
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:10.160]   and recommend it a lot on TEXALA.
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:11.560]   - Yeah, 'cause it's basically just a front end
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:15.200]   to a well-known, you know, Unix item.
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:18.720]   But it is your turn for your pick of the week.
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:19.560]   - My turn.
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:21.440]   This is something I've been using for a long time
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:23.440]   and it actually replaced another application
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:25.640]   that I was totally addicted to.
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:27.160]   I'm talking about Alfred.
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:28.000]   - Yay!
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.400]   I love Alfred!
[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:31.640]   - I feel like you, maybe I've covered this in the past.
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:32.480]   - Doesn't matter.
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:33.320]   Say it again.
[01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:34.560]   You can't say it enough.
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:36.040]   - I replaced it.
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:39.880]   I was using Quicksilver previously and now I'm on Alfred.
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:41.080]   I did buy the Powerpack,
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:42.760]   which is the additional features pack
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:44.240]   and it's totally worth it.
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:46.920]   - So it's not just an application launcher, of course,
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:50.160]   but you can also do it to find files within applications,
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:53.000]   search within applications, do Google searches,
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.760]   search on Wikipedia, and also do searches
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:58.280]   within websites that you can predefine.
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:01.640]   And you can also use it to play iTunes tracks
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:05.280]   and to do all sorts of crazy stuff on your system.
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:08.200]   It basically makes it so you almost never have to use your mouse.
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:09.400]   - Yep, I love it.
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:11.360]   - The Powerpack is definitely worth getting
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:13.080]   'cause then you have access to things
[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:16.680]   like you can do terminal commands by doing a little bracket
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:18.720]   and then you can type any terminal command.
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:20.280]   And Andy, you'll like this, or was it,
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:22.120]   and I think Andy was talking about fantastical.
[01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:23.640]   It now has fantastical support.
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:25.080]   Just came out with an update
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:27.160]   so that you can enter your calendar data,
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:28.880]   full sentences and so forth.
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:29.720]   - Yeah.
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:31.360]   - Just the command line, which is awesome.
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:32.800]   - I just learned about that recently,
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:34.560]   so I wanna test that out a little bit more.
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:37.120]   But I use it for the calculator features.
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:39.680]   I use it for spelling and for pulling up things
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:42.040]   on a Thesaurus or a dictionary.
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:45.120]   Once you figure out the tricks, just like Quicksilver really,
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:47.760]   once you figure out all the tricks and the little ins and outs,
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:49.600]   it becomes indispensable.
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:51.640]   And every time I get a new machine
[01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:53.520]   or I'm working on someone else's Mac,
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:55.880]   I forget that I don't have it installed on there
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:57.600]   and it'll be the first thing I put on
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:00.120]   or I just feel very, you know,
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:03.680]   like I'm not moving at a fast enough pace on the machine.
[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:05.640]   It definitely makes you work a lot faster.
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:06.480]   - I'm so with you.
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:09.320]   I was really pleased when these guys did this
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:11.640]   and it's a small company.
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:15.240]   - We've talked before about the husband and wife team
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:19.440]   who do this and then there's a great blog,
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:23.880]   a tumb log that has a lot of additional Alfred features
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:25.960]   'cause you can customize it like crazy.
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:28.840]   So it's Andrew, Pepperell and his wife, Arrow,
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:32.320]   and they do just such a good dime.
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:34.120]   - Yeah, you can't skin it the same way
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:35.320]   you can skin Quicksilver,
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:37.000]   but you don't really need to, it looks great.
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.280]   - Well, you see I'm using the black version of it
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:40.360]   and you can take the hat off,
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:41.920]   but who needs to really?
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:44.360]   You know, I mean, I could type somebody's name
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:46.240]   and I just find, you know,
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:47.560]   start an email to them and everything.
[01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:49.680]   And then if you go to the tumb log,
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:51.920]   Alfredtips.tumbler.com,
[01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:55.200]   you'll see this is so tweakable.
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:57.720]   Lots and lots of different features.
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:58.560]   - I agree with you.
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:00.120]   - Yeah, it's one of my favorite apps for sure.
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:00.960]   - Yeah, me too.
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:03.240]   I use it on all my Macs.
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:05.120]   And you'll be using it on your new MacBook Airs
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:05.980]   as soon as it comes out.
[01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:08.720]   I'm gonna be mad because I already bought mine.
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:10.480]   I feel so sad about losing my,
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:12.800]   well, I'm not gonna lose my MacBook Pro, my 13 inch,
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:16.320]   but it will be sad to give her a little rest for a while.
[01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:19.800]   But it's time, I think I carry around my laptop too much
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:20.800]   and it's getting to be,
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:22.520]   even going down to the 13 inch size,
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:24.760]   it's still too big, too heavy.
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:25.600]   - I'm with you.
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:27.400]   - Maybe I've become accustomed to my iPad.
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:30.280]   - No, it's a perfect kind of intermediate step
[01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:33.400]   between a real laptop and an iPad.
[01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:34.280]   And I think with the new one,
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:36.080]   if they have a Thunderbolt and all of that stuff,
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:37.960]   it'll be amazing.
[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:40.320]   Veronica is the host with my old pal,
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:41.840]   Mr. Patrick Norton of a great show.
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:43.000]   You'll find on revision three,
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:47.920]   TekzillaTEKZILA.com.
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:50.280]   They do it every week,
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:52.440]   but there's also daily Tekzilla updates.
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:53.560]   There's lots of information.
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:55.240]   It's really a great helping how to show.
[01:43:55.240 --> 01:43:56.840]   It's just got some style.
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:59.240]   - Yeah, we've got two episodes a week actually now.
[01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:02.480]   I do the Thursday, the show that comes out on Thursday
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:05.960]   and Robert Herron does the show that comes out on Tuesday,
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:06.800]   I believe.
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:09.520]   - Oh my God, that they've enlisted Robert into that.
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:11.560]   - Yeah. - Yeah, excellent.
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:13.800]   - So twice as much Tekzilla a week.
[01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:16.800]   - TEKZILA.com.
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:18.560]   I'm so glad you could join us, Veronica.
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:19.400]   Thank you.
[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:20.240]   - Thank you for having me, it was blast.
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:21.080]   - Really appreciate it.
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:23.360]   Of course, Andy Inatko is with the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:27.080]   His website is cwob.com.
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:31.480]   And you'll find him as a regular on Macbreak Weekly.
[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:32.800]   In fact, I know you sent me a note.
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:33.840]   There's a show you'd like to do.
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:35.000]   And I actually,
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:38.280]   I've started a bidding war for Andy Inatko's services.
[01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:40.320]   So we'll talk later.
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:41.320]   I have an ignore jury now.
[01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:42.320]   - We'll do an NBA style.
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:44.720]   - We'll escalate the escalates until I pick a winner.
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:46.320]   - So I've found a number of people
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:47.440]   who want to do a show with you.
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:49.320]   So I'll tell you about that in a little bit.
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:53.040]   Also want to thank our great friend Alex Lindsey
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:54.360]   for joining us from the Pixelcore.
[01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:56.600]   Pixelcore.com, if you'd like to join that 3D.
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:44:59.400]   - Finally, I get to hug this man at the end of his show.
[01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:00.240]   - Hug him.
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:01.160]   - The work he does for charity,
[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:02.880]   he doesn't want anybody to go above.
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:05.200]   - I'm gonna embarrass this man at his telephone.
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:07.960]   (laughing)
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:09.320]   - Pixelcore.com?
[01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:11.400]   - That sounds profoundly goddess to come together.
[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:13.360]   Bury the hatchet, the feud is on the phone.
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:15.520]   - It's a beautiful thing.
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:16.720]   - I never thought it would happen.
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:20.160]   - It's just a beautiful thing when two people make up like that.
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:22.480]   Boy Veronica, the picture quality on Texill.
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:24.120]   I'm just watching it is so clean.
[01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:26.440]   You guys are doing an HD, I can tell.
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:28.360]   How good. - Thank you.
[01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:29.440]   - Man.
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:31.000]   - It's all SSM paygax.
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.240]   - Is it really?
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:33.360]   - I believe we do use it.
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:35.680]   - Wow, that's cool.
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:36.800]   Thanks everybody for being here.
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:40.400]   We do Mac break weekly 11 a.m. Pacific every Tuesday.
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:42.240]   That's 2 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:44.840]   1,800 UTC at live.twit.tv.
[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:46.040]   If you wanna watch us live,
[01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:48.720]   if you can't watch us live or you missed a show,
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:51.200]   you can always go back and get all the episodes,
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:56.200]   all 251 of them at twit.tv.tv/mbw or of course on iTunes,
[01:45:56.200 --> 01:46:00.360]   or Zoom Marketplace or everywhere,
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:02.320]   better podcasts are stored.
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:04.240]   We have audio plus video versions
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:07.320]   of every episode up there.
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:08.080]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:09.480]   We'll see you next week.
[01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:10.560]   Get back to work.
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:11.680]   Break time is over.
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:14.260]   (upbeat music)
[01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:25.600]   I now have to look up, meet Loaf.
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:27.320]   Kara, okay.
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:30.240]   - I did, the only, the only karaoke I ever did was,
[01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:32.280]   somehow for some reason ended up with dire straights,
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:33.720]   walk of life, which is.
[01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:34.560]   (laughing)

[01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:38.720]   - I could sing a really hard song to think of all the words.
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:39.560]   That's all I have to say.
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:40.960]   - Well, they put it on the screen, no thing.
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:42.200]   Even when they put it on the screen,
[01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:45.000]   he's just, it's a run, it's one long run on sentence.
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.080]   It's not like a bunch of little verses.
[01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:49.640]   - I hate that when you think you know a song
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:51.120]   and then you get to the karaoke version,

[01:46:56.240 --> 01:46:57.640]   - Here you go, run again.
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:59.280]   - Here you go.

[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:26.480]   You can't do karaoke on Skype.
