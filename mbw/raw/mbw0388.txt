[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.120]   cover the latest from Microsoft with its guaranteed certificate of authenticity.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.480]   I'm Leo LaPorten on this Mac Break Weekly and we will not be giving you any MS
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.720]   DAS news. Although as we go to press, so to speak, Microsoft has finally
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.200]   announced after a six month talent search that all along we had him right
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.760]   here in our midst.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.120]   The new CEO of Microsoft's third and 30 years is such a nadela coming over
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.320]   from the business and enterprise and cloud group.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.760]   He will be assisted by Bill Gates who stepping down as chairman of Microsoft
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.920]   to become a visionary.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.480]   Either that or it's, you know, bye bye.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.080]   John Thompson, who headed the executive search, will assume a role as the new
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.960]   chairman of the board.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.720]   Both Gates and Balmer will keep their board seats at Microsoft.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.520]   For more information, please visit your local library.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.040]   No, for more information, we did a, we did a breaking news special on TNT this
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.120]   morning, really good special with contributions from Ed bot Paul
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.040]   Therat and many others.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.280]   So some really good analysis.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.880]   That is in the TNT feed, twit.tv/tnt.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.160]   It will be soon anyway if you're watching live.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.280]   Is it already up there?
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.600]   Wow. But it will be soon.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.640]   And we're also going to put it in the Twit specials feed because it really
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.360]   wasn't breaking news story.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.800]   Meanwhile, we're back to Apple and we've got a massive panel here starting,
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.040]   almost start all the way from the left and go all the way to the right here.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.760]   Starting on the left, it's Renee Richie of iMore.com.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.040]   And his brand new set.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.400]   Thank you for being on Twit this week.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.960]   You were great.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.360]   Oh, thank you for having me, Leo.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.000]   Yeah, I'm still in progress of building it out, but I'm getting there.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.560]   All the shelves are only filled up to what you can see on camera right now.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.880]   You've got two ICEOs there over your left shoulder, both the stuffed one from
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.080]   the throwboy and it looks like a bobblehead ICEO.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.960]   That's the one that came out of Hong Kong at Sketchy Place in Hong Kong.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.520]   It was the Steve Jobs ninja or the company.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.560]   No, but it's Steve Jobs.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.600]   It was the ninja action figure and you had to take the mask off after you unboxed it.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.480]   That was shut down.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.640]   We're almost right away, wasn't it?
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.360]   Yep.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.160]   I'm impressed.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.080]   Very few people have that.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.360]   Welcome, Renee, also here back from his travels.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.560]   It's so nice to have Alex Lindsey of the Pixel core here.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.360]   It's going to be back.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.680]   Make sure you watch Alex's interview on triangulation this week.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.320]   It was really fun.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.240]   It was not a fun hour with you and ask about stuff that we can't, you know,
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.360]   don't normally get to talk about.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.360]   So welcome.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.000]   Thank you for having me.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.320]   He was assembling something that arrived just moments ago.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.480]   I'm going to show it now.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.440]   Presumably your pick.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.800]   Yes.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.200]   Yes.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.360]   We'll save that for later.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.200]   Hey, also here from the big nerd ranch on I'm not insulting him.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.360]   That's actually where he's from.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.400]   The big nerd ranch, Aaron Heligas.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.120]   Always great to have you.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.040]   What brings you out here?
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.600]   Well, I'm just visiting for the Appworld conference.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.000]   Down to San Francisco.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.280]   There's an is it is it iOS app world or is it all at all apps?
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.440]   All apps because you do teach Android development.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.800]   We do Android and we do iOS.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.680]   We also do HTML JavaScript stuff.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.800]   It's very small.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.360]   Just ship the new objective.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.040]   See book the second edition.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.360]   Awesome.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.200]   So you should get that for beginners.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.360]   I just started the old one.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.080]   So now I got to do.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.960]   I have the new I.O.S.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.200]   book will be out in another month.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.600]   Awesome.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.680]   It's nice to have you.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.080]   I have lots of questions for you, including to talk about the Mac
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.920]   Pro and development and all of that.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.440]   But let's also introduce Andy and I go from the Chicago Sun
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.000]   Times rounding it out.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.960]   Who is that?
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.640]   That looks like Steve McQueen with a rather large gun in your
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.440]   Steve McQueen, basically making every person thinking, maybe I
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.240]   should have a gun if I looked at nice with boys.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.720]   He cool.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.920]   It was the king of theirs.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.600]   Even even even dying young.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.760]   He makes look cool.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.400]   Yes.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.360]   It's almost unfair.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.320]   Great to have you all.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.960]   I guess that brings I since we mentioned Steve McQueen and a
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.280]   great actor who passed away, we should probably nod to
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.520]   what a man many consider our greatest actor of the of his era.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.200]   Anyway, Philip Seymour Hoffman passed away at the age of 46 this
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.400]   week.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.280]   Very sad to lose him.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.240]   He was just incredible and a wonderful actor.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.320]   So it'd be appropriate to mention him.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.560]   I don't know if you used a Mac.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.680]   Incredible, incredible actor and such a loss.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.240]   He was so young.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.680]   Let's talk.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.400]   There he is.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.160]   Beautiful.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.280]   That's that's him in doubt where he played played the priest in one
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.440]   of his best performances.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.320]   But what what wasn't one of his best performance Magnolia?
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.040]   I think it's a performance in Magnolia.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.520]   It's incredible.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.920]   Brilliant.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.720]   And then he kind of reprise that a little bit in the master, which was
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.440]   his most one of his most recent films.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.240]   Phenomenal.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.720]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.960]   Well, and also and also Truman.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.800]   Yeah, everybody loves Capote.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.880]   Especially especially I'm sorry.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:23.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:23.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.400]   I go.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.160]   It's especially when you're throwing some guy the the challenge of
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.280]   here is a very, very iconic, classic looking guy who had a very, very lived
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.160]   his life in such an affected way that are you just going to do the voice
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.840]   and do the do the hand gestures?
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.560]   Are you really going to make him into a real character?
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.440]   And so yeah, I mean, he blew me away in Magnolia, but that's the movie where
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:44.640]   it's at.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.280]   OK, I'm going to now add a new name into the list of actors of which I
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.280]   make colossal fans play.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.240]   Lester Bangs and almost famous reminds us at our sex.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.560]   When you start going down his list, he made a lot of movies in his short
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.080]   career when start going in the list, they were all brilliant.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.000]   I saw him on Broadway in a long day's journey at the night and it was
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.800]   wrenching.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.880]   You go out of the theater, just drained.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.040]   And somebody said of him, that was why he didn't like doing live theater
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.240]   because he did that every night and it was just, you know, very, very
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.760]   draining.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.400]   Frosting.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.400]   Brilliant, great loss.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.120]   And, you know, of course, it's a drug overdose.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.280]   And that's what's really sad.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.720]   It was it was unnecessary.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:32.200]   But in happier news, Apple posts a manual work around for male problems
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:32.960]   in Mavericks.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.800]   Whoo hoo.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.720]   Yay.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.360]   I have I have work around.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:36.920]   I haven't update.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.280]   Update.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.760]   Yeah, don't update.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.120]   Holy cow.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.560]   Let me ask more to the point iOS seven, which really seems like a bug
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.080]   fest.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.360]   Seven one.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.160]   Have you been well, see, nobody who's been playing with seven one can talk about
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:48.280]   it.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.760]   Yes, you're at the aid.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.880]   Are we getting close?
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.320]   You beta today.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.520]   New beta today.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.160]   This was seven five five five.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.560]   No, five or six.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.280]   Five or six.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.760]   So how many do they typically do before they release the damn thing?
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.880]   Four to eight.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.400]   So they're in the ballpark.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.600]   Beta five just came out today.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.280]   They pushed out iOS seven point zero point five, but that was only to smartphone
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.200]   to iPhones outside North America.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.960]   And it really only addressed one small, a really important issue in China, which
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.200]   is an important market, but it didn't give the bug fixes that we so desperately
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.520]   need globally.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.880]   Do you, Aaron, when you when you are thinking about writing software, do you
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:35.440]   do you take specific versions of the iOS or any operating system into account
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.960]   and program around bugs?
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.240]   Oh, yeah, for sure.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.400]   I mean, you have to, especially backwards compatibility, a client will come to us and
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.720]   say this has to run on this version of iOS and we have to make sure that it
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.640]   always works backwards with this, including all the bugs.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.560]   And that's the most painful thing to do to write lots and lots of code just to
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.920]   compensate for something that you know has already been fixed.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:55.800]   Ask Microsoft.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.960]   That's all they did with Windows.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.520]   It's they're quite famous for it.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.320]   There's lines of code in Windows specific specifically for an individual
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.160]   piece of software to make sure it works with Windows.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:06.840]   Exactly right.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.480]   The amount of stuff you have to do to support legacy is insane, which is one
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.360]   reason Apple kills is very quick to kill older products.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.240]   Much quicker than most companies, definitely.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.360]   And it's a wonderful thing being able to.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.160]   Good for you.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.000]   It'd be so good for the guy who bought an iPad, which suddenly finds he can't use
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.640]   it anymore, even though it's three years old.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.680]   But Apple makes it really easy to upgrade these days.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:28.920]   Yeah, I mean, that's a wonderful thing.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.880]   It's easy.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.520]   But it does that.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.960]   I mean, it seems like it must help the developers a lot to know that the vast
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.240]   majority of users are upgrading quickly.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.120]   That's exactly right.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.680]   When a client comes to us and says we have to support this version of iOS, I can go
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.880]   back and say, let's look at the pie chart, how many people have already
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.600]   upgraded to the latest, and it's a huge number, especially on iOS.
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.440]   Not they don't upgrade as quickly on the Mac.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.040]   OK, yeah.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.760]   As a particularly big deal, when Apple introduces a new feature for the
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.240]   operating system that has to be supported by developers, it must be.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.360]   It must be a lot easier to make that sales point that, hey, I'm going to support
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.800]   this because it will immediately be drifting down into the majority of devices
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.400]   that are out there.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.400]   That's exactly right.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.800]   Especially when they roll out a big feature like, you know, a passbook or
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.240]   something.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.680]   And the client says, well, this is all based around the Passbook API.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.200]   There's no point in even talking about anything before that.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:18.640]   Right.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.040]   Right.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.160]   Being a Passbook health book is on the way apparently, according to rumors.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.880]   This would be something iOS 8 would have.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.840]   And it makes a lot of sense.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:31.160]   We heard earlier this week, according to the New York Times, that actually was
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:31.920]   an interesting story.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.360]   It wasn't New York Times had the mainstream story, but they got it from a blog.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:41.960]   There's a lawyer who spends some time parsing the FDA's public calendar
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.800]   and pays attention to all of that stuff.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.640]   Mark A McAndrew, he's a partner with the law firm Taft, Stettness and Hollister,
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:55.560]   was browsing the public calendars and noticed this the week of December 9th,
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:01.240]   high level Apple executives, including Bud Tribble, vice president of software,
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:09.800]   meeting with high level FDA, senior FDA directors in December to discuss.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.320]   It says mobile medical applications.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.120]   You tie that into this rumor about health book, which would be kind of like,
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.400]   I guess, Passbook for health.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.160]   That would be the kind of thing.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.600]   Now, the FDA weighs in if an app makes health recommendations.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.560]   So if an app says slow down, you're going too fast, got to make them more.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.120]   If they do that, then you have to get the FDA approval.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:37.320]   And it's probably prudent given how the FDA pretty much shut down 23 and me
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:43.400]   for not getting FDA approval on their genetic testing that Apple would do that
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.320]   but I was talking with Dr.
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.760]   Mom about this and she's a physician, a surgeon.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.840]   She also knows a little bit about FDA process.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.440]   She says they don't have this kind of meeting unless you have something to show them.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.840]   Right. This is not exploratory.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.080]   Hey, we're thinking of doing this.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.000]   What would you say?
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.680]   I mean, maybe Apple could have that kind of meeting, but more likely they were
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.480]   actually going.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.600]   There'd be no reason to bother.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.280]   I mean, you definitely have consultants and other people that can tell you how
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.920]   to get almost to the goal line.
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.440]   And it's a matter of once you get over it, really making sure that you're
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.600]   in that communication loop.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.040]   I have a theory that we should start a rumor based on.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.440]   OK, which is Apple is looking for new consumer devices.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:24.040]   Yes, I'm thinking a toilet based on the eye toilet.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.080]   They would make health recommendations like, Hey, Aaron, maybe you should be eating
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.320]   more leafy green vegetables.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.720]   More roughage, Aaron.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.280]   You're roughage.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.400]   You're killing me here.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.720]   Oh, boy.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.760]   Actually, that you know, me and my dad, but but but but Frank, well, I don't
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.920]   want to get too detailed here, but that probably would be a better metric.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.160]   That's just something on your wrist.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.280]   They're just having another joke.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.920]   You can't make the I just going through the list.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:54.320]   Now you have to get through seven eight to nine before that may be sort of OK to
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:54.800]   set it.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.680]   I'll just pass.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.280]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.400]   Ever since I bought that fancy toilet, I've been talking about my butt.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.200]   Wouldn't it wouldn't it be great to have that fancy toilet being controlled by your
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:03.760]   iPhone though?
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.800]   You're the guy who made me buy that fancy toilet.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.840]   I know I have it.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.800]   I have a fancy toilet, too.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.480]   Alex, Alex, you know, you can't you what they call that?
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.560]   They just call that the toilet.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.040]   The toilet.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.640]   Is this a total?
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.600]   It's a total wash.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.080]   Let's 500.
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.280]   When it's out of the way, you have a very clean fan.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.440]   Yeah, imagine actually mark.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.680]   I have a fancy toilet to for possible title.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.560]   Actually, it's not as thorough as I had hoped.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.920]   God, I don't want to talk about this.
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:36.920]   Alex Wager Alex Wager show fans wants to start all over again.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.640]   Back break weekly.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.880]   Great, big panel today.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.200]   I was going to start talking about technique, but I just felt like I should stay away from
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:44.720]   them.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.880]   Afterwards, let's you and me.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.520]   And his headphones just rushed off stage.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:59.000]   The FDA, the other thing that might be meeting with with the FDA would be a watch,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.760]   right?
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.680]   And this is, I think one thing that's pretty clear is that the health book is just a
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.280]   total rumor.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.800]   The watch, frankly, is a total rumor.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.160]   But as we get closer and closer to something happening, it does make sense that
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.920]   they, if they have a watch that, for instance, monitors health.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:18.080]   You would, I don't just did the jawbone up, have to get FDA approval.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:18.720]   I doubt it.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.920]   I think it depends on what they're claiming.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:26.480]   How much information that they give you or recommendations or so.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.080]   And the iPad used to be a rumor.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.360]   The iPhone used to be a rumor.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.120]   We're in one of those.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.640]   Wonderful times again.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.560]   Yeah, that good point.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:39.080]   You could also imagine some Ibicon, we can work with this as well, like places in the park.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:39.600]   Yes.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.440]   You'd be in the eye.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:40.920]   You'd be in the eye.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.840]   You'd be in the nose.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.360]   Look around you.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.280]   If nobody at the table is an Ibicon, then you're the Ibicon.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.080]   That's right.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.720]   You'd be the eye.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:55.400]   And that's one of the things we learned about iOS and Apple devices, every, every
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:02.320]   iPhone since the 4s, every iPad is an Ibicon is capable of beaconing as well.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.920]   Everything with Bluetooth 4.0.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:04.360]   Right.
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:08.200]   And there's a lot of things that you can measure pretty carefully when you start
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.080]   looking at the vibrations and movement and so on and so forth.
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:15.800]   Like, for instance, you could have a wrist, you know, a watch or something that when
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:20.360]   you're working out was keeping track of all your reps, you know, and, and, you know, it could
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.960]   easily, it could keep track of all of those things as you're going and just
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.280]   automatically input those into your documents and so on and so forth.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.920]   And I think that there's, you know, we're just barely scraping the surface of what's,
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.480]   you know, of what's possible.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.640]   Like when I walk into the gym now, you know, you, there's all these pieces of equipment
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.560]   that I don't know how to use and so I don't use them.
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:43.160]   So I have a very basic, you know, like, you know, like, you know, I, I, or I get, or I
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.920]   eventually get around to try and one new one every once in a while.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.880]   Um, but what if I was able to walk up and the Ibicon was able to show me, you know,
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.720]   how to use it and like the little video shows up on my iPhone and then I'm, and
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.720]   then it keeps track of all of my reps and, you know, all those things, but, but
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.480]   having that biometric connection and then if you look at people with health issues,
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.120]   you could be having something that's paying attention.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:05.240]   And this might, this is why you talk to the FDA is you have someone who has a
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.040]   heart condition and it is paying attention to your heart rate.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.520]   If your heart rate changes dramatically or does other things.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.160]   It sends an alert.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:13.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.800]   You know, at least alert you, if not alerts everybody or even as something as
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:22.040]   simple as if you have someone who is like a high risk sort of person, you can
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.880]   simply say, please send an alert if there is an unusual disruption in the
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.440]   level of activity in this person.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.720]   Uh, because you can watch someone's movements for our, for our day, day to day.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.920]   And you can realize that it is very, very unusual for the, for the
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.920]   day to be no motion off of this device from 2 p.m. until 5 p.m.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:42.280]   in the afternoon, which is not automatic 911 call, but it can be, okay,
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.680]   please contact this person and just have them call the device and try to see what's
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:45.920]   going on.
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.120]   Especially with the aging population.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:49.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:49.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:53.080]   We're at Wilson who's a venture capitalist, a principal of year and
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:57.800]   square ventures, and as a vested in a lot of, of the companies that we now
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:03.080]   consider, you know, stalwarts, uh, of Silicon Valley is very excited about the
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:03.480]   idea.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.040]   He says, we've been looking at this sector for a while.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.720]   One of the things that has kept us from making investments is the sense that all
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.240]   this data capture is soon going to happen in the phone itself.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.080]   Once that happens, things could change pretty rapidly.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.480]   The key he says will be API's.
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:23.720]   My big question is, is Apple going to give its users or developers more
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.000]   importantly and open API to send their health and fitness data to third parties.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.080]   They authorize they do it with the M seven already.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.840]   I mean, the M seven wasn't proprietary to Apple.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.720]   Fitbit can tie into it and Nike to tie into it.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.760]   And one of the things, I mean, these reports are really awesome and blood
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.720]   monitoring and hydration level monitoring are fantastic.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:44.560]   But I think also it's important to set the expectation that the iPhone, the
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:48.160]   original iPhone, the original iPad were great, but the iPhone, the iPad air and
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.880]   the iPhone four were fantastic.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.200]   And whatever we're going to get soon is not going to be as cool as what it's
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.760]   going to be when Apple actually gets all these technologies implemented.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.360]   I think I think it's going to be primarily motion sensor based.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.040]   So assume what we see actually see these things come out into real products.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.320]   And the other thing is that when it comes to making a better camera, that's
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.080]   something that's accessible to absolutely everybody.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:12.120]   When it comes to fingerprint authentication, that's again, a problem
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.000]   that everybody faces and everybody wants to solve.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.080]   There are a great many people for whom they don't really necessarily care that
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.480]   they would never use the health features of a phone and wouldn't really
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.200]   affect them at all.
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:26.360]   So it seems as though they're when it went as I've been reading these more
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:31.080]   specific reports, I keep asking myself the questions of what are the different
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:34.000]   ways in which Apple could want to put in make this feature happen.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   One of them would be that we want to see that there's there's a health
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.200]   enthusiast market that hasn't been tapped into right now.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.200]   And we're going to make it we're going to make a phone that is specifically
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.520]   pitched to be the best phone to have if you are a health enthusiast.
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.720]   There is the second way, which is that we feel as though we can get we can
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.440]   make this into an advantage for an aspirational purchase where people who
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.680]   feel as though they really should be able they really should be exercising
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.800]   more and moving more and hey, this of these two phones that I'm sort of half
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.760]   and half on, this one will help me keep a keep a healthier lifestyle.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.200]   But I think that as I was thinking this through this morning, I think the third
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.680]   one is really the truth of the matter.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:14.440]   I do think that this is an area in which Apple feels as though they can help
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.120]   improve the world by improving health.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.800]   And that this is a simple and elegant thing that they could put into the one
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.600]   the most popular handheld devices and pocket devices in the world.
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.160]   So I really don't think there's so much creating a new market or trying to
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.760]   create strategic advantage.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:32.040]   I really do think that inside Apple, they really do feel as though this is
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:36.480]   something that every device can be doing that would materially improve people's
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.000]   lives. We can do it.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:38.880]   So we are going to do it.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.520]   Yeah, it's like textbooks were two years ago, the whole textbook and I book
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:43.200]   author movement.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.320]   Yeah, but I will really didn't didn't reinvent textbooks.
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.040]   That's been a flop, I would say.
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.720]   It's aspirational inside Apple, like they believe deeply and education.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.920]   Let's make a difference.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.480]   Let's make stuff.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.160]   Yes, meaning that I don't believe that these if again, we're all assuming
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:01.480]   that this is all going forward, that if Apple puts the makes iOS eight into a
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.760]   very, very health centric operating system or at least the most aggressively
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.680]   health forward mobile operating system of the planet, I don't think that they
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:09.680]   would label it a failure.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.840]   If three years from now, they find out that only 18% of users are actually
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.840]   using those features and that nobody's expecting that.
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.200]   They're going to say that, wow, we've got 18% of the people who were not going
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.680]   to be exercising before are now exercising.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.720]   We consider that a win.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.600]   But I think it's going to be more than just motion.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.520]   I think we're going to see a whole lot of medical monitoring devices that have
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.240]   Bluetooth in them.
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:31.000]   And that's how we'll monitor blood glucose levels for you.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.080]   Yeah, you don't want to watch prick and you're feying every five minutes.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:39.040]   Fred also talks about in context of APIs.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:44.520]   He says, I envision a future where my doctor's office, there's a button that
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.040]   says, authorize with heart with health book.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:51.600]   And I push a button and that stuff from health book that's in my phone goes
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:55.680]   right into the doctor or my gyms mobile app, my health insurers, web app, a host
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.720]   of other places, that's the privacy concern of some people that we don't
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.880]   want the health insurers to get this information.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.800]   I think that's something that starts off as a feature turns into a requirement.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:09.560]   I mean, you look at like what's happening now with the requirement now where
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.800]   they're talking about forcing cars to talk to each other.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.840]   You know, at first it was like, oh, this would be a cool technology.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.160]   And now they're talking about requiring it in all the cars, which means that
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.840]   you'll never be able to speed again.
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.040]   When it goes eventually, that's all going to have to go back out of it.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:21.840]   No more vendor vendors either.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:25.800]   No more vendor vendors, but there's, you know, there's just a lot of, you know,
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.400]   and of course everyone, when that actually happens, I think everyone's going to
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.320]   want an automated car because it'll be no fun to drive anymore.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.680]   You know, so you're like, why bother?
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.040]   You know, because you're, you're.
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.760]   So here we are talking about iOS eight.
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:41.280]   This is, this is, in fact, the health book rumor really implies that iOS eight
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.960]   as a whole will be health focused and wellness focused and sensor focused.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.160]   I mean, as much as the last one was past book focused.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.880]   I mean, I think the health book name is not chosen, you know, randomly.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:55.760]   Again, you know, okay, I don't want to be the negative Nelly here, but I,
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.840]   this is Apple does this all the time.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.120]   Past book never lived up to its promise.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.840]   It's not yet.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.800]   They're really patiently.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.280]   Yes.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.440]   I think it was amazing.
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:10.720]   I think of this more like CBS hiring, hiring David Letterman for the 1130 slot
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.560]   where they can say where if you're on the outside, you can say that.
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.600]   Not for everyone.
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.520]   Well, no, no, no, no, what I mean by that is that you can say that, oh, well, mean,
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:19.280]   okay, so great.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:22.520]   So they got Letterman and he's 1130, but still Jay Leno's kicking his butt
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:23.080]   every single night.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.360]   That was a bad mistake.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:29.840]   Like, no, they had CBS said absolutely nothing going on at 1130.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.280]   And now they have a hugely profitable show and have had it for the past 20, 30 years.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.040]   So the fact that past book has not revolutionized all point of sale payments
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.800]   for across the entire globe, that doesn't label it a failure.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:43.720]   Now they have a infrastructure and a feature that they didn't have before that
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:48.440]   to my thinking is one of the best ways to do a feature where if you don't use it,
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.880]   you ignore it, it stays out of your way and never complicates anything.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:56.080]   But the time when as soon as you're your local market, which was probably the
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.680]   independent market, not the local, not the huge chain,
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:02.640]   decides to put in a few iPad terminals and now you can pay with your past book.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.480]   Suddenly your phone becomes 20% more awesome instantly.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.080]   So the fact that they have it there and that it works is enough of a win for
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.480]   Apple to keep going with it.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.040]   By the way, Apple is not the only one looking at this.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:18.560]   Google is working on a contact lens that will test your blood sugar in your
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:24.480]   tears and give diabetics a reading that apparently is accurate from their contacts.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:28.000]   The key I would like I hate to see Apple Apple does such these, you know,
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.240]   these closed universe things.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.480]   The key I think Fred was right is APIs.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.240]   If you have interoperability and a Google contact lens can talk to health book
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:40.240]   and talk to your phone more power to them, I guess Google would probably favor
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.040]   Android in a similar way.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.040]   But Google has a tendency to start in Android and then move to iOS.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.480]   I mean, Google does it off the other way around.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.200]   I mean, the iOS stuff is the best stuff out there.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.320]   So this stuff needs data and you have to think that Apple's going to want to collect
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.480]   data and they're going to need to have those API endpoints coming to it and going out of
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:56.520]   it.
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.720]   And who's the data company Google?
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.840]   They built their company around data.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:06.240]   So I will they're happily they'll give core location to Google Maps on iOS.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:06.760]   Right.
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.720]   I would hope that they will bury the hatchet.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.320]   Because it's good for everybody.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.040]   Apple, it's good.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.400]   It's going to save lives.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.840]   They're going to keep swinging the hatchet.
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.640]   Leo, but they'll do business while they're swinging it.
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.200]   That's for the children, Apple.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.080]   It's for the children.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:24.000]   Well, I think that I think that what's interesting is also that across the board, we've been
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.640]   talking about the measured life for a long time.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:31.280]   And we're about to see, I think, just an incredible explosion over the next literally
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:36.120]   24 to 36 months where suddenly, you know, it's not it's your location with I beacon.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.920]   It's your health with these, you know, with these different bits and pieces.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.240]   But the I don't be a whole different level of measurement related to what you're doing.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.840]   The irony of this, of course, is Google did something like this.
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.200]   They were we had a Google health product, which they killed.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:53.360]   Microsoft Health Vault is really the dominant one right now and does, in fact,
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.920]   interoperate with a lot of stuff.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:25:00.240]   This might be another case where just as with tablets, Microsoft's been there for
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:05.920]   years and then all of a sudden Apple steps in and makes it consumer friendly and takes it over.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:13.200]   These are apps and devices that work today with Health Vault and it's a broad range of stuff,
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:19.360]   including the not just the Fitbit, but CVS pharmacy, import your lab test results,
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:24.800]   American Diabetes Association, Ettina personal health record.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.560]   I mean, there's a lot of stuff here.
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.040]   This is all compatible with Health Vault right now.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.720]   That's sort of a signature thing.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.000]   I was just thinking about this this morning when I was doing my dishes, believe it or not,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.680]   that this is the thing that people overlook about Microsoft.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.600]   Specifically, I was thinking about the CEO.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:43.360]   I was just like, "Watch dishes and think about Microsoft and a little bubble with a heart
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.320]   and it with Bill Gates and it's over my head and I'm just want to make it that clear."
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.240]   This is what Microsoft sees its role as.
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.080]   They are the company that keeps the lights on.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.800]   This is the company that keeps clean water coming into the house.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:26:01.120]   They really make all of their coin and all of their reputation on fundamental services that
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.000]   people don't particularly care about but absolutely need.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.560]   Services don't really call attention to themselves until they stop working.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.440]   I mean, Windows is like that, Microsoft Office like that.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.800]   Those are these infrastructure things you're just talking about are also like that.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.320]   So that becomes part of the conversation when we talk about
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:22.480]   Microsoft, Google and Apple and what they do best and whether somebody is lagging behind
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.800]   because they've never been able to make a good phone or not.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:29.760]   There's also this thing at Apple where there has to be bad versions of a product in the market.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.760]   They have to be able to identify the problems.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:36.240]   The computer has to suck for them to want to make a Mac and the trio in the Blackberry has to not be,
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:40.160]   has to make Steve Jobs really angry when he wants to make an iPhone.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:44.080]   To this day, that's absolutely true.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:48.080]   If they can't identify problems in a market that they think that they can make a substantial
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.440]   difference to and it's a large enough market, they're not going to enter it, which is why they're
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.280]   never really early in any market.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:57.360]   Every time they talk about their own products or the development of their products, they usually
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.280]   talk about the pain points and the friction points and other existing technologies.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.560]   They rarely come out with something that we've never ever seen before.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:09.840]   So their inspiration usually comes from looking at something else that's out there,
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:14.960]   not wanting to build another one of those, but seeing an opportunity in the failures or the lack
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.080]   of Blackberry word vision in these other devices.
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.360]   Chad's been doing this, I guess, for a while.
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:26.560]   This is an app called My Fitness Pal that you use to, of course, it's always the fit ones who
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.720]   are keeping track of how many calories they eat.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.040]   Yeah, nice, Chad.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.680]   I see that you're doing very, very well.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.400]   What is this?
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.840]   This is an app you've used for how long?
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.080]   So yeah, so I've been using this since the beginning of the year.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.760]   Since day one of 2014.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.240]   You know what I love is this, you've got this news feed.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.080]   Chad has logged in for 30 days in a row.
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.080]   Chad has burned 241 calories.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.160]   Chad has logged in for 25 days in a row.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.680]   Why can't you be more like Chad?
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.040]   Why can't you be more like Chad?
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.440]   Because I don't have any friends on my fitness palette yet.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.840]   If you had friends, they would appear there too.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:58.320]   Right.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.360]   And the thing I like this is it looks like things it works with.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.600]   Like you guys are talking about the quantified self.
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.840]   And I feel like I'm living in it right now because my scale talks to my fitness pal,
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:13.280]   my Fitbit talks to my fitness pal, and you can use all sorts of stuff to plug into it.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:18.880]   One of the things that I love is if you go, I believe that there's a thing called progress or
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.480]   underneath.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.440]   I see the graphs.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.840]   One more up.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:24.640]   One more up.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.520]   Oh, look.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.320]   So this is 94% progress.
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.760]   You know what that is?
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.440]   That's the heavy cream you had in your coffee.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.840]   Well, I've only eaten one thing today, which was coffee.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.280]   So let's go to yesterday.
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.480]   Yeah, if you go yesterday.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.520]   That's carbs is blue.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.640]   Protein's green.
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.440]   Fat is red.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.360]   I've been trying the keto thing.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.920]   So if you over in the corner right above the other arrow, right below the other arrow,
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.320]   there is a it looks like a lot of lines.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.040]   Yeah, click that.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.600]   So that'll break down everything I've eaten today
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:57.840]   in terms of sodium protein, carbohydrates, absolutely everything.
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.680]   How hard is this to enter stuff into?
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.280]   Because that's one of the problems I have with all these.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.200]   I used to lose it for a long time.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:03.440]   Right.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.920]   Tracking what you eat is the single best thing, by the way you could do it.
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.120]   You don't even have to have a goal.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:07.360]   Right.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:10.560]   As soon as you see, oh my god, that bagel just killed me.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.880]   Just tracking it works.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.200]   So how easy is this to use?
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.880]   This has been the easiest one.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:21.760]   The one issue that this app has on is that it doesn't have a restaurant tracker.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:26.320]   So normally it's it's like lose it will say, hey, you're next to Taco Bell.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.400]   It's always your Wendy's that they have fast food stuff, Taco Bell.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.360]   I don't understand that.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:32.160]   Is that?
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.360]   And so well, this one doesn't have that.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.600]   Makes me want to eat more fast food, frankly.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:35.920]   Right.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:36.320]   I know.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.760]   Boy, we're a lot easier if I have an a big Mac right now than this plate of broccoli.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:40.000]   Right.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.240]   This one, all you do is search and the search has been really, really good.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.040]   So so you just type it out what you're looking for.
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.120]   Wendy's spicy chicken sandwich.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:49.600]   Exactly.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.360]   I've eaten that one frequently.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:51.920]   You can tell.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.560]   Create a new food, meals.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.120]   Easy sandwich.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.520]   And so the meals so the more you use it these year, it gets.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.240]   Absolutely.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:58.640]   Absolutely.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:02.480]   Because I know if I go to Chipotle, the meal I've already created with the lettuce and the
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.920]   everything I get and.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:08.880]   Every time I get into tracking, I always find that I eat simpler food because I don't want to
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.680]   track it.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.880]   Like I look at like pre-processed stuff and I'm like, oh, I don't really like,
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:13.680]   I don't want to eat that.
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.200]   I just need rice today.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:15.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.800]   It's like a cup of rice.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.360]   That makes sense.
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.960]   It's in tonics only 92 calories.
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.200]   Yes.
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:19.760]   I can't remember.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.480]   I can't remember.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:20.640]   Really?
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:20.960]   I can't remember.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:21.920]   I'm just going to eat a tonics only 92 calories.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.120]   I should be drinking a lot more of this.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.040]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:29.840]   I try to type in twizzler, but it keeps auto correcting to carrot stick.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.320]   Oh, well.
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.720]   Guess I'll have to eat a carrot stick.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.960]   This is called my fitness pal.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:38.000]   This is one of a large number of utilities like this, but this is the most
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:38.640]   confusing thing.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.920]   I've actually had a couple of people recommend that.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:43.680]   I just downloaded it a couple of weeks ago and I haven't actually started it, but I'm.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.520]   And we're looking on the iPad.
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.120]   So it's an iPad and iPhone.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.480]   And Android and Web.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.120]   Uh oh.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:49.520]   It's not.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:50.320]   I have to use it.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.200]   Oh, correct.
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:56.560]   I mean, this information has been invaluable in trying to truly look into what I've been doing.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.120]   And you can go online and change your settings.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:04.960]   So when I started keto, the app was like, whoa, you are going crazy with fat and protein.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:05.520]   That's dead.
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:05.680]   That's dead.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.280]   And then you just go online and change the numbers around and goes, oh, oh, you're doing great.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.240]   You know, keep it up.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.680]   You need more protein in your diet.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.400]   Works with the Y things, works with the Fitbit, works with the Up,
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:18.720]   Runkeeper, RunTastic, pretty much everything that people use.
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.080]   That's nice.
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:25.520]   And this one doesn't like lose it will charge you for connecting other things.
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:26.400]   This one does not.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:26.880]   I used to.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:27.600]   Really, really nice.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:32.240]   They had one of these espresso exercise bikes at the gym and then they stopped paying for the
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:32.800]   subscription.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.960]   So it was a little annoying.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.800]   But that's another story.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.360]   Yeah, it's nice if you don't have to pay for everything.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:43.840]   But I can't like this this information, you're talking about how Apple might get into a health
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:44.240]   book.
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:46.720]   It makes me think about switching from Android.
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:53.040]   If it's something that can be better, if it's FDA approved, if it can give me more granular
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:58.640]   information than any other device because they've gotten FDA approval, that is something that is
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.240]   very interesting to me.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.240]   Well, and shout out, I like that you're doing it.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:06.080]   You're a young guy and it's if you start now, it's a lot easier than if you start later.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.280]   So I like to see that you're doing that.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.400]   All right, I'm down with that.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.360]   My fitness pal.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:15.120]   And yeah, if the watch, the problem I have with the watch is there's only a few things
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.080]   it can measure.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:22.880]   It's not going to measure blood gas or insulin or sugar levels.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.080]   There's some things that just can't do.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:24.960]   Not yet.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:31.360]   Well, every time we talk about its ability to get things like blood sugar,
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:35.520]   get things like blood pressure, get things like blood chemistry, a lot of times we're talking
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.720]   about technologies that are kind of invasive to begin with.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:43.280]   Even if it's a micro needle patch technology, it's still something that's going to irritate your
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:46.160]   skin if you're wearing it on your wrist 24/7.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.920]   So we are going to have to look at and it's not even necessarily, there are technologies that
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.720]   will get it from tears.
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.560]   There are technologies that can get it from sweat.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:55.680]   But tears means that you do have to wear something in your eyes.
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:33:00.880]   Sweat means that you have to be in a situation where you are generating actual sweat.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.960]   I mean, here is the back of my watch on a cold winter's day and there's just not a whole
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:05.760]   lot happening there.
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.080]   Right.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.800]   Not that we have to be slick with stuff.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:14.480]   But the problem with health apps is that there's a reason why, if I want to show you my Fitbit,
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.480]   I can't because it fell off.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.800]   I put it someplace in the house, it's somewhere.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:23.840]   And then there are days where I couldn't use it because it has this bily little charger that is
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.000]   not nearby and they couldn't get it working.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.720]   That if you create this wonderful, easy to demo suite of hardware and software for health and fitness,
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:40.000]   but make it so that it is just 8% too difficult to charge this thing or it is just a little bit
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.720]   inaccurate, especially that one day where you really want to know what your fitness level is,
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.440]   or it stops working just momentarily.
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:52.640]   This is the reason why I haven't looked really too hard to find that Fitbit.
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.080]   I'm sure, again, I'm sure it's here somewhere.
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:57.200]   I didn't throw it out and give it to the good foot on a raccoon.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.560]   I have a raccoon give me a drawer full of those devices.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.600]   That's why it's interesting.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:08.320]   I'm not sure there are a lot of people who would switch phone platforms specifically
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:14.000]   for the health features of a phone unless they were already active like people, active
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.840]   exercisers and active nutrition people.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:19.760]   I mean, there's a lot of, Andy mentioned the 20% increase in value.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.000]   A good friend of mine works in a hospital and she has to do rounds and she leaves her phone
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:30.080]   on her desk now and just wears her pebble with her and that sends all her notifications to her watch.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:34.480]   She's found that it just transformative in terms of where she can go and what she can do
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.840]   and not have to just carry it.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:40.640]   Thinking about carrying a phone with you now sounds so easy, but for her, not having to
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.240]   carry a phone was the big thing.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:45.840]   If it does health for some people, notifications for other people,
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:50.400]   Ibik and stuff, commerce for other people, you start getting enough features that someone will
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.680]   find something they like.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:55.520]   What's so great about all these strategies that we're talking about and that are being discussed
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:01.600]   like on the sites is that Apple doesn't have to clobber everything all at once.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:07.760]   They can just create this infrastructure and have one nice feature where that motion sensor
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:13.840]   inside the existing iPhones is leveraged a lot more aggressively and the data that's producing
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.960]   is surfaced a lot more easily to the consumer.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:22.400]   So it does maybe one or two little things first and then with the next release, it's now doing
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.080]   four or five interesting things.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:30.320]   So Apple could take a couple or three years to make the iPhone and iOS into the single most
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:34.320]   important fitness based mobile device out there.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.400]   So again, they don't have to kill it with the first release.
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:41.520]   They can just do one little feature and just make that so nicely done that people will
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:46.480]   sort of emotionally invest in it and use that one little feature every single day.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:50.560]   And then maybe a year from now, they'll spend $50 for a little watch and they're so attached
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:53.680]   to the infrastructure that they will remember to charge it each and every day.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:57.040]   So Apple, I'm sure they have a long plan for this and I'm sure it's going to be
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.240]   more interesting three years from now than it will this year or next year.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.480]   Looking forward to it.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:08.640]   And boy, it sure is achieving the stature of more than rumor, even though all we have
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:12.000]   is rumors at this point, but one hopes we will hear.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:12.800]   That's how it starts.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:13.440]   Yep.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.040]   You that's an excellent point.
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.400]   That's how the iPhone started to.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:21.440]   We're going to take a break, come back with more Aaron Hillagas is here from Biggnard Ranch.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.960]   If you need to learn how to program, they've got books, but they also have courses you can
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:31.200]   go live on the ranch, learn how to rope, how to wrangle, how to create four wild loops.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:38.400]   He also is a very nicely cowboy fella.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.200]   I like the big hat.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.480]   That's nice.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.680]   Where do you get those?
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.040]   This one's actually made for me.
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:43.600]   It's a guy.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.720]   His name is Jack and he has a company called Jack's Built.
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.480]   You have a man who makes your hats.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:53.680]   And he sends you a pattern that you put on your head and it figures out the shape of your head.
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:56.160]   And then you send it back to him and then he cuts the hat.
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.120]   I need that.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:57.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.600]   Jack's built.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:00.240]   Jack's built.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:00.720]   Jack's built.
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.120]   Is he all kinds of hats or just cowboy hats?
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:03.840]   Just cowboy hats.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:04.400]   Yep.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.520]   Nothing wrong with a cowboy hat.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.240]   I need a cowboy hat.
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:08.560]   And you know all you have to do if you want to look like Pharrell on the Grammys,
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.960]   you just punch up the top and it'll look exactly the same as Pharrell.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:11.840]   That's the same as maybe cut the brim off.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:14.320]   Thank you for being here, Aaron.
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:18.160]   Of course, our regulars are in a Richie from imore.com, Alex Lindsay from Pixelcore,
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.240]   who's going to be more of a regular, it sounds like.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:20.560]   Yes.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.680]   I'm happy about that.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.600]   Andy and I go from the Chicago Sun times.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:24.160]   Did you see?
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.600]   Did you watch the Super Bowl?
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:28.800]   Did you see the Squarespace ad on Super Bowl?
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:29.520]   I did.
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.480]   I think it's so, you know, you feel like you kind of rooting for,
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:36.080]   they're one of our sponsors and in fact, we're about to do an ad for him.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.800]   And it's just like, you feel like, um, wow.
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.680]   Those are our guys.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:40.560]   Those are our guys.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.560]   It was an interesting ad.
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.000]   Yeah, let me play.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.120]   I'll play a little bit of it here for you.
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:45.440]   This.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:46.240]   Maybe the last guy.
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.120]   Maybe the last guy.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.320]   What am I hearing?
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.200]   Yeah, you're playing.
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.640]   I'm hearing something else.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:51.520]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.560]   I don't want that.
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.280]   Let me go back.
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.320]   This, it's a bunch.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:57.440]   It's all, it's all just to make this a little bit more intelligible.
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.320]   It's all the internet memes at once.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.200]   Okay.
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.080]   So that'll help you.
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:05.120]   There's a baby.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.920]   Your funny words here that's I can has.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.760]   So this person is.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.520]   Think yeah, look at this.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:19.280]   So there's a stock, I stock photo right there.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.280]   Abe Lincoln.
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:24.160]   Grown a bikini band guy.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.920]   I don't know what the nuclear guy is.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:26.880]   Virus one.
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.160]   Oh, he's got these the virus.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.040]   Like this.
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.200]   30% off.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:34.000]   Lower your mortgage.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.040]   People who buy this also want this.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:37.600]   Epic fail.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:41.680]   Comes with the web has become, but we can change what it will be.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.000]   A better web starts with your website.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.280]   I think that's kind of fun.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.880]   It certainly gets your attention.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:50.880]   I don't know what people think a square space is when they see that.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.000]   So let me fill you in.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   See that was the, that was we got your attention portion.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.080]   And people get the word square space in their mind.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:01.280]   Now when they're listening to us and they go, oh, yeah, I heard about that thing.
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:02.240]   I can tell them what it is.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:05.040]   It's hosting plus the best content management system
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:08.480]   to give you a really good place to put your next website,
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.880]   whether it's a blog, a portfolio, if you're an artist
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:14.640]   or a photographer, maybe your e-commerce site
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.200]   couldn't be easier to create a site with Squarespace.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.920]   You don't need to know any code, but if you've been to Big Nerd Ranch and you know,
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.560]   CSS and HTML and you're ready to do it.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:26.000]   They have a developer platform with a beautiful editor that's got syntax,
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.520]   color coded syntax and all that.
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:31.600]   The design templates you start with are stunning.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:35.600]   That's the best way to find out about Squarespace is to go to squarespace.com.
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.040]   You can all go there at once.
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:37.680]   It doesn't matter.
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:39.360]   You cannot bring a Squarespace site down.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.560]   Oh, look, there's the link for the ad right on that.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.960]   And you'll see a big Get Started button.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:49.680]   Click that Get Started button and you will, well, I'll do it right now.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.160]   I'll show you.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:50.960]   You know, I saw it.
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:51.680]   This is interesting.
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:52.800]   Something's going on.
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.000]   I moved the mouse and the parallaxes.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.440]   They know CSS.
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.520]   That's like they know CSS.
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.360]   You click Get Started and it'll show you all the templates.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.480]   I'm sorry, Alex, what were you going to say?
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:07.040]   I was going to say I get an ad for the Zoot Bowl for one of the,
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.880]   you know, someone that does online stuff.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:11.040]   And I went to their website and it was down.
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:11.760]   Like, you know, it was down.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.440]   Yeah, Maserati.
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.160]   So the first time they'd ever run an ad in the Super Bowl
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:20.160]   for the new Rosarati gibli or whatever it's called, they're sites down.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.760]   Alex and Annie, I think was the one.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:22.480]   Alex and Annie went down.
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.800]   It was just, it was like, you could knock Annie by the way.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.400]   They make like bangles or something for your wrist.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.440]   I keep saying I saw those ads 100 times and I still don't know what they are.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.560]   No, no, it was interesting.
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:31.200]   Those I went to there.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.080]   I don't know what they are.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.560]   I still don't really know what they are because their site was down during the
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.240]   Super Bowl because they weren't on Squarespace.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.960]   Okay, so if you're just been $4.5 million on a Super Bowl ad,
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.880]   you should at least actually be up.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.720]   Yeah, yeah, you got to make sure you cut that.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:49.200]   Alex and Annie, Maserati, may I introduce you to Squarespace?
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.960]   You cannot bring a Squarespace site down.
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:54.720]   I don't care if you buy a Super Bowl commercial and, and by the way,
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:57.040]   they could have just done a cheap Squarespace site.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.400]   It's free for the first two weeks.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:03.600]   Made that the site, used up all the bandwidth and then moved on if they wanted to.
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.640]   Squarespace is so great.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:07.840]   If you decide you want to stay, they have some amazing pricing.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.680]   You're going to get the best hosting in the world.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.000]   These great templates, easily customizable.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.680]   You don't need to know any code.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.080]   Every site is unique in Squarespace.com.
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:16.960]   They don't look cookie cutter.
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.840]   They've got great 24/7 support from New York City.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:22.960]   If you want, if you want, you know, the problem is the support guys,
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.240]   the accents are pretty strong.
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.360]   Yeah, what do you want?
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:26.320]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.360]   That's a joke.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.400]   So hey, you have a problem with your website.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.200]   I can help you there.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:36.320]   They are really nice guys and they really do care a lot about you.
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:41.680]   Squarespace has a great webinars page where you can learn how to use Squarespace.
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:43.040]   Price is incredible.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:43.520]   The what?
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:44.480]   In the support.
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.960]   So when you're building a drug in business, something goes wrong and you
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.920]   immediately get response and they show you how to fix it.
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.560]   And the big thing is also is when you're trying to edit,
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.600]   when you have a company and you're trying to, our stuff is all Squarespace.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:59.520]   And one of the great things is that anybody can edit the website.
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.040]   I mean, you know, you give logins to it.
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:04.880]   It's not like I have to call a coder to design a new page.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:09.120]   You know, I can simply just have it have somebody go in there and fix things.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.320]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.680]   Price is right too.
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:17.520]   When you buy an annual plan as low as $8 a month for that, you get your domain name free.
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.560]   Now, I think a lot of people are going to go with the middle plan,
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.480]   the professional plan it because it's unlimited everything.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:26.240]   Not only can you not bring the site down, but even if you had an ad in the Super Bowl
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.280]   and a million people went and sawed your site, it wouldn't cost you more.
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.320]   Because you have unlimited bandwidth, unlimited pages, unlimited galleries,
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:36.880]   unlimited blogs, unlimited storage, e-commerce for up to 20 products.
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:40.800]   So you can even test their e-commerce platform for $16 a month.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:44.400]   If you want the fully commerce platform, it's just 24 bucks a month.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.520]   I'm telling you shop around.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.800]   There's nothing like it.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.920]   And that includes unlimited products, digital physical services,
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:53.840]   real time carrier shipping information populated right on your page,
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:58.880]   label printing via ship station, integrated accounting from zero.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.600]   This is just fabulous.
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:02.640]   They'll help you with taxes.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:07.120]   They'll help you with inventory at 24 bucks a month.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.160]   And they don't take a cut.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.520]   You got to love them.
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.440]   Squarespace.com, visit them.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:14.160]   If you decide, first thing to do is, of course, just get started
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.440]   and you can get the full run of the place.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.560]   You don't need to give them a credit card.
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.240]   Put your stuff in there.
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.680]   You can import all your existing content.
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:22.480]   If you decide you want to buy though, I would ask you one thing.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:27.760]   Just use the offer code MACBRAKE #2 for February, MACBRAKE #2,
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:31.680]   and just MACBRAKE #2.
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:35.360]   Don't write the number two.
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:36.560]   It's MACBRAKE #2.
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:41.200]   And you will get 10% off, which is a great deal if you buy the annual plan.

[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.200]   We love them.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:53.120]   Yeah, and Mazarati and Alex and Annie,
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:59.360]   you'd think you buy it $4.5 million for a Super Bowl 30 second ad.
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.360]   Yes, we do something.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.320]   You ever thought about a big nerd ranch ad on the Super Bowl?
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.040]   Oh, yeah, definitely.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:08.400]   Well, you know, coding is all the rage now.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:08.800]   It is.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.160]   Everybody wants to be a code of these days.
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:10.640]   Yes.
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.640]   An hour of code must have helped your business.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:17.840]   I mean, all the awareness about coding and the importance of controlling computers
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:20.640]   instead of letting them control you is good for us.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:21.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:27.200]   30th, Apple did not have an ad on the Super Bowl,
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:30.640]   but they released at the same time as the Super Bowl,
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:36.160]   a really kind of gorgeous video, which was shot by Ridley Scott's son.
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.640]   Ridley Scott did the original 1984.
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:42.000]   If you look at the behind the scenes, Ridley Scott was in some of the behind the scenes
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:42.560]   for us as well.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:43.040]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.000]   He's definitely involved.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.560]   Here's, this is the 92nd version of the ad.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.000]   First of all, the fact that this shot is shot on an iPhone is kind of mind-boggling.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.520]   Like 36 hours?
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:52.480]   Yeah, all in one day.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:56.960]   Um, Alex, how do they do that?
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.600]   How can you get an iPhone to look that good?
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:04.240]   You know, managing exposure, they've got, if you look at the behind the scenes,
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.920]   they definitely used a lot of great rigs.
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:06.480]   These rigs, yeah.
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.880]   So while they shot it on the iPhone, it's not like they were handheld,
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:09.920]   right, you know, with the iPhone.
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:12.480]   I mean, you know, they're using jibs and molds.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:14.320]   Well, you see the motion of it stuff.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.960]   Well, the earlier shot where it was going up in an elevator,
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:18.400]   yeah, things like that.
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:22.240]   These are really, but if you, the behind the scenes is as as interesting as the ad,
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:25.040]   right, you know, because you really see.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.400]   Well, let's look at the behind the scenes.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.960]   Actually, let me see what the ad is.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:33.280]   And you've all seen it by now is kind of people using Apple products,
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:40.160]   not just the Mac, but iPad and iPhone in real life to do a lot of amazing things.
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:43.920]   Behind the scenes, Apple ad.
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.200]   Let's see if I can find the, yeah.
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:49.840]   Yeah, behind the scenes video for the 30th anniversary.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:53.840]   That's actually for our audience has a lot more interesting than the ad.
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:54.800]   So.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:46:00.320]   10 countries, 15 locations.
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:03.760]   It's the whole of January 24th for the 36 hours.
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:07.440]   Wait a minute, January 24th, they did it a week ago.
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:10.480]   That's impressive too.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:11.360]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:11.840]   All right.
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:15.200]   But in Australia, I want to see the start from running out.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:20.560]   So, so, so that's Ridley Scott's son directing it from a control center.
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:21.360]   He had photography.
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.360]   I mean, obviously he didn't go to 36 countries.
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:23.920]   Right.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:24.960]   At 15 cruises.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.240]   He was finishing on the West Coast.
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.600]   Wait a minute, look at that rig.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:28.800]   Holy cow.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:29.760]   Nice States of America.
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.440]   It's a full, this is ridiculous.
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.720]   Keep watching it.
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:36.160]   It's a movie, a movie sized dolly.
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:39.120]   And you can see where they're doing is they have an HDMI out of what they're of the,
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.160]   of a camera.
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:41.360]   So they can send that send.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.520]   They're not recording on the camera.
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:44.960]   Oh no, they could be recording on the camera.
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:47.280]   They probably did for this, but they had a video tap,
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.200]   but they have a video tap so that you can go back to him
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.720]   so he can see what's coming out of the video tap.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.720]   Because you're not recording that because it's the,
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:54.480]   what the video tap has is the interface.
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:55.600]   You saw that earlier with him.
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:56.880]   Ah, you don't want that.
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:00.560]   It's just doing a screen mirror so that, so that he can see what they're shooting.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.120]   Got it.
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:06.400]   As you can see, we got Seattle, Tokyo, Paris, Aspen, Los Angeles, each crew has.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:08.240]   Whoa, that gimbal is something.
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:09.840]   That's, that's important.
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.120]   I think that that, I'm not.
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:13.280]   Because you wanted Andy, is that why it's unfortunate?
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:14.000]   I don't know.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.320]   It's like, if they had not shown this, and they just simply said this was all shot
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.720]   and Bruce on an iPhone, that would have been a great.
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:25.440]   But now it's like, oh, so if I've got $80,000 worth of gear plugged into this
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:28.400]   and crews worldwide, I can shoot nifty videos.
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.600]   But just one day, Alec, Andy, just one day, if you gave yourself a month,
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:32.480]   you wouldn't need the gimbal.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:37.280]   But the point is that the video is still iPhone video.
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:40.000]   Yeah, so I give them credit for that.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.440]   Again, again, it's cool.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:46.800]   It's just that it's, I don't know, it feels, it feels vaguely like when they do those extreme home
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:53.040]   makeovers, where they said, well, rather than just simply raise $180,000 to buy you a much
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:56.720]   better house and maybe $50,000 to get you medical equipment.
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:02.240]   And we're going to basically do 80 times the amount of work to do something extremely
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:02.640]   flattering.
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.080]   It gets the exact same results.
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:07.680]   I like this guy in the crane.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:08.080]   Hold on.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:18.160]   He must feel all silly if God could achieve one third of week and accomplish.
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:20.320]   He would consider himself a very lucky man.
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:20.960]   That's exciting.
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:24.960]   But sometimes like that, okay, so that shots just a guy in an elevator handling an iPhone.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:25.440]   Exactly.
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:28.160]   It's actually, it's, you're basically treating it just like any other camera.
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:28.480]   Right.
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:30.720]   I'm not talking about, I'm trying not to be cynical.
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:31.840]   It's just that I'm like, okay.
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:32.960]   We've seen this rig before.
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.440]   This is kind of a cool little rig and not too expensive.
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.280]   Yeah, it just took, who makes that?
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:38.960]   I think steady cam.
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:40.080]   It might be steady cam itself.
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:43.920]   It's just a little counterweight basically that you mount the iPhone to, but it helps
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:44.960]   you hold it more steadily.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.480]   Yeah, it's really nice.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:48.320]   Move off them into that view.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:49.120]   That's what I love.
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:54.080]   That's Ridley Scott himself there, right?
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:54.880]   I believe so, yeah.
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:58.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:48:59.600]   What's that, an iPhone?
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:01.360]   I, it looked like an Android phone.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:05.360]   We've got a rig, eh?
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:07.920]   Look at that.
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.200]   That is so cool.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:09.600]   You're right.
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:11.200]   The behind the scenes is much more interesting.
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.880]   The essence of the moment.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.640]   That's the, I believe, wow.
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:19.840]   That little arm, is that the company that does the boom arms that we've talked to before?
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:23.280]   That's pretty cool because it looks like a sound boom,
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:24.880]   but only at the end they've got a nice phone.
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.000]   That looks like a K-Tec.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.520]   K-Tec, K-Tec, that's the company.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:27.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:29.600]   That's kind of cool.
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:31.840]   So you could, you could choose that.
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:32.800]   It's just a boom arm.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:33.360]   It's not a boom arm.
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:34.560]   Yeah, but you could do it if I did that.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:35.520]   It's steel.
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:38.400]   The tool company,
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:39.680]   but that must just be a sticker.
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.720]   I don't think that still makes.
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:42.160]   Truthful.
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:45.200]   As seen through the prism of this device,
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:46.800]   I think it's really rather lovely.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:51.360]   Very nice.
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:52.640]   I want that control room.
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.480]   Yeah, which is built on a sound stage.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:54.880]   It looks like.
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:55.840]   You can't fight in here.
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:57.040]   This is the war room.
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:01.200]   Really nice to watch the behind the scenes.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.040]   I think that's really, really cool.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.000]   It really is cool.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:08.160]   All I'm saying, I think I want to like sort of fine tune
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:09.040]   my comments earlier.
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:10.560]   It's a fine commercial.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:13.120]   I just think that it would have been a lot of people,
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.280]   I think would have found it more inspirational
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:19.280]   if they had stuck to budget of no more than $100 worth
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:22.000]   of accessories for any one camera that's being operated.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.920]   Because the iPhone can shoot video that is amazing.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.320]   That if you're applying the correct technique
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:30.640]   and the correct storytelling to something,
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:34.480]   it almost doesn't matter that you're shooting it on a phone,
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:36.560]   especially a phone that's this good at video.
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:36.880]   Yeah.
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:40.400]   Well, as Dendrite said in our chat room,
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:43.600]   here's all the things you can't do with your iPhone.
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:47.040]   Well, again, I mean, it's factored by time.
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.600]   If you don't have a lot of time, you got to spend a lot of money.
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:52.320]   You know, if you have more time, you don't have to spend as much money.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:52.960]   That's how I look.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:54.400]   I was a little bit disappointed like Andy was,
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.720]   but then I remembered 36 hours, not a bad job.
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.400]   You know, you could do all that.
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:00.000]   They're just being a little.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.280]   Okay, the difference between the quality of the footage you get
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:06.800]   with that versus a stick that you taped an iPhone onto
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:08.560]   is this is 1%.
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:11.520]   You could get 90% of the way with just stuff,
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:12.880]   just crap lying around the house.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:17.440]   You could definitely with it with a couple hundred dollars of additions.
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:20.480]   If you spent no more than you spent on the iPhone,
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:23.760]   it'll say $800 or whatever, you could get a bunch of little rigs
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:27.840]   that you could shoot a pretty incredible bit with.
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:31.360]   I think what I would love to see is like a top gear style challenge,
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:36.000]   where each each person, you get three or four different directors.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.080]   Each one has a budget of no more than $200 for additional hardware
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:42.720]   and $5,000 for additional personnel,
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:44.240]   whether you want to hire a lighting person,
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:47.120]   a sound person, an effects person, an editor,
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:50.400]   and try to produce the nicest four and a half minute movie
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:51.520]   that you can possibly make.
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:54.960]   Because I think the results would be so impressive.
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:57.920]   I think the results would be as impressive as the video that we just saw.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:00.080]   Then at the end, the stick comes in and shoots it professionally.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:08.640]   This Apple, of course, has this website that's associated with the 30 years of the Macintosh.
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:11.760]   And they do have a page in greater detail on the making,
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:16.560]   including the video we just saw and images of the setups
[00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:21.440]   and how they did it and where they did it and all that stuff.
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:22.000]   It's kind of cool.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.280]   It's cool.
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:26.240]   It reminds me a little bit of Rick Smolens Day and the Life Project.
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:27.680]   Absolutely.
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:29.120]   He did Day of Life on the Internet.
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:34.080]   It's especially cool when you give somebody a deadline like that,
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:36.640]   which is to say, don't take two months to think about it,
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:38.640]   two months to plan it, and then a month to shoot it.
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:41.120]   Here's the day on this day you're going to go out and shoot something
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.400]   and send me whatever you have.
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:43.920]   That's just exciting.
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:45.680]   Okay, there's one other point I'm going to make here,
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:49.440]   because you can see in this shot, not only are they shooting with an iPhone,
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:52.240]   but because the command center was on Los Angeles,
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:57.680]   the cinematographer is hooked up by a FaceTime to Los Angeles.
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:58.240]   To get feedback.
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:03.360]   To get feedback, you can see he's listening to this phone that's being held in front of him,
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:06.800]   and Scott is there on the phone.
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:07.920]   I would say I wouldn't have done it that way.
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.760]   I would have attached that phone to the other phone.
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:10.400]   I know you.
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:14.320]   I mean, I would have read next time call, Alex, and he'll set it up for you.
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:17.040]   Yeah, because we've done some of those FaceTime is where we do that,
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:19.520]   but what we do is we do the camera tap and it hasn't been out of an iPhone.
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:20.800]   It just might have a regular camera,
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.360]   but what we do is we attach the iPhone to the camera,
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:26.000]   like to the cold chume out or the hot chume out,
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.800]   then you have a little rig above it and then you can sit there and talk.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:30.800]   Yeah, one of the problems with this is, of course,
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:35.200]   the director is seeing the shot, but not exactly the shot this director's seeing.
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:38.560]   Maybe he does have the audio close and you can upload it almost immediately.
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:39.760]   He's got the tap.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:44.160]   He's got some interface over top of it, but it's not, but otherwise you see what they're shooting.
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:49.680]   Alex, would it be important to have a director that is looking at these shots live
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:52.000]   when he has something of this complicated and this widespread,
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:56.720]   or with a project like this, would it be easier for him to simply say,
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:58.960]   "Here's the storyboard. Here's the shot I want you to get."
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:04.240]   The bottom line, he's going to get a lot more of what he wants and the iteration rate will be faster.
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:09.600]   Any time you're doing production, whether it's visual effects or video or whatever,
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:11.520]   you're never going to get the shot that you want.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:14.560]   You're going to get the shot that you ran out of time and that's what you ended up with.
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:19.040]   20% of it is really technical.
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:23.600]   40% of it is knowing what you want and 40% of it is the number of iterations
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:25.520]   that you're going to get before you get it.
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:28.640]   That increases the iteration by having the FaceTime and having the real-time feedback.
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:32.320]   That's not really about the fact that Angus Wall was the editor.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:38.320]   He hired 21 other editors to go through all the footage.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:40.080]   70 hours were shot.
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:43.440]   They say 15 cinematographers in 10 locations.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:48.320]   What they don't mention is those 15 cinematographers shot 70 hours on 100 iPhones.
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:50.160]   There's a lot of footage.
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:56.080]   It's probably a multi-million dollar production.
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:55:00.000]   That's the only thing I want to say about it.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   That I think that people might get the mistaken message that what Apple made that
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.480]   movie on the iPhone is something you could do with any phone or any $100 drug store camera on
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:16.960]   the market if you had all this technical support, if you had all these extra doodads on it,
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:18.960]   if you had all this extra stuff.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:20.720]   But I think that it's hysterical.
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:26.000]   Even Jake Scott and the Cloud Ad Agency couldn't get any Mac Pros for their control room.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.360]   It's all on Macs.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:29.280]   There's not one.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.480]   There just weren't enough Leo.
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:32.880]   This was the opportunity to show the Mac Pro at work.
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:33.360]   But no.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:34.240]   You wouldn't need it.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.040]   I mean, you know, for this.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:35.520]   Shh.
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:41.280]   No, because I had breakfast this morning with the developer who's given a February ship date.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:45.440]   And his phone has not been out of his hand since midnight, February 1st,
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:46.960]   expecting a confirmation.
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:50.400]   If they had like every desk there had a Mac Pro, they would be like, oh,
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:53.600]   so I guess five people got screwed out of delivery of a Mac Pro.
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:55.360]   So you can shoot your little cartoon video.
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:56.880]   I take it back.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:58.000]   Go ahead.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.600]   My friends got an email today saying from Apple, just reminding him that his delivery
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:02.800]   date was in February.
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:05.760]   He thought he got all excited when he saw it and it just said, we're reminding you,
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:08.480]   it's going to ship in February and we'll tell you when closer to the date.
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:10.960]   Apparently they didn't use Mac Pros for the video.
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:13.840]   They use Mac Pros for the scoring of it.
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:20.560]   There is a Mac Pro in one of the images and it looks like they're doing the scoring.
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:22.400]   That's another studio entirely.
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.640]   86 Macs were used in production.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.080]   One of them, a Mac Pro.
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:31.360]   And they still can't fix the MagSafe connector on the new Mac.
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:32.960]   I'm being facetious.
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:35.680]   They solve the problems they want to solve, don't they?
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:40.320]   Must be a fun project to work on though if you're a Lee Cloud, the creative director.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:43.040]   By the way, the same team that did same company.
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:44.560]   No, I'm sorry, the same.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:50.400]   Lee Cloud was the ad agency creative director at Shaiya Day in 1984 when they did the 1984
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:54.560]   commercial and Lee Cloud comes back to do this with not Ridley Scott who directed it,
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:57.600]   but his son, although as obviously is the case, Ridley's there.
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:00.880]   Boy, this is really cool.
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:05.440]   But I think that one of the things is obviously this is part of an ongoing push that we're
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:06.960]   going to see probably all year.
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:07.920]   Made with a Mac.
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:10.560]   Well, it made with an iPhone and an iPad.
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:14.800]   I mean, I think that one of the things that distinguishes the iOS from all the Android
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:20.960]   applications is that it is more of the Kindle specifically is the Kindle is much more of a
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:21.760]   consumption device.
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:25.840]   And what they're trying to get people past is the iPad and the iPhone are not just consumption
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:27.280]   devices, they're creation devices.
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:33.200]   And if you want to create something, we'd like to have you join our crew.
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.840]   Think about that when you're buying your tablet, when you're buying your phone.
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:39.600]   I think that that is definitely something that they're going to keep on aggressively pushing.
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:41.200]   I don't know if it's necessarily a great case.
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:44.640]   I think there's a lot of great creation apps on the Android platform.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:50.320]   But I think that specifically, I think Apple is eyeing the Kindle, which is, is a, I think
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:54.160]   that Amazon would tell you that it's a consumption device.
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:55.600]   It's just like the end for that store.
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:58.320]   So it's really attacking.
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:02.000]   If you're going to buy it, if all you want to do is consume, consume, consume, then the
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.280]   Kindle is good for you.
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:06.480]   But if you want to create stuff, and I think that they're trying to inspire people to think
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:10.080]   about, "Oh, maybe," even if they never do, there's a lot of us that buy gym memberships
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:10.800]   who never go work out.
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:13.840]   But they might think, "I'm someday I might want to make my movies and do whatever."
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:19.440]   So I think that that's the, and I think that you could argue that people who are wanting to
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:24.160]   do that kind of stuff with their devices may spend more money.
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:26.000]   And may buy a Mac as well.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.800]   I mean, after you get it all together, it's nice to edit it on a Mac.
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:32.960]   So it's a whole suite of buying the whole ecosystem.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:33.280]   Yep.
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:33.760]   Absolutely.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:36.320]   What's nice is that they're telling the story again.
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:37.920]   And for a while, they'd stop doing that.
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:40.000]   And as much as it was, it just works before.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.520]   Now they're really hitting, we believe.
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:41.840]   Right.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:43.600]   And they keep doing these technology alone is not enough.
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:45.200]   And the more they do that, the better.
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:45.760]   Much better.
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:52.560]   Although, I got to say, there are other phones that have optical image stabilization, 4K video.
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:53.440]   I mean, there's-
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:54.800]   They're going to tell that story.
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:56.880]   They need to tell their story.
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:59:01.920]   But they're doing a much better job of it because I don't think that the iPhone has
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:04.400]   the best camera on the market today.
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:10.000]   But in terms of I've taken a very good picture, what are the apps and what are the services I can
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.920]   use to do something really, really great with it?
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:15.840]   I still want that to be on an iOS device as opposed to an Android device or a Windows phone device.
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:17.840]   Well, worth visiting that.
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:22.640]   If they were an app that I could take pictures with a Lumia 1020 and then put it into the iPhone
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:25.680]   for iOS thing with just one tap, that would be ideal.
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:31.680]   Well worth visiting apple.com/30-years.
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:33.440]   That's their 30-year site.
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:37.440]   You could see the making of the commercial, but there's a wonderful Mac timeline as well.
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.600]   You're getting great with these micro sites.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:42.080]   This is nicely done, I got to say.
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:43.600]   A lot of CSS.
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:44.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:46.880]   Thank you, Mr. Bernie, for their money.
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:47.120]   Yeah.
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:51.360]   Have we ever seen Apple so interested in its own past before?
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:52.160]   Never.
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:56.800]   I remember Steve Jobs very specifically said, "No, we don't look backwards.
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:59.120]   We're not going to celebrate the 25th anniversary of that."
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:02.960]   Let's ship those boxes and boxes of crap of old stuff to a university because we don't want
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.000]   them claring up here.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.920]   I think that's a good thing because part of what makes Apple so great is its history.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:12.240]   It's not a newcomer that's trying to feel its way out or trying to do things from go from product
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.280]   to product to product.
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:17.680]   When you look back on 30 years, it's sort of like when you look at the back at 30 years
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:21.920]   for performance artists, where being in a kiddie pool, covering yourself with gravy,
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:24.880]   and then lighting a deheshen flag on fire, you don't get it.
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:28.960]   But when you see the 30 years with the work they did before that, you see a continuum and a
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:37.120]   sense of purpose that makes it to make the iPhone 5s, not just the iPhone 5s, but the residue of
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:41.040]   30 years worth of thinking behind the relationship between humans and technology.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:46.240]   One of the things I think is really interesting is when you look at the years on the Apple store,
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:51.440]   is they really were pretty good at picking out the classic max of that year, of that progress.
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.000]   It's fun to see that.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:59.840]   There's a lot of us will talk about the PowerMac 8500, which was just a classic or the eight.
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:03.280]   I don't think that I think would be missing there is the 840AV.
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:05.120]   If anyone remembers the 840AV.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:12.320]   - Although they do have oddly enough the Mac TV, the Apple TV, there's the 20th.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:12.880]   - No, that was not one of them.
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:14.880]   - That was an anniversary Macintosh that didn't sell.
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.480]   There it is, the Macintosh TV.
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.560]   I don't even remember that.
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:23.360]   Robin and Rand Miller, who did, of course, missed.
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:26.480]   Really, this is fun.
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:31.440]   The Macintosh TV, not to be confused with today's Apple TV, the first Mac with built-in television
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:31.920]   capabilities.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:32.400]   - Yeah, I had it.
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:33.760]   I remember I almost bought one.
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:37.600]   It was just like the timing because I was like, "Oh, I could just replace my TV with it."
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:38.960]   - Because I had two.
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:39.440]   - I was playing three.
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:42.080]   Wow, I do not remember that.
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:43.760]   And I thought I'd have never met there was.
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.040]   - It's not the Pippin.
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:49.520]   - It was the only Black Macintosh desktop until the introduction of the Mac Pro.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.720]   So I have one of the two Mac Black desktops.
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:56.800]   Really fun to, there's Hans Zimmer.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.320]   - Gorgeous, I...
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:01:58.800]   - Yeah.
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:01.040]   One of the original buggles.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.720]   - It's my webpage, my nice word.
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:09.440]   - I like to pick the least important thing Hans Zimmer ever did to his Genesis.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.840]   It was credit.
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:17.600]   - Well, you know, when Raoul Julia died, his screen credit was Raoul Julia,
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.360]   star of Mortal Kombat II.
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:19.840]   - Right.
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:22.320]   - He was in "The Nels" and "Tensil" over the movie.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.080]   - This is neat.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:28.800]   It's fun to go through these old Macs.
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:29.360]   Look at them.
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:31.440]   And all the things people have done with them.
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:32.640]   This is beautifully done.
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:33.760]   It's museum quality.
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:36.800]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:37.440]   We come back with more.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:38.480]   We'll talk about Ibeken.
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:39.920]   It was used at the Super Bowl.
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:41.520]   Don't know how it worked, but we'll find out.
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.480]   Maybe somebody knows.
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.640]   Apple had a great quarter.
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:45.840]   We did talk about that last week.
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:47.600]   - Didn't help Denver find the end zone, did it?
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:53.520]   - I want sports joke I can make.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:58.720]   You know, I'm watching the Super Bowl, and I completely forgot that my arch nemesis,
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:01.360]   Paul Allen, owns the Seahawks.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.600]   One more reason not to like him.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:08.400]   Saw him up there taking the Vince Lombardi trophy.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.480]   And congratulations Seahawks.
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:15.760]   As Richard Sermon said, the 49ers are the second best team.
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:16.960]   That fell not the third.
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:20.080]   - Mac Break Weekly brought to you by FreshBooks today.
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:21.520]   I know, Sportball, no interest.
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:26.400]   I know the simple cloud accounting solution that helps thousands of entrepreneurs and

[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:45.600]   that makes it possible for you to do your work and get the accounting done.
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:48.080]   That's always the thing I didn't want to do.
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:50.560]   Set out those invoices at the end of the month.
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:54.800]   And this is when I was working in Canada, so I had to invoice people in dollars,
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.240]   Canadian and dollars US.
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:56.960]   It was crazy.
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.080]   FreshBooks handled it all.
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:01.520]   Multiple currencies, the invoices went out.
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:06.080]   There was even a pay-am-now button on the invoice that made it very easy for my clients to pay me.
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.240]   I just love FreshBooks.

[01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:58.400]   It's tasty.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.120]   We've gotten one.
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:04:59.920]   Excellent.
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.840]   Yeah, that was just a weird, coinkie thing.
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:02.240]   I hope.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:02.800]   It was.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:03.040]   Yeah.
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:04.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.880]   You didn't rig the contest or anything, right?
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:09.040]   No, in fact, we weren't sure if we were allowed to have it.
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:10.560]   And we called them.
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.760]   They said, "No, it was totally random."
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:15.040]   And it was somebody years ago, of course.
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:15.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:20.560]   Good review, I thought, from Dave Girard in Ars Technica.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:21.200]   Very long.
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:21.680]   Very long.
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:23.280]   Well, that's what Ars Technica is famous for.
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:25.600]   Of the brand new Mac Pro.
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:28.720]   We're starting to see reviews as people finally get them.
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:35.360]   And what a lot of people have pointed out is that the Mac Pro is an incredible deal.
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:37.440]   Yeah.
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:41.040]   And that's something that's not obvious when you see a computer that starts at over $3,000.
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:52.000]   They reviewed, he reviewed a $6,500 version with the eight core Xeon and at 32 gigs of RAM,
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.920]   dual FirePro D700s.
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.520]   You upgraded the card.
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:59.200]   He said, "You could not buy AMD FirePro D700s.
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.800]   Two of them for that price."
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:05.360]   Or certainly, the processor alone is $2,000.
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:10.160]   So the price is, he says, "Apple is really giving you a deal.
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:13.280]   If you need this stuff, it's a good deal."
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:15.040]   Now, if you don't need it like me, it's stupid.
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:17.280]   Buying it anyway.
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:21.280]   You're doing it because you just love how beautiful it is.
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:26.080]   Now, as a programmer, what's interesting about this review is that he compares it with the iMac.
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:31.280]   And he says, "Unless the software is optimized for this situation, there's no point in it."
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:35.440]   And so, Apple is sending a clear message to developers that it's time to start thinking
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.480]   multi-threaded so that you can use all the cores at the same time.
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:43.280]   And also start thinking about OpenCL, which is the library we use to talk to the GPU
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.680]   to do general purpose computing.
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:49.200]   And if you're not really working the GPU in all the cores, there's no point.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:53.920]   It's not going to be faster compiling even because you get plenty of speed on an iMac.
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:07:02.400]   He points out that the FireProW9000, which is very similar to the D700 Apple selling,
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:06.000]   retails on Newegg for $3,400, one of them.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:13.840]   So he says Apple charges $600 for the upgrade to Dual 7700s.
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:22.640]   So really, he says, in fact, if you do need it, you should be upgrading to the D700 for 600 bucks,
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:27.600]   because Dual D700s are better than Dual D500s.
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.680]   I say, go all in.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:30.800]   Go all in.
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:36.320]   He points out that the processor he got the 8-way processor is $2,749.
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:39.520]   It's unbelievable.
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:42.400]   What I love about this computer is how quiet it is.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:43.440]   Yes, I-- oh, you have one.
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:45.920]   You put your head-- well, I had our own ones myself yet.
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:46.560]   I played with somebody.
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:47.520]   I keep forgetting to bring it in.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:48.480]   Just February, just starting.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:49.760]   I don't know why I forget.
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:51.040]   Because you love it so much.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:53.120]   I forget to bring it in.
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:57.520]   I forget to bring it to Alex wants to play with it.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:59.520]   I'll run home today and pick it up for you.
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:00.480]   I likely store it.
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:04.000]   He does say that if you can now get third-party RAM upgrades,
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.800]   and that's probably a good idea.
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:12.960]   But do make sure if you get RAM that it's made for a Mac Pro,
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.680]   for instance, in fact, I would just--
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:16.400]   And one of the things--
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:17.520]   Don't even mess with it.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:20.480]   It's got a temperature sensor in it that talks to the fan.
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:23.040]   He says, if you get the wrong one,
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.480]   your fan will be a full speed the whole time.
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:26.240]   One of the things that we did--
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:29.040]   we had to do a lot of research back in the day.
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:32.800]   One of the things that we found is that a lot of a Rata,
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:35.440]   the difference between a computer that is really stable
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:37.200]   and a computer that just is a little wanky,
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.520]   turns out to be the RAM, oftentimes.
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:40.240]   Yeah.
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.320]   And we used to do a lot of testing.
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:48.160]   We had to do it with a lot of video,
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:49.520]   a couple million clips of--
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:52.720]   or 750,000 objects for a movie I was working on.
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:55.360]   And we had a lot of crashing.
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:57.760]   And it turned out once we cleaned up all the RAM
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:00.000]   and tested it all heavily, everything got stable again.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.320]   And so definitely, because of that, I just generally buy--
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:06.880]   I know that Apple's RAM tends to be very stable.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:08.160]   And it's really built for this,
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.800]   and I tend not to get third-party RAM anymore.
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:12.320]   You're paying for the peace of mind.
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:13.840]   450 watt power supply.
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:16.880]   Now, that's bigger than most PCs, but it's still not massive.
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:18.240]   For a little computer like that--
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:20.000]   For a little time in space that when it's working,
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   it burns 330 watts.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:22.560]   Yeah.
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.400]   And as you say, it's dead silent.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:24.960]   Dead silent.
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:27.600]   The hard drive, the spinning hard drive I have hooked up to it
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.760]   is louder than it, and it's annoying.
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:30.240]   Do you feel--
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:31.200]   Can I have it on the top?
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:34.560]   Boy, not a heat, exactly.
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.320]   No, it's heat coming on the top.
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:36.800]   I'll buy the--
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:37.600]   Call me here.
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:38.400]   Hey.
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:40.560]   I'm just wondering if I can replace my space heater with it.
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:41.600]   You might work a couple of--
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:42.560]   Hand drive, you're working well.
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:43.840]   And I'm not--
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:44.480]   Nothing I could do it.
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:48.720]   I'm playing, you know, Bioshock-infinite full quality
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:51.520]   and everything and great frame rates, and it's not--
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.160]   It's not breaking.
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.840]   Well, I've been doing a whole bunch of recompressions
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:54.720]   of footage from last week.
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:55.280]   That's what it would be.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:55.920]   Like hundreds of--
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:56.400]   Like, I would--
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.880]   When I love the test, it honestly, I've got about--
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:00.960]   We shot about 20 hours of footage last week.
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:03.440]   You know, we have to convert, you know, to Apple ProRes.
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:03.920]   And--
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.680]   You'll be able to dry your hair at the same time.
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:06.960]   Yeah, that's awesome.
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:07.840]   So you--
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:08.240]   I'm working--
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:08.400]   I'm working--
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:08.960]   Heat up the office.
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.960]   I've heard about pity infiltration.
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:13.040]   It's a source of radiant heat.
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:13.840]   It's--
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:16.520]   If you've got a cat, you're going to basically come
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:18.840]   and it'll look like one of those Egyptian Coptic jars.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:20.680]   It'll just get its bodies stuck in the tube.
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:22.240]   It'll just have it'll stick you out of a cat.
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:22.720]   It'll cover it up.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:23.560]   A cat would love it.
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:24.840]   A cat would love it.
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:25.680]   A kitty sauna.
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.840]   Or even a small rodent of almost any kind.
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:30.080]   Squirrels.
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:31.320]   Oodent of unusual size.
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:34.520]   It does apparently, for those who are wondering,
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:37.720]   support windows, but windows eight only,
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:40.360]   because windows seven doesn't have support for USB three.
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:42.480]   The driver's going to be flaky.
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:43.520]   He says, you should really-- you're
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.960]   going to have to use windows eight.
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:49.480]   He said also, the AMD driver Apple installs with bootcamp
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:53.120]   has crossfire enabled, so it uses both GPUs for gaming.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:53.600]   Right.
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:55.360]   Awesome.
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:59.680]   I'm going to have to put windows eight on it and let you know.
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:00.600]   I've been avoiding that.
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:01.920]   It feels like sullying.
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:04.480]   It's like putting a mustache in the Mona Lisa.
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:04.920]   It's just--
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:07.440]   Can't do it.
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:10.000]   I mean, this is probably--
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.040]   maybe it's just that we're just stopped
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:14.440]   talking about the 30th anniversary of the first Mac.
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:18.760]   But this really is a lot like the first Mac in so many ways
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:20.920]   in that cool, radical design.
[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:24.080]   But also, it's kind of scarce right now.
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:27.120]   And the people who want them are people who are willfully
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:30.360]   ignoring the fact that this is not the most practical computer
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:33.240]   to own in 2014.
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.280]   And everybody who does not have one
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:38.000]   wants to know somebody who has one so they can go and see it
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.240]   and try it.
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:41.640]   I'm really getting a 1984 vibe off
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:45.360]   of the entire Mac Pro of conversation.
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:47.280]   He says, at first glance, the new Mac Pro
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:50.280]   seems like a finger in the eye for demanding creative
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:51.240]   professionals.
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.040]   But after actually using the system,
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:56.480]   I'm convinced this is a very successful workstation design
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:02.360]   that can be a great template for future versions, as you say.
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:03.600]   Apple has designed a machine that
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.200]   has to appeal to video customers.
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:07.320]   The company's done a good job of reaffirming its commitment
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:08.920]   to that user base.
[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:12.400]   Great, of course, for graphic professionals as well.
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:15.160]   But now comes the time for tough love.
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:18.200]   Those video users likely make up a majority of Apple's media
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:21.160]   pro base, but they are also disproportionately represented
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.440]   as the only people who use Mac Pros.
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:26.160]   Apple has changed Final Cut Pro to leverage dual GPUs
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.600]   and created a powerful dual GPU workstation
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:32.880]   to push a narrative that says the GPU is a future of computing.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.640]   It's clear how this machine wants to be reviewed.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:38.000]   Plug it in, hit play on your 4K Final Cut Pro 10 footage
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.560]   and go, wow, this thing is amazing, which is actually what
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:44.000]   probably you and I would do.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.240]   But he says, I pay for these machines and use them for work.
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:51.560]   He's a 3D designer, not a video guy.
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:54.040]   And that does not fit neatly into the narrative
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:57.640]   that Apple would like to weave.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:01.080]   In 3D rendering, CPU is still king.
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:01.920]   Yes.
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:04.480]   Well, it depends.
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:07.560]   When you're working in 3D, the CPU for the final render
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:08.520]   is still king.
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:12.400]   When you're actually doing your previews and looking at things,
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:15.440]   then the GPU is still very important for being able to watch
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:16.840]   your playbacks before you hit render.
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.040]   So--
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:21.120]   Yes, and that won't frequently tap the second GPU.
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:23.440]   And all visual effects production quality
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:26.240]   renders V-Ray, Arnold, Manta, RenderMan, Cinema 4D,
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:29.160]   et cetera, et cetera, are CPU bound.
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:31.320]   And their developers, apparently, are not being swayed
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:35.320]   by the talk of GPU everything.
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:36.360]   That's true.
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:39.640]   Nvidia has done a lot of work with some of their rendering.
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:42.480]   But I think that that did not go the way they wanted it to go.
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:45.480]   But again, you are using-- having big GPU--
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:49.520]   I mean, I have big GPUs in my older Mac, specifically
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:51.640]   because I want to be able to look at stuff.
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:55.000]   Also, the compositing software that we developed
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.920]   was completely GPU driven.
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:01.760]   So it is very valuable for real-time interaction.
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:04.360]   So I think that he's a little overstated.
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:05.920]   But CPU, as far as the final render,
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:08.320]   definitely makes a difference.
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:11.360]   He also points out that over the, say, four-year life
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:13.440]   of this computer, it's going to be absolutely essential
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.760]   that I can upgrade the GPU.
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:18.320]   And of course, that's not possible as far as we know.
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.520]   Maybe.
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:22.120]   The problem is he said it's absolutely essential.
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:24.440]   I don't need the GPU, but it's essential
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:25.600]   that I would upgrade it.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:26.560]   The single GPU.
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:27.720]   Well, no, the single GPU.
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:28.920]   Oh, OK.
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:31.680]   He says, as for the Phantom second CPU,
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:34.560]   how am I supposed to make up for the power loss
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.760]   in the single socket downgraded?
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:38.560]   I think he means GPU.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:40.000]   Oh, no, maybe-- no, I get it.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.280]   There's two CPU sockets.
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:45.280]   Anyway, it's worth reading if you're thinking about it
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:45.920]   and you're a pro.
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:51.760]   He has some qualms, but I think in general,
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:55.680]   as with almost everybody who's played with the Mac Pro.
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:59.000]   This is an amazing machine.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.480]   But not for everyone.
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:01.680]   Well, I think that we're not seeing--
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:03.600]   I mean, I think that we're going to have
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:06.680]   to see how quickly Adobe is able to get After Effects
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:08.960]   and Premiere running an app and taking full advantage of it.
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:09.160]   Right.
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:11.720]   I think that right now, it makes the most sense
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:13.320]   if you're a final cut user.
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:16.160]   And then we'll probably see some upgrades pretty soon
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.240]   with things like Cinema 4D that work heavily.
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:19.920]   And they tend to move very quickly,
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:22.880]   so we'll probably see Macs on move forward very quickly
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:25.480]   to push a lot of that forward as well.
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:27.280]   It seems like the person for whom this makes the most sense
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:28.640]   is developers.
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.560]   Really down with that C that doesn't, doesn't?
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.440]   No, it's a nice machine for developers.
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:33.600]   Oh, yes, you can afford it.
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:34.880]   I mean, you can drive the bigger screens.
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:36.440]   You get more pixels, which is more--
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:37.640]   Always big screens is good.
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:38.840]   Yeah, always good.
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:39.760]   You have a lot of cores.
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:43.320]   So you can be compiling a lot of files at the same time.
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:47.080]   And most compilers in GCC now will use as many cores as you have.
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.800]   Yes, Xcode will take care of that for you.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:49.880]   Yeah, Xcode also does that.
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:51.440]   So it's a great developer machine.
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.920]   Once again, it's quiet until some one of the kids
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:57.760]   puts something on top and stops all the airflow and melts down.
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:59.200]   It's going to be a perfect machine.
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:00.200]   Got a sandwich there.
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:02.760]   We had a production box last week, Catch Fire.
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:03.280]   It was awesome.
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:04.280]   What?
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:06.080]   Yeah, it's definitely in the middle of production.
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:08.880]   Suddenly, like, somebody is smoking somewhere.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:09.760]   So yeah, but--
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:10.240]   Wow.
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:13.200]   Yeah, you got to-- ventilation is important.
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.640]   It turns out.
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:19.440]   Apple had a $13.1 billion quarter,
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:21.040]   the fifth highest of all time.
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:24.880]   Fortune puts this into perspective.
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:29.360]   They say they had a bigger quarter than most oil companies
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:33.120]   by an order of two.
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:35.440]   And Wall Street still downgraded the stock 8%.
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.760]   Companies that have oligopical control over fossil fuel
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:38.280]   resources.
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:38.280]   Yeah.
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:40.880]   Limited fossil fuel resources.
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.760]   Only oil and gas companies make that kind of money.
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:46.280]   They haven't seen a $10 billion quarter since 2011,
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:48.600]   but Apple's stock fell 8%.
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:51.080]   So that's Philip Elmer DeWitt, who has always
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:54.000]   been a great writer about Apple stuff.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.160]   They had a great piece from Ben Thompson, too,
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:58.000]   who was looking at the transition in market share
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.040]   from Apple to Samsung.
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:00.800]   And Apple, we've talked about this before,
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:03.360]   has 0% share of the under $400 market.
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:05.280]   But their share of the over $400 market
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:08.840]   went from, I think, 45% to 65% quarter after quarter.
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:11.480]   And that represents a lot of money for Apple.
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:13.400]   And their average selling price per iPhone
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:16.720]   has gone up by, I think, $30 or $60.
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:18.400]   And Samsung's has gone down.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:21.000]   Because there's a lot more pressure on the low-end market,
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000]   and especially now that Lenovo is entering it,
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.600]   than there is on the high-end market.
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:29.400]   I beacon rolled out at MetLife for the Super Bowl.
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:32.480]   As you, in fact, as you walked around Manhattan,
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:36.120]   your phone would say, hey, over there, it is the big toboggan.
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:39.120]   Why don't you try it for a ride, or if you walk it through a park,
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:41.280]   say hot dogs here, get your hot dogs here, or whatever.
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:42.280]   I don't know.
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:44.480]   Major league baseball is planning to do the same thing
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:45.360]   for opening day.
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.720]   Yes, we're talking opening day.
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:50.160]   Pictures and catchers report next month.
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.840]   So get ready.
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:55.160]   The league is looking to have 20 parks outfitted with 100
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.280]   bei beacons.
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:59.720]   At the end of March, Boston, Milwaukee, San Diego,
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:01.720]   the Dodgers, the Giants, among the teams
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:03.760]   that will have iBeacons installed.
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:06.520]   I think we should put iBeacons all through the Twit rec house.
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:07.800]   We can put iBeacons up.
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:08.480]   Let's do it.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:09.600]   What would we do?
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.440]   Here is where OMG Chad writes the microwave?
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:13.280]   Yeah.
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:17.000]   Leel passed out here after his New Year's Eve party.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.840]   Can you still smell the aroma?
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:20.320]   This is where Aussie poop.
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:22.720]   We've actually been talking about taking like two or three
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:24.120]   blocks by two or three blocks in Petaluma.
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:25.560]   I just put a whole bunch of them all over the place
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:27.000]   just to kind of play with as R&D.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.200]   Scoble wanted to do that.
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:31.120]   Scoble was going to kind of do a gorilla iBeaconing.
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:31.480]   Right.
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:33.440]   What I think this is going to be.
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:38.440]   I think what is possible with iBeacon is mind boggling.
[01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:38.760]   Right.
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:41.000]   Just like we talk about what we want
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.080]   to do with our shipping cases.
[01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:45.520]   Because we've all-- we are constantly-- as you've seen,
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:46.960]   there's lots of Pelican cases downstairs
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:47.440]   that get moved down.
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:48.440]   I have seen them.
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:51.320]   Keeping track of what all the hardware is and everything else
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:54.880]   and what I think is going to be possible is, for instance,
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:59.200]   our gear telling our case that it's going into the case.
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:01.400]   Like as you put it into the case, the gear--
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:01.960]   I'm in the case now.
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:03.120]   --like with the case numbers and everything else.
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:03.960]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:07.160]   And as the cases leave, they're telling us,
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.840]   this gear is going in.
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.520]   And when you take it out on the other end,
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:12.120]   it tells you that it's been taken out of the case.
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:13.680]   When it gets put back in the case, in fact, you could look
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:16.840]   at the gear and it'll tell you what case it should go back into.
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:20.720]   So these are all things that when you have all these localized--
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:21.600]   these little chips.
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:24.280]   And we were playing with doing this with Active RFID,
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:26.160]   but it was not really a format that really worked.
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:27.960]   And having something that's really standardized on this,
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:28.840]   I think, is exciting.
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:32.200]   I mean, I think that there's also things around--
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:34.320]   of course, there's a lot of things
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:35.200]   where they can send you coupons.
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:37.320]   But there's also just like, how do I find my seat?
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:39.400]   Anyone who's been to some of these stadiums,
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:42.400]   should I go into this entry or somewhere else?
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:43.600]   And how do I get to my seat?
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:47.000]   All those things are stuff that GPS cannot help you with.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000]   But or where is the nearest restroom?
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.480]   Which way is the nearest restroom?
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:52.000]   So this is what Major League Baseball is saying,
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000]   which I think is very interesting.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.040]   They're not trying to make money,
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.160]   but trying to improve the fan experience.
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:58.840]   They say, we're taking a longer range view.
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:00.560]   Time is more valuable than money.
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:02.640]   So Major League Baseball wants to make the fan experience
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:04.720]   as efficient as possible.
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:06.280]   So looking to eliminate time, which
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:09.240]   is waiting in line at the will call window,
[01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:10.920]   getting to your seat, it shows you--
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:12.840]   it says, looking for your seats, and it'll show you
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:16.360]   how to get there, gives you offers.
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:19.080]   Every 10th visit unlocks a special offer.
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:21.680]   This is the New York Mets--
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:25.320]   this is an app called @TheBallPark, which is, I think,
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.960]   already out.
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:28.240]   I like that.
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:30.560]   They'll be able to guide the police to exactly
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:34.560]   to the seat of the person with child support payments, too.
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:36.600]   There are so many applications for this technology.
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:39.560]   There's a drunk here.
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.320]   Yeah, you can download @TheBallPark,
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:47.360]   mlb.com @TheBallPark for iPhone right now, and be ready.
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:48.360]   Come opening day.
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:50.080]   P&C Park is one of them it looks like.
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.440]   Is it?
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:52.680]   It's the best--
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:55.120]   it's the coolest park in Pittsburgh.
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:58.320]   It is like to be able to fill it up all the time
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.280]   when you have a team that never wins, except for this year.
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:01.520]   That's saying something.
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:03.240]   You know, it's a--
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:03.760]   take some work.
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:04.760]   But the--
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.120]   I mean, when you think about this also,
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:07.760]   like as a parent, imagine being
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:12.000]   able to get to a point where you lose your kid at the park.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.880]   And if they have their iPhone with them,
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:16.040]   they have a little I beacon on them,
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:17.400]   being able to know exactly where they are.
[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:20.160]   And I have lost my son at a baseball-- at P&C Park.
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:21.680]   Surely you should have I beacon stitched
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:24.160]   to the nape of their neck.
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:26.480]   But imagine it being able to get to a point where, I mean,
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:29.480]   five years down the road, you run an alert,
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:32.280]   and it literally won't let the automatic doors open
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:33.560]   because they're nearby.
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:35.200]   You know, or they're right there in front of it.
[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:36.720]   I mean, all of these things are--
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:38.520]   I mean, it's a pretty--
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:40.920]   Where can I buy I beacons and how cheap are they?
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:42.920]   They're down to, I think, a couple dollars each.
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:45.360]   So we've been doing some research on them.
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.600]   I'll get some for a twit.
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:49.000]   There's also a lot of diabolical things
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:49.760]   you could do with them.
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:51.160]   I keep thinking about casinos, right?
[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:53.200]   A casino, you have your customer loyalty card,
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:55.480]   you have your phone in your pocket, and it keeps track.
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:58.240]   Well, usually Alex comes in, he loses about 200 bucks,
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:21:59.560]   and then he goes home.
[01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:01.120]   Let's make sure he gets drinks first.
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:01.800]   Exactly.
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:03.440]   Or we'll wait till he's up, and then we'll
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:06.200]   send him a coupon for the jewelry shop at the edge.
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:07.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:08.200]   That's absolutely--
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:09.200]   He's making a ton of money on the real estate.
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.520]   Well, and so just manipulating your--
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:12.720]   So these are 100 bucks.
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.080]   This is the thing that concerns me the most
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:15.480]   about that technology.
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:17.160]   But I think that we're going to maybe
[01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:20.400]   create a generation of people that are aware that perhaps I
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:22.400]   should switch off my phone and leave it off
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.880]   until I'm back into a trusted environment.
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:27.800]   Because the first time that a casino does something creepy,
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:29.720]   the first time that a baseball park or a mall
[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:32.360]   does something creepy, like saying, hi, Andy.
[01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:34.560]   I remember that you were looking at this camera
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:36.680]   when you were in a best buy 40 miles away.
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:39.160]   And now that you're in this other mall,
[01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:41.760]   do you realize that that price is 20% less?
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:45.200]   I'm like, OK, I'm going to take up my Pentelobe screwdriver,
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.360]   take apart my phone, and disconnect the battery manually
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.880]   because you've just freaked any off.
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:50.480]   Well, one of the things I think is going to be important
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:53.000]   for Apple is to give us granular control over what
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.320]   kind of notifications we're getting based on that I beacon.
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:56.320]   You turn it off.
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:59.280]   Not notifications on who gets this information.
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:01.000]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000]   I need to be able to cut off that master switch at the source.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.480]   It's not that everybody can get access to it,
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:09.160]   but they can control-- but I can control what I hear about it.
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:11.600]   I'm saying that if I want to pass through this mall
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:15.240]   like a ghost, I should be able to do that.
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:15.600]   He says--
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:16.480]   He's doing settings.
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:19.440]   Reminds me of the day I was at Pack Bell Park waiting
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.840]   to get in while they scraped the web van logos off
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:23.000]   the back of the seats.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.720]   He says somebody can share them.
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:25.800]   But I mean, one of the things--
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:28.200]   Here's the-- this is a company, Estimote, that makes IB.
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:29.200]   Because these are more visible.
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:30.360]   They're larger.
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:33.440]   And they are $33 each.
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:35.600]   Pack $3 is $99.
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:38.480]   So here's an example of a retail implementation.
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:41.320]   As John approaches the entrance, the violet beacon
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.720]   positioned in the window sends a personalized message
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:45.520]   to his phone, engaging him.
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.360]   Hello, John.
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:48.080]   Get in here.
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:50.480]   We've got a special offer for you today.
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:53.240]   John is headed towards his favorite retail store.
[01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:55.440]   He has the store's mobile app on his smartphone.
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:56.600]   That's kind of the key, right?
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:57.120]   Humanoid.
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:57.600]   Stop.
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:00.000]   Because all you want is a digital version of that guy
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.880]   outside Vegas trying to offer you tickets every time you want.
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:03.160]   Yeah, flick flick.
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:04.600]   Jeans are on sale today.
[01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:06.880]   John sees some great jeans and wants to learn more about them.
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:08.960]   Thanks to another beacon located near the product,
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:12.640]   he can immediately receive more information and a special offer.
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:15.160]   He then walks over to the shirts.
[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:16.880]   As he approaches the t-shirt section of the store,
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:19.600]   the yellow beacon sends a new message to John's phone
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:23.240]   with a recommendation for a new purchase in a very--
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:25.560]   I wonder why his battery is now down to 20%.
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.200]   He fully charged in the car.
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:29.560]   John decides to buy both the items
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:32.240]   and uses the store's mobile app to finalize the purchase.
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:34.960]   And then as he walks out the door,
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:37.440]   the light blue beacon triggers a thank you message
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:39.600]   with shipping information.
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:41.200]   The items you purchase we ship today
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:43.440]   and deliver to your home address, which I already
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:46.080]   know because I know everything.
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.360]   See you Thursday at 4 p.m.
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:49.840]   based on private experience.
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:51.480]   I wonder if this company gets it, though,
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:54.040]   because they've just created the most sterile consumer
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:56.880]   experience possible, where I don't interact
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:57.480]   with anybody.
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:59.440]   I don't need to ask for anybody's opinion.
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:01.840]   And even if you aren't in the level of--
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:03.760]   the reason why I leave the house and don't buy things
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.880]   on Amazon is because sometimes I want that sort
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:07.920]   of interactive consumer experience.
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:11.360]   Even if that doesn't matter to you, I'm thinking that, OK,
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:14.720]   so not a single clerk had to come and help me.
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:16.960]   If your store is doing a lot of business with this,
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:19.160]   that means you're probably hiring fewer people.
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:21.880]   So why is this yellow shirt cost exactly the same
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:23.440]   as it does in the store next to me,
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:24.800]   where they have a full staff?
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:26.400]   People who will ask me, am I being helped?
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:27.600]   Then can they help me find it?
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:29.280]   I think it all depends, because I mean, people like me,
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:31.240]   I don't want to talk to anybody when I walk into the store.
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:33.400]   I want to look at something that I really don't want you to.
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:34.040]   But I want to--
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.480]   That's what I'm saying, though.
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:38.400]   If the shirt and the fully staffed store cost $30,
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:42.200]   it should cost $25 in this store that has maybe two people
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:44.760]   on staff whose job is only there to troubleshoot
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:45.520]   the I-beacon system.
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:48.160]   I would actually pay more if people just left me alone.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:49.640]   You know, like, I don't--
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:51.800]   there's this incessant coming up to me all the time
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:53.120]   and asking how I'm doing.
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:56.160]   I just want to go and get my stuff.
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:57.160]   I don't care.
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:57.760]   I'm like, you know, it's--
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:59.440]   There's definitely a balance to that.
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:03.400]   But again, I was just buying at Home Depot this morning.
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:05.680]   And it actually pleased me that I wasn't being accosted.
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:07.360]   There were people who were like unpacking boxes
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:08.740]   and doing their job, but they saw that I
[01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:10.600]   seen you be walking around looking for something.
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:12.400]   And the first thing I said, can I help you find something?
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:13.400]   That's first place.
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:15.480]   The other thing is, I want them to say, can I help you find
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:16.280]   something?
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:18.960]   The issue is, is that I want my iPhone to do that.
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:20.000]   I don't need them to do that.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.440]   Like, I want to be able to walk in and it goes, what do you--
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:24.360]   I don't necessarily need a coupon.
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:26.640]   But what I want to do is walk in and say, what are you looking
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:27.640]   for?
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:28.960]   And then I go, shirts.
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:30.760]   And it says, go right, go forward.
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:32.240]   Especially like in Macy's.
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:35.880]   As long as you control the experience, if they set it up,
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:38.560]   if they set it up, or even if the defaults in the app
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:41.840]   are set up so that I've been conditioned over the past two
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:44.600]   or three years that when my phone buzzes in my pocket
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:47.120]   or makes that trolling sound, it's probably a text message.
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:48.400]   It's probably something important.
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:51.120]   But now I'm starting to ignore text messages
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:53.760]   because my phone is keeping me alert and said, did you know
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:57.160]   that we have this new flavor of red vines?
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:59.560]   It's actually beef vanilla flavored?
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:01.400]   Well, you know, all of this--
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:04.320]   As with all other marketing and all other point of purchase
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:06.800]   and everything else, what we used to call it at--
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:08.080]   I used to work at Sony Music.
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:12.160]   And so I dealt with point of purchase a lot for bands,
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:13.520]   mostly music and stuff like that.
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:17.000]   And what we used to call it was karmic balance.
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.160]   Karmic balance.
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:19.000]   Yeah, so karmic balance.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:19.920]   You're going for a band.
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:23.080]   Yeah, but karmic balance was, are you providing something
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:25.680]   that's great versus what you're asking them to do?
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:28.600]   And as long as your karmic balance was positive,
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:30.840]   people would be fine with it if it became negative,
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:33.440]   then you were going to actually reduce.
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:34.840]   So a lot of people don't understand that.
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:36.640]   They understand what they need out of this.
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:38.360]   Like, I want to get people to buy more or whatever,
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:40.280]   but they don't understand that if they're not producing a use,
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:43.320]   if they're not making the experience better,
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:46.480]   then you're actually going to dull people's connection.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:48.840]   I think that people-- there's a lot of opportunity here.
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:52.240]   And I think that if the karmic balance is good with Ibik,
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:54.360]   and there's an incredible number of things that can be done,
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:57.360]   but I think Andy is very aware of if the karmic balance
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:01.320]   is negative, I think all of the things that Andy's talking about.
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:03.560]   And you think Apple is going to police the karmic balance?
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:04.960]   I think they will.
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:06.520]   I think much more than--
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:10.080]   I think that if we start seeing it-- because I think Ibikin
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:13.080]   is a huge opportunity for Apple, and Apple
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:15.640]   will definitely bust in Knuckles if they feel like people
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:17.960]   are getting overwhelmed by the information.
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:18.760]   Absolutely.
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:20.680]   Apple is the one company that I would trust
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:23.000]   to actually have that master kill switch right in settings,
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.480]   saying Ibikin's ignore.
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:26.360]   Yeah.
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:27.600]   That solves the entire problem.
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.520]   Again, I love these features where if you don't
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:32.080]   want any part of it, you flip a switch or by default,
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:34.920]   it simply doesn't bother you until you see a sign that says,
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:36.400]   oh, by the way, we use Ibikins.
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:38.720]   If you download this app, it will make your shopping experience
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:39.280]   better.
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:42.520]   If I then have to actively make that choice and make that vote,
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:44.320]   then that's a totally different story.
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:47.560]   I think this is going to be huge for big department stores,
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:48.720]   Safeway.
[01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:51.240]   I want to just-- I want to go-- where is the coffee?
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:53.440]   And then it just tells me which row, which aisle it's on.
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:54.920]   Because that's what I keep on asking people for.
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:56.640]   And I don't want to ask them.
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:58.800]   I just want to look at my iPhone and have it tell me where
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:01.600]   the gin is, so I can make my gin and tonic for 92 calories.
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:03.480]   I just don't want people to lose jobs over this.
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:04.320]   And that's the reason.
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:05.840]   Oh, they definitely will.
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:08.600]   I mean, I don't want that to happen.
[01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:10.960]   I think that's too expensive if now they're--
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:12.320]   the workforce has been decimated,
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:13.800]   and the people are still there now
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:15.560]   have to do about eight different jobs,
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:17.360]   instead of specializing on one or two.
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:18.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:23.200]   I feel as though the trend is to streamline operation so much
[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:27.120]   that your staff are basically treated like meatpots.
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:28.720]   I think that the issue is--
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:30.640]   It's not that your staff's treated in meatpots.
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:33.560]   I think that the issue is is that if you are in a job
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:35.200]   that you think is mindless, don't worry.
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:37.240]   You won't be in it for much longer.
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:40.640]   I think that you have to be, as an American,
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:42.440]   I think you have to be very focused on how
[01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:45.600]   to move up the food chain and stay ahead of a computer.
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:47.600]   Because you should not-- if you think
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:50.320]   you're going to be working at the gap and just managing
[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:53.840]   people's orders, you know, or McDonald's.
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:58.720]   I mean, McDonald's has had almost self-run McDonald's
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:29:59.680]   for 20 years.
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:01.320]   They've been experimenting with that.
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.240]   And all we need is the minimum wage
[01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:04.240]   to go up a little bit further.
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:06.040]   And IDKs to work a little bit better.
[01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:09.240]   And they'll reduce their staff by half.
[01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:14.000]   And so that math is something that all of these guys are--
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:14.840]   everybody's working on.
[01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:16.600]   And it happens everywhere.
[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:17.920]   I mean, just having these computers--
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:23.200]   I mean, I'm working on this big thing for my G+ post about it.
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:24.640]   So employment is definitely something
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:25.480]   I'm thinking about a lot.
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:28.560]   And it's just that the technology is always
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:31.200]   going to keep on disrupting where employment is.
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:32.400]   But it doesn't mean that it goes away.
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:33.480]   It just means it's moving around.
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:34.920]   And people have to pay attention to it,
[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:36.600]   especially when you're at the top of the heap, which
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:38.600]   is the United States.
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:39.400]   A couple of financial perspective.
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:41.240]   A couple of quick stories.
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:44.440]   Adobe has just released a critical update for Flash,
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:47.040]   for Windows and Mac addressing a zero-day vulnerability.
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:49.240]   I'm sure we'll cover that more in security now in just a few minutes.
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:50.560]   When do we get to get rid of Flash?
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:51.760]   I wish we could just get rid of it now.
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:52.560]   Steve was so right.
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:54.760]   And I think we're close.
[01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:58.960]   I'm looking at reports from Mac rumors
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:03.960]   and boy genius about iOS 7.1, the beta 5 that just came out
[01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:05.400]   today, not only what's new in there,
[01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:09.720]   but they're noting that the build number is only slightly
[01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:13.920]   higher than the previous beta's build number they think.
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:14.840]   And I think they're probably right.
[01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:17.840]   That means we're probably getting close to a release date.
[01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:21.520]   Boy genius report was saying March.
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:23.520]   But now they're saying in the coming weeks
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:24.840]   could be sooner than that.
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:26.200]   So get ready.
[01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:31.280]   Something much needed in 7.1 is getting close.
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:34.000]   And I just got the new version of hype.
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.560]   I forget which version number it is.
[01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:40.920]   But that's the HTML5 interactive dynamic tool from Tumult.
[01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:41.720]   And it's fantastic.
[01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:43.200]   Everything I used to do on Flash, I
[01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:44.680]   can easily do on that now.
[01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:46.120]   And it has no exploits.
[01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:49.720]   Yes, let's replace it with HTML5.
[01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:51.320]   It's responsive now too, which is what the--
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:53.280]   I think the last thing I was waiting for was responsive
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:55.920]   design stuff.
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:57.440]   Have you played with paper yet?
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:58.600]   Love paper.
[01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:01.320]   I feel sorry for 53.
[01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:01.800]   Yes.
[01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:03.120]   There's a bit of a dispute, of course.
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:05.680]   Paper is the new Facebook app.
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:08.920]   And a 53's paper is a beautiful drawing app.
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:11.800]   It's been one of the top apps on the iPad.
[01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:14.000]   And I have to admit, it was confusing when I saw paper coming
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:14.520]   out with Facebook.
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:15.800]   I was like, did Facebook buy paper?
[01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:17.880]   I thought the same thing.
[01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:18.360]   Yeah.
[01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:19.320]   No.
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:20.080]   So--
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:22.440]   I will admit, they filed for trademark the same day
[01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:23.320]   that Facebook put it out.
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:26.280]   I was kind of like, you might have thought about that earlier.
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:26.800]   You know what?
[01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:28.800]   I might have done that a couple years ago.
[01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:30.840]   But what was funny, though, was a different reaction
[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:31.840]   when people--
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:34.240]   Facebook using paper got an entirely different reaction
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:36.800]   than King trying to stop other apps from using candy.
[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:37.840]   Which I thought was interesting.
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:39.400]   Yeah, isn't that-- yeah.
[01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:41.920]   People love paper by 53.
[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:44.120]   They're not so fond of Facebook.
[01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:45.200]   Anyway--
[01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:48.160]   Also, remember that Mr. Jobs got away with that, too,
[01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:49.560]   when they said, oh, well, of course,
[01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:50.560]   I'm going to call us the iPhone.
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:52.640]   Oh, someone else has that?
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:53.440]   Yeah.
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:55.000]   We're just going to still call an iPhone.
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.000]   I'm sure that--
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.760]   I mean, Facebook's a really big company.
[01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:00.520]   We will hold a pen over a checkbook and one hand
[01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:01.520]   and a knife with the other.
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:03.120]   We'll see which pen it would end.
[01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:04.600]   Cisco wants to deal with.
[01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:06.840]   Yeah, I mean, I think that the advantage--
[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:09.280]   unlike iPhone, I think that the advantage is
[01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:11.640]   53 is not that big of a company compared to Facebook.
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:14.720]   And this can all be solved, I think, probably with a big check.
[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:16.080]   Honey, Facebook is serious.
[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:18.480]   So I can't talk about most of our clients,
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:21.280]   but Facebook has graciously given us permission
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:22.320]   to talk about them.
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:24.800]   This year we trained 750 of their engineers
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:27.960]   on mobile programming, both iOS and Android.
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:29.480]   They paid attention.
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:31.640]   They are serious about mobile.
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:33.160]   And they're a dream to work with.
[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:36.080]   They pay their bills instantly.
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:38.280]   And this is the sort of thing that you see.
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:39.840]   They brought on Mike Matas.
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:41.480]   Yeah, but Matas is the guy.
[01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:42.480]   Lauren Brikter.
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:43.480]   Can you come over?
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:44.880]   He's been working with Facebook on this.
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:46.280]   Not with us.
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:47.280]   He already knows about it.
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:49.080]   Yeah, he knows about it.
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:50.320]   So this is it.
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:52.000]   Of course, it's an iPhone app, but it runs actually
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:55.560]   quite beautifully on the iPad.
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:56.480]   Incredible interface.
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:57.920]   I think in many ways--
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:01.920]   well, first of all, it's a very, very future-looking interface.
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:02.960]   It's just beautiful.
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:05.280]   What you get is the screen is divided into halves.
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:08.280]   The top half is the table of contents.
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:09.960]   You can have Facebook, of course.
[01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:12.040]   And that'll be your kind of traditional Facebook feed
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:12.640]   in the bottom half.
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:13.920]   You can scroll through that.
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:16.760]   But you can also have headlines because you have--
[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:16.840]   I mean--
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:17.880]   --content sources.
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:19.600]   It's a funnel assault on Flipboard.
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:20.800]   Oh, this is better than Flipboard.
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:21.640]   It's gorgeous.
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:24.080]   So let's say I'm following sports on this.
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:27.840]   You'll see how that quickly rolled through all the stories.
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:29.240]   I can scroll through a story.
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:31.440]   When I see a story I want, I can tap it.
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:34.840]   If I want to read more, I can scroll up in it.
[01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:37.200]   And so this is a really elegant way.
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:40.000]   Of course, I can like it because it's still Facebook.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.160]   Comment on it.
[01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:42.640]   And I can share it.
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:44.680]   That hasn't gone around, gone away.
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:46.840]   But what's interesting is this is more than Flipboard
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:48.600]   because it's also obviously intended
[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:51.360]   to be the way you read Facebook, Facebook, plus.
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:54.000]   Because it starts out with your Facebook news feed.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.080]   And if you scroll down, you now get access to the stuff
[01:34:57.080 --> 01:35:00.560]   you would get in a Facebook app, including, by the way--
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:02.600]   whoops, that's not customized yet--
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:06.000]   including, by the way, your code generator, which is hidden--
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.920]   I keep pressing the wrong button--
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:09.760]   hidden in settings.
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:13.520]   So if you are using Facebook for a second factor authentication
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:16.200]   in the Facebook app, as far as I can tell,
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:17.800]   it really has all the functionality.
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:20.560]   You can turn off push notifications.
[01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:22.880]   Here's one of the things I think that Facebook is doing really
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:25.040]   right here is that they've created--
[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:27.360]   So they've created a repost from it, by the way.
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:30.720]   And they encourage you to post a beautiful image and so forth
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:31.760]   because it's very visual.
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:35.600]   And they've created-- basically, I
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:37.680]   think they've created replacement for their Facebook app.
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:38.840]   That's clearly what this is.
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:41.480]   But what they didn't do-- and this is what Apple made the mistake
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:43.840]   with Final Cut 10 and a lot of other things--
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:46.120]   what they didn't do is they didn't make this the update
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:47.400]   for the Facebook app.
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:49.200]   What they did is they created a whole another thing
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:50.600]   that everyone is going to start using.
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:52.240]   And then people are going to decide they don't want
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:53.360]   to use their Facebook app anymore.
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:54.800]   And that's fine with them.
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:57.240]   But they didn't force everybody into an update.
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:35:59.480]   Some people really like their Facebook app.
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:02.800]   And they're letting people see that this is a lot better
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:04.560]   and choose that.
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:06.440]   And what you're not seeing is the big upset
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:08.080]   that you would see if they tried to just change
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:09.800]   the interface of the Facebook app.
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:12.040]   I think we're going to see Facebook apps for different users.
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:15.440]   So especially people who live on high latency, low bandwidth
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:16.920]   networks of the kind of world.
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:18.080]   This is not for that.
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:21.520]   We're going to see versions that use less bandwidth.
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:23.200]   And then this-- one of the things I love
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:26.600]   is when you have an image, if you rotate it, it will show you--
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:29.240]   It get parent-- not on all images and other ones.
[01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:31.240]   And we'll do that with some of your images, too.
[01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:32.840]   It's hard to know when it's going to do that.
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:34.120]   That's the only thing.
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:36.520]   You see it is doing this kind of motion thing.
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:38.360]   And you can move stuff around.
[01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:39.680]   It's an incredible app.
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:41.880]   It is state of the art in iOS.
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:43.160]   And one of the things I love about it
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:46.560]   is how it teaches you as you go, as you get in a voice
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:47.800]   over with different tutorials.
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:49.600]   It will pop up and it will say, oh, by the way,
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:51.280]   if you want to know, you could do this.
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:53.680]   And they need to do that because much like Windows 8,
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:55.600]   there's a lot of scroll-y stuff that you may--
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:56.640]   there's not very discovery.
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:58.000]   I would have been totally lost if I had it.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.000]   There's some new mediums in here.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.480]   Exciting idioms, but things that they had to tell you about.
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:02.400]   And they do it gradually.
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:04.800]   It's not like it's one splash screen at the beginning
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:06.120]   where you're supposed to learn the whole thing.
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:08.080]   It's as you get comfortable with something and say, oh, by the way,
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:09.080]   there's something else you can do.
[01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:10.640]   Although I have to admit, I got into it so quickly
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:12.880]   that I was like, it kept on telling me something.
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:14.360]   And then it wants me to go do something.
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:15.600]   I was like, I was reading the article.
[01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:17.440]   I don't want to do that.
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:19.280]   By the way, I've been using it long enough now.
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:20.440]   I don't get any more tutorials.
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:22.320]   It goes away after.
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:24.000]   So that's good news.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.800]   I really think they've done a nice job here.
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:27.040]   This is a beautiful app.
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:30.000]   And you can see I very easily added content categories.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.720]   These are the ones I've put in here, but they have many more.
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:39.000]   I just added LOL, which is going to give me humorous stuff.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.080]   Dimly lit meals for one.
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:44.080]   I'm interested to see how they allow other people to--
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:45.840]   like clipboard to publish.
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:46.360]   You know, to it.
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:47.400]   Well, and they have--
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:49.480]   So when you go to these categories,
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:53.200]   you do see that they have partners.
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:57.560]   So if, for instance, you look at the news category,
[01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:00.160]   you're going to get the partners, including the Huffington
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:02.200]   Post, the Verge, Mashable.
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:03.680]   And that's good, like with the Eliport.
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:04.880]   Anybody can do it at this point.
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:06.040]   I think they still want to--
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:06.760]   They haven't got that yet.
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:08.760]   And there's no way that these are partners.
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:11.400]   You're not able to add your own yet.
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:12.320]   And it's not clear.
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:15.760]   For instance, I'd love to it to be one of these in tech anyway.
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:16.880]   But it's not there.
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:18.080]   So I still think that's an advantage
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:19.480]   that Flipboard has to some degree of--
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:20.000]   It's more open.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.600]   But Facebook's historically never--
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:23.200]   But you know, I think--
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:27.120]   Speaking of new idioms, this just underscores an ongoing thing
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:30.960]   where individual work on operating system level user
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:33.840]   interfaces is not as important anymore.
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:36.320]   Because it seems like every major app that gets released
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:39.360]   doesn't go with an iOS interface or even an Android
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:41.640]   interface, they create something brand new that's
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:43.600]   suited to the app they want to make.
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:46.080]   That, more importantly, can make it a consistent interface
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:47.520]   on both platforms now.
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:48.360]   Yeah.
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:49.120]   Right.
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:51.520]   So I can take a picture.
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:54.640]   I can post--
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:58.840]   So this camera stuff, if I take this picture,
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:00.920]   is this iOS or is this Facebook?
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:04.160]   It's got Instagram filters.
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:05.240]   Those are the iOS filters.
[01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:06.960]   These are the iOS filters.
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:07.640]   It's got enhanced.
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:09.200]   That's iOS also, right?
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:12.320]   The cropping, the rotation, all that stuff.
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:17.200]   So it's just using the camera app then to do that.
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:19.640]   Yeah, really quite nicely done, I think.
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:24.560]   Is it a good thing or a bad thing when a company comes up
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:27.920]   with a new app and you think, wow, you're sure this was
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:29.360]   developed by Facebook?
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:30.680]   It's too good.
[01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:31.360]   It's a good thing.
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:32.680]   The inner team is phenomenal.
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:33.840]   Yeah.
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:34.360]   Yeah.
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:35.560]   It's definitely a good thing.
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:36.400]   That's how you--
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:38.400]   Facebook was looking for the ancient.
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:42.240]   Comparing to the web interface, which to me is still just way
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:44.480]   too cluttered, way too confusing.
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:48.520]   And you almost think that it tricks you into publishing
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:51.040]   things and sharing things you don't want to share because it's
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:52.360]   just so muddled.
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:55.120]   When you see it that this same company produced an app like
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:57.680]   this, you wonder if that's actually part of the marketing
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:01.760]   strategy to trick the web users and to sort of bring in the
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:02.880]   mobile users.
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:05.280]   Well, Facebook for a long time was sort of the poster
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:08.920]   child for HTML5 and JavaScript and universal
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:10.040]   applications.
[01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:12.560]   And it hasn't been so long since they actually devoted
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:15.560]   themselves to doing native versions of the Facebook app.
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:20.480]   And I think this is a natural fruit that that is bearing.
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:22.240]   Well, it's worth the download anyway.
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:24.480]   You just search for paper by Facebook, I guess.
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:26.680]   What's really interesting is they use their new origami tool
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:27.640]   to prototype all this.
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:29.520]   And if you go to the trouble of making a tool like that, it's
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:31.600]   probably not the only app you're going to use.
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:33.360]   Oh, interesting.
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.320]   Interesting.
[01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:35.880]   Let's take a break.
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:36.320]   We come back.
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:39.200]   Your picks of the week, Aaron Hillagas is here from
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:41.000]   Big Nerd Ranch.
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.840]   Alex Lindsey from the Pixelcore.
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:44.880]   Renee Ritchie, iMore.com from the Chicago Sun
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:47.800]   Times, Andy Enocho, or a show they brought to you by 99
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:48.680]   designs.com.
[01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:49.840]   Design is everything.
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:53.080]   But when you look at that Facebook app, compared to the
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:56.240]   old Facebook app, you can see design is what makes it
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:57.840]   usable, what makes it great.
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:00.200]   And just because you're a programmer or a chef or you have
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:02.960]   a business doesn't mean you're good at design, stop doing
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:04.000]   your own design, folks.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.880]   Unless you're a designer, leave it to the pros.
[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:09.040]   That's where 99 designs can really help.
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:12.720]   There are more than a quarter of a million graphic designers
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:14.800]   waiting for you to post a contest.
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:16.600]   That's what they call it in 99 designs.
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:17.840]   You say what you want to do.
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:20.640]   Do you want to do a t-shirt or stationary?
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:23.280]   Do you want to design a new website or a mobile app?
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:24.760]   You want a new logo?
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:27.320]   You post the contest on 99designs.com.
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:28.920]   Cost you nothing to do that.
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:31.000]   The designer submits ideas.
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.080]   You can work with the designers to refine them, pick the
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:39.160]   one you want, and then pay the price as low as $199.
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:41.040]   It is fantastic.
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:46.240]   And when you visit 99designs.com/mbw, you'll get a $99
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:48.080]   power pack of services absolutely free.
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:50.800]   A power pack gives you more designer time and attention.
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:53.600]   99 designs will bold and highlight and feature your
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:54.920]   design project.
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:57.040]   And the 99 designs marketplace, that means more
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:58.360]   designers will notice.
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:00.480]   You get about twice as many designs.
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:01.240]   That's all for free.
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:06.320]   If you go to 99designs.com/mbw.
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:08.880]   If you're a great chef, have a great menu.
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:11.800]   If you are a great programmer, your app could have great
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:13.800]   design too.
[01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:15.560]   Too many people think they can do it themselves.
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:16.920]   Get some help.
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:21.920]   278,000, 403 designers await you.
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:23.000]   493.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:23.960]   Look at that.
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:28.600]   Designers await for you at 99designs.com.
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:31.440]   Make sure you go to 99designs.com/mbw.
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:33.520]   Get that power pack of savings.
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:36.120]   Time for a picks of the week.
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:37.040]   I'm going to give a little credit.
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:38.040]   I'll start.
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:39.040]   Anybody have an iPhone here?
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:40.040]   Yeah.
[01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:42.040]   So I'm going to have you do this.
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:43.040]   To get on my pocket.
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:44.040]   I'm going to go.
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:45.040]   Well, Alex is busy.
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:47.560]   So you can all follow along at home.
[01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:49.880]   There's been complaints about the fingerprint recognition
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:52.560]   on the iPhone, particularly a fingerprint fade,
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:54.720]   after a period of time you lose it.
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:58.120]   Now Steve Gibson, our security guy, found a very
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:00.280]   interesting thing.
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:02.480]   And I think you should all try this at home.
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:05.680]   Turns out you can over train the fingerprint reader.
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:09.000]   As it stands right now when you train it for a finger, you tap it
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.320]   what five times and it will slowly add to the pattern.
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:14.000]   And then finally says, OK, I got enough.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:19.640]   Steve says, you know, you could go on hundreds of times and the more readings you give it,
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:21.560]   the more accurate the fingerprint read is going to be.
[01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:26.200]   But Apple quite reasonably decided, well, we're going to limit this to say a five or
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:28.120]   eight nodes and that'll be enough.
[01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:32.960]   Well, it turns out you can over train it on your iPhone right now.
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:38.600]   If you go to the interface where it says, I want to train it for touch, what do they
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:41.080]   call it, the one touch or whatever?
[01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:42.080]   Touch ID.
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:43.080]   Touch ID.
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:44.800]   You do this Renee and see if it works for you.
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:49.280]   You go into the settings for touch ID, where it lists all your touch IDs.
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:56.880]   Now if you tap one and start tapping the thing, start doing readings, it will add nodes.
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:43:59.520]   I can't show anybody because nobody's got an iPhone right here.
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:00.520]   I'm doing it.
[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:03.760]   It will add nodes and we'll do it as long as you want.
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:08.720]   Steve says he's done it, you know, like literally bunches and bunches of times.
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:09.720]   And this is solved it.
[01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:14.360]   Now Steve discovered this, but I guess others have now picked up on it.
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:17.000]   Over training touch ID.
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:18.520]   I'm glad others have heard about it.
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:19.520]   Did they give Steve?
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:20.520]   Yep, they did.
[01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:21.520]   Thank you, Alice.
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:22.520]   Oh, that's you.
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:23.520]   Well, there you go.
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:25.640]   And I'm more than I'm more.com.
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:26.640]   Yay.
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:27.640]   Thank you.
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:28.720]   Figures you'd give us credit.
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:31.680]   So that is my tip.
[01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:36.960]   If you want touch ID to be much, much more accurate, by the way, you could still have,
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:40.280]   you know, five different fingers with touch ID.
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:42.760]   I have an incoming phone call.
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:47.360]   Unfortunately, all my devices ring.
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:48.840]   It'll stop in a moment.
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:51.360]   I don't know what that is.
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:53.120]   Somebody somewhere else.
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:57.680]   If you have, you still can have all your five fingerprints if you want and just over train
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:44:58.680]   each one.
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:00.080]   There's plenty of space.
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:01.080]   So very interesting tip.
[01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:03.520]   I don't know why no one figured that out.
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:11.680]   But if you want to know more, Alice has done a great job of summarizing at imore.com.
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:16.480]   And a lot of credit to Steve Gibson, who is, you know, just kind of a nutty guy.
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:18.360]   Man, he figured it out.
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:20.480]   He says, I'm not happy.
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:21.720]   I'm not going to do this.
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:26.120]   So you pick your fingerprint and then just keep tapping it.
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:28.800]   Apples never said anything about this.
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:29.800]   Maybe they will.
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:32.080]   Renee Richie, what do you got for us?
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:33.960]   So there's a developer named Jarrah Sinclair.
[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:35.320]   He's a very thoughtful developer.
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:39.200]   He posts a lot of really good comments when new apps come out about how they do interaction
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:40.960]   and how they do design.
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:46.080]   He's got a couple of well-known apps for App.net, including Whisper, which is a messaging app
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:49.000]   and Repost, which is just a general App.net client.
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:54.320]   And he's just put out a new RSS client called, I put it in the chatroom and now the name
[01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:55.320]   escapes me.
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:56.320]   Unread, yeah, exactly.
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:57.800]   Unread an RSS reader.
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:01.640]   And he didn't like the almost mail.app style of RSS readers.
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:04.800]   He preferred a more leisurely, more human approach.
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:10.080]   So he's basically built one that is more like a traditional reading experience.
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:13.240]   He recommends that you might want to prune your RSS feed, get rid of the stuff you don't
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:18.680]   read often because it's not designed for rapid triage of RSS, but really to sit down
[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:22.320]   and read through the great stuff that you subscribe to.
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:23.320]   Very cool.
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:24.320]   He doesn't read.
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:25.320]   He does fantastic designs.
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:26.320]   Yeah.
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:27.320]   iPhone only?
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:29.320]   I believe it's iPhone only now.
[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:32.320]   He's a one-man crew, so I'm guessing he wants to do a really good job on the first one
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:34.320]   and then expand from there.
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:35.320]   $2.99.
[01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:40.480]   Yeah, ever since Google will kill a reader, a lot of people have been rethinking what
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:41.880]   an RSS reader might look like.
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:46.920]   And this uses, you can put in your feed wrangler account or your feed lea account and you download
[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:47.920]   all your RSS.
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:51.200]   Another nice thing about the post-Google reader world is that there's a bunch of different
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:54.840]   services and you can basically just go from app to app until you find the one you really
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:55.840]   like.
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:56.840]   Yes.
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:01.080]   Alex has assembled his tip of the week.
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:04.080]   And when I say assembled, I mean assembled.
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:07.840]   So this is probably the kind of thing they used to make that ad for Apple.
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:08.840]   Finga.
[01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:12.160]   You have attached a cigarette face a lighter.
[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:13.160]   Giant lens.
[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:14.160]   Look at this.
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:15.160]   Look at this.
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:16.160]   Wow.
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:17.760]   So that's an optical zoom lens.
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:18.760]   It's fairly long.
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:20.720]   It's about five inches long.
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:22.400]   And I don't have it quite attached.
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:23.400]   It goes on your iPhone.
[01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:25.400]   And you need a special case, I presume.
[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:27.880]   No, no, so this case is adjustable.
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:29.880]   So it'll work on this one specifically.
[01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:30.880]   We'll work on any.
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:32.880]   Now you can get ones that have I can.
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:36.400]   And I could give you, I can try to give you the brand for this, but this is essentially
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:39.120]   a Chinese manufacturer figured out how to get it from a variety of sources.
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:40.120]   You get it from a variety of sources.
[01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:41.120]   You go to amazon.com.
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:46.000]   They range between $18 and $50 and they're all, I think they're all pretty much the same.
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:47.000]   $18 and $15.
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000]   That's nothing.
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:49.000]   $18 and $52.
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:52.240]   Yeah, but so get the $18 one.
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:53.760]   Well I think they have different.
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:56.720]   This is what makes it different is how it's attaching to the phone.
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:57.840]   So this one will fit.
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:01.480]   I wanted to have one that would fit on my Android phone and my iPhone and my, you know,
[01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:03.040]   different phones.
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:05.120]   It looks a little bit like a lightsaber handle.
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:06.120]   It does.
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:08.120]   And we saw this.
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:13.520]   We were shooting at a location and we saw someone using this and it worked remarkably
[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:14.520]   well.
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:16.520]   So I need to get me one of these.
[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:20.360]   Let me show it on our handheld.
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:23.160]   So if I go to the camera app, right?
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:25.160]   Is that plastic or machine to aluminum?
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:26.160]   It's beautiful.
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:27.160]   It's metal.
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:28.160]   Aluminum.
[01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:29.160]   Aluminum.
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:30.160]   Aluminum machine.
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:31.160]   I don't know.
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:32.160]   Can you, okay, let's see.
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:33.160]   Let me put this somewhere.
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:34.160]   Yeah, okay.
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:35.160]   And then you turn the...
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:36.160]   You might have to go for a round.
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:37.160]   It really was just zoomed for a round.
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:38.800]   Oh, that's just the, yeah, there you go.
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:41.160]   It's tough because I need to give you an angle.
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:43.600]   You can read it at.
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:44.600]   Wow.
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:45.600]   But it's quite a...
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:48.040]   What would you say the focal length is?
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:49.040]   You know, I don't know.
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:51.600]   I just literally just showed up and I wanted to show it.
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:52.600]   It's a light scope.
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:53.600]   Yeah.
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:54.600]   And it's a little bit...
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:56.120]   This little ultra like that everything kind of works.
[01:48:56.120 --> 01:48:58.640]   I think I probably, if I did it again, I'd get one of the ones.
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:48:59.640]   I'm seeing some video editing on this.
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:00.640]   Well, I got it.
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:01.640]   It's not tightened enough yet.
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:02.640]   I've adjusted that.
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:03.640]   Yeah, I've just...
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:04.640]   But the...
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:08.320]   I think that I would probably get one that fits, that is the case.
[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:10.720]   Part of why I also want to do this is that we're actually...
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:11.920]   I know this was some crazy.
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:14.240]   Because a lot of things I do sound crazy.
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:15.240]   But this was actually...
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:17.480]   For Renee, this is for you.
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:18.480]   We're actually...
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:21.360]   The reason I got it with the adjustable thing is actually to see if I got retrofitted onto
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:22.360]   a C120...
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:23.360]   A watch check.
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:24.360]   A watch camp.
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:27.520]   So you'd have actual optical zoom on the watch.
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:32.480]   So the number one reason for it was to play around with attaching lenses to our webcams.
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:36.080]   So anyway, so it happens to work on the iPhone as well, which is why it's a good pick for
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:37.040]   Mac brings.
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:40.360]   We'll put a link in the show notes.
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:47.000]   If you search for on Amazon for magnifier, aluminum, camera, telephoto, you'll find it.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.240]   There's lots of different manufacturers are selling a little bit of them, but it's just
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:50.960]   one Chinese manufacturer that does well.
[01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:51.960]   It's got a little...
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:53.640]   It says 12X, which is quite a bit.
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:54.640]   That's like...
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:55.640]   Yeah.
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:59.400]   And one of the cool things is it does have a quarter 20 mount on the lens.
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:01.200]   So you can actually hang it off.
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:02.360]   Oh, you could have a tripod.
[01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:05.640]   Yeah, you can put a little tripod on the lens and then the iPhone hangs from it.
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:06.960]   But I would get one with the case that I said.
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:09.880]   I got one that was kind of a general purpose for other reasons.
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:12.280]   I'm not totally sure that was the right way to go.
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:14.200]   25 bucks for the one we just saw.
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:15.200]   That's amazing.
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:17.800]   Aaron, you got anything you'd like to share with us?
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:20.000]   I know you have a new book.
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:21.000]   We should share that.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.160]   A very good book for beginners who want to learn.
[01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:26.600]   So the beginning book is Objective C, The Big Nerd Ranch Guide.
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:27.600]   And anyone can read it.
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:29.720]   It moves quickly, but it doesn't assume very much at all.
[01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:31.440]   I think you'd like it a lot.
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:35.960]   And that's really the prequel to our iOS programming book or our cocoa programming book.
[01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:39.200]   And the fourth edition of the iOS book has already gone to the printers.
[01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:41.880]   And it should be in your local bookstore within two weeks.
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:47.120]   Or you could just go to Big Nerd Ranch.com and you'd find it all there, Pilgrim.
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:48.120]   Right.
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:49.120]   And of course we do training.
[01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:51.080]   We just open a new training site near Monterey.
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:52.080]   So the bar is a little...
[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:53.080]   Oh, it's beautiful.
[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:54.080]   The bar is beautiful.
[01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:55.080]   It's beautiful.
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:57.080]   I'm headed down there as soon as I leave here to get to see one of the class.
[01:50:57.080 --> 01:50:58.760]   That's where Ted used to be, the Ted Commons.
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:50:59.760]   Yeah.
[01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:01.360]   And we still teach in Atlanta and Amsterdam.
[01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:04.400]   So there should be somewhere you can get too easily.
[01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:09.680]   And I have to say, I've read the books and taken the class and they are barn on the best classes.
[01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:10.680]   You did it.
[01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:11.680]   Yeah.
[01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:12.760]   If you want to learn how to program it, this is the...
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:15.600]   If you've decided you've seen all the code.org stuff and you decide you want to learn how
[01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:16.600]   to write...
[01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:18.600]   No, this is the thing to do.
[01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:19.680]   And then we do corporate training.
[01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:22.960]   So we send instructors to company sites just like Facebook.
[01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:28.520]   Their valuation has gone up by 80 billion since we started teaching them.
[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:29.520]   And you take full credit.
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:31.520]   I take full credit for that.
[01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:32.520]   Yeah.
[01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:33.520]   Yeah.
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:36.600]   By the way, if you get on their Christmas list, they set out the best cookies every year.
[01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:38.440]   We should get you guys to come and do another one here.
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:39.440]   Yeah, that'd be fun.
[01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:40.440]   We'll talk about that.
[01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:43.880]   We'll get a schedule and do it in our little studio over there.
[01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:44.880]   Love it.
[01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:45.880]   Yeah.
[01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:46.880]   Love it.
[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:47.880]   And your pick is marked.
[01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:48.880]   Yeah.
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:53.280]   Every once in a while you come across a utility that does just one thing and does it so beautifully.
[01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:56.160]   And I really wanted to bring attention to this one marked.
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:59.840]   So markdown is a markup language where you can say, "This is a headline and this is
[01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:03.320]   some paragraph text and this is a code sample."
[01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:08.600]   And then this tool renders it into a beautiful readable style.
[01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:10.080]   So it does not an editor.
[01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:14.360]   It just takes what you've written in whatever editor you use.
[01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:17.840]   And every time you save it, it re-renders it so that you can see what it looks like.
[01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:18.840]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:19.840]   Yeah.
[01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:20.840]   Very, very elegant.
[01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:21.840]   It's on the Mac App Store.
[01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:22.840]   It is $3.99.
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:24.800]   Totally worth it.
[01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:28.600]   And M-A-R-K-E-D marked too as I apparently on its way.
[01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:29.600]   That's right.
[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:31.000]   By Brett Terpshire, who's awesome.
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:32.000]   Oh.
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.040]   Of course I know Brett.
[01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:35.120]   What was his other...
[01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:37.680]   He does so many things.
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:38.680]   Envy alt.
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:40.320]   I mean, there's just so many projects.
[01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:41.320]   Yeah.
[01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:42.320]   Neat.
[01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:45.320]   Andy and Aco, your pick of the week.
[01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:50.080]   Mine is sort of a variation on a pick that Alex made about a year ago or something.
[01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:51.920]   Autodesk's 1-2-3-D catch.
[01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:52.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:57.920]   This is that awesome iPhone app where you take a series of photos of an object from
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:02.560]   all angles and then it will upload it to a server that will then send back a 3-D model
[01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:05.800]   of the thing, which is lovely and wonderful.
[01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:08.680]   The difficulty of the app is that you need to have the actual...
[01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:11.840]   Well, you need to have the app and you need to be taking pictures of your phone.
[01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:14.280]   However, in this...
[01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:18.040]   In the time since that recommendation, or at least since I looked at that recommendation,
[01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:21.080]   it is now in addition a fully online tool.
[01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:26.480]   So if you go to 1-2-3-D app.com, you can simply take pictures with whatever camera you have
[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:28.520]   or whatever you want to use.
[01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:33.800]   And then when you get back home, upload it to 1-2-3-D app and it will build a model.
[01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:40.120]   And so over the weekend, I went to the visit of the Concord Museum that has this wonderful
[01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:44.040]   exhibit of Daniel Chester French sculptures and bronzes.
[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:49.200]   He's probably most famous for this piece right here, which is from the Lincoln Memorial
[01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:50.200]   board.
[01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:56.280]   And I really wasn't even explicitly thinking, "Oh, I'll capture this for 3-D."
[01:53:56.280 --> 01:54:00.400]   It's just how often do you get a chance to photograph the Lincoln Memorial from the back
[01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:05.360]   and from the top, unless you're a bird or a maintenance worker at the Lincoln Memorial.
[01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:07.280]   So I was just taking lots and lots of pictures.
[01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:10.520]   And then when I got back, I found that I've been so obsessive about it that, "Yeah, I wonder
[01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:13.000]   if 1-2-3-D app could do anything cool with it."
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.840]   And wasn't really expecting very much, but here is...
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:18.600]   So you weren't even planning to do a 3-D render.
[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:19.600]   Not even really.
[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:22.840]   So here is the 3-D model.
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:26.360]   How long before Google puts this into Auto Awesome?
[01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:27.360]   Wow.
[01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:28.360]   It is just absolutely...
[01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:30.360]   Why does Adobe give this away?
[01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:31.360]   -Oddedes?
[01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:32.360]   -Oddedesk.
[01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:33.360]   -Oddedesk.
[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:34.360]   -Yeah.
[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:35.360]   -Oddedesk.
[01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:36.360]   -And it is just...
[01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:37.360]   -Because they made money on these tools.
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:38.360]   -Well, so this is all based on...
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:40.680]   I believe this is all based on RealViz, which is something...
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:42.560]   A company that they bought, a French company they bought.
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:46.720]   And this is when I started doing photogrammetry, we were using RealViz, which was very manual.
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:47.800]   And this was...
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:52.800]   I think that from an auto-desk perspective, this is still kind of a work-in-play.
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:53.800]   And I think that's a great thing.
[01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:54.800]   And I think that's a great thing.
