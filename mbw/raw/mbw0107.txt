[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.880]   And the old timers are back.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.240]   We've long missed.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.720]   [COUGHING]
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.000]   Merlin Man is still on hiatus.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.520]   I think he's on a hernial hiatus.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.400]   But he'll join us at some point from time to time,
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.360]   but not on a regular basis.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.520]   I'm so glad Annie Enocho is back.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.080]   Annie, by the way, are deepest sympathies.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.480]   I know that must have been very tough for you.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.760]   Yeah, thanks a lot.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.760]   My mom passed away a couple weeks ago after a long illness.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.520]   And yeah, I mean, it's tough.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.480]   But what is-- I don't want to bring people down about it.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.040]   No, no, no.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.720]   This is life.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.720]   This is what happens in life.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.000]   Yeah, but this is an opportunity for me to thank.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.400]   I've been getting so many emails and so many posts to my blog.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.320]   I felt it was sort of a weird thing
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.840]   because I do talk about my mom a lot.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.600]   And I was thinking, well, I haven't actually
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.800]   talked about my mom's illness over the past year
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.840]   because I felt that that was her story and not mine.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.360]   But there came a time where I have to decide, OK,
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.960]   am I never going to talk about mom?
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.040]   Am I going to sort of potentially still around
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.640]   and sort of negate all the courage
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.040]   you showed over the past year?
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.720]   So I made a post to my blog and posted the eulogy
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.040]   that I delivered at her service.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.360]   And again, just nothing but the kindest postings
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.840]   and the kindest emails.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.360]   And you know what's like this?
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.400]   This net we call inter.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.880]   Anytime you post something and you enable comments,
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.520]   you're like, I'm going to enable it.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.200]   But you know what?
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.160]   If someone is a jerk, that's going to be a bad thing.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.560]   But a single person was anything less than really nice
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.920]   and really supportive.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.880]   And so my thanks to everybody who took time to write.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.760]   She's a wonderful woman.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.520]   I think the picture that I posted--
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.520]   Sort of shows.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.600]   What a beautiful picture.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.600]   I mean, almost-- I'm not saying do this.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.120]   I'm using this in a metaphorical sense
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.960]   because that picture is copyrighted.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.720]   So you cannot put it on the Wikipedia.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.840]   But if you need a picture for the Wikipedia page,
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.400]   mom, you will understand the concept when you see
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.120]   this picture on my mom.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.080]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.320]   No kidding.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.480]   And I was really glad that we kind of
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.840]   knew what was going on behind the scenes.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.880]   And you were really there for her in the last year.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.960]   And I think that that's really must be a little bit
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.600]   gratifying for you.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.400]   Yeah, I mean, there's a bunch of us.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.120]   Yeah, I mean, I was her full-time caretaker for like,
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.600]   seven days a week, like 16 hours a day, all year long,
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.760]   which is why my podcasting setups got a little bit more
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.560]   baroque and interesting, as I'd have to say, OK, now, mom,
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.560]   I'm going to be on the porch.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.280]   So go ahead and watch Matlock.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.400]   We've got to burn out here.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.400]   We'll be fine.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.320]   That's why the first week you got to hear
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.640]   mom's Matlock in the next row.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.280]   The next time you got to hear birds outside.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.840]   But again, I also want to thank just the whole Twitch
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.280]   community because it is tough being in one place
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.760]   for all that time.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.360]   And it was always great that I could always
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.440]   look forward to that hour and a half or two hours
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.560]   of just talking to my friends there in the studios
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.800]   and my extended friends who comment on Twitter
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.480]   and other places.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.040]   So I might be writing about the experience more
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.320]   when I get a little bit more distance and perspective.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.320]   I mean, for now, there are a lot of people to thank.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.040]   And I'm glad that I have a microphone in front of me
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.080]   and I can thank so many of them at once.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.360]   Well, we all love you, Andy.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.680]   And we're glad that you're with us.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.840]   And I'm glad that you could be with your mom
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.080]   in her last year because that's something special.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.560]   That's--
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.480]   Absolutely.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.560]   That's something you can look back on and say,
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.120]   I was there for her.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.600]   We're also glad to have Alex Lindsey back
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.480]   from his travels around the world.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.160]   I'm back.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.600]   Yay.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.200]   I've made it.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.080]   Yay.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.720]   Survived.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.640]   You've thrown early back--
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.600]   week after you get back.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.240]   I mean, I was back last week, but you really--
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.240]   it takes a week to make sure that your actual back.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.800]   Thrown out of-- where were you thrown out of--
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.160]   Rhodesian?
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.920]   I wasn't thrown out.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.560]   I just wasn't allowed to enter Nigeria.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.920]   That's your airspace.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.000]   That is-- I would be trying to get someone
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.360]   to update my Wikipedia page if I were denied entry to entry.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.360]   That's the point.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.840]   That make you look like a big shot.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.280]   It's like John Lennon or something.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.960]   You know, that's pretty cool stuff.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.400]   I and my 2,000 doses of penicillin and life-giving drugs
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.240]   were turned away at the border.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.520]   Fortunately, I had my disguise get ready.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.800]   My tome of proper film production procedure
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.160]   and how we do it here, that was just too much.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.680]   Oh.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.040]   They couldn't take it?
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.320]   They fear people who speak truth to power.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.200]   They've never had it.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.560]   Hopefully, I get to go back.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.480]   I'm very excited, actually, about going to Nigeria.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.440]   And I'm hopefully going to get a chance to go in the spring.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.880]   So it's just a technical difficulty.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.240]   We talked about last week.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.880]   We know now what happened.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.480]   And we're just glad that you're here with us.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.120]   And we're glad that you don't have any large stock investments,
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.360]   so haven't had any temptation to jump off the roof.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.480]   I don't have any.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.640]   Holy cow.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.040]   That is not why Scott Born is not with us.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.640]   He's actually-- well, maybe it is.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.640]   I don't know.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.280]   He's in the grandstands.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.240]   He went to the mountains.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.440]   It's just weird that, you know, over the past couple weeks
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.720]   those of us who are self-employed and work in technology,
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.960]   it's like--
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.800]   Oh, was it a Gruber who said, who would ever
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.280]   have thought that the person who runs a personal website
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.200]   for employment has a more stable employment that's
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.000]   on a course for low--
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Isn't that weird?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   --isn't that weird?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.840]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.040]   I thought people got hurt by this.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.200]   I'm sorry to be laughing at it, but I'm saying, you know,
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.480]   it's interesting how you can make plans,
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.440]   but you're still at the will at the whims of a god who really
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.760]   likes to be amused and doesn't have access to Nintendo.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.260]   Yeah.
[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.800]   Well, I just find I talk to a lot of people.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.560]   I know we're getting a little off center here,
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.440]   but I talk to a lot of people about how the fact that having
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.000]   lots of different clients and lots of different things
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.640]   that are coming in makes me feel much more stable than having
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.640]   a 401(k) and a poshy job.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.360]   Those are the ones that kind of scare me.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.520]   I find those to be a lot less--
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.720]   Oh, I have a friend who's a stockbroker who's not happy.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.120]   But I think in many ways, one of the things
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.600]   that's a little odd about this is we're
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.080]   all waiting for the other shoe to drop.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.200]   You know, we know that what's happening can't be good,
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.920]   but the tech industry chugs along.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.040]   Apple keeps releasing products.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.480]   In fact, if you look at the numbers,
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.320]   they don't even seem to be going down on tech sales.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.840]   And you just know, well, there's going to be--
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.640]   maybe not, but there seems like there's some other shoes
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.360]   going to drop here.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.640]   And some of you have already felt that pain.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.360]   As I said, my neighbor has been in tears for four days.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.040]   But for the rest of you, rest of us,
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.920]   it's kind of like, OK, you know, a train's coming.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.840]   But the thing we have to remember is
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.120]   is that it got-- it was bad in the '30s,
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.760]   but it doesn't mean that everybody did badly in the '30s.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.640]   And so the thing is, if you're in a niche market,
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.560]   if you're in a growth market, a lot of those
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.120]   are going to grow with or without the general economy
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.320]   moving forward.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.000]   And it's never really slowed down across the board
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.960]   for every industry.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.960]   You never done that.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.920]   You know, we talked a little bit about this on Twitter.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.160]   We'll say this and we'll move on.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.720]   But we talked a little bit about it on Twitter.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.240]   And one of the things that became clear
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.760]   is that if you are in a tech business,
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.720]   if you can hunker down and hang on,
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.480]   we saw this happen in 2000 when the bubble burst.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.040]   Those companies that weren't forced out of business
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.760]   immediately that didn't have a high burn rate
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.800]   or had some money in the bank and they could kind of,
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.480]   you know, slow down and hibernate,
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.120]   those companies emerged stronger.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.400]   And in fact, our big, big companies like Amazon.com,
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.040]   big, big companies now, they did--
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.680]   - That's how we got all our picture.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.520]   - Yeah.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.920]   - All the companies in our building went under,
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.760]   except for us.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.200]   - Lots of air on shares on the market.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.400]   - We had lots of good furniture that we ended up with.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.240]   - Yeah, not so.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.080]   - Good enough.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.560]   - So I guess, you know, certainly,
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.560]   my motivation, I'm sure it's yours as well,
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:53.000]   is to kind of hold the line, stay here,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.160]   keep doing these shows, build an audience.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.960]   We can survive, you know, and e-gattle living,
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.240]   and then be here when the tide turns.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.160]   Let's hope it does.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.480]   Let's talk a little bit about,
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.520]   I mean, there is actually a lot to say.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.480]   We're gonna talk about the App Store
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.320]   in just a little bit.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.000]   I wanna talk about,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.640]   oh no, I forgot, I had a great story.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.040]   I wanted to talk with you guys about,
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.600]   that had Mac implications.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.440]   Oh, yes.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:21.000]   I'm a PC.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.320]   I'm giving up, by the way.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.800]   I'm gonna buy a Windows machine in a Zoom
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.320]   because I can see the light now,
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.040]   and I clearly was wrong about the Mac
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.000]   being in any way superior, better, hyper.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.880]   We'll talk about that in just a bit.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.800]   Has Microsoft turned the tables?
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.560]   But first a message from our friends at audible.com.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.960]   We usually put them in the back of the bus.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.600]   We're gonna move them up front
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.320]   and give them a nice spot right at the top of the show
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.880]   'cause we know that Audible
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.200]   has been a wonderful resource for all of us here,
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.960]   all of us Audible listeners.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.400]   If you go to audible.com/macbreak right now,
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.760]   audible.com/macbreak right now,
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.840]   you can get a free audio book from audible.com
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.800]   if you're already signed up for one.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.000]   One of the things we've really had a good time doing
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.120]   since we're all audible listeners here,
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.600]   all like, who isn't it?
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.040]   Is Scott not an Audible listener?
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.240]   I think Scott's not,
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:15.040]   but Alex is and Andy is, and Merlin was and I am.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.280]   And it's always fun to pick a book,
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.960]   something wonderful to read,
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.680]   and Andy, I now know why you've been getting
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.560]   so much reading done.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.600]   You've had some downtime, some downtime
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.160]   where you can get some reading done.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.080]   I've had some downtime and more than that,
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.040]   this is sort of a double whammy year
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.240]   in that I had to move while at the end of while
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.240]   this is going on.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.320]   And I moved, I moved like about another half hour,
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.400]   45 minutes away from my mom's place.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.960]   So I've been really going through audio books in the car
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.120]   because these 45 minute hour long, each way commutes.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.520]   It's fun for a while, I mean, I'm sorry,
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.080]   but they went when she went into hospice.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.720]   It was like, it's fun for a while.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.960]   And then at some point you're like,
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.720]   okay, now let's try that.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.800]   I'm gonna be alone in the car with just my thoughts
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.720]   for about an hour now.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.000]   How about if we listen to Carl Reiner
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.040]   telling me his life story?
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:04.920]   Yes, that'll be much better.
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:05.640]   Good, let's do that.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.920]   Audible is a really big treat.
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:09.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.600]   You have a pick that you'd like to share with us?
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.600]   If not, I do, but I do.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.520]   It's, this is a really good pick for Audible
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.480]   because this was a book that I put down in the bookstore
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.240]   because I thought it was entertaining enough
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.920]   but it just didn't sustain me.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.200]   But they really did a great Audible version of it.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.360]   The book is called World War Z.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.720]   Oh yeah.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.560]   There you go.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.720]   (laughing)
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.760]   By Max Brooks.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.800]   It is not a sequel but a companion
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.880]   to the zombie survival guide
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.400]   which is already written by Max Brooks.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.800]   The first book was all, was about,
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:44.600]   well, if you're attacked by,
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.520]   when zombies attack here, here's what you do.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.120]   He had a really clever idea for the follow up, which is,
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.240]   so let's just pretend that the zombie war happened
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.920]   and let's just do like an oral history.
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.360]   Let's like the PBS, the Civil War only
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.200]   because of the zombie war.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.560]   Were they gonna interview people who survived,
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.720]   survived this big war?
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.520]   You're right, 'cause when I looked at this
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.920]   in the bookstore, I would say, oh, okay, I get the joke.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.280]   I'm not gonna spend whatever it is, 400 pages now,
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.760]   kind of reliving the joke.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.280]   But they did a very different thing with this.
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.000]   They really acted at that.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.840]   Exactly.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.520]   What I didn't like about it as the book is because
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.840]   it really is very, it's more like a comic book series
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.280]   where each monthly comic is a different story.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.240]   So in the book form, it was very hard to really maintain
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.960]   a sort of momentum and really get that sort of,
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.520]   wow, I can't wait to see the next chapter
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.760]   because the next chapter is probably gonna be
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.040]   about something really different.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.640]   But this really works for audiobooks
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.040]   'cause they decided to do it almost as like two dozen
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.280]   different honorable short stories.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.680]   Set in the theme of what happens when zombies attack.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.920]   And I'm just gonna read, I'm on the Wikipedia page
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.080]   that has a list of all the different actors
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.080]   who participated in this in the form of survivors
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.760]   who are giving their stories.
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.240]   Alan Alda, Carl Reiner, Dean Edwards, Mark Hamill,
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.520]   Henry Alphraulans, John Tetero, Rob Reiner, Steve Park.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.000]   I mean, just really, really great people who know
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.600]   how to put their own little spin on these stories.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.560]   So, and it's also on top of everything else,
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.640]   not only does that format really serve the book,
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.720]   it's also a really good service to the concept
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.480]   of audio book formats.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.320]   There are times when I've been listening to an audio book
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.000]   and I just want to get to the end of the chapter
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.800]   because the story is so good.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.000]   And so I'll sit there, I'll burn another bigger hole
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.040]   in the ozone idling in the driveway.
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.720]   You know, let's listen to the end of the chapter.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.120]   These are things that you can consume
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.520]   in nice bite-sized chunks.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.360]   And you can leave the car with a very, very satisfied
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.960]   experience that you reach the end of something.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.560]   But then when you get back to the car the next day,
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.160]   hey, you got a whole new chapter to go through.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.000]   - You know, it's cool.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.560]   I didn't know Max Brooks was Melbrook's son.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.480]   - Yep.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.120]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.800]   - Yeah, I mean, I don't know what it was
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.320]   about what was going on in the writers room
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.680]   of your show of shows, but there's a lot of people
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.720]   who are working on that show that had a lot of kids
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.960]   who are also really, really--
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.800]   - Well, that's true, Rob.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.080]   Reiner's car, Reiner's son, that's right, yeah.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.280]   - And I would have to have more access
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.240]   to Wikipedia to look it up.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.120]   But I know there are a couple other people in that, right?
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.320]   It's a famous enough writer's room as it is.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.240]   But then you start to look at, oh, well, actually,
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.600]   they were smart enough people and good enough parents
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.760]   that they raised children that--
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:13.920]   - With funny also.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:14.760]   - Also funny and also--
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.160]   - It has to happen in the roses.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.880]   (laughing)
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.480]   - A good choice, I think a really great choice.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.840]   I don't know what it is about zombies, but people love them.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.320]   This is tongue-in-cheek and fun and good
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.920]   and World War Z and oral history
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.440]   of the zombie war deadpan serious, too, right?
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.240]   I mean, they act as if it happened.
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.280]   - Exactly, and they know how to play.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.800]   It's not necessarily a humor book,
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.000]   but they know how to play the joke.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.680]   They know that once they start going all cat skills,
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.400]   hey, and then the thing when you fight them is,
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.240]   oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.520]   - Humor comes from the fact that they are really taking
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.920]   this very, very seriously, so they don't spoil the joke.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.360]   They don't trip over themselves with the human piece.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.200]   - Very good choice.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.200]   World War Z and oral history of the zombie war.
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:00.800]   Get it free by going to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.320]   This is where audio books really shine
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.920]   when you get these dramatizations.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.560]   But you know, every audio book from Audible
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.360]   is a dramatization in the sense that they pick
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.960]   the best actors, the best readers.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.960]   You're not getting some guy droning on and on.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.080]   They come to life.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.760]   These are wonderful books.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.480]   Not just books, you got radio shows,
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.600]   you've got comedy acts, you've got speeches.
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.200]   It's all there for you and you're gonna love it.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.760]   - And hey, good news for you Microsoft Zoom owners.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.600]   - Yay.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.560]   - In the latest update, Microsoft Zoom,
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.360]   Audible now works with the Zoom.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.880]   - Another reason to switch to the Zoom.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:30.720]   - They're ecumenical.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.320]   They embrace people of all faiths and beliefs.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.160]   (laughing)
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.000]   They don't judge, they just want your money.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.320]   That's, I appreciate that about that.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.640]   - Yeah, I am my Zoom right here
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.520]   and I have to upgrade it to 3.0,
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:45.040]   but I will be putting audio, audible books on it as well.
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.440]   In fact, you know, I've got my Zoom,
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.280]   I've got my Windows PC because
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.080]   now that I've seen the ads, I really have seen the light.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.560]   I was a little, you know, the Jerry Seinfeld Churro
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.840]   pleather shoes didn't, I mean, they got me warmed up,
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.160]   they softened me up, maybe Bill Gates living in my house.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.480]   That was a great fantasy, but now that I know
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.400]   that hip people use PCs, wow.
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.880]   I mean, it was just, you know,
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.360]   I was just waiting to get to come back over.
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.960]   - God, I mean, I'm actually trying to figure out a way
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.040]   that I can turn that into a column
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.520]   without sounding like I'm being just snarky,
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.880]   but it deserves snark.
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.760]   Come on, this deserves snark.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:24.160]   Oh, Leo, it goes beyond snark and goes into sympathy
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.760]   because if I had a friend of mine
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.040]   were, had made that huge reversal
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.880]   that Microsoft has made this summer in their advertising,
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.080]   they have three different campaigns,
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.080]   all of which are the-
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.160]   - Now, do you think this was the plan?
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.920]   - It's just one big giant.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.880]   Well, I know I am, but what are you?
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:43.960]   - Well, here's my question.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.480]   I mean, Alex, you do advertising.
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.040]   Was this their plan to have,
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.480]   to spend $300 million, $10 million on Jerry Seinfeld,
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.440]   do two ads and go, "Whoa."
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.000]   Okay, new campaign, maybe Jerry will be back.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:55.840]   We don't know.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.520]   This is so scattershot.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.440]   - Yeah, it's, it's, someone got upset.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.840]   Someone got upset somewhere.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:04.680]   - Pull the plug.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.520]   - And said, "We have to do something.
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.360]   We have to do something."
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:07.920]   We can't let Apple keep on going down this path.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.000]   And then they said, "We're gonna send out a whole bunch of,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.600]   you know, people to do a bunch of things, you know?"
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.760]   And that's what it sounds like.
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.200]   - It's kind of risky though, isn't it, Andy, if you,
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.160]   if you're the big company, which, you know,
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.160]   your hurts, Apple is not even Ava's.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.280]   And it's kind of, it is a little bit demeaning
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.560]   to have to say, "Wait a minute, no, we're good."
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.600]   It almost acknowledges they exist.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.680]   - That's exactly what I was saying.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:35.120]   I mean, that is, it's unfortunately, it's Microsoft is,
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.800]   let's put aside, you know, our partisan differences
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.480]   and say that Microsoft is a very, very good company.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.960]   They are, I think they play the business game
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.280]   better than Apple and almost any other tech company does it.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.640]   But they also make some great products
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.160]   and some of the smartest people I know
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.320]   who work in tech work for Microsoft.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.520]   It actually does make me a little bit sympathetic
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.040]   and a little bit disappointed that they,
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.960]   their last three campaigns all coming in the past month
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:01.000]   take this tack of, "Stop hitting us, stop hitting us,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.480]   please stop hitting us, we're tired of getting here."
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.440]   First they come up with a Windows Mojave experience
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.720]   in which they're saying, "It's a good operating system.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.320]   It's just that, you know, it's getting bad press
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.160]   and that's not fair.
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.520]   I don't know why you're picking on us."
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.120]   Why don't you like us?
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.600]   And then you have the campaign with Seinfeld
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.440]   in which they do everything but talk about
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.440]   what's good about Microsoft.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.560]   Explain that to me 'cause I don't understand that at all.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.640]   Yeah, I mean, it's, I, the first one is,
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.480]   it was actually, it actually mirrored my experience
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.880]   watching Lost because when I saw the first one,
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.520]   knowing that's part of a series,
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.800]   I thought, actually, this is interesting.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.840]   If I were writing 12 commercials
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.720]   and I knew that I was good for 12,
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.520]   I might write a first commercial like this
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.360]   that was just bizarre and would get people
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.360]   like, "What is it?"
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.360]   Yeah. And get them hooked up.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.360]   But then you sort of think that--
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.360]   It gets me better.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.000]   I think you see the second one and then that's,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.080]   I also left Lost after the second or third episode saying,
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.600]   "I bet this is probably not gonna actually go anywhere,
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.080]   so I'm not gonna keep following this."
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.120]   But, but, but, but--
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.240]   Well, but I see, I wonder though,
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.880]   because I don't think they were given a chance.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.240]   I think whoever pulled the plug, basically,
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:06.040]   didn't, clearly this, this, this campaign
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.560]   was a longer campaign.
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.440]   Clearly, the Jerry and Bill thing was gonna be developed
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.160]   into more, I thought it was gonna be a sitcom.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.880]   I actually thought, "Hey, this is kind of innovative.
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.480]   They're getting a lot of talk.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.640]   It's a little weird, but they're getting,
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.440]   I mean, how many people went into YouTube
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.400]   or windows.com and actually watched
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.880]   the whole three minute commercial?
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.600]   I mean, how many commercials do you get that?
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.440]   I thought they were getting their money's worth,
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:29.400]   but then they pulled the plug before there's any payoff.
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.320]   Yeah, which is sort of like admitting that this was a,
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.600]   we think, we now think this was a bad idea to start with
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.360]   and we're not gonna waste any more ad dollars on it.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.040]   We're asked these, that's a certain,
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.080]   this is something that Apple has definitely mastered,
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.720]   that you definitely haven't had that arrogance
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.080]   to maintain your forward momentum,
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.000]   to insist that, "No, this is the right plan.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.920]   Some people aren't gonna get it, but we're okay with that.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.120]   We wanna target it towards the people
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.320]   who are gonna get this."
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.120]   But I mean, I really think that Microsoft should,
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.920]   and then there's the I'm a PC ads,
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.080]   which is like, which is again, starts off with,
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.360]   I'm a PC and I've been reduced to a stereotype,
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.760]   which is, again, stop hitting me, please stop hitting me.
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.440]   I really think that if Microsoft wants
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.160]   to create a brand new ad campaign,
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.800]   they should position themselves as,
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.920]   you know what, we are not the Nintendo Wii,
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.680]   we are not this exciting new product,
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.160]   we're like the water company,
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.480]   we are like the electrical company,
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.000]   we are like, we are the company that provides
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.880]   the basic service that you rely on each and every day,
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.680]   even if you don't particularly like computers,
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.920]   even if computers are not part of your lifestyle,
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.520]   if you show up at work and sit down
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.560]   in front of a word processor,
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.000]   we will give you a good word processor
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.680]   that talks to all the other word processors.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.360]   - That sounds kind of a dust, I mean, we need--
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.520]   - But that's okay, you gotta play to your strengths.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:34.640]   Microsoft is not, again, an exciting company.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.600]   They really should sell themselves as the company
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.920]   that they know what they're doing,
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.800]   and they are gonna give you a continuum of experience
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.320]   from year after year after year,
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.200]   which, you know, we are Apple people
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.640]   and we like having new things,
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.400]   we like feeling as though we have the latest features
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.800]   and that we got things a couple years before everybody else,
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.600]   but again, they're people who just want,
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.400]   when I hit the letter A on my keyboard,
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.880]   I wanna see a letter A somewhere in a window on my screen.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.200]   - Yeah, that's not such a bad thing.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.160]   Here's a PC, here's the PC.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.160]   This is on their website.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.120]   - I'm a PC, and I've been turned into a stereotype.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.080]   - I'm a PC, and I'm Sean Siler.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.960]   - Hello, I'm a PC, and I'm a real engineer at Microsoft.
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.480]   - So-- - I'm a program manager.
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:17.120]   - The guy they chose to look like John Hodgeman.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.440]   - I am not a stereotype.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.280]   - Is this guy?
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.320]   - I'm tired of all this, I mean, look at this set.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.760]   This is a good way out there, that's kind of,
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.320]   that's not even a real wall, that's cool.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:30.520]   - It was an email that went out asking for being a spokes coder
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.080]   and ask people to tell their stories.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.520]   - Ah, no, stereotype.
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.720]   - Once they heard that story and got a hand to talk to me
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.400]   about the times, they said--
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.120]   - Tron guy did one of these, by the way.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:40.960]   - Tron guy?
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.960]   - I'm a PC.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.640]   - Even though he's a Mac guy, but he--
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.160]   - Well, and I'm on a point out--
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.000]   - But different.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.560]   - These were produced on Mac.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.400]   So--
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.400]   (laughing)
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.000]   - And most of the time, I think those two Microsoft ads
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.200]   have been produced on Mac, so I mean,
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.560]   that's kind of a reality.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.920]   - Well, but part of this ad is, aren't we hip?
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.760]   We still are cool people do creative things with PCs,
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.320]   except our ad agency decided not to.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:10.560]   - Well, the added, yeah, 90% of ad agencies,
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.640]   are pretty Mac heavy, you know, for promotions.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.000]   - Well, but doesn't that put the light of the ad?
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:15.840]   It's like, well--
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.120]   - Yeah, but I mean, the thing is,
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.880]   is that there are promotions being done,
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.800]   I guarantee there are promotions being done in Apple
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.560]   for some of their pro-abs that have,
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.760]   that probably have graphics being done
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:30.160]   on some other application, on Adobe software or whatever.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.000]   I mean, this kind of stuff--
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.920]   - It's just the way it is.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.760]   - It's just the way it is,
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.200]   because the thing is, is that, you know,
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.120]   you go to an ad agency or you go to someone,
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.080]   not because they use PCs or not because,
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.840]   but because they do great work, you know,
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.520]   Adobe stuff gets done on Apple products,
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.360]   Apple products get done on Adobe products.
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.280]   This is, I think that this is probably,
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.640]   it was a big deal when they,
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.560]   the big one that came out was,
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:58.720]   or 10 years ago when they had the chip flying through the Intel,
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.000]   you know, the Microsoft one where the chip was flying through
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.040]   and landing and everything else,
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.640]   and that was all done on a Mac.
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.200]   But since then, you know,
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.560]   I think that we've kind of gotten used to it.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.920]   I mean, when you talk about the ad agency,
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.240]   when you talk about creatives--
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.760]   - But that's what I'm telling you,
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:14.800]   you've watched the ad, right?
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.480]   That's like they have this musician,
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.640]   that guy with piercings and long hair saying,
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.720]   "Hey man, I use a PC."
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.400]   By the way, they don't say Windows.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.960]   They say PC.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.360]   - Well, theoretically you could be using a Mac.
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.360]   - Oh, 'cause they also don't say, you know,
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.160]   well, I think that's just a tag into Apple's campaign.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.160]   - Yeah, okay, I'm a Mac, I'm a PC, yeah, I guess so.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.960]   - Yeah, I mean-- - This is effective.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.760]   - I don't, I think it's counterproductive.
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.360]   That's one of the first rules of advertising
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.360]   that you don't acknowledge that your--
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.880]   - Right, Coke never talks about Pepsi.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.720]   - Exactly.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.320]   - Oh, imagine Coke saying, "Oh, that Pepsi, it's too sweet."
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.520]   Oh, you won't like Pepsi.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.640]   I mean, that, you're right, there you go.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.240]   - If Coke came out with an ad campaign that said,
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.080]   you know, Pepsi says, "We're not cool,
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.920]   "we're not the new generation."
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.040]   - We are. - They're wrong.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.440]   - They're wrong.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.000]   - Well, they did do the Pepsi challenge,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.680]   but that was, that's, I think that's sort of a different thing.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.840]   - You know, Mike Errington said,
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.040]   and I thought this was kind of interesting,
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.760]   he was ready to slam the ads,
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.600]   and then he said, "But something interesting happened.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.040]   "It did become more difficult for me to watch
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.440]   "the Apple Switch ads without thinking elitists."
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.160]   - Well, at least, well, it also makes it difficult
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.920]   to watch the Apple ads without thinking about Windows.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.520]   So that is-- - Ah, ah.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.200]   - Let's also give Microsoft credit in one way.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:33.200]   Can you imagine, in any of the 83 different parallel earths
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.340]   that I've personally documented,
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.680]   Steve Jobs taking part in a commercial,
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.560]   the way that Mr. Gates took part in those--
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.400]   - No, and I was actually pretty impressed with,
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.960]   well, what I, my free take on the first two commercials
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.640]   is they're great commercials for Bill Gates,
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.360]   who by the way, it's retired.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:55.200]   But boy, he came off as funny, self-deprecating,
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.520]   but by the way, and this is another thing
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.400]   we've been saying on the Windows Weekly show,
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.880]   Bill's videos for CES and Comm decks
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.280]   have always been like that.
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.960]   And we always thought, why aren't,
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.000]   why isn't this side of Bill being shown
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:08.960]   to the general public?
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.440]   Because frankly, he does have these.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.840]   You remember the video they made
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.480]   of Bill's last day at Microsoft?
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.600]   It was very similar, same kind of feel.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.240]   Self-deprecating, funny.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.780]   These are great ads for Bill Gates.
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.520]   - And Churros.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.520]   - Well, that's good because his business now
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.800]   is curing world disease.
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.920]   So if that business takes off, that's the old benefit.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.800]   - That's a good point.
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.200]   What would, Andy, I'm gonna ask you both,
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.240]   but first start with Andy,
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.320]   what should Microsoft be doing in their ads?
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.680]   You say something dull, something boring, something--
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.520]   - Not just dull, I mean, the point of advertising
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.760]   is to sell the thing, the brand new thing you have,
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.800]   or to sell the thing that you have always had,
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.920]   and that is the good spirit of your entire company.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.520]   And once again, you can basically say that,
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.440]   you know what, what look around,
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.840]   you're using Microsoft products all the time,
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.480]   and they are generally speaking, working incredibly well.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.760]   - These ads kind of did this.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.280]   These ads were saying we connected a billion people,
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.400]   were used in big banks, were used by little,
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.440]   I mean, in a way, that's what they said, did a competition.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.600]   - And the way to address Vista,
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.560]   which is, and a lot of the slamps,
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:16.880]   a lot of the slamps is getting about Vista,
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:20.120]   I think, aren't as deserved,
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.560]   aren't as deserved as it has been made out there.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.800]   But if you simply position it as,
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.480]   there were four different versions of Windows before this,
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.400]   there are gonna be a million different versions of Windows
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.040]   after this, that's the point of investing in Microsoft.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.800]   We are not gonna go away, we're not gonna suddenly,
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.120]   we're not gonna suddenly say, you know what,
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.080]   the operating system we've had for the past eight or nine years
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:43.320]   is outdated, is no good, we're gonna force it
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.160]   to learn an entirely different way of doing things.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.800]   And again, here on the max side of the podcasting microphone,
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.720]   we can talk long and hard about how,
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.320]   well, geez, you know, why do we have to,
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.240]   why would we want to have this legacy of OS 9, OS 6,
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.560]   all the system 7 and all that sort of stuff?
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.880]   But again, there are a lot of people
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.160]   who want to turn on their computer
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.040]   and see the same thing month after month, year after year.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:10.320]   If they make the sale that we innovate,
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.440]   but we always do it behind the scenes
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.760]   in such a way that it is not disrupted to the users.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:18.800]   I mean, we forget that OS 10 had to start off with Apple
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:19.920]   saying, you know what,
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.360]   everything that has worked up to now will stop working.
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.360]   Everything that you have learned,
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.720]   at least most of it is gonna be obsolete
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.160]   or gonna require adjustment.
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.480]   We're gonna give you the tools
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.440]   that will help you to make this adjustment,
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.960]   but realize that there's gonna be a huge break
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.320]   between OS 9 and OS 10.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.200]   It'll be a good thing for you in the long run,
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.280]   but realize that it's gonna be a little bit
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.080]   of bumpy road for the next few months.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.360]   I think that if Microsoft did sort of the same thing
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.120]   with Vista, saying that we're gonna give you
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.240]   a lot of the same experience,
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.000]   but we're basically tunneling under the foundations
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.080]   of the house and upgrading all your services.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:56.040]   So, you know, we're gonna keep XP the way it is.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.000]   We're gonna keep updating it,
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.840]   but we're also gonna have this thing called Vista
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.040]   that you can try, you can be on the cusp
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.800]   of this brand new wonderful thing right now.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.200]   In two years, it'll be absolutely 10 times better
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.240]   than what you have right now,
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.240]   but we're not gonna force you to drop your way
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.960]   of doing things and force you to switch
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.840]   to a new way of doing things, until you want to.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.160]   - Alex, what do you think?
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.360]   - Well, I think that Microsoft has to,
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.000]   they have to find the chinks in the arm room
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.480]   because there are chinks in the arm room.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.760]   They can, you know, for Apple,
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.000]   I mean, they don't have to talk about it.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.360]   I mean, they have to talk about what they're doing
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.760]   that's different, but for instance, with the Zoom,
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.560]   I mean, I think that it's, I think that
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.920]   regardless of people will say that subscription doesn't work
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:31.880]   and I think that part of it is,
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.640]   is that people kind of put it out there
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.800]   and then they don't keep on pushing it.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.600]   You know, Apple, one thing about Apple is that they'll just,
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.960]   you know, be thick-headed about whatever direction
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.000]   they're gonna go, and they're just gonna keep on going
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.160]   that direction, and Microsoft has to make that a big deal
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.280]   because I have to admit that for me,
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.240]   every time I buy more and more music from my iPod,
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.240]   I start thinking, you know,
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.240]   I think I'm just gonna get a Zoom
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.440]   so I can just play with music
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.840]   and then when I, you know,
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.520]   so I can just kind of play with all this stuff
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.440]   and figure out, 'cause I just wanna have something
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.560]   that I can play with and decide the songs I like
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.440]   and then I might go back and buy those songs
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:08.080]   for my iPod, but I'm tired of like buying stuff whimsically.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.200]   You know, so the idea is that a Zoom ad campaign
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.840]   that talked about the fact that you can whimsically decide
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:16.440]   what's going on and really building out the advantages
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.160]   that you'd have with a subscription service, for instance,
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.640]   rather than it being always this second,
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.080]   plain second fiddle to the iPod,
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.840]   really showing how you could take advantage of that
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.640]   and really getting into it and, you know,
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.800]   that type of thing or showing, you know,
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.280]   and to some degree they're doing this,
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.680]   but showing people doing great things, you know,
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.520]   with Windows and how Windows makes a difference.
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.600]   Here's what I would do, and I kind of taking off along
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.080]   the lines of what you're talking about.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:44.440]   I think Microsoft's ads should really play
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.920]   along their traditional strengths.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.440]   You know, when you talk to a Windows fanatic,
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.920]   they always say the same things.
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:52.280]   We're cheaper, we have more games, we have more applications.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.240]   We know what the strengths of Windows are.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.000]   I would do a campaign that says,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.080]   Windows is about choice, and I guess they know way
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.000]   when they say Windows, not walls,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.240]   that's what they're saying in a very oblique way,
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.360]   but make it more clear, we give you choice,
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.880]   we give you more applications,
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.000]   we give you more hardware choice.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.720]   Apple's a very limited closed system in that regard.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.560]   It's part of its advantage.
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.520]   We don't have to talk about that.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.800]   We give you choice in the Zoom.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.160]   Alex, just as you're saying,
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:20.560]   listen to any song for 15 bucks a month, any song.
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.920]   You know, if they emphasize that,
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.960]   I think that's the place that Microsoft does have
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.120]   a big strong point, is that there is,
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.800]   it's a much larger ecology,
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.360]   and there is much broader choice.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.000]   Try, you know, play the,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.240]   can you play, you know, the latest games on your Mac?
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.480]   In most cases, no.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.880]   - Yeah, I mean, really,
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.400]   iPhone is very vulnerable.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.600]   If you want to basically paint Apple as,
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.520]   in general, a company that doesn't get it,
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.200]   you can, in many ways, you can pull up the iPhone and say,
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.360]   "Well, here is a cheap-ass phone that I bought for that.
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.280]   "You got for $60 with contract.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.760]   "Here are all the things you can do with it that Apple
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.400]   "will not let you do with an iPhone."
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:03.160]   Hey, look at me, I've just dragged an MP3 file onto the device.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.000]   I'm a friend's house,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.480]   but I'm having to talk with anything.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:08.480]   - Freedom choice. - I just took a memory card
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.320]   out of my camera and put it right in the phone,
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.280]   and I'm looking at showing off pictures on it.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.120]   You know, all that sort of stuff.
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.520]   - You paint Macintosh, you paint Apple as being un-American,
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.880]   as being limited, as being hobbling.
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.280]   I think that there's a real weakness there that they get.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.600]   - Microsoft, if you want the rest of this, $10,000 each,
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.000]   including the first-class airfare,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.400]   - I really think we can bring down Apple
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.960]   and about financial financial.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.240]   - Believe me, I don't want to,
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:34.640]   but I'm just saying that I want the money.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.480]   Let's go. - Okay, let's go
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.320]   for the money.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.480]   - Or actually, let's go to Microsoft Apple bidding war.
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.200]   If Apple will pay us more not to tell Microsoft
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.440]   how to bring the company down.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.280]   - Oh, that's good.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.680]   'Cause I'll tell you, Apple right now is beating the pants
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.040]   off Microsoft in the ad department.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.400]   I mean, there's just no question.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.320]   Every time I watch a Switch ad, I go,
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.640]   God, that was funny, that was creative.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.120]   I don't think, well, that's not technically true,
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.880]   as it often is.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.160]   You know, that's not inaccurate.
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.800]   I just think that's funny, that was good, I like it.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.440]   All right, we're gonna talk actually about one of the things
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.960]   you cannot do with your iPhone.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:11.400]   You absolutely must not ever do with your iPhone,
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.080]   even though you could do it with your iPhone,
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.600]   if you just jailbreak the thing.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.320]   Jailbreak or not to jailbreak,
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.160]   that'll be our topic in just a second.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.360]   And the end, the demise, I'm sorry to say of podcaster,
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.360]   but right now I wanna mention,
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:30.360]   Drobo, we're feeling droopy today, ladies and gentlemen, man.
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.960]   You know, my server on Friday, my server died,
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.320]   we were using a RAID 5 array.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:34.760]   I didn't have any choice 'cause it was off
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:39.120]   at the software data center, and that's how they do these things.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.160]   And you really wish there was a Drobo there?
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:45.360]   Yeah, I posted, okay, the server's down,
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:49.560]   I know we lost a lot of data with a RAID 5 completely died
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.840]   and marked all the disk's bed, and the whole thing went down,
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.480]   and I can't tell you how many Twitter's I got
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.120]   from people saying, "Should've bought a Drobo."
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.960]   (laughing)
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:03.480]   The downside, the downside to being a wise-ass
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.680]   is when you make a mistake, everybody let you know.
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.440]   Yeah, I wish they'd let me had a Drobo in there.
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:11.800]   You know, they charge, I guess all hosting services do this,
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:16.800]   but so I did buy some backup, I bought 200 gigs of backup,
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.840]   $180, not once.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:23.360]   That itself would be twice as much as the going rate,
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:28.200]   $180 a month per month for 200 gigs of backup.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.400]   See if I had a Drobo, I gotta terabyte it,
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.120]   I gotta add 16 terabytes of,
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:38.200]   anyway, Drobo is back, baby, with a new Drobo,
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:42.680]   the Firewire 800, second-generation Drobo,
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.600]   twice as fast as the first-generation Drobo,
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.920]   redundant against hard drive failures better than RAID,
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:51.520]   I learned my lesson, completely expandable.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.400]   You get four drive bays in there,
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.760]   you slide in any drive you want, it adds them all up,
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.880]   you can go up to four terabytes per drive
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.640]   once they release four terabytes.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.840]   I guess the biggest now is what, one and a half terabytes?
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:03.960]   So they keep because--
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.240]   - 175, I think. - 175, wow.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.960]   - Actually, chopping for a new drive for the Drobo
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.360]   to do a little bit of extra.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.320]   - Well, this is a beauty of it,
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:13.000]   'cause so I had my Drobo with older drives
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.280]   and it started running out, so I popped out the smallest drive,
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.680]   popped in the biggest drive I could find,
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:19.520]   and slowly you upgrade it, you don't lose any data.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:20.760]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.640]   Firewire-- - I was at the empty flea market
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:26.640]   on Sunday, and that's a great place to buy
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:28.600]   mechanisms that are not the hot mechanism,
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.160]   but if you have a Drobo, it's like,
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:33.760]   I can buy now like a 500 gig or one terabyte drive
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.400]   for about a third of the cost,
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.480]   like a pull that works just great from old,
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.920]   I mean, it's a really economical way to fill the thing.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.840]   Although I was looking at, they had a big table,
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.880]   I'm thinking, you know what,
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.640]   I should really be the iconic class here
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:47.160]   and buy four 40 gig mechanisms
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:49.800]   and just have a whopping 60 gigs of storage
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.680]   to fall for this little.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.120]   - When I'm telling you that 60 gigs is rock solid.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:55.760]   - There you go.
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.600]   - Well, that's a beauty of it.
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.240]   You can use old, low, slow drives,
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:02.200]   because if one, you know, the data is always secure.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.760]   - Yeah, a lot of-- - It just kills me.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.480]   - Before, with a lot of the stuff before,
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.840]   I mean, one of the things that we worried about
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:09.640]   is we make two copies of everything to regular times,
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:10.800]   and you're constantly making, you know,
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.520]   doubling up drives, and there's a lot of drives for us,
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:17.080]   and so it's nice not to feel like it has to be in two places.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:18.280]   - I attempted to fly to Dallas
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.160]   and Drobo under my arm and say,
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.560]   "Here, can you please just plug this into my server?"
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.560]   But they won't let me do that.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.720]   I did buy extra, it's in house storage,
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:28.280]   and we're gonna use Amazon S3 and have double,
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.440]   'cause we have to do that exactly, Alex.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.480]   We have to make three copies,
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:35.000]   because I don't want this to happen ever, ever, ever again.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.440]   If you had a Drobo-- - Wasn't it good?
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.280]   - Huh?
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.360]   - It wasn't enjoyable for you.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.200]   - You didn't really feel like you're getting back into it.
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.720]   - It isn't, I'm still restoring stuff.
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.080]   You know, Twits Up, the Twit Army Down,
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.840]   Twit forums down.
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.400]   I had backups, but they're kind of spread out,
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.400]   and I'm slowly getting Leo, Phil, back.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.560]   It's just been painful.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.320]   Shoulda had a Drobo.
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:57.120]   So make sure you take advantage of the $25 off coupon
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:02.200]   by going to DROBO.com/Macbreak.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:05.960]   DROBO.com/Macbreak.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:09.160]   Now it's $25 off either the new second generation
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.760]   Firewire Drobo, Firewire 800 USB 2,
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.720]   faster speeds, quieter and cooler operation.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.280]   And by the way, those are specifically for Macs.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.200]   You could put them on Windows,
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.360]   but it's hard to get Firewire 800 on Windows.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.480]   I'm not saying they're saying they're only for Macs,
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.840]   but this is really their saying to Mac people.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.640]   We know you've got Firewire 800,
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.440]   we're gonna make a better one.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.800]   $25 off the old Drobo 2, the USB 2
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.480]   that works on every box easily.
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.040]   Still a great deal.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.640]   In fact, they've lowered the price on that.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:41.640]   Take advantage of it, go to Macbreak.com/DROBO.com/Macbreak
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:48.680]   and enjoy your Drobo and your data will be backed up in peace
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:49.760]   forever.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.040]   I'm so jealous.
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.280]   I wish mine were.
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:56.760]   Put all of your stuff on a Drobo.
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:57.920]   Thank you, Jeff Smith.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.160]   (laughing)
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:03.520]   When we say your stuff, we're talking about data, okay?
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:04.520]   (laughing)
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.840]   Don't send us any pictures
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.280]   'cause we don't enter that sort of stuff.
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.520]   Put all of your junk on a Drobo.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:11.360]   There you go.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.200]   Just made it worse.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.080]   (laughing)
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:17.160]   All right, podcaster, what happened?
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.600]   We've been covering this story from the beginning.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.360]   It's kind of a sad story, really.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.600]   A program that absolutely the iPhone needs,
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.480]   a program that will allow you to subscribe
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:29.480]   to podcasts on the phone, download them on the phone.
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:34.840]   Apple rejects it from the store saying,
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.800]   it duplicates iTunes functionality,
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.240]   which it most emphatically does not.
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.400]   You have to sync to get a podcast on your phone
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.920]   from iTunes.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.280]   The fellow who wrote it,
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.200]   it's Al-America,
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:52.200]   Al-M-E-R-I-C-A.blogspot.com.
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.920]   That's his website.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:57.080]   Said, (laughing)
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.280]   and decided, I thought very cleverly,
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.400]   to release it using Apple's beta program.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:05.560]   So he didn't ask for payment, he said,
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:06.640]   what did he call it?
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:11.640]   Required donation of $10, $9.99.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.600]   You send him an email, he has to send you,
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:17.400]   you have to send him the, was it the IMEI?
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.960]   One of the identifying numbers from your phone.
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.960]   This is how Apple's beta works.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.400]   - This is the only way that if like you were reviewing software
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.440]   and you don't want to have to buy it off the iTunes store
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:30.920]   all the time, the developer can specifically say,
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:35.280]   look, use the technology to sign a specific copy of the app
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.720]   and say, okay, this specific piece of hardware
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.120]   is cool to run this piece of software.
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.960]   - This one's on your, but it does require an identifier
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.680]   from the phone to be in that certificate.
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:45.720]   And they also use it for beta.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.200]   I mean, I think the reason that Apple did this
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.040]   is 'cause developers said,
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.200]   how are we supposed to beta test
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.600]   if you won't let us test it?
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:52.800]   It's top secret.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:56.320]   So they said, well, you can do 100 people in a beta test.
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.720]   So what he was doing is he was selling it to 100 people
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.400]   for 10 bucks each.
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.720]   And then he would change one line of code.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:06.680]   That's the next generation, another 100 people.
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:07.920]   But what's the latest, Alex?
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.560]   Did they shut him down?
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.120]   - They said that basically, I mean, theoretically,
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.400]   I haven't been able to get mine to work
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.160]   and I'm not sure why I bought it.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:18.600]   But theoretically, if you bought it before the 23rd
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.720]   of September, then you would be able to--
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:22.800]   - Today.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.160]   - Today, I guess it's--
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:26.520]   - If you bought it before today, I think,
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.080]   that you'd still be able to use it,
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:30.600]   but they basically are not allowing him
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.560]   to provision anymore.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:33.400]   - They have.
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.400]   - They have. - This was inevitable.
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.480]   - But I mean, what it ensures, by the way,
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.520]   I mean, it was gutsy.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.440]   I think he probably got his money out of it.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.840]   The reason I bought it was just to support the game.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:42.680]   - Yeah, I said I'm an email.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.520]   I never got one back.
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.360]   - But yeah.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:47.400]   - And I mean, I was just in that terrible situation.
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.280]   This is the last week, last week and a half
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:51.480]   of the next edition of my iPhone book.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.720]   And it became, okay, so the podcasting chapter
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.720]   is done and dusted at the end of August.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.360]   Then podcaster comes out.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.680]   Okay, I'm gonna need that chapter back.
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.280]   So I can add a section on podcaster.
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:01.600]   And now I have to say,
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.000]   I'm gonna need that chapter back again,
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.360]   because I don't think people--
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.640]   'Cause I was so sure that at some point,
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.200]   Apple would say, you know what?
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.800]   People are liking this product.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.360]   We have some metrics on what kind of demands
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.240]   it makes on AT&T's network.
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.960]   We think it's pretty much okay.
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.640]   We're gonna allow this to happen.
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.440]   And I mean, what I would like,
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.760]   I could almost respect Apple's position if they said,
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.480]   look, here's the demand that an application like that
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:28.200]   is gonna put on the 3G network.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:32.080]   And if you got, if the entire iPhone's community is okay
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.600]   with in certain locations, bandwidth being dropped down,
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:39.800]   5%, 10%, 15%, because of applications like this one
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:43.000]   that automatically download huge piles of data,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.680]   okay, we'll let you do that.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.000]   But we don't think that's gonna be
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.240]   a really good iPhone experience.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.520]   Now, that's just conjecture,
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.560]   but Apple needs to do something better than simply say,
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:52.680]   oh, this duplicates iTunes functionality,
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:53.600]   and therefore we're banning it.
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.920]   Yeah, yeah, so that makes sense if they said
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.200]   it's about bandwidth, or maybe AT&T
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:01.920]   made about our confidence with AT&T, that might make sense.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.200]   But the thing is, is that him to think round,
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:07.840]   round Robin on Apple pretty much ensures that,
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:08.680]   yeah, he won't be doing that anymore.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.360]   He's done now, yeah.
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.000]   So you thought, you thought Andy did actually Apple.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.440]   You're so, you're so optimistic.
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.600]   You thought Apple might say, wow,
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:19.640]   there's a real demand for this.
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.320]   Let's release it.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:24.360]   Now, always look on the bright side of life.
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.560]   I say, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:31.000]   Yeah, this really is one of the battle fronts of the iPhone.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.200]   And it's only gonna become more important in 2009.
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:38.040]   Just last week, I was shown a certain iPhone app
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:42.000]   that Apple probably will not allow to be distributed
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.440]   via the iTunes store.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.480]   It's an app that I'm not sure whether,
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.040]   I had a long talk with the company
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.600]   about what I could say and what I couldn't say.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.880]   And I'm now a little bit doubtful about what I'm,
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.360]   how much of what I'm allowed to say.
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:55.200]   I'm allowed to say.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.560]   - Are you not talking about Mail Wrangler or?
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:59.240]   - No, I'm talking about an application for streaming video.
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.800]   And I will not, please don't conjecture
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.400]   as to what that is.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.200]   He showed me a working version
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.920]   of this incredible streaming video client.
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:07.840]   The name of the company is one
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:10.240]   that will be familiar to a lot of our listeners.
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.640]   Matter of fact, they showed it off
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:14.680]   just to prove that they could make it work back in January.
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.280]   And they are really in a position where they're thinking,
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.640]   this is so good.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.880]   It shows off the iPhone and our product so well
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.520]   that there must be a way we can get this out.
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:28.240]   And they are seemingly quite determined to find a way
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:31.960]   to get it out with or without Apple's permission.
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:35.880]   Now, if this means that Apple has essentially lit a fire
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:39.040]   and lit a fire underneath the jailbreaking community,
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:42.360]   giving them a legitimacy that they did not have before,
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.400]   I can't think that that's a good thing for Apple.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:49.400]   Because if a podcast becomes available for jail broke phones,
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:53.080]   and suddenly now that there are 100,000 of these copies
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:55.000]   out there are being sold every single month
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.760]   and Apple is not even doing all the bandwidth,
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.000]   paying all the bandwidth costs,
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.880]   but are not getting 30% of each copy sold,
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.720]   that can't be a good thing for Apple, can it?
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:06.880]   - Yeah, I have a hard time believing
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.320]   it's ever gonna be a large percentage though,
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.560]   'cause I know that for me,
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:12.400]   there's a lot of applications that I've seen go by
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.680]   that are for jail broken phones,
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.120]   and I just look at them going, yeah,
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:19.000]   but then I have to deal with that all the time.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   You know, deal with working around all the updates,
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.680]   deal with working around all those other pieces,
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:26.720]   and it's just, I think it's too geeky for 99.9% of the Apple.
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:28.560]   - Oh, even better, so you buy,
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.440]   so now instead of people just buying the iPhone,
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.440]   they'll buy an iPhone and an iPod Touch
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:33.880]   just for jail broke apps,
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:35.720]   just so they keep their phone working.
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.240]   - I think it's safe to jailbreak now, I really do.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:40.880]   - Yeah, it's a lot simpler than it was a year ago.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.920]   As a matter of fact, that's gonna be a chapter
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.200]   in the new book because it is so simple now
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:48.240]   that it's, there's almost no,
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.400]   I wouldn't say there's no reason not to,
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.400]   I'm saying that if you--
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.880]   - There's little downside, there's very little downside.
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:55.520]   - Chiefly is that there's gonna be an update
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.720]   every X months and every X months,
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:00.120]   you're probably going to, that's gonna be a factor
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:02.600]   in how you update to the new version of the operating system.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.440]   - You just have to wait, basically,
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:07.720]   till there's a new tool, then you can update.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:10.840]   - Exactly, and people are so P.O.ed about the idea
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:12.400]   that you even have to jailbreak an iPhone,
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:14.080]   that it's almost like a matter of,
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.440]   boy, if we can get Apple upset,
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:16.480]   and I'm sure they don't care,
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:19.360]   but if we can get Apple upset by maintaining this application,
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:20.760]   boy, we're gonna maintain this application.
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:24.440]   - Right, yeah, 'cause that just kills me.
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.120]   Well, you mentioned Mail Wrangler, Alex,
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:28.440]   that's another tool, I think we talked about last week
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:32.120]   that Apple said no to because it duplicates supposedly
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:35.320]   the functionality of Apple's own iPhone Mail.
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:39.080]   It does not, but Apple could say anything they want.
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:40.520]   - Well, on the other side of it is
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:43.800]   that Trism has said that they're making,
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:47.120]   they've made $250,000 on their little game.
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:51.480]   And they are, one of the Trism developers
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:54.000]   is estimating that any top iPhone app
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.240]   is making roughly five to $10,000 a day.
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.720]   - Shimming Christmas.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.320]   - So the thing is, is that regardless of--
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.800]   - You're gonna do it, you're gonna do it.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.200]   You're not, Dave Weiner says,
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.680]   why would anybody develop for the iPhone
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:08.720]   if Apple could say no to you, well, there's a good reason.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.640]   - Well, and then the thing is, is from a long-term perspective,
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:15.000]   if I was developing something and Apple said no,
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.560]   I would just quickly go, hey, no problem,
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:18.600]   and I'd make another one that,
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.160]   and knowing, I just make another one that was outside
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:23.720]   of that and make my money back, you know what I mean?
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:26.280]   - Right, so you do have a secondary market
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:29.400]   with the jailbroken iPhone, so that is a good point.
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.320]   Although, isn't everything free on the jailbro--
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:34.600]   does anybody charging for software on the jailbrooke?
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:35.440]   - I don't think so.
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:36.600]   - I think it's all free, yeah.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.560]   - Yeah, I don't even know if the infrastructure allows
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:41.720]   if that's sort of, so it would have to write a new application
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:43.720]   that simply acts as the gatekeeper
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.160]   for a so-called commercial software,
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.800]   and I've never seen anything like that.
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:47.640]   - Yeah.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.280]   - But instead of there's so many,
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:52.360]   monetarily there's such a huge benefit to,
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.840]   if you can stay between these two rails,
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:57.160]   and admittedly, people are stepping outside of them
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.880]   and they're upset about that,
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.720]   but I mean, from a developer's point of view,
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:03.120]   and we are developing iPhone apps right now,
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.920]   so we look at it and we just go,
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.160]   is Apple gonna be upset about this?
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.200]   And if they are, we're gonna put that one on the back burner.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:11.360]   - Yeah, but you don't know ahead of time
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:12.480]   what Apple's gonna be upset about.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:13.920]   - Yeah, but I mean, the thing is,
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:17.240]   just look at the apps that Apple provides with the thing,
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:18.640]   and don't make any that look like that.
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.280]   I mean, the thing is,
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:23.040]   there are thousands and thousands and thousands
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:24.560]   of applications that you can write,
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:27.720]   and there is a hundred that are probably a bad idea,
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:28.960]   so stay out of the hundred.
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:30.920]   You know, I mean, that's the thing I get
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:33.400]   that we're all getting our undies all
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:34.240]   and a twist over this,
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.600]   but the thing is, is that the thing,
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.040]   there's such a huge opportunity,
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:39.160]   and then there's this little area
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.640]   that probably is a dangerous place to go,
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.600]   so think that one out,
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.440]   and I get that that reduces some of the whatever,
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:48.560]   but there are a lot of people making a lot of money
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.400]   developing stuff that doesn't go anywhere near this,
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.920]   and at least at the beginning,
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:54.800]   that's where I would put my energy,
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:56.440]   rather than sitting here complaining about it.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:58.400]   That's all, I mean, I mean, you know, it's just--
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:01.000]   - But Apple is giving a pretty big stick
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.280]   to that guy at the company
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:05.480]   who doesn't want to approve your iPhone project.
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:06.680]   - And a huge carrot.
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:08.520]   (laughs)
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:09.360]   - Yeah, true.
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:10.200]   - You know, to match it,
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:11.040]   that's the whole thing is that it's,
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:15.120]   I get that it's a big stick, but it's a huge carrot.
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.400]   - The amount of money and resources
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.920]   being spent to develop this iPhone app
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:19.600]   is absolutely immediate and real.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:20.840]   The amount of money that you could make
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:25.080]   if Apple accepts it is only conjecture, so that thing--
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.680]   - Yeah, I mean, anytime I develop an app,
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:28.560]   anytime we develop an app here,
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:31.280]   when we develop it, we don't know what we're gonna make
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.200]   when we make it, we put a lot of energy into it,
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:35.000]   and then we hope that people buy it,
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.440]   and so far we've bet well.
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:39.280]   We've had a couple of apps that just barely broke even,
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:42.720]   and arguably how you account for it,
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:43.720]   we may have lost money on it,
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:44.640]   but that was a long time ago.
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:47.320]   I mean, for the most part,
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:49.040]   we make calculated risks against that,
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:52.080]   but you're always, and we're, from a developer's point of view,
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:55.840]   we are always at risk every time we write a new application
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.040]   that we're not gonna make any money on it,
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:57.880]   that we're gonna put it out,
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.000]   we're gonna put our show out, and it's not gonna work.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.680]   And that's the reality of developing this stuff.
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:05.120]   - That is the reality, but when you're playing football,
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:07.520]   you take a risk when you suit up and get onto the playing field.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:09.080]   The problem is that Apple is preventing people
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:11.760]   from suiting up and getting onto the playing field.
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.760]   - Yeah, well, they're just controlling it very tightly.
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:19.760]   - Oh, no, they're preventing, it's the idea of, again,
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:23.080]   I can decide that a certain application I wanna write
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.680]   could be successful if I did it really well,
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:26.520]   and there's a market for this,
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.080]   and if I sell it well, I bet there are people out there
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:31.720]   to sell it, it is, I think it does have to be a factor
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:35.040]   that assuming, thinking that, well, there's a great app,
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:37.800]   but let's just hope that Apple lets me sell it.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:40.120]   And I think, I do think you have the right point there,
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:43.920]   that it's not like, gee, if I write a new space invaders game,
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.520]   Apple will prevent me, no, they're not gonna prevent you
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:47.080]   from selling a space invaders game.
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:49.240]   We're talking about things that are very high-band with,
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:52.440]   things that kind of overlap,
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:55.520]   or even maybe even enhance built-in utilities,
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:57.200]   built-in software.
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:00.080]   There's a big, big landmass on that planet
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:01.560]   that if you just stay away from,
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:03.360]   if you just stay away from the place marked,
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:05.120]   here be dragons, you're gonna be cool.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:05.940]   - Why not? - But there are
[00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:07.000]   a lot of good ideas for that.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.600]   - And one thing that I will agree with you on is that,
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:11.720]   that Apple needs to communicate what those rules are,
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:12.920]   much more effectively.
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:16.320]   That's the biggest problem here is not the no-go zones.
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:19.200]   It's the fact that people are walking onto the firing range,
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.040]   not knowing that they're on a firing range.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.440]   And that's what Apple, I think, has today,
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:26.200]   to put up better fences and better signs that say,
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:29.200]   if you're gonna do these, these are just no-goes.
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.920]   And then everyone can kind of sit in those rules,
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:35.520]   but I just feel like a lot of times people go down this path.
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:38.840]   And I admit that I spent most of my high school years
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:45.120]   not breaking the rules, but bending the aggressively.
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:47.320]   - I think we all did, actually.
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:49.480]   - I did some paralegal things with networks
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:50.320]   when I was in high school.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:53.000]   - I think that's unusual among this crowd.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.080]   - And so the thing is, is that for the most part,
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.320]   when I got caught, I was like, okay, I can't.
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:00.120]   I mean, I didn't just break the rule, I bent it.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:04.800]   - I'm helping you to understand what the parameters
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.920]   of this rule are, Mr. Principal.
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.680]   - But you should be thanking me.
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:11.960]   - But it was often explained to me,
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:13.920]   and this is a lesson that I'm now learning as I get
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:17.080]   into my older years, it was often explained
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.360]   that there was a lot of area there
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:20.200]   that I didn't, it was a big part of this field
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.320]   I didn't, that I could go.
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:23.360]   And I just couldn't go with that.
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:26.520]   And I'm sitting there, it's like me every play
[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:28.920]   on a football game, running down just the very edge
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:29.760]   of the sideline.
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:32.840]   - And of course there's something to keep in mind though,
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:35.920]   that it's not, Apple's not gonna own this marketplace
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:38.360]   entirely for very much longer.
[00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:40.600]   Android is coming along in a couple of weeks.
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:43.200]   The new Blackberries, particularly the storm
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.000]   looked very strong.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.160]   - Not only that, think about this.
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:50.080]   For the first 90 days, all downloads
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.920]   from T-Mobile's version of the App Store
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:53.320]   are going to be free.
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:55.920]   - What?
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:59.160]   - For the first 90 days, if you see an application
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.480]   in the App Store and you want it, it's free.
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:03.960]   - Whoa, on which platforms?
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.800]   - I'm sorry, this is on the Google Android platform.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.080]   - It's on Android.
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:07.920]   - It's on Android.
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:10.200]   They are really, it's aggressive.
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:11.200]   - That's aggressive.
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.280]   - Exactly, that is the ultimate middle finger.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.760]   - That's the ultimate middle finger.
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:16.400]   - Right, well that's the ultimate middle figure
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:19.280]   to Apple and potential iPhone users saying,
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:22.600]   here's, you read the news about how Apple's controlling,
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:23.440]   well here's what we're doing.
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:25.680]   Not only are we letting just about anybody develop for it,
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:27.720]   but we're also gonna let you just play wherever you want,
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:28.960]   at least for the first few months.
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:31.080]   I don't, I have to double check my notes,
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:32.920]   I'm not, now that I'm in front of a microphone
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:34.440]   telling lots and lots of people this,
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:35.880]   I don't know whether it's just for,
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:38.000]   I think that that's a reward for earlier adopters.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.920]   I'm certain that it's not anybody who buys
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:44.640]   a T-Mobile G phone in the next year is gonna get it,
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.920]   but at least that's a good opportunity for anybody
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:48.080]   thinking about an iPhone,
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.320]   which is kind of vacillating.
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:51.280]   - The dream is gonna be out.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:54.400]   Do we know exactly when soon, right?
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.280]   - Very soon, sometime with the next two or three weeks,
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:57.120]   I don't even know when I'm gonna--
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:58.240]   - 200 bucks, the price point,
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:51:59.440]   which is a little disappointing.
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:00.440]   - 179 actually, so--
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:01.720]   - 179, okay.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:04.600]   - They'll give you a fast food meal
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:06.960]   and a movie ticket back with your change
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:08.680]   if you buy this instead of an iPhone.
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:09.520]   - Yeah.
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:12.440]   - Only eight gigs of storage, which is really disappointing.
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:15.960]   - No, no additional, you can't put additional storage in?
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:16.960]   - I have to double check that.
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.200]   I know, I don't know what,
[00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.360]   in terms of built in storage,
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:21.240]   there's built in storage in this removable storage,
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:24.560]   it seems odd that they would force you to use up a slot
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:28.880]   when the big deal about having a storage card
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:30.040]   is that they leave that empty
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.120]   and be able to use it whenever you need to use it.
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:35.280]   Not to say, well, I've just taken out my 16 gig card,
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:37.760]   which means that I've just lobotomized my phone.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.400]   - So funny though, that we're saying,
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:41.640]   we're saying only eight gigs, like,
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.360]   I mean, that's still a lot of storage.
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:46.440]   - No, it isn't, not for my users.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:47.760]   I'm a power user.
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:50.920]   - My iPhone is at 16 gigs all the time.
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:51.760]   - Is it really?
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:53.000]   - Wow. - But you're using it
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:53.840]   as an iPod.
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:55.440]   - I don't know if Android is really designed
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:56.760]   to be used like that.
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:57.600]   - Yeah.
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:58.440]   - It has, well, you know, you can buy it.
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:59.720]   - I mean, it's a media player, I'm sure.
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:01.840]   - You can buy MP3s off of it directly,
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:03.800]   wirelessly, just like in the iTunes Store.
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:06.040]   So much of this is beat for beat,
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:08.520]   a response to the feature list of the iPhone.
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:10.520]   - See, if I were Apple, I'm glad to see this.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.400]   I think this is good.
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:12.760]   This is the kind of thing you wanna see.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:16.000]   If they have a free open app store
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.960]   and a thriving third party developer group,
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.240]   maybe a lot, maybe developers
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:22.600]   who are looking at the iPhone are gonna say,
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:25.400]   "You know, maybe we should be doing Android."
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:29.000]   - Yeah, I mean, of course this could buy Google
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   and, you know, right in the butt.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.160]   I mean, you know, the advantage is the way
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:33.200]   that Apple does things.
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.280]   I mean, Apple would never went with a phone
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.680]   that has unreliable software and unreliable OS
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:38.880]   that keeps crashing and freezing.
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:39.720]   - Never.
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:40.560]   - Never.
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:41.400]   - Or at all.
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:43.080]   - No, not Apple.
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:44.920]   - Yeah, see, look at me, I just made a joke.
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:47.440]   (laughing)
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:49.320]   - I think maybe a good analog would be iTunes
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:50.480]   versus the Amazon Store.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.280]   And you notice people still use iTunes,
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:54.680]   even though Amazon's Store's cheaper,
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:56.800]   not protective, higher quality.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:59.600]   - They're using the iTunes Store to shop.
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:00.600]   And then they're moving.
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:01.440]   (laughing)
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:02.600]   They have P3 Store to purchase.
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:05.800]   Again, I think my instant pick of the week
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:08.600]   would be a tool that's that just use a simple Apple script
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:10.720]   to get the song and track information
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:13.520]   that I've simply highlighted in any open iTunes window
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:16.920]   and find the corresponding page on the MP3 Store.
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:18.640]   'Cause that's how I buy music now.
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:21.640]   I use the iTunes app as a shopping experience.
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:25.720]   And if I can get it unlocked and cheaper on the Amazon Store,
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:27.360]   I will purchase it via the Amazon.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:28.440]   - I knew I'd buy it.
[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:30.080]   - After complaining endlessly about it,
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:32.280]   I buy probably 90% of the music I get now.
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:34.040]   - So that's us, I wonder how widespread that is.
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:36.440]   I wonder if that's a general.
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:37.640]   - Yeah, I don't.
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:39.680]   - It is an extra step and a lot of people aren't willing
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:42.720]   to spend, you know, save, oh, for God's sake, 10 cents,
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:45.800]   you know, to have a slightly more complicated experience.
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:47.520]   - Also, we don't know what the development experience is like.
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:49.440]   I'm looking at this article from the guys who,
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:50.720]   at Playnard, who do X-Plane,
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:52.640]   and they said they ported X-Plane
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.960]   in two weeks to the iPhone,
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.360]   and it's an amazingly good port.
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:58.320]   I mean, even they were kind of blown away
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.640]   at the variety of capabilities
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.960]   that the iPhone was allowing them.
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:03.800]   - I like it.
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:05.120]   (laughs)
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:08.120]   - I'm not a big, you know, flight sim guy,
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:10.480]   but I'm pretty impressed.
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:11.720]   It's pretty cool.
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:13.640]   - To have that on your phone.
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:17.600]   - I have never been so entertained by dying so quickly
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.960]   in any game as an X-Plane.
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:23.160]   - It's almost, it's almost fun when, you know,
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:25.600]   I just sort of like try to land on the top of the mountain,
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:28.200]   and then just rolling taxiing bike gravity
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.520]   down the side of the mountain.
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:30.360]   (buzzer sounds)
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.960]   I think, wow, that was a sucky landing,
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:33.320]   but it was beautiful and awesome,
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:35.520]   and I'm very proud of it.
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:38.080]   - All right, we have so much to talk about.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:41.640]   I was gonna try to get Daniel Jockut on the line here.
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:44.280]   He is a developer, an Apple developer does Mars edit
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:45.360]   from Red Swettered Software,
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:47.400]   and I was curious what he thought as a developer.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.840]   And we always talk about,
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:50.560]   well, you're a developer in a way, Alex,
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:52.200]   I mean, you're overseeing developers doing this stuff,
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:54.400]   but I wanna get like kind of from the ground level
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.000]   what these guys are thinking.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.400]   Every time I talk to developers,
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:00.160]   there is a real mix of both frustration
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:02.560]   and excitement about the Apple iPhone store.
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:05.320]   So it's hard to say, you know,
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:09.360]   I think Apple's not, it's not an A+, it's not perfect,
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:11.400]   but on the other hand, it's been a pretty great success,
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:14.640]   and I've loaded up my iPhone with a lot of apps.
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.640]   - Well, and I think that we've seen this over and over
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:19.120]   and over again with Apple,
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.240]   which is that they released something,
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:21.280]   everyone complains about stuff,
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:23.080]   but then everyone keeps on using it.
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:25.120]   You know, the iPod wasn't enough,
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:26.240]   the iTunes wasn't enough,
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:28.120]   the I, you know, and they keep on adding that stuff,
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:29.920]   and we'll complain about it,
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:32.200]   but it still is dominating because it's just easier.
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.680]   You know, I was looking at this article about
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:36.160]   people's 401Ks, and they said,
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:38.800]   when you have to opt out instead of opt in,
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:42.560]   the participation jumps 40 to 85%, you know?
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:44.840]   And it's just, and so the issue is,
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:46.600]   there's a huge population out there.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:47.800]   - Like just lazy. - It's like myself included
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.800]   in some areas that we just don't want to think about it.
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:50.720]   You know?
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:53.000]   And so Apple makes it so that we don't have to think about it.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.720]   You know, I love the fact that I can very quickly and easily,
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:59.720]   I mean, I used to try to buy apps for my trio,
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:02.000]   and it was just like, yeah, it was all the stuff.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.040]   - It's much easier, it's much easier.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.960]   - And I'm sitting here on the app store,
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:06.720]   and I just constantly, oh, I'll have that,
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:08.720]   I'll have that, it's very expensive,
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:10.440]   much more expensive than my trio was.
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:14.040]   - It is, 'cause you just click 'em, but I have to say,
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:15.320]   is there a barrier to entry?
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:16.400]   Can't anybody do this?
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:18.480]   Could Can't T Mobile Store be just as easy,
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:20.480]   just as good working on Android?
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:22.000]   - Probably not.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.760]   You know, that's the, I still think that even with web 2.0
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:27.480]   and Ajax and everything else, I mean,
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:30.400]   the killer app that I still think people are stepping over
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:32.360]   and I've said this a thousand times is that
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:36.640]   Apple has a net application, not a web page.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:37.480]   - Right.
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:39.400]   - And until they get that, they're not gonna,
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:41.240]   every time I see someone on there, I'm like, well,
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:42.720]   they may do well, but they're never gonna compete
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:44.000]   with Apple because they're not building
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.720]   that unified experience.
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:48.400]   - Well, we'll see, I'm gonna, I'm sure you'll do this, Andy,
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:49.840]   and I am, I have a T-Mobile account
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:51.960]   and I, with running a BlackBerry Curve,
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:55.320]   and frankly, the toughest choice is, oh man,
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:57.760]   I would love to get one of these new, the Bold,
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:01.080]   or the Storm, of course the Storm's Verizon only,
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:02.760]   but I'm have to say, I'll probably run out
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:06.000]   and upgrade that Curve to an HTC Dream
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.400]   because that looks like it's gonna be
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:10.280]   a very interesting platform.
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:13.680]   - Yeah, I'm getting mine in about a week and a half,
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:16.200]   they don't know when they'll have a unit available for me,
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:18.080]   but I'm gonna have one pretty soon
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:19.560]   and really look forward to seeing it.
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:21.280]   Although I've just, I've been making sure,
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:23.240]   I've been double checking some of my facts here
[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:25.480]   and I've come across T-Mobile now has an ad up.
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:29.880]   If you don't think they're taking aim at the iPhone,
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:33.640]   they had her first tooth, their phone as funner or...
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:35.900]   (laughing)
[00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:38.880]   - Now, what do you think of the design?
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:40.880]   - It looks a little clunky, doesn't it?
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:42.280]   - It looks a little clunky, it looks a little
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:43.440]   (mumbling)
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:46.600]   It's available in both white and brown.
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:47.440]   (laughing)
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:49.080]   So, that is very soon.
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:50.400]   - That is very soon.
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:54.680]   - For a very corduroy oriented phone, you definitely have.
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:57.520]   - I'm running this though page.
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:00.360]   One touch Google search.
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:03.040]   - Wow.
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:06.400]   - I don't know, it looks to me,
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.360]   it looks a little bit like a,
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:11.560]   maybe one of those old palms, I mean, it's kind of clunky.
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:12.560]   - It's a little clunky, but you know,
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:14.560]   it has a big fold out keyboard
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:17.800]   and that is not game set and match, but game and set
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:19.040]   for a lot of difference.
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:21.440]   - It makes a difference for me, I have to say.
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:23.840]   I really don't like that touchscreen keyboard.
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:25.800]   - I don't like fold out keyboards of any kind.
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:27.600]   I like the virtual keyboard,
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:29.880]   but I'm definitely the minority on that opinion.
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:33.200]   - Let's not forget that HTC has a lot
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:35.600]   of experience designing this kind of phone.
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:37.400]   - They are the company that design basically
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:39.960]   almost every phone you saw on every store
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:41.480]   before they realize that, wait a minute,
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:44.560]   we can make more money by, instead of just selling Samsung
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:46.240]   and selling all these other companies their phones,
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:48.400]   we can sell our own on our own name brand.
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:50.040]   So they are very good at what they do.
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:54.400]   - I kept my T-Mobile phone number for this very reason.
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:56.640]   Should be interesting, they call it the G1.
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:59.840]   - The G1, room for advancement.
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.080]   - All right, let's take a break.
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.200]   We're gonna come back with your picks.
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.440]   There's so much more to talk about as usual.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.960]   We never have enough time.
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.800]   Partly it's 'cause I think it's just so much fun
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:10.200]   to gas with these guys.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.480]   Scott will be back with us next week
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:12.840]   from the Grand Tetons.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.680]   I'm sure he'd want us to say, by the way,
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:17.640]   twpphoto.com.
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:20.440]   I'm gonna give him a plug, twpphoto.com.
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:21.680]   - One thing I wanna make sure we don't miss
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:24.560]   is that Adobe had a big announcement today.
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:25.400]   - Oh, what was it?
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.440]   I know Lightroom 2.1 is out.
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:27.520]   What is it?
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.040]   - They release CS4.
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.760]   - Oh, it's released?
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:31.600]   - Released.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:32.680]   - Well, it's announced.
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:33.520]   I'm not sure.
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:34.360]   - And that's the photo, Kina?
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:37.720]   - They are, well, they just announced that it's been kind of,
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:40.720]   I don't think they were paying attention to photo, Kina.
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.080]   But, I mean, from their point of view,
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:45.120]   but it is a huge upgrade.
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:45.960]   - Oh.
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:46.800]   - I saw it last week.
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.680]   - As a matter of fact, someone broke 'em bar go,
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.760]   so they had to basically release the news
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:52.760]   like last night instead of today.
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:54.320]   - Yeah, I think it was in gadget.
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.920]   Yeah, I saw it on end gadget.
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.360]   - Okay, well, let's pause, and let's not pause.
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:01.760]   Let's keep going because that is a huge story.
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:02.600]   - Yeah, it's.
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:03.960]   - CS4, what's new?
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.040]   - First of all, it's all in, it's it.
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.360]   Well, no, it was Intel with CS3.
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:08.200]   I mean, what is it?
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.200]   - Well, the thing that some people are upset about
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:14.720]   but is just inevitable at the current time
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.320]   is that it's not 64-bit on the Mac,
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:17.760]   and it is 64-bit on the PC.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.400]   - Oh, that was it, yeah.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:21.600]   - They said they just couldn't move everything over to Coco,
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.480]   and they're not promising when they're gonna do that,
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.800]   you know, from the carbon.
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:27.320]   So that's the, but then, you know, there's a lot of upgrades
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:29.320]   as far as the speed and performance-based
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.880]   on OpenGL performance and everything else.
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:35.880]   They brought 3D into a lot more 3D into Photoshop.
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:40.560]   So now you can really bring, you can import OBJs, you know,
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:42.840]   3D models into Photoshop and work with them.
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.520]   You can then export those out as, you know,
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.360]   you can paint them, play with them, so on, so forth,
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.960]   export them out to After Effects, After Effects can now,
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:50.200]   instead of just using planes,
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.400]   can you be using whole 3D objects,
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.280]   which is pretty exciting.
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:56.600]   There's a lot more of the unification, you know,
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:59.520]   that we're seeing between After Effects and Premiere,
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.560]   and Flash, After Effects and Flash, you know,
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:05.680]   there's a lot of those pieces that are-
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.960]   - If I'm not doing that kind of stuff,
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:10.360]   if I'm just using it as a graphics program,
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.520]   of, you know, of a photographer or an illustrator,
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.360]   compelling-
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:15.840]   - You'll see. - Oh, yeah, no.
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:19.480]   But what I love about it is that they've really consolidated
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:20.640]   a lot of the interface.
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:23.000]   A lot of the interface is a lot more visible.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.720]   Like, I was using Photoshop for years
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:32.120]   and making burn and dodge adjustments, you know,
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.760]   with Gee, that's a good picture,
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.200]   but I think that the dog in the foreground
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.040]   is a little bit too dark.
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:37.800]   I'll just lighten him up with a burn and dodge tool.
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:40.440]   I was doing that for years before, you know,
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:41.760]   sitting in on a seminar and learning that,
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.360]   no, that's the obvious way to do it,
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.320]   but that's the wrong way to do it.
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:46.120]   What you want to do is you want to use adjustment layers,
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.320]   and here's how to do that.
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.480]   And so many of the greatest features in Photoshop
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:50.400]   are exactly like that.
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.320]   Now they've all been brought to the front.
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:54.600]   There is a big tool, much bigger tool palette,
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:57.360]   in which I wouldn't go so far as to say
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:00.200]   that image adjustments have now been relegated to workflows,
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.480]   but it's still, it's very, very easy to say,
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.640]   I want to adjust this part of the image.
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:05.840]   How do I go out and do that?
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.360]   Well, it turns out that all the tools you need
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.400]   to make that adjustment happen to be grouped together
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:11.200]   and right in front of your face.
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.040]   I think for that reason alone,
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.360]   it's going to be a really big deal.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.920]   The other thing is that this is something
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:18.200]   that I don't think they're going to be releasing
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:20.880]   day in date with CS4, but it's going to be out
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:21.880]   in a couple of weeks after that
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:24.680]   as a free little utility or free little update.
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:27.760]   You have that it's going to be the ability through Adobe Air
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:31.000]   to create essentially your own layer
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.040]   of Photoshop interface so that if you're in the,
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:37.120]   if your business is just doing pretty much the same set
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:41.120]   of edits to the same sort of like astronomical photos,
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:43.040]   the same, basically a lot of you stuff
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.400]   is just basically busy work,
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.240]   but very, very technical busy work.
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.080]   And you would like to, instead of having the guy
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:50.640]   that you pay $70,000 a year for,
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:53.360]   you have it tying up his time two hours a day,
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:55.360]   you want the intern that you're paying nothing to
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.960]   or the college kid that you're paying nothing to
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:57.960]   to be able to do it.
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:00.120]   The guy who gets $70,000 a year,
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:02.760]   he spends a couple of hours building this tool palette
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.800]   that says, look, click this, then select something,
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:09.080]   then press that button, then press that button,
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.320]   not just a simple idea of triggering scripts,
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.640]   but basically putting the buttons on the menus
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:16.320]   and the features into a sort of linear order
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.520]   and a different sort of layout.
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:20.160]   It's also going to be great for designing Photoshop tutorials.
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:22.480]   If that helps you imagine what we're talking about here,
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:23.480]   where again, you don't have to say,
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:26.120]   now go into the history menu and turn on this,
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.400]   it'll be, now click this button
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:29.720]   and that's, we've basically taken this feature
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:32.880]   out of the dialog box where it's very two layers deep
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:34.200]   and put it in a button right here.
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.040]   So click on that and they'll make you happy.
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:38.720]   - Not cheap, you'll be spending as much as this
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:40.720]   as you would on a new MacBook Pro.
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.640]   - If you buy the whole thing, I mean,
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:45.440]   if you can get Photoshop for 600, right?
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:47.800]   - I think that's the, but a lot of people
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.640]   are upgrading, most people are upgrading.
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.600]   And so the, a couple of other things
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.080]   that I think are really important is the 3D object
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:54.880]   stuff that they're adding,
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:56.280]   being able to bring in whole 3D objects
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:57.680]   and really work with them.
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:58.880]   They keep on moving down this path.
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.280]   There's somewhere down the path,
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:02.040]   we're going to get to a point where we're buying
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.600]   3D objects as stock.
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.280]   So anytime you want a telephone,
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:06.600]   you can add a telephone to Photoshop
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:07.880]   and look at it from any angle,
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:09.320]   relight it, do all that other stuff
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:11.360]   when you're building your ad campaign
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:13.400]   or putting together your website,
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:14.760]   if you want to build cool little icons
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:16.680]   or whatever, instead of just having to go to iStock
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:19.160]   and find the one photo that makes sense
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.840]   for you, you can change that angle.
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:23.240]   And I think that that's something that
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:26.520]   we're going to see continuing to progress.
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:28.440]   Another, a couple other really cool things
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:30.480]   just to kind of, for people who are playing with this
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:32.200]   is content-aware scaling.
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:33.120]   So you take it.
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.480]   - That was, that's like, that's Ninja magic.
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:36.320]   (laughing)
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:37.800]   - It's just like, I saw this.
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:40.160]   You love, if you're giving me a demo of your product
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:42.960]   and you hear me say, wait, what, do you do that again?
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:44.720]   - Yeah, that means that I like that.
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.920]   Because you, yeah, let's you go.
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:48.360]   - So it basically, you have a bunch of people,
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.040]   they have an example, we have a bunch of people
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.320]   and you stretch the image out.
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:54.240]   Well, it figures out, oh, the stuff in the background,
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:56.400]   we'll just stretch that out.
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.880]   But the people, the individual objects that are important,
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.240]   like the people, they don't get wider.
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:03.600]   They, it cuts them out and keeps them where they are.
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:06.240]   And it does it without you doing any work.
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.600]   You know, that used to be something
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:09.320]   that took us a lot of time.
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:10.320]   - It might too.
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:12.320]   - Like the most, it was a shot of like four surfers
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:13.720]   just like waiting for a wave to come in,
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:14.960]   like floating on their boards,
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:16.360]   but they're kind of like all spread out.
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:18.560]   And there's no way to make that fit like in,
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:20.320]   like a regular screen format.
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:22.400]   So you just, you know, draw a rectangle,
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.720]   you know, draw a rectangle, grab a handle,
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:26.720]   drag it from right to left.
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:30.880]   The surfers get closer together, but they don't distort.
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:33.000]   And if you are in a situation where it can't figure out
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.480]   things correctly, you can either just make a couple
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:38.360]   of quick selections saying, these don't do anything to.
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:41.040]   You can even say, look, anything that has skin tone on it.
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:43.080]   That's important, don't distort that.
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.840]   It really is something that I'm already looking
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:48.400]   for photos that, okay, let me still get really bizarre,
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.400]   stupid looking pictures just to see if I can get it
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:51.600]   to screw up.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:52.440]   - Wow.
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:54.560]   - Yeah, so it's some, there's, and then another thing
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:57.680]   that beyond Photoshop, I know a lot of people,
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.080]   that's all they're gonna be looking at,
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:02.360]   but they're one of the big things that Adobe has spent
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:04.280]   a lot of time on, they talked a little bit about this
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:07.640]   at NAB is, and I think that it's gonna be very important
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:09.920]   as we move down from a production artist point of view,
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.680]   is they're paying a lot of attention to metadata
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:12.880]   throughout the video pipeline.
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:15.400]   So when you're sitting on a,
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:18.280]   and it seems like when they told me about it,
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:21.040]   an NAB, I was kinda like, ah, I don't really know
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:21.880]   if I'd ever used that.
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:24.800]   And then the more my head kinda slowly wrapped around that,
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.320]   the bigger of a deal it made.
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.440]   So number one is that they can,
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.320]   you can be sitting on set and typing stuff in
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:33.040]   to what's happening, so if you're in on location
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.800]   or whatever, you can be typing stuff in.
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.320]   That data is gonna live with that video file
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.120]   all the way down the pipeline.
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:41.680]   If you stay within, of course, the Adobe pipeline.
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:44.440]   So, but all that metadata is floating down
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.800]   with the app, so you can be typing in notes of,
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.520]   oh, we need to do this, or we should have done that,
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:50.240]   or we should, you know, we, da, da, da, da,
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:51.720]   well, that stuff sticks with it,
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:52.920]   so when I open up an After Effects,
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.040]   that metadata is still there.
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:55.960]   More importantly, they're doing stuff
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:59.040]   where they're basically, they're analyzing the audio
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:02.200]   and doing their best to not really build a transcript,
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.880]   to build a searchable database,
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.960]   so that if I can say, oh, when, when, you know,
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:10.280]   if I'm shooting a documentary and I have 40 hours of footage,
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:14.400]   and I can't remember when Andy was talking about the Zoom,
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:17.440]   I can type Zoom in and it'll show me every place
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:20.160]   in all of my footage that Zoom was mentioned,
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:23.280]   you know, or Bill Gates was mentioned,
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.600]   or Steve Jobs was mentioned,
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.960]   I can just search for those things,
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:28.680]   for a documentary person,
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:32.520]   or a, you know, or someone working on a production,
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:36.560]   that's a big deal, and to add one more layer to that,
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.480]   is that they've already been working with Google
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:39.480]   to make everything searchable,
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:41.200]   so imagine all this metadata,
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:42.760]   and all this stuff you're adding,
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:45.200]   being able to be in a layer that Google can actually search,
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.240]   now you're talking about searchable video, you know,
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:51.160]   and, you know, this is a, that's kind of the holy grail
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.440]   in a lot of ways, searchable video,
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:54.520]   not only just searchable video, but searchable audio,
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.400]   it means that this podcast that people are listening to
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.480]   eventually be able to be searchable.
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:00.800]   It's a very, you know, it's gonna be new,
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:02.360]   and it's gonna be people are gonna be getting their head
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:04.480]   around it, but when people really start taking advantage
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:09.480]   of this, it's a very compelling reason to be using Adobe products
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:12.440]   because they're the ones that'll support that,
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:16.000]   and I think that hopefully the Apple Pro Apps team
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.280]   will, you know, adjust accordingly.
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.280]   - Let's also say that there's a time,
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:23.360]   like when you're getting interested,
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.040]   either professionally or just personally,
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.800]   and making images and taking pictures,
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.600]   there comes a time when you need to buy a new camera,
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:32.120]   and for the first time you realize that a $350 point
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:34.000]   and shoot just isn't gonna do it for you anymore,
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.480]   and it's time to spend $1,000 on an SLR,
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:39.200]   and that's how I feel, I've always felt about Photoshop,
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:41.280]   that for most people, I photo will do great,
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:43.600]   for a lot of people, Photoshop elements will do great,
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.360]   but there will come a time when you realize that,
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:47.880]   oh, God, this would be so much of a better picture,
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:49.880]   if I could just find a way to just to bring out
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:51.200]   the dog's eyes a little bit,
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.880]   that's the only part of this that I'm just disappointed with,
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:56.160]   and those just start to pack up and pack up,
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:57.320]   and then you'll think, you know what,
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:00.800]   $600 for Photoshop suddenly seems like a good idea.
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:02.840]   - So when will this be available?
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:05.400]   They don't say on the site it looks like.
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:06.640]   - I'm not sure what the available is,
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.960]   I think it's pretty soon, I'm not sure exactly when it's shipping.
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:11.720]   And they do have, I was just checking Adobe.TV
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:14.720]   has 30 minute previews of all the products,
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:17.520]   including we're looking right now at the Photoshop one.
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:21.680]   So you certainly, you have, you can take a look at
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:24.120]   the demos that Andy and Alex got,
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:27.000]   you, you, you, you normal people can see also,
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.960]   at Adobe.TV, what?
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.920]   - Well, it's only if you're worthy, realize that
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:32.200]   you'll just see a nude emperor,
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:33.920]   if you're not worthy of raising a pocket book.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:37.640]   - Ah, yes, that is, that is no resize, just a naked guy.
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:39.840]   Alex, but you not agree that his Raymans are both
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.520]   silken and fine.
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:42.840]   Have you ever seen the likes of?
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:44.320]   (laughing)
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.040]   - All right, we're gonna take a little break, come back,
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:49.560]   we're gonna talk about your picks of the week,
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:52.760]   but first it's time to mention my pick for plastic.
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:55.080]   I'm talking visa here, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.920]   when you go shopping online or off,
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.360]   you wanna make sure you take along your visa car,
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:01.480]   visa, make sure that every purchase,
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:04.320]   everything you buy is safe and secure,
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:06.880]   so you can concentrate on the good stuff like,
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.880]   well, do I want the production package,
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:11.320]   or do I want the web creative package?
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:13.600]   You don't have to think about, am I safe here,
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.720]   am I, you don't have to worry about online fraud?
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:18.200]   No, all purchasers are safe and secure with visa,
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.800]   they have many ways to prevent, detect, and resolve
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:23.640]   online fraud, real time fraud monitoring, for instance,
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:25.960]   very sophisticated technology that identifies
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:29.200]   and responds immediately to fraudulent activity,
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:32.400]   plus zero liability, you're just not authorized,
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:36.040]   are not liable for unauthorized purchases,
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:38.720]   that's what I like, that's peace of mind, that's safe,
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:40.840]   that's secure, that's visa,
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:43.480]   oh, and I have to turn up the visa sound.
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:49.040]   Almost forgot the most important part, the visa jingle.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:52.840]   All right, now I get it, I've got to give them some credit
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:56.200]   for being safe and secure, no problems they assure,
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:59.000]   it's visa, visa, visa, visa, visa,
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.040]   ♪ Ah, now it's time ♪
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:02.960]   ♪ Da-da-da-da ♪
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:06.840]   Time for a Mac break weekly, picks of the week,
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:09.760]   my pick is actually something that's not out yet,
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:13.000]   it's Adobe Photoshop, no I'm sorry, I can't,
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.640]   I couldn't do that, clearly I was taken a back by that,
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:17.760]   I'm actually excited about something
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:20.160]   that is supposed to come out fairly soon
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:24.560]   from the folks at Mac Rabbit, they're the folks who do CSS
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:28.960]   edit, I know you've probably, we picked CSS edit before,
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:31.000]   I'm sure it's a really excellent program
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.480]   that lets you edit the CSS of a page
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:39.600]   while you're looking at the page on the web in real time,
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:41.320]   it's really remarkable.
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:43.120]   I've been so impressed by that, I'm very excited
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.680]   about something they're gonna do called Espresso,
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:48.960]   ESPR, ESSO, if you guys have seen this,
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:52.960]   Mac, web development, more productive than caffeine,
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:57.920]   it's workflow oriented, they say it's not a bunch of apps
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:00.840]   forcibly smashed together, instead we look at the needs
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:03.160]   of modern web developers and streamline workflow
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:06.200]   into one focused app, so you've got edit,
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:09.320]   organize, preview, publish, all built in,
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:13.880]   there is a downloadable demo but you have to sign up
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:17.640]   to get on the preview list for this, it's free.
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:20.040]   And the thing I'm most interested in, they call it sugar,
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:23.080]   they're going to allow people to add languages
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:25.600]   and extend it with a very clear API
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.320]   and they're looking for sugar developers.
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:29.280]   I've been using CODA for some time,
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.000]   but the problem is I use CODA, I use Mac, RABBIT,
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.960]   CSS RABBIT, I use all this stuff,
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:37.880]   CSS edit, I use this all this stuff at the same time
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:41.720]   and this is just all in one, so I'm very excited about this.
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.760]   It's a preview, sign up to download it,
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:47.840]   it's called Espresso from macrabbitt.com
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:50.320]   and I'll give you a much more thorough review.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:53.920]   Once I'm using CSS edit like now, like crazy now
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:56.680]   to try to recover the CSS of my website,
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:00.880]   very handy tool and I'm sure Espresso will be equally handy.
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.600]   That's my pick of the week, Andy Inako,
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:04.360]   what do you got for us?
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:07.600]   I have a little gizmo, a little marvel
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.440]   that could be barked at a carnival pitchman
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:12.400]   because it is a little giant, little giant genius activity.
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:16.240]   It is a, I'm gonna just say the name,
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:17.960]   you have to really describe what it does,
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:21.080]   it has no peppy name, the USB 2.0 Universal Drive adapter
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:22.120]   by newer technology.
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:23.320]   I have one!
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:24.160]   Yes!
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:25.160]   It is the, it is the-
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.640]   It's a must!
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:31.440]   What it is, is it is an angry, geeky, wonderful looking
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:34.280]   set of cables that lets you essentially
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:36.760]   take any hard drive mechanism, not a hard drive,
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:39.280]   but a hard drive mechanism that guts inside it
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:40.840]   and just basically plug it in
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:42.680]   and use it as an external USB drive.
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:45.160]   It'll provide the power, it'll provide the data connections,
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:47.920]   it will work with just about any type of mechanism
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:50.600]   that's been in play for the past six, seven or eight years.
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.920]   IDP and SATA, I've been using one of these for years,
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.520]   it's great!
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:56.680]   Because it's the sort of thing you keep it in your drawer
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:59.040]   and then you will find an occasion where my God,
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:00.480]   what I'm about to, what I need to do now
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:02.080]   would be 80 times more complicated
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:05.080]   if I did not have the ability to just turn this mechanism
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:06.560]   into a working hard drive.
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.640]   Let me give you a couple of examples.
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:12.640]   I do have literally the milk crate full of hard drives
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:13.720]   that I moved from the old place,
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:15.880]   'cause you know, you bought the 80 gig drive
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:17.280]   and you bought the 150 gig drive
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:19.000]   and you bought the 400 gig drive.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.080]   And one of the drives is this really complicated
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:25.120]   networkable ethernet drive that doesn't really work
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.960]   via USB, you have to work it via ethernet.
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:30.520]   And you need special software that finds it on the network
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.280]   and then mounts it and all that sort of stuff.
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:34.800]   And I knew that I had a lot of stuff on it
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.960]   but I couldn't find the CD, I'm about to call
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:38.880]   and the company's the C is a replace,
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:39.960]   I can download this then I realized,
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.680]   wait a minute, I have a screwdriver
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:43.240]   and I have the universal drive adapter,
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.800]   I can just crack the mechanism right out of this box,
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:49.320]   plug it in and press though, it's a plain Jane USB 2.0 drive
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:51.360]   that will work with any Mac or any Windows machine.
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:55.400]   Similarly, I have a couple of old computers,
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:57.920]   old Macs, old Windows machines that again,
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:59.880]   I don't really want to fire them up
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:01.240]   and take a look at what's on there,
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:02.840]   I just wanna take whatever pictures,
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:04.600]   whatever documents off the hard drives
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:07.320]   and just, you know, my tower G5,
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:09.200]   I just dropped the drawbridge on it,
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:10.120]   yanked out the drives,
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:11.840]   lapped it on this interface.
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.720]   And now I've got these 500 gigabytes
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:15.400]   for the photos that I can just copy right onto
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:18.000]   these safety and security of my Drobo.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.080]   And it's dirt, and like I said,
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:22.280]   you just feel like a nerd.
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:25.160]   That really great serotonin first you get
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:26.440]   when you're doing something that would
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.200]   frighten a normal human being,
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:31.160]   like having this bare mechanism with all these wires,
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:34.200]   I stress it's really easy to use,
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:35.600]   but you're not used to having this,
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:38.240]   all these colorful wires coming out of a mechanism.
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:39.480]   And for all this coolness,
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:40.440]   you don't need any software,
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:41.280]   you don't need anything,
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.360]   it just turns into a hard drive.
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:45.000]   It's just like $35, $34.99.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.040]   If you go to newertech.com,
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:48.560]   you can find the product page
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:50.880]   and we'll point you someplace where you can actually buy it.
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:52.320]   But it's like,
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:53.640]   and the version that they have now
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:55.000]   is better than the version that I already have,
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.480]   'cause the version has added.
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:57.320]   - It's fancy now.
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:58.160]   - It's got buttons, lights.
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:16:59.160]   - Exactly.
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.680]   If you thought it was cool before,
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:02.480]   imagine the device with blinking lights
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.160]   of multiple colors on them.
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:05.360]   - And blinking lights.
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:08.240]   - Oh, they don't tell me there was gonna be blinking lights.
[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:09.840]   Only it had a buzzer attached to it,
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:11.000]   then it would be perfect.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.960]   (laughing)
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:14.600]   Somebody told me about this in Macworld,
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:16.480]   I think it was a couple of years ago,
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:19.840]   said you've gotta go over and buy this.
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:24.160]   And I did, and it's so useful, it's so fantastic.
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:25.960]   - It is a solution to a hundred problems.
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:26.880]   - One of the things is really cool
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:29.600]   is that it works with so many different drives.
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:31.920]   You know, because we have a WeBetech mostly
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:33.800]   because WeBetech makes a similar thing,
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:37.720]   but only for 3.5 inch, you know, SATA drives.
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:38.800]   And we have like six of them
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:40.720]   because the way we back everything up
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:42.320]   is we just buy raw drives and back them up
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.840]   'cause they're so much cheaper.
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:46.640]   And, you know, when we're like, when we're just doing in mass,
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:48.240]   you know, the important stuff ends up on the Drobo,
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:51.480]   the stuff that we just need to make sure ends up somewhere,
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:52.800]   you know, ends up on these raw drives.
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:57.840]   And the problem is that it only works
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.840]   with one style of drive, you know,
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:03.200]   and it is Fireway 800, which is cool.
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.480]   But this one, what's great about it is,
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:06.160]   is of course you can plug it into everything.
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:07.000]   - Yeah, that's good.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.200]   - This works with, it does work with everything.
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:11.280]   This is about six or seven months ago,
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:15.240]   I was trying to set up like an old like power computing,
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:17.320]   like power PC tower.
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:18.520]   I'm sorry, no, I'm sorry.
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:20.920]   It was an older machine that didn't have a CD drive
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:24.560]   and I was trying to get it up and running.
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:27.200]   And I realized I just needed to,
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:29.320]   it didn't need to have a working CD drive.
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:32.280]   I just needed to get stuff installed on the internal drive.
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:35.480]   And I didn't happen to have a USB external, you know,
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:38.040]   CD drive, but look, I went through my junk box.
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:40.280]   I found an old, you know, an old scuzzy,
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:43.400]   sorry, not a scuzzy, but I basically found an old pull
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:46.360]   from an old tower machine, plugged this,
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:49.880]   I think it was an ATA format optical drive,
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:51.120]   just plugged it into the adapter,
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:53.400]   plugged the adapter into this old Mac,
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:54.840]   mounted just fine as an optical drive,
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:56.920]   I got the stuff installed without having to go out.
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:18:58.480]   And I was literally this close to saying,
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:01.080]   you know what, it cost me all of 60 bucks to go out
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:03.800]   and buy an external USB optical drive.
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:05.280]   And I should have one for the office anyway.
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:07.400]   So I'll just, in the interest of getting this,
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:09.080]   you know, donated the way I promised,
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:10.160]   I'll just buy that thing.
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:11.000]   - Let me show you.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.520]   - As long as we're talking drive nerds,
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:14.160]   go ahead and finish, I'm gonna show you something.
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:15.640]   - No, that was it.
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:17.880]   - So this is something we started using here,
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:19.800]   'cause you know, we're recording onto hard drives,
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:21.280]   all the video that we produce.
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:23.080]   But I also wanna be able to,
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:26.600]   first of all, I wanna use a new drive every week,
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:28.360]   as we, it's a lot of video,
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.040]   but also I wanna be able to give it to Tony
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:31.720]   so we can edit it, I want Dana to be able to.
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:34.200]   So we got these little drive toasters, basically,
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:37.920]   they're little SAT, they're for ESAT external SATA,
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:39.640]   and you could buy an adapter for a Mac Pro
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:42.080]   that'll give it an external SATA port,
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:43.720]   but you could also use it as USB.
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:46.520]   But the idea is it's, it's usually from thermal take,
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.400]   they're called Black X, they're about 40 bucks.
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:52.240]   It has a slot that you could pop a bear drive into.
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:53.360]   It doesn't go all the way in,
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.360]   so it looks kind of funky with a drive sticking out of it,
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:56.960]   you can see the electronics and everything,
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:59.520]   but this is what we, it's like a little drive toaster.
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:00.600]   So, yes.
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:04.640]   So I just pop a drive into it, record the whole week,
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.000]   when the week's done, I write on the label,
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.960]   I put the drive away and I could pop another one in.
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:12.920]   SATA, external SATA is hot swappable.
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:16.360]   So it's a really interesting way to treat drive.
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:18.040]   - And if you use a search,
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.440]   there's a CD finder, I think,
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:20.280]   and there's a couple of other ones where--
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:21.120]   - Well, that's what I need you to do
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:21.960]   is index these, shouldn't I?
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.320]   - We database them, so we've got--
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:24.640]   - It's a good idea.
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:27.480]   - We have about 150 drives and--
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:28.560]   - So do you use something like this
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:29.720]   that you just pop the drives in?
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:30.560]   It's really cool.
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.440]   - Well, we use the Weba Tech where you just kind of plug it on.
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:34.240]   I think some of the other guys have ones,
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:38.400]   but the most of the ones that you can pop the drive in are USB.
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:39.240]   I don't know if you're--
[01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:41.680]   - This is ESATA, and it is, it's USB or ESATA,
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:42.520]   which is faster than--
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:44.360]   - Oh yeah, for us, we just want Firewire 800
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:45.200]   that we can plug into every machine.
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:46.640]   - This is like Firewire 800.
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:47.600]   You do have to, you know,
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.800]   max don't come with ESATA ports,
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:53.560]   but they have, but like our Mac Pro had three or four extra ports
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:55.400]   'cause I wasn't, you know, I maxed it out.
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:58.920]   So we just buy it, other world computing sells it.
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.200]   It's just, you know, it's 30 bucks.
[01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:03.680]   It's a little back panel thing that connects to the--
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:07.400]   ESATA connector inside and puts a port on the outside
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:09.480]   and then you can connect it up.
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:11.040]   So you get full drive speed.
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:12.800]   This is like an internal drive.
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:15.320]   - Yeah, it's really, really amazing.
[01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:17.240]   When you're going through a lot of data,
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:20.040]   you'll get to a point where you'll decide that some of it
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:22.200]   really has to be bulletproof and you're gonna put it on a
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:24.200]   Drobo or something like that or--
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:26.480]   - The drives are so cheap, the idea that you gave me
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:29.280]   this idea, Alex, because drives are so cheap now
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.920]   for a hundred bucks a week, I can archive everything.
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:33.440]   - Right. - And I have it all.
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:35.480]   But I like the idea, I do need to set up a database
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:36.720]   so it's keeping track of--
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:38.080]   - Yeah, but CD, I think it's CD Finder,
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.640]   there's this tracker but it's really old.
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:40.560]   - Yeah, we're doing it on a PC.
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:41.720]   - CD Finder is the next one.
[01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:44.520]   And so, 'cause what we do is we literally then just search,
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:46.320]   do a search to the database and say,
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:47.800]   where is this, what's the price of--
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:48.640]   - What's the price of a--
[01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:50.960]   - So, go grab, you know, bear drive number 78
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:51.800]   and it's there.
[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:53.200]   - I'm just writing the dates recorded.
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:55.200]   So you know, hey, if you know the date,
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:56.800]   do you know what drive it's on?
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:57.880]   - Right.
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:01.040]   - I think that's like a SAT commentary that, you know,
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:03.320]   we've gone from five and a quarter inch floppy
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:04.960]   so three and a half inch floppy to like--
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:07.600]   - 750 gig a inch. - And now we just have to like
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:10.680]   get a Sharpie and marker on a one terabyte drive.
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:11.840]   - That's what it is.
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:12.680]   - That's exactly what it is.
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:15.200]   - Do you want to do me first, June 27th.
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:16.040]   - That's exactly--
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:18.400]   - Not all the 27th, of course.
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.760]   - That's exactly what I'm doing that,
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:24.600]   but you know, it's 120 bucks at Newegg for a 750 gig drive.
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:26.360]   That's the new floppy.
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:27.760]   - Yeah, I do. - And with something like this,
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:30.080]   it's just like a floppy, you just pop it in.
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:34.160]   - And we have to take actually makes cases for raw drives.
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:37.320]   So that you can, so that they look like the cases
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.720]   that you would get for a cassette tape, you know,
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:41.680]   like the old HD cam, cassette tapes or beta cam.
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:43.240]   And so it'll literally just put it in there
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:45.760]   so you can store them all like that
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:46.760]   and just pull them out as you need them.
[01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:47.680]   - I love it.
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:48.840]   Hey, what's your turn Alex?
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:49.880]   I don't know if that was your pick.
[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:50.720]   Do you want to do a pick?
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:53.880]   - No, no, no, my pick is, this is a new release
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:55.080]   and I just wanted to make sure everyone knew
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:59.320]   because one of my favorite applications is Omni Graffle.
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:03.080]   So I like to think in pictures.
[01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:05.240]   I know people would never think that I would be like that.
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:07.800]   But you know, I really just don't like
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.240]   trying to think things out in text.
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:11.600]   And so for me, you know, when I,
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:14.720]   I got into Omni Graffle versions and versions and versions ago.
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:16.960]   And every time they open, they release a new one,
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:18.880]   I have to, you know, get it and play with it.
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:21.560]   And this of course is another great update
[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:23.920]   and I just have to pick it 'cause it's,
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.960]   as I said, it's probably the app that I use.
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:28.320]   You know, I'm the chief architect here at Pixagore
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:30.320]   and my job is to think out like how we're gonna do stuff.
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:32.000]   And so when I'm designing a webpage
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.560]   and I want to figure out where everyone's supposed to,
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:34.840]   where everything's gonna go,
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:37.040]   we're rebuilding our pipeline right now
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:39.360]   and I'm building the whole thing in Omni Graffle.
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:40.800]   And I can put little notes in there.
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:42.160]   So when you roll over it, it says,
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:43.560]   this is what this page is gonna do.
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:47.640]   And I can set up these big flow graphs.
[01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:50.360]   You know, you can work on the new stuff that they've added
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.680]   is a new layout engine.
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:52.640]   You can do outlines.
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:53.960]   So you're building something in picture,
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:57.480]   but it's actually building an outline for you automatically.
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:00.600]   Which is really, I thought was crazy when they first started it.
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:01.680]   When I first opened it up, I was like,
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:02.600]   what the heck is this?
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:05.280]   And suddenly I realized I'm building an outline with a picture.
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:10.000]   And the, you know, Bezier curves, Bezier shapes
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.240]   that you can play with.
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:13.240]   What's crazy is, is that something I don't even know
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:15.040]   if this is new, but I just didn't realize it,
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.720]   is that you can actually put hyperlinks in.
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:19.560]   So you can export an HTML from your Omni Graffle
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:20.400]   with your little flow chart.
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:22.680]   And when you click on it, it can take you to a page
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:25.040]   or take you somewhere else in the page
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:26.680]   or to another page.
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:30.800]   Anyway, it's just a, I don't know how people operate without it.
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:32.880]   I mean, I have my own little world
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:36.080]   and I don't understand how someone, when I talk to people,
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:39.560]   they don't have Omni Graffle, I get, I'm just confused.
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:41.680]   I'm not upset, I'm just confused.
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:43.960]   So it's just such a great application.
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:45.680]   I think most people don't need the pro version.
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:50.240]   I use the pro version, but the standard version's like 99 bucks.
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:53.360]   So it's not super expensive, but when you're trying to build--
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:54.760]   It throws a little pricey.
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:56.480]   And I've been kind of just trying to decide whether to buy
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:58.080]   a upgrade to the pro.
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:01.320]   Yeah, I mean, I like the pro version.
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:05.480]   The pro version, and now I can't remember what I get.
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:06.280]   Here, hold on.
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:10.760]   The pro version gives you stuff like Visio support,
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:12.520]   subgraphs, presentation mode, which
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:15.280]   means you can present your piece there.
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:17.720]   But in terms of the drawing and the template--
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:19.880]   No, all the drawing stuff is pretty much awful.
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:23.080]   There's some improved PDF support.
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:26.400]   You can use tables.
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:28.360]   But generally, I think 99--
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:31.120]   I think all I need is the basic one.
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:31.960]   I've used it so--
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:32.480]   Great.
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:35.640]   In fact, I want to use it to draw diagrams of how the studio
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:36.240]   is set up.
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:38.000]   Because people want to know, what's that equipment?
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.040]   What's that equipment?
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:40.160]   Do the whole thing.
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:42.000]   And you have hyperlinks in there, but they can take them--
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.440]   And it's drag and drop.
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:46.440]   So I mean, I built these huge graphs of what things look like.
[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:48.080]   And what's great is the magnetize--
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:50.840]   I used to build these graphs in Illustrator.
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:52.880]   And I'd be drawing these little lines.
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:55.640]   But what's great is all the little arrows are all magnetized.
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:56.640]   So you just connect them all.
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:58.480]   And then you can keep on reordering them.
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:01.040]   But all the connections stay there.
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:02.880]   And then it also has all the snapping features
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:04.800]   that you get used to in Keynote.
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:06.720]   So you can kind of snap everything so it looks nice.
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:12.000]   And my OCD is satisfied in that area.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:19.000]   And so all of the pieces to put together a nice looking graph.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.040]   And I use it a lot when I'm showing pipelines,
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:23.600]   like how a show gets made, or how things get done,
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:27.080]   or I'm doing presentations of processes.
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:30.760]   I just don't know what else I would use that would really
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:32.520]   work as well as Omni-Graftful.
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:33.480]   Yeah.
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.000]   I agree.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.840]   I think it's a great product.
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:38.160]   And I've been debating whether or not to upgrade.
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:39.320]   So you've saved me some money.
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:41.760]   I'm going to get the $99 first.
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:43.960]   I just want the most of this, because it's the thing
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:45.200]   that I sit in a lot.
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:46.040]   And you do a lot.
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:48.040]   So I'm always--
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:49.600]   And a lot of times, I'm not even going
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:51.120]   to make something that anyone's ever going to see.
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:52.960]   I'm just thinking about process out,
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:54.040]   and just connecting things out.
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:55.120]   And I forgot that.
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:55.680]   And I forgot that.
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:27:00.440]   And so that's how I use it a lot in just kind of a brainstorming.
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:01.600]   Good deal.
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:03.600]   $99 a seventh of an Alex.
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:04.120]   Yes.
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:07.760]   $39 for the newer tech USB drive adapter.
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:11.240]   That's one 14th of an Alex.
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:14.000]   And mine is pre, because it's not available yet.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.760]   There's your picks for the week.
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:18.120]   Andy Inacos at the Chicago Sun Times also
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:22.560]   has website, www.cwob.com.
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.680]   The celestial ho--
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:26.200]   waste of bandwidth.
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:28.240]   And always a welcome contributor to the show.
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:29.680]   Thank you so much for being here, Andy.
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:32.800]   And our condolences to you and all our best, our prayers
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:33.800]   and our love.
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:36.320]   You're a great guy, and we're really glad to know you.
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:38.920]   Guys, I felt a lot of support from you guys over the past month.
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:39.920]   And it really helped.
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:40.920]   Thanks, everyone.
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:43.920]   And of course, Alex Lindsey, who is also the greatest.
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:44.960]   You're going to move up here soon.
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:46.480]   Alex, we need you up here.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:47.040]   We're going to--
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:48.960]   I'm not going to desk ready for you.
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:50.920]   We have missed-- I'm going to start coming up no matter what.
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:53.200]   And then we're just going to figure out the house thing.
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:54.080]   Don't you have to live up here?
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:55.600]   Just move up here.
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:56.640]   Well, I'm working on it.
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:59.360]   We've bid on three places.
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:00.040]   I know.
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:01.040]   I know.
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:03.000]   Come on, doesn't anybody in pedal him?
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.520]   I want to rent to this nice boy and his family.
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:06.520]   Nice kid.
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:07.640]   The kid you ever saw.
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:10.960]   I know he's carnival folk, but he's good carnival folk.
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:13.080]   Doesn't-- he's clean.
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:13.880]   I don't do drugs.
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:16.880]   Well, I don't do a lot of drugs.
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:18.920]   He has a special man where the monkeys live.
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:22.080]   And he keeps that man parked outside.
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:24.920]   And I only bring the drums out on the weekend.
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:26.560]   No, come on.
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:28.440]   Now we're really scotching the deal.
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:30.160]   Alex Lindsey is at Pixelcore.
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:32.640]   Pixelcore.com, if you want to know more about this great guild
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:38.080]   of multimedia artists, train and work through Pixelcore.com
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:41.760]   at Pixelcore.tv, which is the site of the great Pixelcore
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:42.400]   podcast.
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:43.840]   And people keep saying, you keep saying you're
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:45.040]   going to do a developer podcast.
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:46.360]   Is it out yet?
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:47.120]   It is out.
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:47.960]   All right.
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:49.120]   Right now it's in the main feed.
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:50.640]   I don't think it has its own feed.
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:52.120]   So if you go up your scene developer stuff,
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:53.720]   we've already done a couple great ones.
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:56.440]   In fact, in 10 minutes after we finished recording this,
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:59.000]   I'm going to record a whole bunch of new ones with Sal.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:28:59.800]   So Sal--
[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:01.880]   Sal Soblade, who is the king of AppleScript.
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:02.380]   Yeah.
[01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:04.080]   Yes, we're going to talk about AppleScript and Automator.
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.480]   And we're working on a bunch of new ones.
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:07.000]   And so the developer stuff is already
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.040]   going out into the main Mac break feed.
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:10.280]   So if you want to see some of those,
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:11.840]   go to the main Mac break feed.
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:14.760]   It's going to have its own feed in October, just like Mac Break
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:17.240]   Studio, which we're recording another 12 episodes
[01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:17.960]   on next Friday.
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:20.920]   So all of that stuff's picking up.
[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:22.760]   Pixel Core Doc TV.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:26.520]   And also, don't forget, Twip, which Alex is a regular on.
[01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:28.040]   And I'm sure you guys are talking about photo
[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:29.080]   keynote this week.
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:30.560]   Oh, we talked about it last week.
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:32.480]   We're going to talk about it this week.
[01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:34.000]   There's so much exciting stuff.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:39.040]   I actually am stepping away from the Nikon cliff.
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:39.560]   Good.
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:40.560]   Good.
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:41.920]   Is Scott saying--
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:42.560]   Yeah, no.
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:45.920]   I think this new Mark II is pretty impressive.
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:48.640]   Is Scott thinking maybe you made a mistake?
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:49.680]   No, I don't think so.
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:51.840]   I mean, I think there's still a lot of great reasons
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:52.800]   to look at the new Nikon.
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:55.400]   I think that the low light performance, the high ISO
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:57.280]   performance is still higher in the Nikon.
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:59.000]   It's a little higher, but we shall see.
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.640]   I have to say that being able to shoot--
[01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:05.640]   being able to have almost absolutely everything that I want
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:08.600]   and be able to have an SDK, which I can get with a Canon
[01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:12.540]   I can't get with, and being able to shoot up to 12
[01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:13.920]   minute movies on my--
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:15.160]   Really intrigued by that.
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:15.660]   Yeah.
[01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:17.080]   --great ones of my son.
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:19.120]   It's like all those pictures I've been taking in my son,
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:20.160]   but moving.
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:21.600]   I'm very excited about that.
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:21.920]   So--
[01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:22.440]   God, yeah.
[01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:23.880]   I love my D80.
[01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:26.880]   My D80 has taken a place of any recreational drugs
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:28.880]   that I might have ever gotten into in my life.
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:30.160]   But I'm like, you know what?
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:33.240]   If I were to sell this, I then sell that.
[01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:35.960]   I then take that big ammo chest full of loose change.
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:38.320]   I bet I could just buy myself a D90.
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:39.880]   D90 looks good.
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:40.920]   D90 looks good.
[01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:42.120]   D700 looks good.
[01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:43.500]   They're all going to have to do.
[01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:44.500]   Yeah.
[01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:45.340]   Yeah.
[01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:45.840]   I don't know.
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:47.940]   I'm very excited about the 5D Mark II.
[01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:49.660]   I'm also excited about the G10.
[01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:51.380]   But then I'm also excited about these rumors
[01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:52.140]   about a new MacBook.
[01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:55.220]   So I don't know what I'm going to do.
[01:30:55.220 --> 01:30:58.380]   And I want Photoshop.
[01:30:58.380 --> 01:31:01.620]   It's just not enough money in the world or time.
[01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:03.180]   Alex, Andy, thank you so much.
[01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:04.100]   We'll see you next week.
[01:31:04.100 --> 01:31:05.380]   Everybody, thanks for joining us.
[01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:06.540]   Another Mac break.
[01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:07.540]   It's broke.

[01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:13.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:17.220]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
