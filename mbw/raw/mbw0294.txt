[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.520]   Thanks for joining us great to have you also with us from Fox and friends and our old friend

[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:34.280]   Yeah, I'm in New York and I've also decorated with Philadelphia over my shoulder. So look at that you went to opening day, didn't you?
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.960]   Yeah, it was an opening day yesterday. It was brutally windy and cold
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:45.040]   I saw pictures of you and Natali and the baby. What's his name? Yeah miles miles miles
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.000]   And you got another one on the way. So it was a cold family it was but we enjoyed a enjoyed a little early baseball
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.360]   So always good to get out there. Clayton also does the grizzly bear egg cafe
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.240]   And I just like saying that
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.520]   It's a pop culture catch all and daddy on board with Mike Quacken busch. Yeah
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.720]   so guys
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.360]   Aren't you sorry you didn't come up with a photo sharing application with a bunch of filters about a year and a half ago
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.960]   Oh
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.800]   This is unbelievable. I don't know if I have Sean Freud or what but it's the opposite
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.760]   What's the opposite of Sean and Freud? Sean Freud is the guilty pleasure in the failure of others
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.240]   What is it when you have insane jealousy over the success of others?
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.960]   Just jealousy one of the deadly things called humanity
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.240]   envy
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.880]   One billion dollars say that with a pinky Instagram is sold to a Facebook
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.680]   Lots of arguments over it by the way
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.320]   Instagram CEO if you've been wondering Kevin system his payday 400 million dollars
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.400]   400 million
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.080]   Dollar ruse they were it's interesting because you know, they're only about what 15 16 months old
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.400]   They were recently they their most recent valuation for
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.320]   Investors was a hundred million dollars
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.520]   That was I think last fall
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.880]   So just a billion dollars is 13 full-time employees
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.080]   So here's that cut here's that's gonna break down just in case you do not feel jealous enough
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.720]   Kevin's system 400 million dollars co-founder Mike Krieger a hundred million dollars
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.060]   The venture capital firm which led the their series a funding round last year
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.560]   180 million dollars
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.560]   And recent Horowitz and baseline ventures a
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.080]   hundred million apiece
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.200]   The rest of the 13 full-time employees will share a pool of a hundred million dollars. You'll get a
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.920]   Steak depending on how much how long you've been there?
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:03.040]   Huge win now. What is what is Instagram bring a user base of 30 million iOS users and they just went out on Android
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.320]   Last week which I apparently prompted over a million new signups in the first 12 hours
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.320]   So figure 50 million
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.600]   Are they are they worth it Ken? What do you think?
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:22.040]   How do you how could you possibly say I don't know? I mean what's been what's been really interesting to me over the past?
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.840]   24 hours is watching how much people hate the idea
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:31.160]   And I'm one at the same well Instagram user mean I mean I see a ton of people on Instagram saying that's it good. Bye
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.760]   Yeah, no, I think I read
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.880]   Zuckerberg's post earlier on Facebook and he had something like a hundred fifty three thousand likes
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.320]   But you know that's in his backyard a lot of people I know at least three
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.000]   Instagram users who say that they've already deleted their account
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.880]   Because they have her that they're going to firstly
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.440]   I don't care about that part of it because we've either made peace with what Facebook is doing or we haven't as far as you know
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.760]   Gathering information and gathering users. I'm more concerned that they're just gonna screw up the UI
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.120]   Because you know like they do with Facebook every six months
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.800]   I mean you were to change this now because this is gonna be better and you know
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.640]   Not necessarily but but they go ahead and do it and like I still haven't converted to the timeline
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.680]   I haven't even checked my Facebook page in like two weeks
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.360]   So I don't know if it's done it by itself or if it's gonna do it next time I log on or what
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.720]   Well, so really some bliskey imagine
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.800]   Go ahead. Thank you. Well, I was gonna say Ken
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.040]   I mean it seems like not much or at least or we led to believe that not much is going to change according to Facebook
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.320]   I mean that was right concern right that suddenly now it's gonna be built into Facebook somehow
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.320]   and it's gonna it's gonna lose the
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:41.160]   It's gonna lose the quaintness of it right in most in most of previous Facebook's previous
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.040]   Acquisitions they've been what we call a qua hairs
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.840]   Hires I think of for instance dropio
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.880]   Where they bought drop.io and closed it immediately
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.880]   Right and they really were we're buying it for the founder
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:04.640]   I sort of went a little more macro on this which is is this what we can begin to expect with a lot of our social networks that are
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.720]   Outside the Facebook Twitter universe
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:13.440]   For instance path, you know big path user as you know and love it and is that good?
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:20.160]   Is that long for this world? What about Spotify? Can we expect to see that gobbled up soon built in more in more integration?
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:26.200]   So, you know, you fall in love with these social networks and you they bring real value in a way that's meaningful
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:34.320]   I'm able to share it forces you to take more creative photos perhaps and and it's all about photo sharing and you can you know
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:40.920]   You share them right out to Facebook right within the Instagram app and it's already a clean experience when you go over to Facebook
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.960]   Then you click on you see it already there. You don't even have to click on a link
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.040]   It generates it propagates the image right inside the timeline. So it was already doing that
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.400]   I don't know that much is gonna change but to Ken's point
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.800]   I don't want it to lose the UI. I don't want to lose what we love about it
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.240]   And that's of course the fear and you look with you know Microsoft buying Skype
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:05.720]   There's also a larger. Yeah, which by the way, they haven't changed a bit right skips the same old Skype
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.600]   There's I think there's a bigger issue though
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:15.160]   You use you raise the path. I'll talk about Instagram. There are a lot of these very cute
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:21.400]   Personal sites where we as the users pour our content our heart our souls
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.000]   into
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:32.640]   And you know, I think of CD DB remember CD DB which the CD database where just it was kind of like a Wikipedia for music for
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:40.280]   lyrics and information about albums and everybody contributed and then it got bought by grace note and commercialized and it was as if
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.880]   We'd been working for the man
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:50.480]   Without any compensation for years and boom and I think that there is a little bit of that as well with Instagram where
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.600]   Yeah, we were participating this great small was just two guys for a long time, right?
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.040]   Just a small little thing. It's so cool and we're pouring our heart into it
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:04.960]   And then the big guy comes along says I'll take that and in in the process takes us and everything we put same thing with path
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.160]   Your life
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.680]   I know cuz I follow you on path plate and your life is in path
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.520]   It's like your family photo album me too. I love it, but if it suddenly gets acquired by somebody
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.720]   Suddenly everything doesn't do you see what I'm saying? It feels like some sort of invasion
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.880]   Well, I mean, I think
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.280]   Ken like you you know listen in certain music
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:28.480]   I'll see something Ken posts and path like a certain album or something is listening to and I may want to go and purchase that or listen to that
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.080]   And all of that data in fact is even more personal
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.760]   Right, I would argue that's even more personal than Facebook because we're just sharing with people who are close to us
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.120]   Who we have an acquaintance with who we want to see what's going on so that information seems to me
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.080]   Maybe even more valuable than what we put up on Facebook can
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:48.400]   Well at the same time now going back to what Clayton was asking at the very beginning you do have to I mean
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.240]   this
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:55.260]   Did anybody expect that Facebook was gonna buy Instagram for a billion dollars? No, but how is how was Instagram been making money?
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.960]   I mean at some point they have to worry about monetization
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.040]   Certainly it was it was you know
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.600]   It took less time than we thought it was going to maybe or than a lot of people who are even thinking about it
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.120]   You know thought it would going to or would have thought it was going to but at some point
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.720]   They have to make money same thing is gonna happen to path you asked a question about Spotify
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:16.520]   Spotify as a revenue model. I mean they've got advertising and they've got paid subscribers. I'm one
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.120]   But will that be enough money sure somebody else could come in and buy them at some point
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.960]   But yeah, path is just sitting there waiting to be bought right?
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:31.200]   I mean especially after the whole well remember the whole Instagram thing path was started by Dave Morin who took quite a bit of money out of Facebook and
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:38.520]   I doubt very much path will be sold to Facebook because I think the reason Dave left Facebook is so that he wouldn't have to go back to Facebook
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:44.040]   But but you never know right and and some people I saw actually oh Malick was writing about Instagram
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:49.880]   And he said some people said they sold too soon wait a minute if somebody offers me a billion dollars for anything
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:54.720]   Yeah, I think I'd take it right. That's just a large. It's a large number
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.800]   1.5
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.720]   If Kevin's system gets 400 million dollars has more money than he can spend in a lifetime
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.920]   Just the interest is more money than he can spend in a lifetime
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.680]   Why why why whatever what do you hold now for?
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:15.080]   Well my question too is why can't you I'm curious, you know, you certainly build it you have the bring this maybe that's the answer
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.120]   I just answered myself. I don't even need to go on which is the user base, right?
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.440]   You're getting all of these people these individuals. That's what it is, right? Facebook, you know
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:29.760]   So many photos shared from the Facebook application on the iPhone and Android. Why not build a similar a similar?
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.640]   You know photo sharing
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:37.580]   Mechanism with filters and unique things within side the Facebook app why go out and purchase this?
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.120]   It's because of the it's because of the user base and
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:46.700]   One of the ways you don't annoy and piss off the user base is to change everything because then you lose the user base
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.400]   And then this is what Mark what Mark Zuckerberg says
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.520]   We believe that these are different experiences that compliment each other in order to do this well
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.660]   We need to be mindful about keeping and building on Instagram strengths and features
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:03.480]   Rather than just trying to integrate everything into Facebook. That's why we're committed to building and growing Instagram
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:11.680]   Indently so he's reassuring people now. They've never done that before I have to say Facebook has never done that before right
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:17.900]   And but this could be the first time and when you they've never spent a billion dollars for anything before and I think Mark even kind of
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:24.460]   Implied that this is this is a one-time only deal. He says this is an important milestone for Facebook one
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:29.880]   Billion dollar because it's it's the first time we've ever acquired a product and company with so many users
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.540]   We don't plan on doing many more of these if any at all
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.980]   So this is a fine
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:42.280]   Well, you know and why didn't Apple go after Instagram would Apple have benefited from this they have a billion dollars to throw away
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.360]   They make that every month, you know extra well
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:50.440]   Why would Apple go after it though? They've already got people's payment information and their user experience
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.600]   So they have nothing again. I mean most well wait a minute Instagram has nothing of mine
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.920]   Instagram has my pictures my email address and my Facebook login. It doesn't have a credit card
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.040]   How valuable are those 30 million people are they worth it?
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.940]   You're taking are they worth thirty dollars plus each
[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.820]   in your location a
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.900]   Lot of location information, huh?
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.420]   But you could have bought four square for less than a billion
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:19.000]   Right, I'm reminded of what Steve Jobs said to the Dropbox folks, right?
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:26.500]   What was his specific comment to them that you're you're a utility right your interest question
[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:32.620]   Right, and I'm thinking myself really it's a photo app a billion dollars right for a photos app
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.540]   Really? Why couldn't Facebook have done something similar here?
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.540]   But again it comes back to the user base
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:42.980]   And I just try to think about other other services out there that are like this sort of built on one thing
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:49.100]   That are that are right for for being taken over so don't fall too much in love with you know the likes of Pinterest
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:57.820]   path these other things because you know as soon as we fall in love with them and we hit sort of critical mass they get gobbled up Steve Jobs says
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:01.620]   Dropbox is a feature not a product
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:09.140]   He spent the next half hour waxing on over tea about his return to Apple why not to trust investors blah blah blah and then offered
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:13.100]   800 million dollars for Dropbox which they turned down
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:18.460]   So that's a pretty good feature, you know
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:25.940]   He may have dismissed them, but that's Steve right there. That's Steve you guys are crap, but how much exactly right?
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:32.220]   That's that's Steve Jobs in a nutshell. That's just a feature. That's not writing. It's typing
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:36.540]   You're just a million I'll give it to you, but you're not even worth it
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:41.620]   Anything it is negotiation isn't it?
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:47.820]   And he just tweeted that he's standing by for Mac break so you want to try him again
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:54.500]   I will try him. That's an interesting tweet given that we're not able to reach him Andy Naka was this scheduled. He's at the world
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:59.100]   Affairs Council in that Colorado right now
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:05.780]   And I have yeah, he just he just texted two seconds. I'm here two seconds. Oh, are you there? I?
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:14.260]   Have apparently connected with him on Skype. It's a magic the magic of Skype. Yeah, he may because he's at a remote
[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:15.940]   location
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.940]   Somewhere deep within a mountain
[00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.460]   EJ air command
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:25.980]   Here he comes Andy hey Andrew
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:32.580]   Sorry about that everybody no not at all. We're glad to have you here. We've actually just begun
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:37.660]   I'm gonna let you I'll tell you what let's take a break while you get Andy all squared away
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:41.300]   And I'm gonna ask you Andy what you think we've been talking about the Instagram purchase
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:46.220]   That's really the topic of the hour, but the first a word about go to
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:51.180]   Meeting from our good friends at Citrix when we're when we have a meeting
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:59.580]   We do it a lot. It's often with well. I'll give you an example our web team the people designing the tech guy website
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.700]   They don't even have an office
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:08.300]   Go to meeting is like they have they have people in Rhode Island in Colorado all over the world
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.900]   This lullaby
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:15.500]   Company and but this is the beauty of it nowadays. You don't need to be in the same location
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:19.180]   You just use go to meeting go to meeting it's screen sharing. I know you're familiar with that
[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:24.780]   But it's also HD faces. This is their newest feature that lets you see the team
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:30.100]   And I got to tell you this was something very important about seeing people their facial expressions whether you know
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:34.060]   If you're talking to a client his arms are folded or she's smiling those things make a big difference
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:41.940]   And of course if you're pitching a client having them make a connection to you by seeing you is very important HD faces is amazing great quality video
[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:47.900]   Most computers now have cameras and you know what it also works now with the iPad you can join a go to a meeting with an iPad
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:53.700]   With the camera built in the audio built in you could be sitting in the park having a meeting

[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:29.340]   It's incredible and because the screen sharing is built in it's really nice
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:32.500]   You know whoever whoever holds the meeting can start the screen sharing
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:37.700]   But you know anybody in the meeting can say let me show you and take the screen over it is fantastic

[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:51.540]   So there's really it's much more secure for that reason. I just think not the it part now having to punch a hole in the firewall
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:56.700]   I I want you to try it free go to meeting this what we use go to meeting offer code
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:01.940]   Mac break. I think we got Andy all set up now. We brought his avatar in
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:10.260]   Where are you you're are you at the world affairs council the conference on world affairs at the University of Colorado in Boulder?
[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:15.980]   That's such a great event and every time you do this. I say, oh, we've really got to go next year and it happened
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:17.660]   It comes up so quickly
[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:24.340]   Yeah, and matter of fact, Kiki Stanford is here. So that's me. There is there is a twit contingents here good Kiki's great
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:30.780]   Yeah, so what happens at the this is the 64th annual conference on world affairs. What happens there?
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:38.020]   It's like a hundred different panels open to the public they bring like a hundred different speakers from all kinds of professional disciplines
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:45.780]   all the way from Apollo astronauts to former UN directors to people like me to talk about all kinds of topics
[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.660]   politics
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.660]   culture technology science
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:54.820]   So this yesterday I was on talking about Twitter and Facebook
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:19:02.480]   My first panel of the week this morning. I was encouraging 80 journalism students to chip cheer up
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:07.980]   It's not a quite so bad you can make me a journalism today really and and to mark just starting
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.900]   a photo sharing app and you're you're golden
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.660]   Find if you can write find a guy who can write code right?
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:20.780]   Like Lou get coffee and donuts for him if he asks you to because sometime he might be worth a billion dollars
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.260]   But it's cool tomorrow to this afternoon
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:27.140]   I'm talking about a monopanel about interstellar space travel and then tomorrow
[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:30.820]   I have the stage all by myself for four to five minutes to talk about Steve jobs in Apple
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:35.860]   Oh, so which means I've got about 24 hours to think of something to say on either those subjects
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:39.660]   I think you could probably do it in right now. I don't think that's so hard for you
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:43.340]   We'll do it as a pre-record. That's brilliant. Yeah, and now ladies and gentlemen
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.500]   Just hide to the Isaacson book behind the podium and read
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.580]   And then Steve told me I mean him
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:55.980]   So Andy we've been talking about Instagram and you know I started off by saying gosh
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:59.860]   I'm jealous four hundred million dollars to Kevin's system who created it a
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:05.340]   Lot of anger among the Instagram community not all not I wouldn't say the majority by any means
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:12.140]   But I'd say you know some you know five ten percent of the people posting things like Andre Nontelle who's been here and as a friend
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:18.060]   Saying I that's it. I don't I've been I've been on a Microsoft and Facebook diet for years and I'm not starting now
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.060]   Bye-bye Instagram
[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:26.780]   Yeah, and it's not just a problem for people who never wanted to be wanted a photo service that wasn't part of a Facebook
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:30.900]   Now I'm starting to feel a bit of fear if you're somebody who has ever been in a photo
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:36.680]   That's been shared on Instagram because obviously everything that she gets posted to Facebook gets automatically
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:42.540]   Face-tagged and so now I got a sort of worry if I if I was okay with a friend of mine taking a picture of me and my lady
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:47.660]   Gaga costume two years ago because hey, it's just Instagram. Oh dear. We've got a new problem on our hands
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:51.280]   Do you wow I didn't even think of that. Yeah, you use Instagram pretty pretty
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:56.860]   Thoroughly yes, you're you're a regular not not much. I do have an account. I use it from time to time
[00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:01.980]   I do like the service. It's just that I got into a situation of like the social media glut
[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:06.860]   We're trying to figure out what do I use path for what I use Twitter for what I use my blog for
[00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:11.180]   But I did I did I do like it a lot and I just wasn't terribly active on it
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:16.580]   So the cost to me was not terribly great Clayton and I are big path users and I think now
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:22.180]   Yeah, we love it and I think now our fear is are we are gonna face the same thing with path
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:26.700]   Yeah, see that that's the difficulty when you go through the terms of service
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:32.700]   There's a lot of legalese in there and much of it does say that anything that you do becomes our property here and
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:36.580]   The thing that gets a lot of attention is oh gosh if I post a photo on path
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:40.140]   I post a photo on Instagram does it become the intellectual property of Instagram?
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.140]   And of course they it's they're gonna say no it isn't because that's not true
[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:49.500]   But what's really valuable is the reg is just that social map that you build after a number of months or years on a service
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:57.020]   if I'm using after five years of using using Twitter inside their computers is a really great map of the people that I like the people that
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:02.780]   I respect the people want to hear from every article that I was interested in enough to follow a link from Twitter and
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:03.980]   if
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:07.460]   Some company decided to buy Twitter and then to shut down the service
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:11.420]   They would have a wealth of information about a great many users
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:16.180]   And of course because you click that okay button you kind of waved your right to not be exploited
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.540]   We we trust Twitter and that's fine. We trust Apple and that's fine
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:23.700]   But would we trust the company that might buy Twitter the company that might buy insta paper?
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:30.460]   So that's where it really is coming to prove that there is no such thing as opting out of social media now because at some point
[00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:36.780]   Somebody will collect some piece of data from you that at some point will be sold to somebody else and then the cats out of the bag
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:40.220]   It's like Google plus and I speaking of the terms of service
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:46.260]   I just got a notification from path because I took a photo of my son earlier today that now path owns my son
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:58.940]   Actually, there would be a big difference with path because path has the promise of privacy you only share with the people that
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:05.980]   You connect with on path whereas Instagram was like Twitter always public right if anybody could follow you on Instagram
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:13.220]   So there's no there's no expectation of privacy on Instagram. Well unless you I mean you can you can lock up your account on Instagram
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:16.740]   Oh, that's true to right now. Nobody can follow you, but you know if you're doing that I
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.860]   What happens to that?
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:27.260]   Well, I would imagine it well as long as Facebook keeps it the way it is and don't misunderstand I'm not saying Facebook is gonna do anything
[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:33.500]   Bad with it. I mean the only or questionable my I mean I'm I'm honestly like I said before
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:37.060]   I've kind of made peace with the fact that Facebook is gathering all sorts of information
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:40.860]   I just don't want them to screw up the thing that I like I mean they've already done you mentioned earlier
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:46.340]   Do you get off of a social network once they change it? I don't go to Facebook anymore because it's gotten to be too much of a
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:52.700]   Pain right I mean and it just it's it every six months. It's something different
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.180]   I don't want that to be the same the same way with Instagram because
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:59.100]   It's probably that they use most often on my phone that and um
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:07.340]   Probably that it's probably the most often used app on my phone that and ospura the the Twitter client that I use right and can can you just
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:11.660]   Mention something earlier about changing the UI and then Andy brought up a great point about tagging
[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:15.700]   I mean that's not something you can currently do within the app and you're worried about changing the UI
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:18.820]   I wonder if a an update is forthcoming because
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.900]   While they say they're not going to do anything to it
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.820]   I can't imagine that that would be a feature. They wouldn't want in
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:30.360]   You know, you know brought into Instagram, which is the ability to tag friends and photos
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.100]   right
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:36.540]   That seems to me one thing that they may say that's one thing we're gonna change
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:41.940]   That's one thing we need to add to this otherwise it really doesn't fit with the way in which we share photos on Facebook
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:45.700]   and let's let's not forget that Facebook is they're the kings of
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:53.580]   Upgrading the security and privacy features that they offer to their users and then quietly changing a default setting that you'd already put in
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:55.820]   So my worry is that what if six months from now?
[00:24:55.820 --> 00:25:01.420]   They there was some sort of a default setting that said that your Instagram pictures belong to an Instagram cloud
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:02.780]   And they're separate from Facebook
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:07.620]   Maybe there's gonna be an update which we won't know until two days later that oh by the way you didn't know it
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:14.700]   But your 200 Instagram photos just got added to what other Facebook users can see you didn't we gave you the option of opting out
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:19.700]   By allowing you to click on this button and then that tab and then scrolling down to the bottom and then clicking this other button
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.380]   You chose not to do that and so we decided that you were okay with that
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:26.780]   Right there is and thanks to the chat room for pointing this out
[00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:36.180]   There is an Instagram delete page in the Instagram support center in order to delete your Instagram account visit instagram.com/accounts/remove/request
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:44.700]   When you delete your account your photos comments likes and friendships everything will be removed permanently and will not be recoverable
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:50.020]   So you do have an opportunity at least now to if you really paranoid about it
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:58.260]   To get rid of it. This is what Kevin Rose posted on Instagram. He's right now. He's on his he's on a trip in Japan with his
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:06.780]   new fiance and he but nevertheless took some time and remember that Kevin just sold his company to Google and and there were rumors that
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:09.100]   Google was hotly
[00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:14.740]   Bidding in a bidding war for milk Kevin's company with Facebook
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:19.700]   So Facebook's been kind of looking for this kind of now milk didn't have anywhere near the size community
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.820]   But it had some good developers Kevin wrote huge
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:28.100]   Congratulations to team Instagram on joining Facebook Kevin's system and team have built a product that brings out the photographer and all of us
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.100]   I'm excited to see what they can dream up next with Facebook
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:34.180]   Behind them on the other hand. I've seen a lot of people say hey really what is it?
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.780]   It's just a it's just a bunch of kind of crappy filters
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:45.100]   Really it's a social network built around the idea of in some ways making us better photographers making us
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:48.520]   More look better. I don't know if you're a better photographer, but you look better in Facebook, right?
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.460]   Because of the filters well, I think heck
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:56.100]   I mean I know looking at other people's photos you see angles on different photos that you might hear to for you might not have thought
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:02.420]   Right see different ways in which to capture an individual whether it's a portrait or whatever landscape something like that
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:09.980]   So in many ways that's why people are so attracted to Instagram because it's that one area where they can go and they can see other people's photos
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:12.180]   They can they can comment on it
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:16.460]   They can learn something themselves and even if it's there's no filters at all being used on it
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.380]   It's just cropping it so that it's you know
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:22.140]   Well, and I do you know we had a very penny
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:30.180]   Della Rosa Della Rosa was on that Twitter photo professional photographer who said she uses Instagram for inspiration
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.180]   I mean this woman is a very accomplished
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:36.820]   Professional photographer she says oh no Instagram is huge for me. I get inspiration from it
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:41.940]   She's a food photographer posts a lot of great pictures a lot of pros use Instagram actually
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:46.100]   So you know kudos. I'm not really that jealous
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:51.960]   I'm very happy for we interviewed them when Instagram first came out Sarah Lane taught told me about Instagram
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:56.540]   Right when it first started. I think we were Sarah and I and our group here at Twitt
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.540]   We're probably among the first users of Instagram
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:04.740]   And trouble to remember yeah my first post heads of profanity in it which I deeply regret and and Mark Zuckerberg
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:07.300]   Please if you don't mind I'd like to delete that
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:13.700]   That mark owns that yeah, he owns it now. Nothing I can do about it
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:20.940]   It's really I think you know the only thing I take away from it is wow. This is an overheated
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:24.820]   I think we are now a bubble for the app economy, right? There's no question about that
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:31.820]   Well, it's it's it's also I'm sure I'm sure you guys were commenting about this earlier that part of it must have been just to keep
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.820]   Instagram from falling into someone else's hands
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:38.500]   And when you got when you have that much money in the bank and you can simply write a check and take a gun off the street
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.540]   You just take the gun off the street and that somebody else has to be Google, right?
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:49.620]   Could be Google. I'm not sure if a company like Yahoo could have found any mount anywhere near the amount of money to
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:57.060]   If Yahoo wins their lawsuit against Facebook
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:03.660]   This was this would have sounded like a much less silly statement
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:07.700]   I'm sorry say it again. Wait a minute. Okay, go ahead
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:14.060]   I'm sorry my initial reaction was well, it's good. I wasn't drinking coffee. That's all I was
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:20.300]   I was I was pretty much going to say that a company like a feature like Instagram could have saved a company like Yahoo
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.620]   Had them able to raise the money, but they can't raise the money
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:26.340]   So they're out, but it would also been a really big gem for Google to get
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:30.300]   As soon as I heard the news yesterday afternoon the first thing I thought was yeah
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:34.580]   This is like Google when Google bought YouTube that by one stroke
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:39.500]   They solved a problem that they had being a product that they were trying to make with Google video
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:43.340]   But hadn't really found an attraction with and knowing that whoever acquires
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:47.980]   Yeah, YouTube was gonna have a really big stick to beat Google over the head with may as well just write the check
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:52.060]   Take the gun off the street and make that part of your portfolio, but you're right if Flickr
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:54.860]   Could have acquired this could have been huge
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:30:01.540]   Right, you can't share from Instagram to Flickr. Yeah, and Flickr is of course part of you party
[00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:03.540]   Yeah, right
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:09.980]   But it really does show the the the idea of a company kind of circling the drain a little bit on certain features
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:17.140]   The fact that Yahoo acquired Flickr which still is my favorite photo sharing site and didn't turn it into
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:22.340]   Mobile just shows that oh god start start putting in bids on the office furniture
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:29.300]   This is just just like that that's that mildly offensive thing where that the certain empires used to do is saying
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:34.260]   I'm gonna I want your resources. So I'm declaring you a society and chaos and capable self-government
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:39.260]   I'm gonna point a colonial governor for Flickr. I'm gonna start running you properly from now on
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:45.340]   I mean it was a no-brainer Flickr could have done it in a mean because there's nothing really that hard to do by the way
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:52.860]   I thank you to Pat Dimi in our chatroom. It's Penny de los Santos is the photographer who used Instagram still does use Instagram
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:56.220]   For lots and well worth following on Instagram
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:01.220]   She's just a great photographer and was on Twitter and said Instagram was a huge inspiration
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:04.100]   for
[00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.900]   It's not even like I mean we shouldn't be too offensive about
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:13.660]   Yahoo and Flickr because even even Facebook was trying to figure out how to make mobile photo wraps really really work and failing
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:18.740]   The I mean the other thing that was currently me yesterday was that this is if you can imagine a car manufacturer
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:22.860]   That doesn't have a truck division trying to understand why people buy pickup trucks and well
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:28.300]   The sort of person who wants that even if they don't own a farm at some point you say what if we just bought this company who's been
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.780]   successfully designing trucks for three years and just
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:37.580]   Boom done. Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah, can I ask a question sure can what what does?
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:39.780]   Facebook actually get out of this
[00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:44.900]   I mean if they're going to if they're gonna leave Instagram the way that it is are they using it as sort of a test kitchen
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:51.780]   I mean are they are they coming up with features in Instagram or using the features in Instagram and moving them over to Facebook because I mean
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:56.180]   We talked about this before or I mentioned it before there's still no monetization
[00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:59.500]   Involved in Instagram, so it's not like they're making more money
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:07.100]   They get 30 million users, but they've got so many millions more users than you got a figure that 90% of the 30 million are already
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:12.940]   Facebook users one would think I think most of my pictures on Facebook come from path an Instagram
[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:17.460]   So I mean like Andy when you say that they're trying to take a gun off the street
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:22.560]   What was I mean that gun did that gun have bullets? I mean it was it was it was
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:27.340]   good, I like it but not being used for I mean I
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:31.320]   Don't understand why I don't know you I
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:35.540]   Immediately - you know well pulling my hair out, but I want to
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:39.780]   Why is this happening to I mean do I don't want it to happen rather?
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:40.300]   I started it
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:44.380]   I don't want it to happen and now I'm sort of going back and going what are they getting right?
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:50.260]   Well, I didn't I got I got admit that I didn't understand the half a billion dollar evaluation to be to begin with
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:53.620]   I doubly didn't understand how this suddenly became worth a billion dollars
[00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:59.780]   I think what Facebook will get out of it is that Instagram will be the brand name for
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.340]   for
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:06.980]   Facebook photo sharing right now as much as as much as some people don't like to like to hear it
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:12.340]   Facebook really is the most popular photo sharing site on the entire Internet if they immediately now have the most popular
[00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:14.340]   photo sharing site in mobile space
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.340]   that only
[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:17.860]   enhances the value of
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:22.940]   Facebook as a as a as a site for that sort of thing also their whole concept is out
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:26.700]   Your your life is a timeline that should be shared with as many people as possible
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:34.160]   Instagram really is that this that really is that then their app for people to immediately take a device out of their pocket and share an
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.740]   Event with their sort of friends, so they might have felt that it was very very competitive
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:45.620]   But again this to acquire Instagram's features into someone else's product could have possibly been the sort of thing that
[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:50.300]   Take somebody off of the ropes and makes them viable again, and this is a short
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:53.000]   This is an industry with a short memory
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.660]   Facebook could be
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:34:01.140]   Not no longer the Facebook of their category five years from now if they ignore
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:07.740]   That if there if the people start using and collecting information in a way that Facebook hasn't anticipated yet
[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:12.280]   And they have no product that can satisfy this new direction that the people are following into
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:17.140]   That could be very expensive for them for five years from now, but I do agree with you
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:23.500]   I don't see how they're gonna get a half a billion dollars worth of value out of this investment let alone a billion dollars of
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.820]   investment
[00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:26.980]   I mean we gotta be we gotta find that out
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:31.660]   Any when you had mentioned the idea of the being integrated into the platform
[00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:36.700]   It made I mean what I thought of yesterday when I saw this is suddenly within a Facebook app on
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:43.020]   You know the iPad or the iPhone or or any other device you're gonna see perhaps and who knows but perhaps you'd see
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:46.860]   Instead of snap a photo the name of your photos is now Instagram
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:52.220]   There's an Instagram little icon there you click and you're able to take a photo right within Facebook right within the Facebook app
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:56.440]   So maybe the UI on on on Instagram doesn't change, but the Facebook
[00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:58.380]   UI right?
[00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:05.820]   You hate to you hate to make bold predictions, but I'd be really surprised if Instagram really had any presence as an
[00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:09.300]   Independent entity a year from now. I really think that there's
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:15.580]   That Facebook has started engulfing engulfing Instagram and within a year or two his time
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:21.780]   It's just going to be a name of a feature that's embedded into Facebook and in terms of privacy controls in terms of
[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:23.260]   the
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:28.460]   The simplicity of the experience. I don't think you'll be anything like what we're seeing today and Instagram alright guys
[00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:34.220]   Who's next who's next who's the next big acquisition? Maybe not by Facebook, but by Google Facebook
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:36.820]   Yahoo
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:41.700]   Is path the next on the block? I was trying to think whatever we love that's what they'll take
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:48.660]   It's true Pinterest if you like it's Pinterest interest yeah for me. It's path
[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:52.860]   Yeah, you know it's I do love path. I really do and
[00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:56.660]   I think why we like path is because it's somewhat more private
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:05.100]   Right and you get to share a level of intimacy that you share on I think you know Facebook in many ways for a lot of people
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.180]   But maybe not not you know
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:11.260]   I have friends from high school that I'll check in on see what they're doing on Facebook and they're much more
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:17.740]   Liberal with their what they post on there right, but I sort of reserve that for path. I feel like you know
[00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:20.740]   Maybe I want to I want to just reserve the the more intimate
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:26.260]   That insulates it in fact in a way Dave Moore may have made a mistake it insulates it against acquisition because
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:31.460]   Yeah, nobody wants to buy that because in fact, that's the real question for Facebook
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:35.060]   Isn't it their number one job now is to reassure Instagram users
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:41.420]   Don't worry don't leave because if they bought anything it ain't the interface it ain't the programmers. It's the yeah community
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:46.520]   And it's the data - I mean how many of you got the data and how many of you buy a show of hands?
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:50.060]   Okay, you tag just about every Instagram photo you take
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.700]   Just you and me apparently
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.660]   I'm about 50/50 I
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:58.840]   Do never geotechnical and I'm worse I cross post
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:05.240]   Not only do I do you never geotechnical anything and he's on the run from the law. I believe no wonder we couldn't find him
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.740]   No, it's just it's just it's it's really hard to it
[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:12.940]   Geofencing doesn't really work very well the way that different apps have set it up right now
[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:17.300]   And so I'm very very afraid that if I turn on locations for things that are useful like hey
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:20.520]   I'm in the middle of the Boston's public garden. Here's a really here's where I took this picture
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.780]   We should come here and see this then the next thing I know I'm out of friends house
[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:28.060]   And I've compromised this person's privacy by broadcasting. Here's where I'm right now
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:35.240]   the house of somebody that I like and so it's until geofencing becomes absolutely bulletproof reliable and until
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:37.780]   more social networks like Facebook
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:45.060]   Absolutely say that we'll tell you will tell people that the moment that we release the geolocation of a photo
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:51.200]   You told us to stay private. We will find a top-level executive and have him or her murdered on live television
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:56.340]   Because that's how seriously we take it. Maybe not murder, but just humiliated just you know
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:38:02.380]   I'm looking at my pictures. They're almost all but that's partly because maybe you do this as well Clayton
[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.860]   I don't use four squared directly. No, I don't either
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:07.820]   So that's how I check in on four squares well is with Instagram or path
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:13.340]   I always so all of that geolocation data now being shared with Facebook is
[00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:16.020]   Incredibly valuable as we move towards you know
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:22.980]   Location-based advertising things that are around you things you found interesting. Okay one more question then we're gonna go to break
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:27.460]   This is a big question and I want all three of you to answer it because
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:30.300]   Look at let's face it if you carry a cell phone
[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:37.940]   You are geolocating everywhere you go is your location an important piece of
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:40.340]   private information
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:46.000]   Because if I see you walking down the street, I know your location how private is location information Ken Ray
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:55.300]   How private should it be I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't know how to answer that do you hide your location?
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:39:00.540]   Well, I mean from what you just said about no, I don't guess I do I
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:07.520]   Because I think cuz let me the reason I ask that is become so prevalent that we don't really think about it that much
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:11.260]   Do we unless we're and the end-out go the police the police know where you are at all times
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:13.600]   Because they can they can for a buck-fifty
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:17.800]   Check your cell carrier and say where is he right triangulation figure out where you are?
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:21.080]   And pen pen register doesn't even require a search warrant
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:26.880]   Is that something we want to protect is our location something we want to protect what what do you think?
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.120]   Clayton
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.800]   You know, it's funny you say that I mean
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:37.440]   I guess you know as I'm walking around with my with my iPhone turned on geolocation services or location services turned on all the
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:38.280]   time
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:42.720]   And you know, my wife wants to make sure that I'm on you know find my friends or latitudes
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.560]   So she knows when to pick me up from the train station
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:48.760]   She just checks in on that rather than texting me and trying to find out exactly where I am and maybe I'm half asleep
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.200]   So
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:56.480]   Yeah, I feel like in certain situations. I'm very open about my location and other times
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:02.520]   I'm very very aware that you know, I'm on vacation. I don't want to tweet this particular location and have
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:07.040]   So it's it's situational right it's very situational for me
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:10.480]   I think that's actually path within path. I never worry about it
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:17.480]   That's I think the difference right because you're friending individuals where you're close with I don't ever think twice about putting the location in
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:24.000]   Path but in other situations. I always think about it. Mm-hmm. How about you Andy? Obviously you you do consider this
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.480]   It's not only for my privacy is for the privacy of people that hang out with
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:34.640]   I'm very concerned about the fact that it's becoming it is becoming harder and harder for anybody to opt out of being part of the social
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:39.120]   Map and I just think about how skeaved out someone could be to notice that I
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:42.040]   Tweet I might tweet something to you know
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:48.760]   I've 60,000 followers but even if I only had like four or five hundred if someone just why did you broadcast your
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:53.480]   Location to 200 absolute total strangers that I don't know right. Thank you for you know
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:41:00.160]   I might have to not invite you to the next cookout or the next party because I just don't want it concerns me that that
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:03.520]   Information is out there, you know, we've got exciting
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:08.680]   I just feel like we're living in 1984 because a no more privacy period. Let's face it
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:13.360]   Be the government clearly wants to know everything so we're screwed
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.240]   on that happy note
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:24.200]   T mobile gets the iPhone. I'll explain what I mean in just a moment, but first a word from Ford our great friends at Ford
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:26.120]   I mean
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.720]   You know Ford should have bought Instagram. What am I thinking?
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.680]   for
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:37.520]   So we can drive intake pictures at the same time brilliant idea for new right away and not every car company knows this that
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.520]   There was gonna be this issue
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.800]   Consumers on the one hand really want to be connected in fact
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:45.640]   I think it was Walt Mossberger said you know until recently when you get in the car you travel back to the 50s
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.320]   You're not you're you know
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.920]   you're driving and
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:55.080]   Of course despite the fact that we want to stay connected. There's this big issue about distracted driving. It's a huge problem
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:42:00.520]   And I think for early on I saw this coming and said look we've got to create a way
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:04.000]   To solve the problem give consumers what they want but not risk
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.920]   Distracted driving and they came up with a beautiful solution which we talk about all the time Ford Sync
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:12.680]   The idea is you don't take your hands off the wheel. You don't take your eyes off the road
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:13.760]   You don't look down on the screen
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:19.160]   You don't twiddle a knob you can do everything that you could do in a car tune a radio station
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.720]   make a phone call
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:26.480]   Set the cabin temperature find a gas station get your horoscope for crying out loud
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:33.880]   With Ford Sync and your voice. It's all voice activated. It's amazing. I haven't my 2010 Mustang and I love it now the newest
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:38.880]   Fords have Ford Sync plus app link and this is this is taking it to the next level
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:45.280]   They have an a Ford has an API for your smartphone iPhone Android Windows phone that developers
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:48.840]   Can write apps that you control by your voice?
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:55.200]   So now you get in the car the phones connected either via Bluetooth or via USB and all Ford sync vehicles have a USB connector
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:43:01.000]   That goes, you know right into your iPhone or your Android phone and you just connect it up and then you can talk to your phone and say things like
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.280]   Yeah Pandora you could say play Pandora play my Pandora station the Rolling Stones
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:09.600]   You could thumbs up thumbs down you could say skip to the next one
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:14.880]   You can even bookmark a song for purchase later on iTunes all without taking your hands off the wheel in the eyes off the road
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:18.240]   That's really cool stuff. You're still connected, but you're still safe
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:26.640]   Towards a lot of research that shows we have more than sufficient cognitive ability to do this as long as you're focusing on what you're doing
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:29.400]   You have plenty of ability to have a phone conversation
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:33.560]   She's not even that complicated to say play my Rolling Stones records. That's cool
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:39.600]   Now they've got NPR has an app so you could listen to news as well as NPR shows
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:46.480]   There's iHeart radio, which is the clear channel radio app that means lots of radio stations including all of my tech guy stations
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:51.120]   You can listen to just talk to the car. It's amazing. They even have a destinations app
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:56.040]   So in a lot of cars with Ford's sake don't have the big screen line does but they don't have the big
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:01.920]   You know GPS maps, but you can use your phone for it get access to navigation and directions through your smartphone
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:05.480]   Talking to it hands on the whale eyes on the road see that button boom
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:08.760]   That's all you do
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:14.960]   Yeah, the API platform is available. Yeah, it makes that sound I will you know actually makes a nice little tone chime
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.960]   I would like it if we'll go
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:21.800]   I have the 2010 Ford escape with you don't have a
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:28.480]   I want the I want the I want stitcher. I want to be able to podcasts in there. That's right
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:34.920]   You could you could have dad on board on board right that would be awesome. That'd be very meta
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:41.000]   They also have to have a mobile application developer network if you're a developer to
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:46.360]   There will you can use to contact Ford and say I want to I want to sync enable my app and they'll work with you
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.800]   I think there's a little scratch in there, too
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:55.360]   You can expect to see more sync enabled mobile apps. I'm not making a promise here that for writing a check that Ford has to cash
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:59.640]   But I think I suspect you can expect to see more sync enabled mobile apps
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:03.840]   Going along for the ride in Ford vehicles. There's more all the time
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:09.760]   Learn more at the website for dot com slash technology or you know what the best thing go drive one today
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:16.480]   The I think the 2013 all the 2013s the 2012 focus Fiesta
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.640]   We were we tested it in a Fiat 2012 Fiesta was awesome
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:23.720]   Sync and app link what a marriage made in heaven
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:29.200]   How do you like you having escape? Yeah, you got that you got that so you have the kid you have to buy the
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.680]   The fan
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:34.640]   Head up to the mountains quote of it. So we needed something with four-wheel drive drive
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:38.840]   you know just looking we we test drove a ton of cars and
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:43.280]   The we test drove this early on and we test drove a whole bunch of other ones and we came back
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:48.840]   So I just want the Ford escape. Yeah, it was affordable and it just it's been a great car. It's great. I love it
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:52.800]   So here's my thinking T-Mobile
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:46:03.160]   So AT&T is announced they announced on Sunday that they are they will unlock your iPhone if you've had it for in contract for the two years
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:12.880]   Today we have more than one million unlocked iPhones running on the T-Mobile network T-Mobile says T-Mobile currently offers
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:16.600]   Micro sims for customers who already have a GSM phone. They want to use on the T-Mobile network
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:23.240]   including an iPhone in order to set up an unlocked iPhone on T-Mobile's network just purchase a micro sim card select
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:27.400]   T-Mobile plan that suits your needs and you're using your iPhone on T-Mobile
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:32.200]   And by the way T-Mobile is a lot more affordable. They have a
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:37.120]   Lot more. Yeah, they have plans that are fairly you don't like we're talking the well
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:43.560]   They have a way for what you get to pay for what you get. Yep. Yeah, they don't have full full 4G rollout
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:48.320]   And I guess some of the areas of the East Coast. I've been hearing different reports but different people having
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:53.720]   Showing up on I've got some tweets about it people showing up on their phones that they're getting HP
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:59.040]   I can never say HSPA plus right in certain areas
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:07.280]   Yeah, they still don't have the full 4G rollout but for 49 bucks for two lines two lines. It's great. Yeah unlimited text to gigs data
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:13.000]   No, I have I have I have my I'm sorry. It's 49 bucks for each line, right?
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:20.160]   Total is 99. Yeah, oh, okay. That's still what is still better than the 130 for for AT&T
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:25.440]   But yeah, you have to put up with T-Mobile. So we really come down there. Do you have good T-Mobile? So here's the deal
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:34.120]   You can Apple actually is apparently according to the the next web.com the one doing the unlocking actually Grant Paul
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:39.360]   It was an iPhone hacker and developer did the did the research here as
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:43.880]   Of Sunday you can if you're out of contract in your iPhone
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:49.920]   You can either go to an AT&T store or an online chat at AT&T's website
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:55.760]   All they need is your I am EI number which is in the about this phone dialogue
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:00.400]   Yeah, one of the things I'm really excited about this is the international
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:08.820]   Traveling because you know if you've got maybe you know, maybe you're like me or maybe you're like one of my my family members
[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:12.700]   Clutsey and you tend to drop phones or you tend to break phones
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:16.960]   You may not want to bring your you know iPhone 4s if you've got if you've got that or one of your new phones
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:18.960]   And let's say you've got an old phone laying around
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.400]   Maybe you've got a
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:25.720]   Laying around what a good point I do you could you could pop that
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:27.780]   In you could do the same thing there and it's you know
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:31.000]   It's been unlock it take it with you and then you know
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.280]   Maybe you don't need the highest data speeds because you're overseas for a short amount of time
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:35.800]   And you don't want to suck up a lot of data anyway
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:38.740]   You just want it to make you know text messages or just some you know
[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:42.720]   I didn't even think of that you could do up to five devices a year
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:48.680]   But that's a good point if you have your old if you didn't go to Gazelle like we can tell on you
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:51.240]   And you have your hold which I do I have an old 3GS
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:58.680]   Which I've been keeping because you know my son has an iPhone 4 not a force before and I just watched the the glass
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:00.280]   You know it's of course is broken
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:05.040]   But I just watch it slowly peel away and I know that you know it after a month or two
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:06.480]   He's gonna want a new phone
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:10.120]   Right and so I have the 3GS ready and waiting for you Henry
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:13.960]   But I'm but I'm how I'm thinking maybe I'll unlock it and I could bring it to and I have my regular phone
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:15.960]   But I can have an international phone
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:18.920]   Now can you get micro Sims easily readily overseas?
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:25.200]   I don't know about micro Sims, but I know that Sims are pretty easy to get as matter of fact
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:28.920]   So the 3GS would be fine. Yeah, I mean before you even leave Heathrow
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:34.200]   You can go to it just a automated kiosk put in a put in a credit card and it's basically pop out 20 pounds worth of
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:37.920]   Orange orange wireless
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:40.120]   So that was that was my attraction
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:46.440]   I mean eight I do like AT&T's international roaming plan and the three days I spent in Barcelona without a
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:52.040]   iPhone connected to a data plan with the worst three days of the last 10 years of my life
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:57.360]   So believe me that I am going to be I did I am going through my box of old
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:02.240]   iPhones finding whichever the newest one will could be unlocked and immediately getting unlocked for exactly that purpose
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:06.120]   Well, I wonder if it'll work on the iPhone 1 because I still have that
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:12.880]   That's funny. Oh, I do too. I do too. It's in my museum. Oh, I don't love it
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.760]   It's still be one of those beautiful design pieces of hardware
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:22.560]   I have the original iPod the original iPhone. I have a Newton so I have a little glass case would like this class classic technology
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:29.840]   But the but the funny thing is I actually I actually fired up a charged and fired up my my iPhone 1 for the first time in like two years
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.560]   It really felt like a Chinese knockoff
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:39.600]   Screened look crummy the transitions were like four frames per second as like my god
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:45.360]   I used to I used to this is this was the Jesus phone. I don't think so three hours of battery life
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:47.640]   Yeah, exactly
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:51.400]   So I've there breed did you find it? Hey look it's an edge connection
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:58.480]   We'll get 3g someday look at this well now and and and what did I ask you? Oh?
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:01.840]   That's the original iPod. Yeah. Oh, it's a little dusty. Oh
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:07.560]   I have to dust my collection. There's the original life on your right. It does kind of feel a
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:14.560]   Little it's got the same fingerprints from a from 2007. I wonder if this is what the iPhone 5 is gonna look like
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:16.560]   I
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:24.000]   That rumor that says who it's gonna have like a unibody chest you know, it's exciting about this people wanted so much and and
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:30.800]   It it sounds like that they can really push this because they say now with plastic for better antenna work, you know, you know, you
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:36.160]   Cuz they were smart enough to have a plastic bottom in those days so that the antenna would actually work
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:40.000]   Wow dinner, you know, but yeah, it's not I mean how they gonna fit
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.520]   You know that all the rumors of course about a larger iPhone in the fall
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:46.840]   But how you know my question is how are they going to fit if they do keep it at 3.5 inches?
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:50.120]   How are they gonna, you know fit an LTE chip in there, right?
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:52.840]   That would be the first right that would be the first battery
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:58.360]   Oh, there's the same sounds like I could actually use this. It's kind of the be kind of retro
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:04.280]   I'll save it for another five years and pull it out. It'd be like Michael Douglas in Wall Street. Wow
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:10.680]   That phone is so huge. Sometimes there's gonna have to be a film right there's gonna be some Hollywood film where it's gonna take place in what?
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:15.120]   6 2007 and they're gonna need a whole bunch of iPhones, right?
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:15.880]   They're gonna need a button
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:19.080]   And so if you have a whole bunch of them on hand just wait for Hollywood to come calling
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:23.440]   I was watching something the other day and everybody there was a lot of cell phone activity
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:28.240]   It was all iPhones and I thought boy, that's not gonna date. That's not gonna age well, but then maybe it will
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:34.760]   Maybe I have this idea right my own Instagram idea
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:40.480]   They'll make me a billion dollars is you know how like James Cameron spent all that money to update Titanic for 3d
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:46.680]   If you really want to update movies so that you can re-release it take the movies from like 1988 and just digitally replace like the
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:48.760]   CRT TV with a flat screen
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:52.720]   Digitally remove like the the huge shoebox phone for like an iPhone
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:58.200]   You can do this those are the only cues that people have that these things are not happening in 19 in 2012
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:01.280]   Cost you a lot less money. I think it's more return on the investment
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:08.800]   You got a pity the poor Wall Street analysts who really can't say anything much new about Apple except buy more Apple stock buy more Apple stock
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:15.200]   Every once in a while though you get an outlier from BITG research a guy named Walter Pichik has
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:19.080]   Cut his Apple by rating to a neutral
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:22.880]   He says to investors this Apple thing just can't go on
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:30.440]   He says telecoms get this are growing weary of paying high subsidies for the iPhone
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:35.760]   With returns that don't match Apple's high margins in other words Apple's making more than the cell phone companies
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:39.280]   So they're just gonna stop carrying iPhones. I don't yeah
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:43.600]   I think so because it's all about what the carriers want. It's not about consumer demand
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:47.320]   Yeah, I agree with that too
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:53.520]   I just but there is maybe some kernel of truth to that when you certainly see what they they were doing with this launch the other day
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:56.840]   You know, I love that phone now. Have you been carrying that as your full-time?
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:59.720]   He's he's got the low the Nokia Lumia 900
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:04.480]   Yeah, I've been carrying it just as equally as I've been carrying the iPhone 4s and you know
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:06.600]   I'm a whoa whoa that doesn't count
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:13.000]   That does not count I can't know I can't because they're truth you I have to give up your iPhone if you're gonna really
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:20.040]   Equally I'm carrying this is no you're not in one pocket
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:28.120]   I mean I it's hard to review a phone if you've got an iPhone because it's like well
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:30.360]   I don't really want to give up. No, but for about a week
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:35.800]   Prior to the to the launch or prior, you know, I had it in early release and I was playing with it
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:41.360]   It's pretty amazing. I really kept the iPhone away as much as I could and yeah, it's a you know, it's a beautiful phone
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:47.040]   But to the point of them being perhaps more interested in the lower
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:50.000]   Amount of money that they're gonna get for
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:55.600]   The it goes back to Apple. I mean look they spent a hundred and fifty million dollars AT&T did
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:55:02.560]   Behind the the Lumia 900 as part of this launch, which of course launched on Easter Sunday. Yeah, that was smart
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   Yeah, let's see let's launch our hot new phone on a day when all our stores are closed
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.240]   I guess they were worried about people lining up and causing traffic problem
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:15.880]   There was actually there was a wonderful I can't remember who it was that wrote it
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:20.480]   But somebody was like yeah, it's actually pretty smart because then if sales don't go well, that's true. Well, it was Easter
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:23.280]   Yeah, not our fault. Yeah, what are people gonna do?
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:29.280]   Call it was also there's also somebody bragging about how it was the number one most ordered phone on Amazon
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:34.600]   And I said yeah because so many other stores were kind of closed that if the people who are out shopping
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:37.280]   We're probably more shopping from home than going out to a store on that Sunday
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:42.360]   I kind of feel bad because we've been letting Alex Gumpel in our
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:49.400]   Office use and review this he's our only really kind of dedicated windows users. Unfortunately, I'm showing his pictures now on
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:54.240]   National television and dudes in there
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:57.760]   Kind of bad. I don't know if Alex really knew that
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:03.720]   We'd be doing I really wanted to like this phone. I think maybe more than I did
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:08.160]   I think Andy you maybe said it best a few weeks ago that there were there's still a few holes
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:15.600]   Well, it's it's apps, right? There's no Instagram, right? Well, and you know look in Internet Explorer on here is I've I've had nothing
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:19.720]   But problems really explore on here and you know just trying to load web pages
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:24.560]   I know their years is loading perfectly there, but where even in my video review
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:32.040]   And I didn't I was on LTE in the middle of Midtown Manhattan LTE, which you know every other phone that I test on LTE is really fast
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:35.940]   Just would hang up. I couldn't get web pages to load
[00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:41.040]   And I know other people I think even Walt Mossberg reported having issues loading web pages on Wi-Fi
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:46.240]   And I actually talked to somebody from Nokia about this and they said they're they're they're looking into it
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:49.120]   They have R&D looking into it right now and trying to figure out what's going on here
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:52.680]   So I still can't I'm trying to load it isn't loading. Let me see if I can load
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:55.520]   Let's see Leo Vil
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:57:02.360]   There's one of my favorite little small blog sites. There's Twit finally loaded. Yeah, you're right
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:07.280]   It's well, maybe that was a twit problem. It seems like certain websites and I can't figure out even if like mobile
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:09.800]   Mobile optimized websites as well like really?
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:13.720]   Yeah, you would think well you're not having as many photos to worry about it
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:19.520]   rendering and kilobits instead of megabytes and still not still not loading quickly, but
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:25.600]   Do love the hardware. Yeah, I just think it's a beautiful phone, but you know, it's too late
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:29.220]   It I don't know if it's too little too late, but it's definitely too late
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:36.040]   Everybody has an iPhone
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:44.240]   99 bucks and Microsoft supposedly bang between the what it was a 10 and $15 bounty for every
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:50.320]   Well, they had to do that because other carry TNT other carries do that they weren't getting AT&T wasn't recommending
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:52.680]   Windows phones, so they kind of had to do that
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:56.000]   Well, but I mean you've got you've got at least three different prongs there though
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.180]   You've got Microsoft doing that and then I think it was Nokia
[00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:04.000]   Poning up something like 25 million dollars to make this the free phone for AT&T
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.240]   So it's not just a matter of our for AT&T employees
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:10.240]   So it's not just a matter of okay, you guys sell this because you'll make some more money
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:12.480]   But then it's also by the way if you want a free phone from us
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:17.880]   Here's your free phone get to know it get to love and go ahead and start using it and then you've got AT&T spending a hundred fifty million dollars
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:23.920]   I don't remember. I mean everybody keeps talking about and correct me if I'm wrong because it's been four and a half years now
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:28.160]   But everybody keeps talking about well AT&T is spending more on this than they spent on the iPhone launch
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:30.720]   Did AT&T spend real money on the iPhone launch?
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:35.840]   I mean there was so much there was so much talk for six months before that and I remember AT&T
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:40.120]   Honestly acting a little peo'd when I came in the first day of the iPhone launch
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:45.840]   Just because I happened to pass two of them and they seem really more annoyed that I was there asking about the iPhone than anything
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:49.740]   They're behind this phone. Yeah, yeah
[00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:55.640]   It's kind of signage because they're not used to having they weren't used to having customers in their stores before so when you walked in
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:57.640]   They were shocked to see someone in there
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:01.780]   But all the you know all the signage that was up in those stores remember that they had that giant
[00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:07.120]   That giant iPhone which I always wanted. Oh, I love that was running Windows. I loved that too
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:15.360]   Yeah, it was and you had all the signage in there inside the AT&T store, so I think you know I bet you could get those giant iPhones really cheap right now
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:19.280]   No, I bet that they were carved up before they returned
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:22.040]   That's a bummer because it would be really cool to have one of those in here
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.960]   But that's usually with with display stuff like that
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:28.520]   They don't just simply send them back. They said you have to destroy it and then send it back to us
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:32.660]   That's the pieces, but I do want to say that I mean the
[00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:37.840]   Handsets is really one of the areas in which Apple I wouldn't go so far as to call them vulnerable
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:40.160]   But which they don't really have total dominance yet
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:46.320]   I mean one of the metrics that not only is the if you're talking about the entire user installed user base of Android
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:51.840]   Granted that split across several different OS releases that are so different that they may as well be four different
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:53.440]   types of operating systems
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:55.600]   but when I just go out and about and
[00:59:55.600 --> 01:00:02.440]   My eyes always get glanced the glass strictly to like what kind of computer is this person using what kind of handset are they using?
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:07.720]   Do I recognize the app that they're using and there are plenty of rooms in which all I see are iPhones
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:11.280]   But there are also plenty of rooms of which I see more androids than anything else out there
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:15.800]   So if there is any place for a company like Microsoft to not
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:22.000]   If they're going to disabuse themselves of the notion that they could beat the iPhone at anything, but there's certainly enough
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:28.320]   Options out there that consumers want to pursue that if you do a good job and make it distinct from everything else
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:31.960]   And that is definitely what Windows phone is you could probably make some money off of this
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:35.920]   You're right and not even just Android yesterday was at the Phillies game and
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:42.920]   There were I've sold tons of phones. Yeah, people just popping out little that's Phillies fans. I think that's just
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:50.600]   I'm surprised at how many how many feature phones I'm seeing here you think that hey
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:55.960]   These are you know the kids out there with a bebop music and the long hair and their jazz records and their iPhones
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:58.280]   But people can't afford it. Let's face it
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.240]   I mean the reason you continue to use a feature phone is the you know
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:04.720]   It's a hundred dollars a month to use a smartphone or at least 50
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:09.960]   If you're a T-Mobile one third of all high school students according to a Piper
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:17.720]   Jaffrey have an iPhone one third and 40% of so surveyed students say they want or will purchase an iPhone in the next six
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:25.320]   Months, that's the largest number ever they've been doing this every year for 23 years 5600 US high school students
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:31.680]   34% at all time high have an iPhone double the percentage double the percentage a year ago
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:35.840]   So can we go can we go back for a second to buy a check though?
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:40.320]   And this actually ties into that because there were two other things there were two other reasons that buy a check dropped his
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:47.640]   His rating from buy to neutral. This is the analyst the analyst who says don't buy Apple stock
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:49.000]   Right
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.640]   Right the first one was that Verizon AT&T and Sprint which is kind of funny may may abandon the iPhone Sprint especially
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:58.480]   Spent they're in they spent a little bit of a near term right
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:02.360]   The second reason was that Apple may go ahead and drop the price of the iPhone
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:05.400]   Which would of course, you know lower the amount of money that they could make from it
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:10.840]   I guess that would be to battle the Verizon's and AT&T's in the world dropping dropping the phone
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:17.640]   But the third thing is his third reason was that Apple may not come out with a revolutionary product this year
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:20.200]   And he said in his notes
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:27.520]   He said he said in his note that the evolution of the mobile space and of the tablet space the evolution of what they've already got will continue
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:28.840]   but
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:34.000]   There they might not do anything revolutionary and that might make people worry and that might send Apple shares down
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.680]   And then you go to what you've got right there with the high school students
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:42.280]   What how what was it again a third of them a third and going to 40% if in the next six months if
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:44.520]   They're probably there
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:50.760]   They're probably there forever because then go back to every other analyst not forever because forever is a long long time as the song goes
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:55.480]   But I mean they're locked in now because they have Instagram and they have you know
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:59.240]   iTunes and they have iCloud if they've got more than one
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:03.480]   I mean the music they're buying through iTunes now can always be downloaded back to that phone
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.880]   It can't be downloaded to Lumiya 900
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:11.400]   I mean you can move it because they're unprotected drm free mp3s at this point
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:17.000]   But you know that's not the same as oh, I remember I deleted that song because I wanted to download this but now I hate that
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.400]   I want that song back boom
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:24.440]   Right it's the broader ecosystem and maybe he has a short memory too because remember right at christmas
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:31.560]   What was the number one most requested toy or whatever on uh teenagers wish lists was the ipad
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:35.640]   The number one across the board and I think it wasn't number two like the iphone
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:42.200]   Yeah, I mean there's no question. This is what kids want if they could afford it and it really comes down to what mom and dad are gonna
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:44.760]   pony up for
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:49.160]   I can only say I mean the fact that pie chick doesn't know
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:55.000]   That sprint has two-year contract a two-year contract to buy every iphone that they can make
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.440]   Uh just shows that this guy is like I don't know maybe he just wanted to be the other guy
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:04.920]   Everybody says bye and he's hoping that if apple tanks, which is like one chance in a hundred
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:09.080]   Then he's got his his career is made right? He's the only guy who said it
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:13.320]   I get to spend quite a bit of time at the fox business network and doing
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:17.880]   Quite a different in a bunch of different hits and discussion about technology over there
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:19.880]   And i'm always surprised by at least
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:24.200]   What's driving the day on wall street ends up being an analyst report
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:29.400]   Yeah, and I can't tell you it seems like over the past three four years the number of times that they've been wrong
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:32.680]   Uh, maybe it's been 90 percent of the time
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:38.760]   Uh, so it's remarkable to me to see these stock swings in this way and i'm not a financial guy
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:42.200]   But for people who are as clearly clueless
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:46.280]   I mean how many times has gene monster been wrong about the apple tv constantly
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:51.240]   Constantly, yeah, oh that's not really fair. He'll be wrong at the end of this year
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:55.240]   If he's gonna be wrong. I'm sorry. I'm not saying he's i'm not saying he's gonna be wrong
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:58.200]   But he's thinking there will be there will be an apple tv or not
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:03.560]   I don't I pass. I don't know. I hate the idea. I've said a million times
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:08.920]   I hate the idea, but either way monster has always said by the end of 2012 you want another analyst and fairness to him
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:11.000]   Here's another analyst
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.720]   Uh, this guy is with jeffries
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:21.240]   Uh, his name is peter my sec. He upped his price target for apple. He's saying by he says it'll get to 800
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:23.800]   Because of the i panel
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:25.960]   A tv set
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:29.480]   To launch later this year. That's so much more than a tv
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:32.200]   The i panel
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:37.880]   Uh, is a display. It's a gaming center. It's a media hub. It's a computer. It's a home automator
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:40.360]   Etc, it says my sec
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.920]   It's a floor lots
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:48.120]   Etc, they save your troubled marriage. He says it will cost an average selling price of
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:51.960]   1,250 bucks with 30 gross margins
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:57.320]   Ah wow and it may just save a troubled marriage. I'm not
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:00.760]   I'm gonna back you up on
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:07.320]   It's not just tv said it's been the source of some consternation in my house when my wife gives me the five-minute media
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:12.920]   Warning. Okay. She's almost ready. We're doing five-minute media warning. We get those two
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:18.760]   Get your movie get your movie that we're gonna watch ready and i'm like, uh, is it on Netflix?
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:23.240]   No, is it on iTunes is it on the apple tv? I can't remember where it is. You need a google tv
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:26.120]   So if you do home share if you had google tv
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:32.360]   Then you could search all of those and it would tell you where and then it would crash and you wouldn't have to you could go play cards
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.200]   It'd be great
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:38.520]   Then we could sit and talk and that may actually save it would save your marriage. Yeah, because it would just
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:42.600]   No, actually I like my google tv, but I know i'm the only one in the world
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:48.680]   We're gonna take a break when we come back. It's the end of innocence for apple users the flashback
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:50.840]   Trojan
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.880]   Now 600,000 strong and I haven't checked the numbers today
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.960]   um
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:07:01.000]   Apple did make a patch though. Yeah last week. We'll talk about that in a second before we do can I talk about hover.com?
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.560]   Hover is domain name
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.800]   registration
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.160]   And management
[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:12.920]   Made simple. It's just fantastic. I get tweets now all the time for people say you are right
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.560]   Thank you for telling me about hover.com
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:20.440]   One of the things they don't put in their ad copy. I'm just gonna tell you if you go to mac break
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.240]   Type this in mac break dot hover.com
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:29.880]   Uh, you'll see at the top of the page there. There's a phone number 8667316556
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:34.600]   If you call that number and say I want I'm listening to leo
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:40.520]   On twit and I want you at no charge to me to transfer all my demands to hover
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:47.080]   Uh, they they normally they charge $25 for this concierge service. Please don't do what I did. I said I said oh no
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:50.840]   I'm gonna save 25 bucks. I'll do this myself and I still have domains that are locked over at go daddy
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:53.240]   And I can't I can't they just
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:58.840]   Hover will do it for you. They charge 10 bucks for each domain registration transfer
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:01.800]   But that's another year includes another year on the domain name
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:10.280]   So you really you make it out like a bandit call them and get that transfer over you will thank me if you're about to register new domains go to hover.com
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:17.560]   Uh, let's see. I I I I need a new domain for um, what should what should my new domain name be?
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.240]   um
[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:20.920]   photo
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:22.440]   sharing
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:23.400]   app
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:28.120]   Dot com. I think I've got an idea for a new app never before seen
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:33.000]   And I'll search for that now I have a feeling that's gone, but we'll see
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.400]   Uh, whenever you got a domain name idea you want to go in there log in
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:42.600]   Yeah, somebody's got it. But look here's something interesting. There's some stars next to some of the suggestions
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:47.880]   It's a pretty these are premium domains that somebody said i'm willing to sell these and they set the price
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:53.240]   So, you know one of the problems I have when I go to buy a domain as they say, oh, uh, yeah, that'll be
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:55.800]   $1 billion
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:59.880]   This way the price has already said you know what you'll pay for it if you see a domain with a star on it
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:01.960]   It's a it's a domain that you can get
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:08.760]   Uh for a very photo software dot com that's available. That's not bad for 1649
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:13.400]   Uh photo a dot com photo po dot com
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:19.720]   So these are premium domains hover has this new thing and I love it the premium domain domain name
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:27.320]   Market they also have clunker trade-ins if you as I do often register names that I'm never going to use again
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:30.760]   You know something I thought it was a good idea at 3 a.m
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:36.680]   And you never use it they will refund everything you've spent at hover dot com to you they'll give it back to you

[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:59.640]   It's just very straightforward. I guess I can give up shut up and play dot tv now. I don't really I don't really need that anymore

[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:46.040]   Maybe I'll save it just in case you never know
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:49.880]   All right, let's move on the flash back
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:52.680]   Trojan
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:55.320]   Or virus it's so funny how many emails I get
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:11:01.720]   Because some people say oh, it's not a Trojan and then some people say oh you they were calling in a virus. That's a Trojan
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:04.040]   It was a Trojan
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.640]   Now it's a virus
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:07.640]   You could even say it's a worm
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:08.520]   Uh
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:14.120]   According to dr web.com which is a russian anti virus site 600,000
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:21.480]   Mac owners are infested 57 percent of them in the us another 20 or 30 percent in the Canada
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:29.640]   Uh, the way you got it last year was it was a Trojan you you get a you know, you click a link to download a fake flash updater
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:30.920]   uh
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:32.840]   most recently
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:36.040]   It has come in as through a hole in java
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.440]   Oracle which owns son which owns java patched that hole in february apple took a little longer
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:47.720]   Uh, you know if you think back you remember there was a lawsuit blah blah blah blah blah the apple son
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:50.360]   The apple java is not made by son. It's made by apple
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:56.200]   They didn't update that till wednesday. They have updated it if you haven't run your updates get your update
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:03.880]   Because that hole allows a malicious website just to get into your system. There is a flashback checker
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:10.920]   Um, I probably recommend this one from infinite loop jackie chang writing about it yesterday at uh, r is technica
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:13.800]   It's just an apple script. You can just run it and check
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:19.640]   Uh for your infection. There's a simple terminal command if you're comfortable terminal that might be safer
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:23.320]   I always make it nervous about downloading apps to check for malware because
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:26.200]   That's one way bad guys get on your system
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:29.800]   Is it the end of innocence and a nocco
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:37.400]   Uh more of a wake-up call. I mean more of an end of stupidity people who thought who might have thought that the reason why
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:44.600]   Uh, the reason why max don't have uh viruses or trojans or malware is because they've been blessed by god with absolute
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:47.080]   Impeneterability and invisibility to bad people
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:54.760]   You know that that was that was an illusion that this has finally been smashed because there just so many components that apple doesn't control
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:58.520]   So many components that apple might not have updated frequently enough. There's oh and
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:05.400]   Every time there's like a hacking contest where you know, there's the macbook that's been set up on a pedestal that if you can get
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:10.440]   If you can change a webpage on that device, uh, you win a thousand bucks that thousand bucks gets won in about 10 minutes
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:12.760]   And it's usually the first computer to get hacked actually
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:15.320]   Yeah, exactly
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:18.280]   Chiefly because of just what you're talking about a hop about how uh
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:23.480]   Microsoft has had a microsoft has actually had a bigger and more public problem with malware
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:27.240]   And so that means that they're really a lot more aggressive about about fighting it
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:30.600]   Uh, apple does care has always cared about that sort of stuff
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:33.880]   They cared about enough to make it a big part of their advertising campaigns few years ago
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:37.880]   But there it's like fireproofing a house that has never been on fire
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:41.720]   Right, they're not as paranoid about it as microsoft has been which is why for
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:44.440]   I would say since vista
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:50.120]   Windows has actually been on it on a just on a simple basis of the number of security holes that can be exploited
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:55.480]   Uh windows has been harder to exploit than then even the modern version of the mac OS
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:57.880]   So yeah, it's a wake-up call. Yeah
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:00.520]   And age of innocence is over if ever there was one
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:05.640]   Uh, do people what do you recommend do people run out and buy antiviruses?
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:13.240]   Not yet because I've yet to see an antivirus kit that really attacks the problem that uh, that that's being presented right now
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:20.280]   Uh antivirus case are best for i going after known threats that they could i could be identified and scan for and also looking for
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:22.040]   processes
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:27.960]   That are inherently dangerous and the only ones that are effective are the ones that are so paranoid about
[01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:33.320]   Processes that doesn't understand that you uninstall it in about a day because just there's just too much hassle
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:36.760]   I liked little snitch, but that's exactly what happened with little snitch. Yeah, exactly
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:40.280]   I couldn't bear it by the way if you had little snitch running on your system
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:44.840]   Flashback would say oops and would get out of there. They would delete itself
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:50.760]   Also, also appears mentioning that the next version the mac OS is going to have countermeasures exactly against this sort of thing
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:56.280]   uh, where if apple system code of of sign code really works
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:00.920]   uh, not only will be that much harder for uh, unrecognized code enter the system
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:06.280]   But also the system will have a way of recognizing that it's been tampered with and to block operations of errant code
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:08.120]   We'll have to find out how well this works
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:13.400]   There's a lot of i've been talking to a lot of developers about how apple is implementing this the sort of threats that it could solve
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:18.200]   The sort of threats that could do nothing to solve and the sort of innocent things that seem to be impossible now
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:21.320]   If you're following if you're following mountain lion's rules
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:25.720]   But for for now, I don't think that anybody has ever established the sort of credibility
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:31.640]   As an anti-virus maker to warrant going out and spending 50 bucks for any such a product. Yeah
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:40.360]   You guys feel uh cheated ripped off. I know you're both mac users mac OS can you've been you've been following the mac operating system since
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.360]   Especially day one um
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:47.240]   There was a long time of debate is the apple is our apples inherently more secure or just
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:53.400]   Is it that hackers haven't attacked them which does this now prove it that they are in fact just as insecure?
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:57.640]   Well, I mean we I mean and he says that this is a wake-up colonies, right?
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:02.200]   But we get this wake-up call it seems to me for the last five years not the first time right? Yeah, yeah
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:06.760]   I mean you say um our innocence is over. I think this story and I don't know why I remember this
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:13.000]   Line but the line that I used I want to say in 2006 or 2007 was our time in eden is over
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.520]   Because there were some malware that came along. Did you like the apple? I mean this is just
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:21.560]   It's it's part of it now and it's kind of a drag and it's still safer because they're still not as much
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:25.000]   But yeah, if people are just saying well max never get viruses
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.800]   I mean that's or never have never have to worry about malware or don't have to worry about security. That's
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:35.320]   Sadly, that's uh foolish and wrong. I actually but started to steer people. I used to steer them towards max
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:37.320]   I asked him towards ipads
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:43.320]   The people who really like just not sophisticated they just want email and they don't want to worry about security
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:49.560]   An ipad secure, right? We had an issue recently with a family member who's a 71
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:53.000]   And uh over the past year he has 12
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.720]   I broke in his magbook
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:58.440]   And and just through something that he shouldn't have been doing with it
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:03.640]   And and I in my head started having the discussion with him about you know what you really might want
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:08.040]   Because I think that's more than enough for him. I honestly do believe that would be for most people
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:11.400]   And luckily it's been it's been salvageable his magbook has been
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:17.720]   Fixable both times, but I mean at some point is it now? What did he do? I mean did he try is it malware?
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:20.440]   Did he I don't I don't want to tell you no no no
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:25.480]   Okay, he cleaned it with water. Okay there
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:33.800]   You know that would break an ipad too. In fact, I know very well. It's not good for an iPhone either
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:36.280]   Right, so yeah
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:40.760]   But I mean, you know at least you can you can take a uh you can take a tissue or something
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:47.800]   I mean, you know and and what the screen of an ipad and accomplish about the same thing that you would hopefully not want to accomplish putting water on a keyboard
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:50.440]   Have an eye have a macbook
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:55.800]   You guys think about any sort of antivirus software on the mac. I mean, I know Andy just
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:59.640]   answered it in part, but I you know, I'm always struck by my
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:02.280]   when I go home to visit my parents and
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:08.280]   The the computer guy that my dad insists on using that he's used for like 20 years
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:12.600]   Um pops over to the house and immediately installs all of these
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:17.960]   I buy software programs on this computer and my dad wants to know when I show up why it's now so slow
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:20.840]   Right and all he does all he does is get on to check email
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:25.800]   That's the only thing my dad. He's a realtor. He gets on he goes into email and he launches his MLS program
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:29.640]   That's all he needs. He's not downloading all sorts of ridiculous attachments
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:33.400]   And I warn him about doing anything like that. He's like I never do that. I never do that
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:36.040]   So why do you need you know, why do you need this stuff?
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:38.680]   And it slows his computer down so much that I uninstall it
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:41.800]   And I know I'm curious what Steve Gibson would say about that
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:44.360]   But is that a bad Steve does not use an antivirus
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:47.240]   Uh, a lot of people I know I don't use an antivirus on any computer
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:54.600]   He does because if you know what you're doing you don't need an antivirus the problem is the people who need an antivirus are people
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:58.200]   like can like your family member or others who just
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:00.040]   um
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:04.200]   Don't know what to do. You know, they they they see for instance this flashback Trojan worked because
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:09.880]   Oh, you need to update your flash, but it didn't look like adobe. You go to what say it's not a dobe site
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:15.960]   And you know, we would go yeah, right. I'm not downloading that. It's the inexperienced novice user
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.440]   And I suppose those are the ones who need uh some help
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:23.720]   But there's something like mackeper with you know, it's something like that even work in that situation or would you would you be
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:26.440]   I have to I have some recommendations
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:30.360]   In fact that I will make his mic tip of the week. How about that?
[01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:34.600]   Um, let's move along. I want to get a couple more stories in here before we get our picks
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:37.080]   of the week
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:42.680]   Walter isakson responds you remember that larry page in interview last week in
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:49.560]   In business week said oh, I think that was theater. I don't think steve jobs really wants to kill androids
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:53.160]   uh, waltter isakson in an interview this week
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:56.600]   said that
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:58.840]   probably
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:02.280]   He discussed the petulance and exuberance of jobs
[01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:07.480]   And he said you know, tim cook's gonna settle with google. He said this isn't gonna go on much longer
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:11.320]   Uh steve gets upset steve was furious when he saw microsoft
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:16.360]   This is a quote stealing the mackeOS interface and licensing it to every pc maker who paid for it
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:22.760]   So when google licensed to sandra and mobile operating system so promiscuously to junky handset makers
[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:26.360]   He was determined to act steve said to goo you can't pay me off
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:32.040]   I'm here to destroy you, but tim cook will settle that lawsuit. He's a lot less emotional about business than steve
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:34.280]   Why are you laughing nandy?
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:37.720]   We may never know
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:39.400]   bummer
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:44.600]   The comments the comments were you saying about how this was all for show really he was just trying to get his troops
[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:47.720]   Excited about uh, but what was about what they were working on
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:50.920]   Oops. Sorry
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:58.120]   Which is like does this sound at all like the way that that steve jobs does business not really quite so much
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:05.160]   But but yeah, it does make sense that really realized the very first thing that uh steve jobs did when he arrived in
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:09.160]   Uh back in the ceos chair was start settle lawsuits that he felt were
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:11.800]   Mostly that were just what that were
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:16.040]   Unproductive for what apple needed to do that they're costing weight money
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:22.040]   They're causing to focus on exactly the wrong things at some point you got to realize that you can't the ability to undo
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.520]   Uh google releasing android as a knockoff of the iphone that opportunity
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:34.280]   Laps about four years ago when steve jobs had the tracer missiles aimed at the proper offices inside google and decided
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:39.400]   To be talked out of actually pushing the commit button. So now you just simply have to live in the world that you live in
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:40.440]   Right
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:42.440]   Uh some other things that isakson said
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:48.840]   Uh despite the loss of jobs apple will still create more great products. It has quote the world's greatest industrial designer
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:50.840]   johnnie ive
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:55.400]   Uh, he said jobs was quote the most intense emotionally charged person you could ever meet
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:22:02.200]   When asked well did steve suffer as it's sometimes presumed that others in the tech industry do from asperger's syndrome
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:09.400]   He said steve wasn't kind he was brutally honest, but he was intensely emotional and cried many times when we talked
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:15.880]   He was at the opposite end of the scaled asperger's his prob products prove he could emotionally connect to people
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:22.280]   Unseen and that he would in a hundred years rank alongside the great inventors henry ford tomah citizen
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:24.760]   I think that there's no doubt about that
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:27.400]   um
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:32.120]   Let's see here a couple more stories before we make our break
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:35.400]   um
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:41.560]   Let's quickly talk about the iphone five would kind of mention that we're starting to see rumors now
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:43.640]   october launch
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:44.920]   You guys
[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:47.960]   Yes, yes, yes, we're all in agreement
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:51.720]   Yeah, I mean, you know, I think
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:57.160]   Well, who knows right there as apples said who knows they don't like to be predictable some guy in fox con says
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:59.320]   right
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:05.240]   The head of human resources at fox con says we got to hire a bunch of people now because we're going to be
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:07.640]   Put out that new iphone in october
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:13.960]   And presumably if that's true, that's the same guy who just read like last week met with tim cook and and gave him the hairnet when they
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:16.040]   WOLFT around
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:18.200]   This looks so good on you
[01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:21.880]   Really everybody wears them here
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:28.440]   But yeah, again interesting to me more than the stuff we probably already know which is uh, you know, one gigabyte of ram
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:31.400]   It'll have the next generation chipset in there. Uh, unibody
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:34.280]   Yeah, is it gonna have that unibody?
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:37.080]   Construction much like the iphone one we were joking about
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:40.040]   but will it have and how is it going to
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:46.440]   How is it going to handle this a larger? You know a larger next generation wireless chip in there?
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:50.920]   That's that's more interesting to me. I was just talking to the friend yesterday about this very issue because
[01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:59.960]   To to our knowledge, we couldn't think of another 3.5 inch phone in that same form factor that has an lte chipset in it
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:02.600]   Maybe there is one out there
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:09.000]   That's interesting so you're actually you're actually saying that the lte could drive the four inch phone that everybody keeps saying for
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:15.880]   Years and years that apple is gonna eventually come out with the question is is there is there no 3.5 inch lte phone because
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:21.880]   You can't fit it in or because no one wants a 3.5 inch phone anymore. Uh, that's still not true
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:25.800]   Well, there's people buying iphones obviously which is 3.5 inches
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:30.680]   But I do think that the world is moving towards larger screens. Of course. I'm the guy who's using a galaxy note, so
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:33.560]   This is the case of the yeah, I love it
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:36.120]   I think this is the case of the marketplace
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:41.720]   Making a very very strong vote if there were if people actually prefer to 3.5 inch size phone to 4 inch
[01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:44.680]   You see a lot more viable 3.5 inch handsets out there
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:51.640]   I don't think it's just I do think that cramming a larger battery in an lte chipset is also a factor in the drive towards larger phones
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:55.640]   But if if people really really demanded a smaller form factor
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:58.200]   It would be a lot much larger presence out there and I agree with you Clayton
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:01.160]   I was trying to figure that out myself about a month ago that how
[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:05.880]   Going through going through every single product listing trying to find how many smaller handsets I could find
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:08.840]   And the only ones that I could find were the ones that were
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:13.880]   Deliberately designed not to compete directly with the expensive high contract phones
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:15.880]   So, I mean apples
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:22.600]   It's it's puzzling because apple is starting to run out of things they can add to an iPhone to make it to make it look fresh each and every year
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:25.400]   Uh, and everybody's going to start really expecting lte
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:28.040]   on these handsets and if
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:30.200]   I don't know how
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:32.200]   I don't know how apple feels about it
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:37.160]   But whether they would rather preserve what they feel to be the perfect size and the perfect form factor
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:41.320]   Uh for the for the for the iPhone and simply wait for the chips to become
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:46.600]   Uh less power hungry and and smaller to make it happen or if they're willing to say well
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:49.000]   This was a good idea for the first generation
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:55.480]   Of of uh phone screen, but you know what the reasons why we decided to stick with 3.5 are no longer really operative
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:59.560]   The fact that other companies are having so much success with a four inch phone means that people want it
[01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:02.920]   If we can make it work will make it work. I don't know how what apple feels about it right now
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:07.720]   I think it'll come down to whether they feel as though a four inch phone could really be beautiful and elegant
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:10.280]   I do think that's going to be an important factor for them to consider
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:17.560]   And even more more important than the hardware because I think we always maybe not we but I think we sometimes forget the idea that
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:19.400]   What really drives
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:23.720]   The innovation right now on the iPhone or the most appealing factor about it is ios
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:26.520]   Um and ios 6 and what that will look like
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:29.560]   Um as will it be revolutionary will it be
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:33.240]   Not scrapped and rebuilt from the ground up, but it's going to have you know
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:39.080]   All by all accounts a lot of new things in it and it's may have a totally different look
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:43.080]   Um and that may be that may be the first really interesting
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:49.880]   Challenge in this space for apple in that way to see how how different i'm reminded of a police story
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:55.240]   Everyone expected i love the police everyone expected when they were working on their next album
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:57.640]   All of these both those police
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:01.880]   Police department. Oh, oh sting in the police. Okay. Go ahead
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:05.320]   They were
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:07.320]   Every all these other copycat bands
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:14.520]   Popping up and they were sort of mimicking that the police sound and everyone sort of expected their next album to have that same sort of sound
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:16.920]   Here's the police again, and then they came out with synchronicity
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:21.960]   And it sounded nothing like what they were uh had done before and it sort of blew everyone away
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:26.520]   And so you wonder what apple has in the pipeline for ios 6 that's to me perhaps more
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:32.280]   You know more curious than than what what piece of ryan is in this thing
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:35.400]   I do agree though with the with that analyst pichik who says well
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:38.360]   You kind of run to run out of things you can do that are so
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:42.040]   Revolutionary you've got to start going evolution and we've seen that on the desktop
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:49.160]   Uh, although now we're going i don't know speech interfaces and tablet interfaces. Maybe maybe that maybe it isn't maybe it isn't out of steam
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:53.320]   Maybe there is more you could do with ios 6 what I would say more speech would be good, right?
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:28:00.280]   Yeah, I use it all the time. I mean I use I I dictate emails on a regular basis one of those journaling apps
[01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:05.560]   I was a terrible journal journaler before I hated the thought of sitting down for an hour and writing
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:09.400]   Something like that when I you know just it would paint me so now instead
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:14.760]   I I walk around I'm able to do some yard work and dictate my my day into a day one journal that I love and
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:19.240]   So I use it all the time for writing emails and but deeper integration there
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:26.760]   Especially with third-party apps being able to use it in a more convenient way. I think you're going to see a lot of that and and maps
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:31.240]   You know, obviously some of the interesting things that are happening in the mapping world right now
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:34.520]   Internal inside buildings
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:37.960]   You know where you can be inside of a mall that sort of stuff
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:43.560]   Shopping so I don't know it'll be curious. I think you're right though. How much what more do we need?
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:47.720]   I can't it's not like I'm sitting there. I wake up in the morning like god. I wish I had
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:50.920]   This I think speech is it. I really do in fact
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:53.080]   I've been using the speech so much on the iPad
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:57.880]   And the iPhone to answer email that actually it's starting to feel onerous to sit down at my
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:00.600]   Mac and type
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:02.520]   That's not good
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:06.440]   But I but this is really interesting. I'm noticing that I'm getting used to speech so much
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:09.400]   The typing is starting to feel like a chore
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:12.120]   And if we do get to that point if others get to that point
[01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:16.440]   There may be that that completely replaces the keyboard that would be a major shift
[01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:19.800]   Although it also be a
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:23.400]   Go ahead start start can and then and then we'll give you
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:28.600]   I'm I'm I'm I'm still stuck back on the three and a half to four inch screen
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:31.560]   I mean
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:34.920]   There's got to be a better reason than because everybody's doing it
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:38.840]   I mean where it's all customers. It's not because you don't want to look like you're old
[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:45.000]   And three and a half inches looks old. It's not it's not strictly. I'm sorry. Go ahead. I'll I'll come by later
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:51.640]   Forgive me if it's still the number one cell and smartphone on all of the at least are in the states on all of the carriers where they sell it
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:55.320]   Well, that's why you make changes because because
[01:29:55.320 --> 01:30:00.440]   If you wait until the sales start dropping off you've got a problem
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:04.760]   Right, you got a kind of look a little bit ahead Ken. You can't just say hey
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:07.240]   This is selling great
[01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:11.080]   Start changing because that could hurt you in the in the short run in the long run
[01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:16.600]   Well, but I mean has there been one I mean I'm not saying you wait for sales to fall off but has there been one yet
[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:23.160]   Where sales have one three and a half inch phone? No one makes them anymore. No one I know an iPhone
[01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:26.040]   Well, I think to the to the to the to the to flip to Andy's point
[01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:31.400]   Nobody makes a three and a half inch phone because no one wants it the iPhone maybe surviving based on iOS
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:34.120]   But I think you've got you got to really address that issue
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:41.000]   So that in terms of in terms of usability though are the companies that are coming out with foreign phones or greater doing that
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.320]   For the most part and I'm not speaking for all the amount
[01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:46.600]   I want I'm not speaking for any of them or for the most part are they doing that because
[01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:51.480]   They've really found a way to use that extra half inch across. Yeah, the keyboard works better
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:54.360]   Okay, period. All right
[01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:59.800]   Andy your thoughts. It wasn't initially just about differentiation. No, it's about functionality
[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:01.400]   Okay
[01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:05.880]   It's not it's not about putting out a foreign screen because that's what everyone else is doing
[01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:10.680]   It's more of recognizing that the fact that these phones are popular means that that's sort of a vote that
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:14.840]   The marketplace is making that they actually kind of like four inch phones
[01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:18.600]   Uh, which is also not in itself a reason for apple to switch
[01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:23.480]   But it's a reason for them to look at the decisions that they made about why did we make the phone exactly this size
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:28.760]   And then three years later four years later probably actually probably closer to five years later after they made that
[01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:31.880]   Sorry four years later after they made that decision now they have to ask themselves
[01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:34.840]   Do we still feel that strongly that three and a half inches is?
[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:39.400]   Integrally important to the design of this phone and if they decide that well actually no
[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:43.640]   I think that the reason why we've been using a three and a half inch for the past two years is because that's the size
[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:46.600]   It's always been that gives them the option now of saying well
[01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:49.000]   What would we do with a four inch phone? How could we make this better?
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:54.200]   And as long as they could do that without them feeling as though they're compromising the simplicity and the elegance of the iPhone
[01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:56.520]   That suddenly becomes on the table
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:02.680]   Does that come does that in your opinion then come down to whose idea it was in the first place? I mean if if it was
[01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:06.200]   Again not to polanize it's under whatever you want to call it
[01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:12.360]   But if Steve Jobs was the one who really lobbied for the 3.5 mention of Steve Jobs were still alive then obviously we're not even talking about
[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:20.360]   Well, no understand but my question is does it come down to you know who was most strongly behind it at this point or is it?
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:24.360]   I mean do we see it as a foregone conclusion then that it is going to have a bigger screen
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:30.360]   No, I don't think it's a foreground conclusion, but I think that the the the scales might be moving towards the
[01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:39.160]   If there are advantages that apple can see to doing a four inch screen then now they're probably more receptive to doing that because it's been three years now
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:44.760]   Sometimes your philosophy changes after three years three years ago every single screen was three and a half inch
[01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:49.000]   They didn't have all this data coming in about four inch screens to go by
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:54.840]   I mean if if when Samsung released the galaxy tab as a seven inch tablet and they started selling
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:01.320]   Gangbuster quantities of these tablets apple wouldn't simply apple wouldn't have concluded that they made the wrong choice in attendance
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:02.280]   But they would have said okay
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:08.440]   We now have evidence that there are 10 million people who want a seven inch tablet despite the fact that's running this crummy scaled up phone
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:13.000]   Operating system and they would certainly learn from that and also let's let's also never forget that
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:20.440]   Sometimes Steve's opinions from from reports that we've been reading isn't just simply he made a decision and that was it
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:25.000]   Sometimes other people would say well no Steve you're wrong. Here's the here's the evidence of why it should go that way
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.120]   And then two meetings later Steve is saying well we've made a great decision
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:32.120]   I was wrong. We're going with a four inch phone or we're going with this layout for the for this app
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:39.000]   There's so many so many stories like that that it's hard to say that because uh Steve chose the three and a half inch form factor three years ago
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:42.040]   That that would be a factor in continuing that size carrying on
[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:47.160]   There's a good article on the verge in the apple core about a four inch
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:52.840]   iPhone 5 we've we've talked before about well all you do is you keep the same 960 by 640
[01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:58.600]   Resolution you just blow it up to a bigger size, but that causes some issues
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:05.240]   Certainly is no longer a retinist play unless and this is what the author and the verge is suggesting you change the aspect ratio
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:08.600]   from three two to nine five
[01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:11.480]   You make it somewhat taller
[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:13.560]   I don't know if this is a good idea or not
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:18.360]   I think that one of the reasons people want bigger phones is so that they can look at HD video
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:22.360]   Uh, and that's going to be a problem if apple wants to keep the same screen resolution
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:27.880]   It's an interesting and also also the main the main argument that comes up for maintaining the three and a half in the screen is that
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:33.000]   Your the average thumb can span the entire screen once why and you do lose that on these bigger screens
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:33.960]   I admit
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:37.720]   Right and so if they decided to go with that keep the same width and stretch it up a little bit
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:41.320]   Now you have a whole top row stuff that you can't access with a thumb if you're going to do that
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:44.440]   Why not make it a little bit bigger and maintain the same aspect ratio
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:48.440]   Not even care about having a new class of apps that uses this different size screen
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:52.440]   That would be that that's the that's of course the issue apple doesn't want to fragment
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:57.960]   Uh that leon i'm supposed to be talking about interstellar space two floors below me in about five minutes
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:00.360]   And he give us your pick of the week. How about that?
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:04.040]   My pick of the week is a really cool app that I found a week ago
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:10.680]   Us old timers, uh who were around with the mac with beginning have a certain astalgia connection to bill act
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:15.160]   Consons dithering algorithm for turning a photo into a one bit like black and white love this app
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:17.000]   and
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.440]   And so
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:20.600]   I will never be able to john balastari
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:24.920]   At tin rocket dot com wrote an app called hyper dither that
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:30.600]   Uses the actual identical algorithm that bill act kensen use he got the actual algorithm from bill
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:35.880]   And will convert any photo that you have into one bit ditherd as though it's a hyper card graphic
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:41.160]   And some people might be saying well who cares i've got like graphics converters that can dither into one bit
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:44.760]   There's something about the way the actin's an algorithm
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:50.360]   Processes it that mint makes it so interesting it boosts stuff the contrast a little bit
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:56.600]   It gets the details a little bit crisper. There's there's little there's not as much random noise that appears there as before
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:36:03.720]   But I will also say that in addition to the aesthetic appeal of it. You're just put right back into the mid eighties
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:10.520]   It's really fun. You scanned in something with thunder scan and you're seeing a picture of of your dog that on your computer
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:13.640]   Which you've never seen before with that really cool dithering pattern
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:19.160]   There stupid nostalgia is valuable to some people and fortunately on one of those people. That's a free app too
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:23.640]   I think i'm going to redo my entire blog and do everything in hyper dither one bit
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:29.320]   Thank you Andy Naco. He's at the chicago sun times if you are in colorado immediately go to his lecture
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:37.000]   We thank you for being here cwob.com if you go to colorado.edu/cwa you'll get the full schedule all the events
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.160]   Everything's open to the public and there's a lot of cool things going on
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:42.520]   They don't do they don't stream the talks do they okay? I don't believe they do
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:49.080]   Too bad next year. We gotta be there next year next year. I'll you know, I think that you're an invite you're you'd be a high class ticket
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:50.680]   I'd love to go
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:52.680]   All right. Hey, thank you Andy cheers. Take care
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:55.800]   Clayton you want to do a pick
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:56.920]   Sure
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:59.480]   Yeah, I actually I've been playing with this
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:02.760]   Well, I have to see if I have it up here
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:05.080]   Yeah, I do
[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:08.200]   So it's a little bit of an ecosystem. I know you're you're a health nut
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:11.720]   And you can see how well it's worked for me
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:18.360]   Well for me too, I mean had all these different apps for a while had different technology that helps you you know lose weight and everything
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:18.840]   I said, you know
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:20.840]   But when it when it all works together
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:25.800]   And it works in one little ecosystem and if you're an iPhone user you're gonna love this
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:30.760]   So I've been using the brand new fitbit ultra which is the new one that came out
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:33.960]   About a month ago or so and I just did a review on it
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:40.040]   And what's great a bit about it is is that you of course you can download the fitbit app on your iPhone or your iPad
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:45.240]   Here it is. Here's this little thing. It's like it's a it's a pedometer that goes on your belt or around your neck
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:48.280]   But also measures now altitude as well as steps
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:52.840]   Right. So the new one. Yes, you go up down steps and what's great is you get little email updates and say hey
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:55.800]   You've climbed the amount of stairs equivalent to a helicopter
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:38:03.800]   In the sky, which is cool, but beyond just that. Yeah, you've got the the pedometer and I think of all the different health apps or the different health
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:10.520]   Pieces of equipment out there like the fuel and the moto active and those different things. I think this is the best
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:18.520]   Um, and I think if you even if you look over at like gdgt.com now or gadget.com. I think it ranks as the one of the highest there too
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:21.160]   So in my experience, it's just been durable and works really well
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:25.640]   But here's where I get excited about it and what's been working for me and over the past two and a half weeks
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:27.640]   I've lost eight pounds now. Wow
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:34.760]   Is tying it together with the the great app lose it. Yeah, love losing, you know a long time iOS app
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:37.240]   But now they've got fitbit integration
[01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:42.360]   Inside of it. So that's neat when you walk near your fitbit base station
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:44.920]   It sinks of course. You don't need to actually put it on there
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:48.520]   And by the way, I actually took it to florida with me and for five six days
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:52.200]   I didn't need to recharge it and it still catalogued all that information when I came back
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:58.280]   I synced it and it integrates with lose it. So let's say you've tabulated up your number of calories for the day
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:00.200]   And I'll see you're able to see this or not
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:01.720]   So I stay
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:05.080]   You're able to put all your different calories up there for the day and then at the bottom, you know
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:07.080]   It'll it'll it'll say fitbit integration
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:13.880]   And it'll give you like your exercise variant and it'll subtract the number of calories because you've been wearing your fitbit throughout the day
[01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:18.840]   Um, I've been waiting for this kind of integration because we all have all of these
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:23.320]   I've got a, you know, you know, the why things scale and the why things blood pressure monitor and
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:27.880]   A fitbit and an up and it'd be great if these all work together to somehow get a profile
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:33.640]   Right. Well, well, that brings me to my third portion of this, which is the why thing scale is also integrated with lose it
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:35.800]   So I have to get lose it now. That's great
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:37.400]   Yeah, so every morning when I wake up
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:41.080]   I you do it at the same time jump on your why things scale works over wifi
[01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:45.160]   And it syncs with lose it so you can see where you are how much weight you've been losing
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:49.240]   And when you see those sorts of little indicators, you actually really start to try to lose weight
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:51.880]   You know that you were you're trying to hit this calorie count every day
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:53.880]   So you put in what you've eaten for breakfast
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:55.560]   Then you you're wearing your fitbit
[01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:59.320]   You try to get to your 10,000 steps every day or whatever your goal is and you know
[01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:04.520]   And just like I said seven eight pounds in the past two and a half weeks and uh, you know, I'm like
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:09.320]   Other 10 pounds off my goal. That's awesome. Good for you. All thanks to technology. Yeah
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:12.120]   It's nice to have that reinforcement. That's awesome
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:17.240]   So, uh, lose it is free, which is nice. It's on the app store available for the iPhone
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:21.640]   And uh, the fitbits99 bucks from fitbit.com
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:26.680]   And the why things scale is like, I don't know 160 bucks or something, but it's fun to have also
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:31.560]   It's fantastic because it gives you BMI and uh, what else does it give you BMI and your body fat
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:33.160]   And your fat and your fat also
[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:35.160]   But when you step on that you see that
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:37.800]   But when I mentioned lose it on the air one day, I got
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:43.000]   Hundreds of emails from people that what does that app? What does that app? I want to lose weight? I oh, I need something like that
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.480]   And the it's basically a calorie counter, but now that it integrates those in that's really makes it even more
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:51.480]   And it has a barcode scanner. Have you tried that feature? Yeah, isn't that nice and it's free
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:56.520]   It's free. So check it out. It's been my favorite, uh, calorie counter for years actually
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:41:02.360]   Um, I'm glad to see that they're updating it because they I don't know how they make money on it, but uh, that's really cool
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:05.160]   Thank you. They have a partnership with Doritos
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:12.840]   It's been now a taco bell to the do fit bit lose it Dorito taco
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:18.040]   Uh, do you want to get oh as can as long as you're here? Mac OS can why don't you give us a pick?
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:20.040]   You must have something you like a lot
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:23.240]   I'm in love with paper. Paper is awesome
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:27.320]   This has been mentioned on the show before not on this show and I pad today. I think we mentioned
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:30.280]   Alex. Oh, that's right. Did he really?
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:34.520]   Go ahead. Tell us how much you love paper. It's okay. I love paper
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:41.800]   That much this this is not paper like in like the like, uh, scranton, Pennsylvania the office
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:48.920]   Thunder mifflin paper not thunder mifflin not paper for a paperless world. This is in fact paper for a paperless world. It's awesome
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:54.840]   I have a thing that I drew that you can't see let's see show show it show us
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:57.400]   Aww look at that. Yeah
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:01.880]   That's good. I like about it though. And then uh, I lean was just going I guess it was I lean going through the
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:08.600]   Uh, the description of the application. It's very simple. Yeah, I have a page for my iPad. Mm-hmm. Um,
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:12.120]   an art rage lets you do a whole lot and
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:19.800]   Honestly for me because all I've ever done for the most part is doodle right art rage is is a little bit too much
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:25.800]   It gets very easy for me to sort of um screw up the stuff that i'm doing in art rage because there are so many different
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:28.760]   Uh, you know levels and and and different tools
[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:31.480]   So if you're like if you're a total if you're a total pro
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:37.000]   You then this might not be the thing for you except for what you were talking about earlier where you're saying
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:42.600]   Photographers professional for the first use instagram. This is kind of like that. The the line quality
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:49.080]   Is just so incredible and and it's so responsive. It's it's kind of like what you guys were talking about earlier too about
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:54.920]   About path. I mean the best thing about path is path. I mean, it's it's the
[01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:57.400]   user interface. It's the simplicity, right?
[01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:01.240]   And and and it's sort of the same thing with uh, it's sort of the same thing with paper
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:05.080]   I like the um better artist when you're playing with it too
[01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:08.840]   That's what I need
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:13.080]   No, it's absolutely true. It's and and that really I think does have to do with the line quality
[01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:15.480]   It's a free app. It comes with one drawing
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:18.120]   Um one drawing tool the pen
[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:25.160]   And and the line quality and the pen the second I saw that I knew I was going to spend the full eight bucks for all of the other tools
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:30.280]   Um, it's gotten some bad reviews and itunes because they charge
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:33.320]   And the $99. I mean, sorry, excuse me
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:35.480]   99 cent out world
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:41.000]   They charge too much for the tools and some people's opinion, but I mean 799 gets you all
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.480]   Five, I think of the drawing tools. So there's like a
[01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:49.160]   Now there's a pencil and there's a there's a watercolor brush and I can't remember what the rest are
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:51.080]   There's sort of like an outliner
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:56.120]   Um, it's just really it's a fun and likely inside it makes you feel like you're a better artist
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:01.160]   I just bought the 799 tool tool kit so I'd have all the pens
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:03.320]   So think of it as an eight buck app really
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:05.240]   Pretty much pretty much although
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:06.840]   I mean there is enough function
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:09.320]   I mean if you just want to do the one you want to do for free
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:12.920]   Like if I were giving this to if I were giving some kid my iPad to play with
[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:14.760]   I'd have no problem downloading that
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:18.760]   You know the pen app and letting them do that for free because I mean it really does that's true
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:22.040]   It's just so much more responsive and just and just it's neat
[01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:27.160]   Um, it's the first art app that I've been tempted by in quite a while
[01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:28.920]   And it's even a lot of it
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:29.960]   It's too
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:30.760]   Do you use it?
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:34.120]   You know like I've started using I was designing these raised beds in my backyard and I'm like
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:36.120]   I want an app that I can
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:38.920]   Lay it out, you know like almost like an autocad program in a way
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:44.440]   You know I wanted something where I could draw it out and kind of figure map it out and figure where I wanted to put the garden
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:47.560]   And this and that and I was like, oh, there's nothing really good in the app store
[01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:51.160]   There's nothing like that and now with these little sketchbooks within paper
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:55.640]   Sort of enables you to have doodles or maybe I want to do different home designs or things
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:59.160]   So it's not just a random page of paper that you're drawing on
[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:04.040]   You can keep little sketchbooks at different things you're working on around your house and other things like that too
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:07.960]   Search for it on your ipad as paper by
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:13.080]   53 spelling out the words because it's hard to find otherwise such a generic name
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:17.640]   But absolutely I agree with you to get the free one and if you like it then you can pay for some pens
[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:22.520]   You know each pen is a buck 99 or all four of them are 799
[01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:29.080]   Thank you so much macos can for being here can does a regular podcast every day of the week
[01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:38.760]   Just search for mac os can on uh on iTunes or anywhere go to macos can calm and you can get his daily news show all about the mac
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:47.480]   Did you when you did this so what did the hair go from the top of your head to i don't i'm confused
[01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:50.360]   I really need to update my
[01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:56.520]   Every every couple of months I talk to a little guy because he's actually he's very busy
[01:45:56.520 --> 01:46:00.040]   He's he works on uh, he's he's got an app for which you know
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:04.680]   He is full time employed and good for him and we get together every couple of months and say yeah
[01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:09.640]   We really need cannot doing something about my site. Just just a new picture. That's all. That's all we ask
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:14.360]   That's all yeah, but you can't just do a new picture though because then suddenly it's a whole redesign
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:19.080]   Seriously, we've tried we've tried just doing the new picture in the past and then he'll say well
[01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:21.160]   You know it would be really great and i'm like well if you're gonna do that
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:23.320]   No
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:27.720]   And then three beers later you're like yeah, we should really probably get to the website at some point
[01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:29.560]   Yeah
