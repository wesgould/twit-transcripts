[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.600]   you recover Apple in all its glory.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.440]   Leo is out today.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.200]   My name is Mike Elgin.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.120]   I'm the news director here at Twit.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.520]   And with us is the incomparable Andy and not
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.880]   go Chicago Sun Times technology comms.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.200]   How you doing, Andy?
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.000]   I'm doing pretty good.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.200]   People do compare me to other things, usually not
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.960]   in a positive way.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.160]   So thank you for brushing that over.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.440]   If I'm incomparable, that's nothing.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.520]   That can be nothing but an upgrade.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.920]   I don't like being compared to things because--
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.560]   Well, I will try to not do that.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.720]   And in fact, I would have never done it.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.240]   I would never do that.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.160]   I really enjoy your work.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.960]   I really enjoy all your appearances on this show.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.920]   And also, I'm going to make a pitch right now.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.360]   I'd love to get you on Tech News today much more often.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.320]   I think this year you've only been on the show once,
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.040]   twice, three times.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.840]   But I'd really love to get you on that show more.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.680]   I'd like-- I'd love it every time I've done it.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.920]   I'm just here darning socks by the fire,
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.160]   waiting for that phone to call Mike.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.640]   All right.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.240]   We're going to send you a special red phone that
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.440]   lights up when I call.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.520]   So that'll be a lot of fun.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.520]   With us also--
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.400]   Because I usually am dressed as Batman.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.240]   Oh, really?
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.040]   That's perfect.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.200]   Now I'll have a reason to do that.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.520]   Absolutely perfect.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.400]   Goes with the cave.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.280]   And with us today is Serenity Caldwell,
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.000]   panelist on the incomparable podcast.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.320]   And also, I'm more managing editor, right?
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.320]   Yes, that is correct.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.760]   I'm happy to be here filling in for Renee and other
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.000]   Earthwhile podcasters.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.520]   That's fun.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.840]   Please don't mind the slightly strange appearance behind me.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.360]   I am podcasting from a basement.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.720]   But it does have extraordinarily good Wi-Fi.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.160]   So--
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.200]   It doesn't look like a basement.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.760]   It looks like an attic.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.160]   What are you going to do?
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.880]   So correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.720]   The job title of managing editor is the best job
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.080]   in all of editorial dumb.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.120]   Am I right or am I wrong?
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.640]   Oh, great.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.320]   We're having Skype issues.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.000]   I'm pretty sure just mentioning anything about Wi-Fi
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.160]   is enough to set it off.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.080]   I'm sorry, Serenity.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.120]   We didn't hear that.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.640]   Skype sort of collapsed on us a little bit.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.640]   No, it's like here.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.160]   Let me do a quick reconnect.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.660]   OK.
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.640]   Pretty much.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.000]   I quite like my new title.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.400]   OK, yeah, we're getting serious.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.480]   That was a great freeze frame.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.480]   Yay.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.160]   All right, let me work on this.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.680]   It's like an Agatha Christie story
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.640]   where first there were four panelists.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.800]   Now Renee's gone, and now Allison's gone, and Leo's gone.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.240]   Down to just--
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.560]   I must be the murderer then because I've lured people
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.280]   to the Swiss chalet.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.280]   I say, yes, we need some substitutes for the podcast.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.880]   Don't question yourself about whatever happened to Leo
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.480]   and to Renee.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.040]   It was perfectly normal things that happened.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.120]   Oh, listen to you with your fanciful things
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.080]   about how nobody just simply gets
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.640]   impaled upon a brass candlestick when they're skiing outside.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.160]   That's a painful image.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.040]   Thank you so much for that, Andy.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.040]   So do we have-- do we have the last Serenity?
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.960]   I love this check.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.880]   Is this working again?
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.640]   Oh, fantastic.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.160]   Look at that.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.640]   Wow, it's a Skype miracle.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.040]   I was asking you if managing at her, which I found
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.040]   to be one of the greatest jobs ever in editorial work.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.200]   And I was asking you how you like being a managing editor.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.080]   I quite like being a managing editor.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.920]   When Renee first hired me on at iMork, he's like, well,
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.680]   titles, they're just kind of--
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.080]   you're welcome to choose what you want,
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.080]   but we were thinking like managing editor iOS.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.120]   I'm like, no, no, no, I don't need to choose.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.160]   That sounds great.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.880]   That sounds fantastic.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.960]   So I'm quite enjoying it.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.200]   And it does have a kind of all-encompassing feel to it,
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.440]   which I think actually describes some of the stuff
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.760]   that I've done so far in the first couple months
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.280]   that I've worked.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.560]   You know, a little bit here, a little bit there.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.120]   Or proofing, editorializing, taking some video.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.640]   Yep.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.240]   All of the authority.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.560]   Managing editors are the only people in an editorial
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.040]   operation that know everything and have all the power.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.920]   So that's why it's such a fantastic job.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.600]   Well, let's jump into the Apple news.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.320]   We've got some Apple news.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.960]   Not a whole lot.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.360]   This is one of the weird things about covering Apple
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.600]   is that they're not like Google, which is always constantly
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.040]   leaking out bits of news and information.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.480]   Apple releases official news two, three times a year,
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.440]   or something like that.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.360]   And then the rest of the year, we're all on our own.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.720]   Scramble and figure things out.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.960]   And we rely on the goodness of people
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.240]   to file lawsuits against Apple so that we have something
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.520]   to talk about.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.800]   So Apple's in court today, and they
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.440]   are faced with a $1 billion lawsuit, class action
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.680]   lawsuit over iPods and music stuff.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.480]   And it's actually a $350 million lawsuit,
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.800]   but it gets tripled because there's
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.360]   an antitrust dimension to it.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.960]   Andy and I, I couldn't really get
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.320]   a sense of the outcome of this, whether they're
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.360]   going to win this or lose it.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.720]   Can you do us the favor of just encapsulating
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.760]   what this lawsuit is actually about,
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.040]   and then maybe give us your sense of whether Apple's going
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.920]   to have to actually pay that $1 billion.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.080]   It's-- that's the thing with lawsuits with Apple.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.680]   They're fighting so many battles and so many fronts.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.840]   You kind of have to-- it's like you
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.080]   can't follow every single sports team.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.840]   You kind of cheer for the one that you really, really like.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.200]   So I'm a big fan of the interconference
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.320]   scrabbling between Apple and Samsung and Apple
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.680]   and the book industry.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.360]   When it comes to this thing about antitrust stuff
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:11.720]   and music players, I really don't know what the real beef is.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.240]   I have to absolutely admit that this is one of those things
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.400]   that makes my eyes glass over a little bit.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.720]   Yeah, and Serenity Caldwell, one of the interesting things
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.920]   about this is that, of course, Steve's jobs
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.160]   is going to testify, sort of.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.920]   He's actually going to be a video deposition of Steve Jobs
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.800]   himself, which was recorded probably four years ago,
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.280]   something like that, is going to be played in court.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.440]   And I think we're all looking forward to seeing it.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.000]   He's probably going to be very persuasive, as he always is.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.880]   But it's just kind of a weird aspect to this
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.200]   that Steve Jobs is testifying.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.400]   Yeah, I think it's funny that Steve probably,
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.640]   in his infinite wisdom, is like, you know what?
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.120]   On the off chance that we get sued,
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.520]   I'm just going to make a bunch of video testimonials,
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.560]   and I'll be extremely compelling in all of them.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.640]   No, but I believe the video is of boardroom meetings
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.320]   or something along those lines where he's talking
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.040]   about the various plans for the iPod
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.840]   and about crushing competitors, which, of course,
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.600]   this lawsuit has taken to meeting,
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.720]   oh, well, the iPod is clearly anti-trust.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.840]   And its goal is to make sure there are no other competitors
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.640]   in the music space.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.480]   And I don't know.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.600]   I mean, not having seen the videos myself,
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.600]   and maybe they'll leak out after the court testimony.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.840]   I'm skeptical to believe that what Jobs was actually,
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:39.240]   like in the ebook, the ebook "Anti-Trust Suit,"
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.680]   I'm not necessarily sure what he was saying is,
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.880]   let's crush all the competitors more like,
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.000]   we have a better product,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   and we're going to make it the best product
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.680]   in his traditional Steve Jobs way.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:54.040]   Now, whether that will be helpful or harmful for this case,
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.120]   we shall see, I suppose.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.480]   It's also weird.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.760]   Go ahead, go ahead, Annie.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.840]   I'm just saying also, this is where non-lawyers like myself,
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.080]   this is why our eyes glass over.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.520]   A lot of the things that are sort of key
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.600]   to this particular suit are the idea that for a time,
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.960]   you had to, if you wanted music that worked with iPod,
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.720]   you had to buy music from Apple.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.920]   And so to us, that's more like,
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.080]   maybe we've been beaten down our expectations
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.560]   of having freedom with non-DRM content,
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.120]   but now it's like, well, of course, if I buy a Kindle book,
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.800]   I guess I'm not gonna be able to,
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.120]   I'm not necessarily gonna be able to get it on a player
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.600]   that has not been approved by a Kindle,
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.400]   if I buy an iTunes movie,
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.640]   I'm gonna have to be limited to Apple TV
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.400]   and the Apple iPhone and the Apple iPad and that sort of stuff.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.560]   And then you just have to wonder,
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.400]   well, why is the government so worried about it?
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.080]   And this is why, like I said before,
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.240]   my eyes kind of glass over it,
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.800]   because I don't know at this point
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.880]   the difference between something that we are,
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.120]   we should simply accept because this is the way
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.840]   that business wants to do business,
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.840]   and something that the government really does say,
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.120]   no, no, no, we're here to defend you by saying,
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.040]   you shouldn't tolerate that sort of stuff from happening.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.320]   And the other, pardon me,
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.160]   and the other reason why your eyes glass over is that
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.240]   you know that even if things come down,
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.320]   a judgment comes down on the side of the consumers,
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.560]   it's gonna be something like,
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.400]   we suddenly get a credit for $1.73
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.880]   appear magically in our account and like,
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.920]   well, congratulations,
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.040]   that was the result of all this lawyers
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.880]   and all this gas being burned to photocopy documents
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.320]   and get their positions, $1.73,
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.280]   a couple of nuts.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.920]   - Yeah, it's also, it's kind of,
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.320]   you know, it's weird, of course,
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.000]   that Steve Jobs is gonna make
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.360]   a sort of virtual appearance in all this,
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.640]   but it's no less weird that the subject matter of this
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.960]   is this whole topic about music players and iPods
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.360]   and lock in for iTunes music and so on.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.240]   It's almost as if, you know, Microsoft,
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.040]   we're going to court today to defend itself
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.880]   against charges that its dominance in Windows
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.080]   is allowing it to maintain its dominance
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.880]   with the Internet Explorer browser
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.600]   and they're all gonna go to court
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.240]   and figure out this issue once and for all.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.200]   The whole thing is gone, it's over.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.120]   And it's just a question of whether, you know,
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.120]   people get that dollar and change in their accounts.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.560]   And so yeah, it is a bizarre thing
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.440]   that should make everybody's eyes glaze over,
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.880]   not just the non-lawyers.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.240]   - It's also something that I'm glad that some of the stuff
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.280]   that I might've posted on my blog
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.840]   or like written about like in the 1990s,
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.080]   back when the government might have,
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.880]   might possibly have broken Microsoft
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:32.720]   into separate units for their operating system division
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.720]   and their application division
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.640]   and their services divisions
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.880]   'cause they're just so powerful.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.840]   And it was incorrect for them to create an ecosystem
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.200]   in which their own products work together
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.960]   better than an outside product would.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.760]   And I'm sure that I was also like, you know,
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.080]   15, 20 years younger than.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.000]   And so maybe 21, 22 year old, Andy would have said,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.840]   "You know, this is exactly what needs to happen
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.640]   "because Microsoft wants to control everything.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.680]   "It do everything."
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.120]   But now like I'm Andy into my 40s and saying that,
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.400]   "Okay, I'm not necessarily saying it's a good thing
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.040]   "that I can't buy this copy of the Lego movie
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:02.880]   "and play it anywhere."
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.160]   But you know, Apple does such a wonderful job
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.920]   with its high-cloud integration to make sure
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.040]   that sinking between devices works so very, very well.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.080]   And it's like, you just don't know what's real
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.120]   and what's unreal anymore.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.000]   And I don't even know like whether the blue pill
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.080]   or the red pill is the one that I'm supposed to take
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.280]   to get back to reality.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.640]   - Well, as far as I'm concerned,
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.480]   I don't want to remember nothing.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.320]   Nothing.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.840]   Serenity, you had a comment?
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.960]   - Oh, just, you know, the fact, again,
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.920]   like you were saying, Mike, about the internet
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.000]   and explore days,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.560]   iPods, you know, were locked in primarily
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.480]   because of all hardware issues.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.520]   You know, when you're talking about early sinking problems,
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.320]   we all remember how much fun it was to sink early iPods
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.920]   and early music players to your computer.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.000]   Whereas now, I mean, there's a reason why this lawsuit
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.080]   is capped at like 2008, 2009,
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.800]   because once the app store wasn't reduced
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.080]   and everything else, like, yes, you have the option
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.560]   to buy from the iTunes music store,
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.360]   but you also have apps like Amazon Music
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.440]   where you maybe not necessarily can buy directly,
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.960]   but you can get your music downloaded.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.480]   You can put your music on Dropbox.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.880]   You can have your music accessible via Google Play.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.120]   You can stream it off of YouTube.
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:17.000]   Like these concerns are now no longer concerned.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.320]   So it's not like this lawsuit is,
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.400]   stop the big bad apple that's, you know,
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.720]   keeping us from doing everything that we want to do.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.280]   Most of those options are available.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.320]   Alternate options are available to you now.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.760]   - Yep, it's still an interesting principle.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.920]   It went one of the central things.
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.560]   And one of the reasons why I think this has gone so long
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.320]   is because there's Steve Jobs is known for saying things
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.240]   that are on his mind and whatever happens, then happens.
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.640]   And there's a conversation between him
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.520]   and Phil Schiller, is it Phil Schiller, I think?
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:50.520]   Where they're talking about one of the central
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:56.040]   like a touch match issues here was when real player
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.360]   wanted to get its content on the iPod,
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.680]   Apple would not let them do that.
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.480]   So they found a way to do that.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.800]   They simply reverse it.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.120]   I don't know if you,
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.400]   this fits the legal definition of reverse engineering,
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.240]   but they figured out that,
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.560]   hey, there's a way that we can actually do that,
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.160]   whether Apple wants us to do it or not.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.520]   Then Apple said, okay,
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.440]   or we can change the way that a host computer talks
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.000]   to the iPod to make sure that doesn't work ever again.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.520]   And that's one of the central issues
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.800]   that these suits are based on.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.640]   And it's an interesting question to ask.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:29.040]   Like, is it bullying tactics if Apple says this to,
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.800]   what this application that an independent consumer
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.880]   may or may not choose to install,
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.760]   that may or may not affect the operation of only the hardware
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.600]   that he or she actually owns,
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.400]   should we actually actively move to make sure
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.440]   that that tool is not available to that person?
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.280]   Even though it doesn't seem to be breaking any laws,
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.720]   there's no violation of digital Millennium Copyright Act.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.520]   It's not breaking copy protection on anything that we sell.
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.040]   Is it bullying to, for Apple to say, no, no, no,
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.080]   we emphatically say that as a consumer,
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.480]   you do not get to use any software on here
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.040]   that we do not approve.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.320]   And you certainly can't sell software as a company
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.560]   that lets people use our hardware in a way
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.420]   that we did not envision in a way that we don't approve of.
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.120]   So I think it's a more interesting debate
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.480]   amongst people like us who talk about this
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.220]   than amongst lawyers because when lawyers get involved,
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.440]   that starts to have knock on effects
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.720]   that maybe you don't like five or 10 years later.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.240]   But it's, like I was saying earlier,
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.680]   I think it's an interesting issue
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.440]   that things that we thought maybe were incredibly important
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:32.120]   in the 1990s, we simply accept as the law of the land,
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.200]   simply by virtue of the fact that we like the,
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.200]   we like the good things about the kingdom that we live in.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.320]   It's okay if they occasionally catapult people
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.260]   over the moat that we were kind of fond of.
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.100]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.660]   And you know, the companies that are often subject
[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:51.420]   to lawsuits and also antitrust action by the government
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.340]   tend to bristle about it because they understand
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.420]   something that this case actually demonstrates,
[00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:00.540]   something that we refer to the Microsoft case in the 90s.
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:03.460]   That demonstrates it as well,
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.620]   which is that innovation will always clobber you anyway.
[00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.700]   It's not like, you know, it's very, very difficult
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.100]   to get a lock in unless you're Facebook
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:11.700]   in which when you have every social,
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:12.820]   almost every social network,
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.580]   one third of the internet users in the world.
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.380]   And it's very difficult for them to sort of lose
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.460]   their monopoly if you wanna call it that.
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:23.300]   But for things like, you know, browsers, you know,
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.380]   music players, I mean, nobody, I don't think,
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.240]   could have predicted the degree to which streaming services
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.980]   would replace the behavior of buying songs
[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.740]   and downloading them to the extent that it is happening now
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.180]   and to the extent that it's almost certainly gonna happen
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:41.980]   in the future, that's just the industry being innovative
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.700]   and moving on with new ways of doing things
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.540]   and people embracing new ways of doing things,
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.980]   invalidating the old sort of lock in model
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.820]   that this case is all about.
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:54.260]   It's also a big question about how you slice and dice
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.740]   and categorize things.
[00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:00.740]   Does Apple have a 100% monopoly in iOS market share
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:03.740]   or do they have a 50% monopoly in the United States market
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.940]   because the iPhone has something like that
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:06.980]   in terms of its market share?
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.860]   Or do they have a significantly lower market share globally?
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:11.380]   How do you slice and dice these things?
[00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:16.100]   How do you determine what the market is and so on?
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.540]   So it's annoying when the lawyers get in there
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.260]   and start making these distinctions,
[00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:25.220]   but it's really, I think, as Apple will attest,
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.580]   these questions are almost always resolved,
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:32.220]   not by antitrust legislation, lawsuits, or the government,
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.260]   but by the markets, the innovative competitors
[00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.780]   and the users themselves who choose different models
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.020]   for doing things.
[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.140]   And so that's why these companies have to constantly
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:41.980]   reinvent themselves.
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.300]   Well, Apple is a company in flux
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.780]   and it's really interesting to see
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.500]   and it's one of my favorite topics
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:52.060]   to sort of look for signs of the new Apple,
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:55.340]   the new Tim Cook, the warmer the fuzzier Apple,
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.020]   the less vindictive, the one without the thermonuclear war,
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.100]   that Apple.
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.100]   And so I think we're seeing another sign of this
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.700]   and correct me if I'm wrong, Serenity Caldwell,
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.980]   that in Apple's red campaign,
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.380]   which is where everything that they sold
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:12.060]   on Cyber Monday yesterday, all the money raised
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.940]   went to help fight AIDS.
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:18.620]   And an interesting element of this is that they're pushing
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.900]   this so hard that they literally pushed a push notification
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.180]   out to people which caused people to freak out and think,
[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.260]   okay, this must be a spearfishing attack
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.180]   or something else.
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.900]   What do you think about this?
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.380]   Is this a red campaign sign of an Apple
[00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.980]   that's more willing to do good things in the world?
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:38.660]   Or is this just the same old Apple,
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.660]   something that's existed before?
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.300]   - Yeah, I mean, I really think that,
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.940]   I mean, they've been doing the red campaign
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:45.300]   for quite a few years now.
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.660]   And this campaign, this we're going to brand all
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:52.140]   of our apps red and encourage people to buy apps
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:55.700]   during World AIDS Day and donate our profits.
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.260]   That's a step above from what they're normally doing.
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.780]   The push notification issue is a little thorny
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:05.980]   because on one hand, there's a lot of us who are very upset
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:10.980]   when apps that we buy, like send push notifications
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.140]   that are ads, right?
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.900]   You should buy this in-app purchase
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.340]   or everything is 30% off today.
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.540]   All of that kind of stuff, that's really annoying
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.300]   when you get it from everywhere else.
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.260]   So to say that Apple is immune from that,
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.980]   even when it's for a good cause,
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.460]   it's kind of a hard tack to take.
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.380]   But at the same time, I don't think it was meant
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:33.740]   maliciously and I don't think it's the harbinger
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.780]   of things to come from Apple where they're like,
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.260]   oh, hey, let's use our push notification system
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.940]   for ads all the time.
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.180]   I think that it was probably one or two people
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.380]   on the App Store team or somewhere in that who were like,
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.060]   oh, you know what would be really cool?
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.780]   As part of our promotion of World AIDS Day,
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.820]   let's make sure that all of our customers
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:54.780]   really know about it and make sure that they understand
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.500]   this great cause that we're supporting.
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.540]   So it's like, I don't necessarily think
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.140]   that Apple should continue to use push notifications
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.260]   for ad or charity-related reasons.
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:09.380]   But I understand the vein from which they were coming
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.540]   and I don't necessarily think the outrage,
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.740]   the subsequent outrage on the internet is necessarily justified.
[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.260]   It's like, yeah, they made a mistake.
[00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.940]   They made a mistake in concert for a good cause
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:23.020]   and now they've definitely understood
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.980]   that people are maybe not so thrilled
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:26.900]   with this mistake that they've made
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.900]   and maybe they won't do it next year for World AIDS Day.
[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.700]   - And do you see other indications
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.060]   that Apple is getting both warmer and fuzzier?
[00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.860]   - Oh, yeah, I mean...
[00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.020]   - Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.500]   - Go ahead, I have to get any.
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.420]   - I just wanted to pick up where
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.260]   Serenia was talking about.
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.460]   It's an interesting move for...
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.140]   I wasn't outraged by it.
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:50.820]   I just thought it was okay, well, that's interesting.
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.900]   I've never seen it like that.
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.860]   I think that it is important to note
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.340]   that this isn't an ad so much as this is an extension
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.660]   of Apple's beliefs that we want to...
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.100]   And we want to do this, take this step
[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.460]   to promote something that we really, really like.
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.140]   Also, I think it's also important to note
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:12.020]   that they didn't do it at like 20 p.m. on a business day.
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:14.500]   It was during a long weekend where pretty much nobody
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.460]   is really using their phones for anything business related
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.620]   or really, really important unless their car is on fire
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:20.900]   and they're trying to get 911.
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.860]   So maybe there are exceptions to that.
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.140]   But it's interesting that you could take this as a sign
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.460]   that Apple really does see their users
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:32.180]   as a community of people that have shared beliefs
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:35.940]   and shared values because think about how many iPhones
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.460]   there are out there.
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:40.940]   And everybody in this conversation has a certain number
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.420]   of people who follow them on Twitter,
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.220]   follow them on Google+, or whatever.
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.380]   And you notice as your community grew,
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.780]   you start to notice that things that you could say
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.220]   about, wow, isn't it great that the President
[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:55.980]   of the United States was happening along
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:59.020]   and pulled that child out of the tree
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.140]   before the leper got at him.
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.260]   When you have 2,000 followers, people are going to say,
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.260]   yes, isn't it great that kids life got saved?
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.740]   When you have 2 million followers,
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:08.860]   you know what?
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:11.020]   Let's find out how that kid got in that tree
[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:11.860]   to begin with.
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:15.940]   I don't subscribe to you for political propaganda.
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.980]   And so it's interesting when Apple chooses to say,
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:21.980]   we're going to not just simply promote the idea of charity
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.900]   or unified fund, we're going to promote a specific charity,
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.780]   we're going to push that out to all of our users.
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.940]   So I do think that it is a sign that somewhere inside Apple,
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:33.060]   there are people that still think that everybody
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.740]   who has bought an Apple device did it because they have
[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.300]   a sort of shared values thing going on with the company
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:40.180]   and with all other Apple users.
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:41.220]   - Yeah, that's a great point.
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:46.220]   And we are actually joined by another third panelist
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.660]   with us right now is Alison Sheridan.
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.540]   Welcome to you, Alison.
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:51.540]   - Hey, Mike, how you doing?
[00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:52.660]   - I'm doing fantastic.
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:53.500]   It's very nice to meet you.
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:57.460]   I have also never been on a podcast or a netcast with you.
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.540]   And so I'm very glad to have you on.
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.900]   Thank you so much for coming on at the last minute.
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.220]   Yeah, you're with the Nozilla Cast Mac podcast.
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.100]   Can you tell us about that podcast?
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.940]   - Yeah, my tagline is a technology geek podcast
[00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.300]   with an ever so slight Macintosh bias.
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.980]   In other words, like a giant Mac bias.
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:16.980]   But I cover a lot of other tech stuff.
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:20.780]   In fact, this Sunday is my 500th show.
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:21.980]   - Wow.
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.420]   - Yeah. - That is fantastic.
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.100]   Well, congratulations and welcome to you.
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.940]   And I'm so glad you're here to join us.
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:30.580]   Now we have a true quorum here on Mac Brigitte.
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:31.500]   - We can call it a panel.
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:32.420]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.700]   And so I wanna launch this next story
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:35.540]   'cause it's really interesting.
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:39.580]   I've always been fascinated by Apple's eBooks initiative
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:42.580]   and the litigation that they're dealing with.
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:47.580]   And Eddy Q actually had an interview with Fortune this week
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.540]   where he talked about the need for Apple
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.700]   to fight for the truth, he says.
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:54.860]   And he said that Tim feels exactly the way he does,
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.180]   but they have to fight for the truth,
[00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:59.140]   fight for their principles because it's the right thing to do.
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:02.620]   I think that price fixing is not normally viewed
[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:05.620]   as fighting for the truth, but I think they do have a point.
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.020]   And I think the larger point of course is that Amazon
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.740]   is the dominant e-book player.
[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:10.740]   They have a lock on the market.
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.940]   They do all kinds of things that smell and taste
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.620]   anti-competitive, which is that they sometimes sell e-books
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:18.980]   at below the price that they paid for them
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.700]   and they tend to be very, very dominant.
[00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.660]   And I think Apple is trying to figure out a way
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:28.100]   where publishers and the company that delivers them,
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:32.260]   i.e. Apple, gets paid a reasonable amount for books.
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:36.340]   Do you think that Eddy Q's sort of missionary zeal
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:39.620]   is well placed here and that it will help Apple in any way
[00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.860]   deal with this litigation that they're facing?
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:45.980]   I'm sorry, you're directing me or?
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.140]   I'm sorry, I'll go ahead, Andy.
[00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:48.980]   You already started talking.
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:50.340]   I'm gonna go around the horn on this one,
[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:51.180]   but let's start with you, Andy.
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.020]   Go ahead.
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:56.820]   - I think it really does point to how Apple does seem,
[00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:59.300]   is like one of the few companies that can take things
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:04.300]   personally, like it's not when Google revised Android
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.580]   in response to the iPhone.
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:10.380]   It wasn't a case of one company creating a product
[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.620]   designed to be more competitive with a successful
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:13.460]   other product.
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.740]   It was Google has screwed us over.
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.660]   We trusted Google and this is what Google,
[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:20.980]   Google has made a powerful enemy today.
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:23.500]   And when you look at the antitrust thing,
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:27.060]   it seems to be mostly based, not on,
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:30.980]   I think that when Edd Q made that statement,
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:33.460]   I think he was talking more about how the judge
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:37.620]   who heard this case concluded that Apple had colluded
[00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:41.940]   with publishers to fix prices when in reality,
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.780]   they were just getting the iBookstore off the ground.
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.060]   One interesting new quote from this,
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:51.100]   from all this is that it's not as though the iPad
[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.900]   and the iBookstore were packaged together
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:54.820]   from the very beginning as,
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.860]   hey, we do a tablet, doesn't it make sense for us
[00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.540]   to start selling books in the iTunes store?
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:00.740]   No, it was Edd Q who said,
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.740]   who puts together all these deals for content
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:07.460]   who basically came to Steve Jobs when the iPad was
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.940]   in development and said, hey, here's an opportunity here.
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.780]   And one quote from the article is that Steve said,
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.220]   well, we're not gonna delay the iPad for this,
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:15.700]   but see what you can put together,
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.500]   which makes it seem like this is just,
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.620]   let's see what we can do just in time
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.740]   to get this time with the release of the iPad.
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.940]   And so I think that what Edd is saying here,
[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.220]   I could be wrong, is that he's saying that, no, look,
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.220]   you went after these publishers
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.740]   because there was a good documented trail of them
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.420]   colluding together to try to provide a united front
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.700]   against Amazon.
[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:38.100]   You're throwing us in with them when actually they did all
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:40.220]   that before we even got seriously interested
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.420]   in the e-book business.
[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:42.980]   And so we want to defend the truth
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:47.420]   that we did not join a big cabal to try to fix prices.
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:49.540]   Now, whether or not that's actually true,
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:51.820]   whether or not whatever they did on their own
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.180]   was price fixing or not,
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.340]   that might be something that's gonna be discussed
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.860]   in a week or two when this case is re-heard.
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.260]   But it is, I do think that's so typically Apple
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:05.180]   and I think in a positive way that they do feel
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.380]   as though they are one living organism
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.900]   with a heart and a brain and the ability to get offended
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:10.740]   and hurt.
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:12.220]   And when they get hurt, they try to say, hey, man,
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:13.540]   what's, what was that?
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:14.620]   What was that?
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.660]   When you cut me, do I not bleed?
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.020]   Well, no, I don't 'cause I'm a corporation,
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.540]   but still metaphorically.
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.460]   - Corporations are people, Andy, at least what's
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.140]   with the United States wants us to think.
[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:25.140]   - That's right, exactly.
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:26.980]   - Andy, part of what you said there at the very end
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.260]   where you said whether or not that ends up being true,
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:32.780]   isn't it probably true that anybody going into a lawsuit
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.340]   like this or almost any kind of court battle
[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.820]   believes that what they know is the truth?
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:39.580]   I mean, it almost seems obvious that he said,
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:40.580]   we're defending the truth.
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:42.340]   Oh no, the other guys, they think they're lying
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:43.500]   and they're defending lies.
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.620]   That's probably what nobody thinks, right?
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:46.940]   - Exactly.
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:47.780]   Well, I don't know.
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:52.780]   It's the, sometimes you feel, it's like you get pulled over,
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:55.780]   you know you were speeding, okay?
[00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:59.340]   There's no way that I was doing 65 on that downhill
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.860]   straight away late at night with no other cars on the road.
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:05.740]   There's no way I was doing 65, but you know that the game's
[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:08.220]   over if I say yes, officer, I was definitely speeding.
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.180]   I wasn't even paying attention to the speedometer,
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:14.140]   but the trees behind me were a complete Brownian motion,
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:18.420]   a complete Doppler blur into the red there.
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:20.340]   So whenever you say that I've sped up,
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.140]   that's the ticket you're gonna have to write for me.
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.500]   You're gonna say, no officer,
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.100]   I don't know why you pulled me over.
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:27.500]   And you're gonna, it's even if they said,
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.780]   you know there's a lot of leeway on what,
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:34.780]   we might have done something that fits the colloquial version
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:36.300]   of price fixing.
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:37.820]   I mean, yes, we talked to these people
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.100]   and then we encourage those people to talk to those people
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.100]   and then we all agreed to do this,
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:45.260]   versus we did something that fits the legal definition
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.180]   of price fixing.
[00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:50.180]   Like I did not have relations with that woman.
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.420]   Nope, I, well, when the truth comes out,
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:53.460]   how do you define relations?
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:54.300]   There you go.
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:55.460]   So I didn't lie, I just simply said something
[00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:56.580]   that I knew that I could defend.
[00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:59.540]   - Depends on what the definition of is, is.
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.740]   But Serenity, you had a comment on that?
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.500]   - I was gonna say it's the Obi-Wan Kenobi philosophy.
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:05.940]   It's like what I told you was true
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.420]   from a certain point of view.
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.780]   You have to, you have to believe that you're,
[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.780]   if you're defending a case, you have to,
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:15.180]   you have to have a narrative that you strongly believe in
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:16.700]   because it's very...
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.540]   - The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:19.460]   'cause stands of defense.
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.900]   Now, remember, Jerry, it's not a lie
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.140]   if you believe it. - You believe it.
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.700]   You believe it. - Yep.
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:25.660]   No, exactly.
[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:27.360]   - Love a sign, love a.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:31.080]   But you know, just, just a zero on on exactly what Apple is saying.
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.820]   And that, you know, to a certain extent,
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.700]   almost all aspects of their, of this whole scenario
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:39.940]   on Apple's part is, is very acceptable.
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:43.700]   So, you know, the first, the first aspect of it is that
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.860]   Amazon is very dominant and there has to be some way
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:48.900]   for other players to compete with Amazon
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.540]   when Amazon is bringing prices down to a point
[00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:53.060]   where nobody's making any money.
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:53.960]   Okay, that's acceptable.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.140]   We can all accept that.
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:57.500]   So, so Apple comes forward saying,
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.620]   "Hey, we'll just have our regular agency model,
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.260]   the same one we have for apps and everything else.
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.500]   Essentially, you can, you, the publisher,
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.380]   can choose any price you like.
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:07.740]   And then you give us our massive cut.
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.220]   And, and then we make money, you make money,
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.180]   you get to determine the price, not us.
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.540]   You know, Amazon determines the price of Amazon eBooks.
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:17.380]   And Apple's saying,
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.220]   we're going to provide an alternative to that model.
[00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:21.660]   I think everybody can accept that that is
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:24.620]   a perfectly above board thing to do.
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:27.300]   And then the price fixing part is when they said,
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.580]   but once you've selected a price,
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:32.780]   you can't sell that same e-book elsewhere,
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:35.980]   i.e. Amazon.com, for a lower price
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.180]   than the one that's available on, you know,
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:39.980]   through, through Apple's, you know.
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.300]   And so, that's the price fixing part.
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.220]   And, and that's where the,
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.420]   this definition of is, is because,
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.300]   again, according to the Forbes article,
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:51.220]   Q's statement was, look, this, we,
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.420]   that was when, that was like a draft version
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:54.260]   of something that we were doing.
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:56.540]   We quickly swapped away from that to something else
[00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:00.100]   that, that, because we felt as though that language,
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.300]   whether it was legal or not,
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:04.340]   didn't even, would not even achieve what we wanted to achieve.
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.300]   So that's, so, so a lot of it really is,
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.100]   here's the timeline is, they're also,
[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:09.940]   they also seem to, sorry, the people,
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.460]   the prosecutors also seem to, again,
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:14.620]   tinge on things that Steve Jobs tended to say,
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:17.260]   like after, shortly after the iPad announcement,
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:19.780]   again, quoting from the, from the Forbes article,
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:23.020]   that as Steve was being asked, like,
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.500]   well, I think was Walt Mossberg, that,
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.980]   Gee, but Steve, you know, you're charging,
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:29.940]   your, the iBook store is charging $15
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.540]   for the same book that Amazon is charging $10 for,
[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:34.100]   who was gonna, who's gonna be buying this book
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:35.420]   for $5 more?
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:38.860]   And Steve said, soon all the prices will be the same.
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:41.540]   I realize that he was, he's a tenor,
[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:42.780]   he's a tenor, not a baritone,
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:44.140]   but there's the same ominous sort of,
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:45.820]   it also sounds bad.
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:48.380]   - Andy, are, I'm not a lawyer,
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:50.700]   and either a you, so I'll just ask you directly.
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:52.460]   Do you know whether they're allowed to bring up
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:55.220]   anything about what's going on with the Hashet case
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.820]   and all that with, I guess it's not a case,
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.580]   but with Amazon?
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.420]   I mean, that sort of seems really interesting
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.260]   in this context, but probably has nothing to do
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.100]   with what happened in the past.
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:08.660]   - I don't know, I mean, we're both non-lawyers,
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:09.500]   which means that we can go,
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:10.860]   we can go hard wild in speculation.
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:11.980]   - We can make stuff up.
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:13.940]   - I don't think that they would be able to say,
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.220]   well, here's something that happened three years later
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.100]   with parties that had nothing to do with Apple
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.100]   or the other publishers.
[00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:20.580]   - I quit looking over there.
[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:22.420]   They're being bad.
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:24.620]   - Hey, we just pushed out an ad that helps,
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:26.180]   helps AIDS patients.
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:27.980]   Come on, could we do anything bad?
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:31.260]   - And just-- - But we'll send the new iPad is.
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.620]   - Judge.
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:35.620]   - This should get us all kinds of credit in court.
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.460]   Just to review the Hashet case,
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:40.020]   essentially what happened there is that Amazon
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.580]   was accused of bullying tactics.
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:45.380]   Essentially, they negotiate with publishers
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:49.660]   to get to figure out what the price is that Amazon pays
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:51.740]   for the books that they are then gonna sell.
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.380]   This is not the price that they weren't negotiating
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:57.420]   the price that Amazon is gonna sell Hashet books at.
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:58.820]   That's none of Hashet's business,
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.060]   as far as Amazon's concerned,
[00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:01.940]   it's the price that Amazon is gonna pay.
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:03.940]   And of course, they have these negotiations all the time.
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.180]   They have to in order to establish a contract
[00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:08.620]   for providing the e-books and so on.
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.700]   And Amazon wanted it apparently,
[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.420]   an unacceptably low price.
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.300]   There was protracted negotiations,
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.020]   and Amazon wanted to squeeze,
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.740]   this is the critical version of Amazon.
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.300]   I'll give you the Amazon version in a minute.
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:25.580]   But the critical version is that Amazon tried to squeeze
[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:30.300]   the Hashet by starting to stop making certain titles
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:31.620]   available on Amazon.com.
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:35.460]   You couldn't pre-order upcoming books from Hashet.
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:37.580]   You couldn't, they were starting to squeeze them
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:38.780]   literally their bottom line,
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:43.060]   that the income that was coming through Amazon to Hashet.
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:45.780]   And it was an effective tactic.
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.220]   People cried foul, a bunch of authors wrote a nasty gram
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.980]   to the Amazon board of directors.
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.980]   And this kind of thing feels anti-competitive.
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:55.180]   Now the Amazon's point of view was that,
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:57.340]   hey, we weren't sure that we were gonna actually
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.260]   be able to ink a deal with Hashet.
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.180]   So why would we have pre-orders for books
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:04.420]   that are in an uncertain state?
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:06.260]   They had language like that.
[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:07.260]   And they also said,
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:10.740]   ultimately we're all about embracing literacy.
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:14.300]   Literacy is enhanced when books are very cheap.
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:16.580]   And we are therefore the reader and the consumer
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:18.700]   driving down the prices of e-books
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:20.980]   so that everybody can afford to read
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:23.180]   and have the gift of literacy, et cetera.
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:26.300]   But Amazon does many, many things that feel anti-competitive
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.980]   and sort of using its monopoly,
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:31.580]   close to monopoly, whatever you wanna call it,
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:33.660]   their dominance in the e-book publishing market.
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:38.660]   And also their dominance in the online print book market
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:43.820]   to actually essentially turn the screws
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:45.540]   on the publishing companies.
[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:47.900]   That feels anti-competitive, but it isn't really.
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:49.020]   It's not against the law.
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.780]   There are selling books at below cost,
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:53.100]   feels anti-competitive,
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:54.820]   but it's only illegal if you do it internationally.
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:57.180]   It doesn't, there's nothing against the law about it
[00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:59.900]   if you do it internally, you can lose all the money you want.
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.340]   And so.
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:02.700]   - That starts making me wonder,
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.660]   I was thinking about it when I got something
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:05.900]   from Amazon today and I was like,
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.140]   oh, I only asked for it yesterday and it came instantly.
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:09.940]   And I just have this vision that one day
[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:12.820]   after Amazon is dominated, absolutely everything,
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:13.660]   then they're gonna go,
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:15.180]   okay, now we're gonna actually start charging
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:16.460]   what it really costs.
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.500]   And also just everything goes up 20%
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.420]   because it's just too good to be true right now.
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:21.740]   - There were some reports that in fact,
[00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:24.260]   that has happened in certain academic markets
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.940]   where they were able to turn the screws
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:29.100]   to a certain extent and establish a monopoly
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:30.700]   on that through low price,
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.860]   undercutting everybody so nobody else can make money.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.220]   The prices then went way up.
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:36.780]   That's a report that was controversial.
[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:38.620]   That's not an absolute statement
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:41.020]   on what their intentions are in all markets,
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:42.620]   but there was a report along those lines.
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:46.300]   Of course, the notorious diapers.com situation
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:49.340]   where they actually have algorithms
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:52.140]   that monitor diapers.com prices,
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:53.740]   they wanted to buy diapers.com
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:55.240]   and they were in the diapers,
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.740]   competing with them for diapers.
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:00.660]   And so they had this algorithm
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:03.180]   that would determine whatever the prices were on,
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.100]   diapers.com and then undercut it automatically
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:08.940]   and instantly, the valuation diapers.com plummeted
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:12.220]   and then Amazon bought them at a very favorable cost
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:13.980]   because they just didn't have a business anymore
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:15.420]   because of Amazon.
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:18.660]   And that's another example of what feels like
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.260]   not entirely fair business practices
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:24.100]   on the part of Amazon, but again, nothing illegal
[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:29.100]   and they're benefiting the cause of keeping babies
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:33.740]   from having full diapers by driving down the price.
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:35.580]   Some would say that they're in the same condition
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:37.020]   as those very diapers.
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:39.220]   And I'm sure that's how they explain it to stockholders.
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.060]   Yes.
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.020]   It's gonna cost us money to do this,
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:43.540]   but think of the children.
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:47.420]   At the end of the day, it really comes down to,
[00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:51.980]   if there's money being removed from your pockets,
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:54.900]   like if you're being charged only $5
[00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:57.140]   for something that should cost $10,
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:57.980]   where's that?
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:00.540]   Like that other $5 didn't just magically disappear.
[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:02.260]   It's not like, it's not invisible money
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:03.740]   that you never had to pay in the first place.
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:07.020]   Oh, this is what the book actually costs
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.260]   or the diaper actually costs.
[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.100]   That money is being taken away
[00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:13.460]   from either the bottom line of a company
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:15.620]   or the bottom line of the writer who made the book
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:20.100]   or from the workers who are packaging your 30 pack of diapers.
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:24.700]   Like Amazon may be dramatically undercutting a lot of prices
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:26.860]   to basically become dominant in this market
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:29.380]   and they may be engaging in semi shady
[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:33.140]   but pseudo-legal tactics to take over companies.
[00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:34.860]   But at the end of the day,
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:39.860]   where is this missing money being taken from?
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:42.340]   It's like we've all heard stories
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:43.580]   of like the crazy workers
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:48.140]   and I've heard stories from small publishers
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.540]   and small publishing companies
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:52.060]   and even bigger publishing companies
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:53.740]   who are like, yeah,
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:58.020]   e-books should cost marginally less than a paper book
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:37:59.980]   because of printing costs and all of that.
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:01.220]   But when you look down to it,
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.740]   printing costs really aren't that much.
[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:04.820]   And the majority of the money that you're paying for a book,
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:07.060]   whether it's printed or e-book,
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:09.540]   is to help offset the promotion
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:11.540]   and the writer's cost and everything else.
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.780]   And the more money you take away from that,
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:15.260]   the less we're able to pay writers,
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.220]   which means that writers may not be able to write
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:19.140]   as many books for us in a year,
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:23.140]   which then it trickles through the entire system.
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:26.100]   - Yes, and eddyq wants to fix it.
[00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:28.460]   Thank you, eddyq, for saving us.
[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:29.300]   - Not speed.
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:31.420]   - Yeah, and again, I think like so many of these things,
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:34.740]   there will be an industry solution to all of this.
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:37.060]   And there is the case to be made
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.460]   that Amazon is in fact making it super easy
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:42.220]   for authors to get books into the hands of readers
[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.660]   at low cost and that is theoretically a very good thing.
[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.940]   Well, in just a sec, we're gonna come back
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:50.180]   and talk about some really interesting apple patents,
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:51.580]   including some crazy apple patents.
[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:52.820]   We're gonna find out what they mean
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:55.780]   and when they're gonna come to an iPhone near you,
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.060]   probably never.
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:00.220]   And but first I wanna tell you about Squarespace 7.
[00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:02.580]   I've been using Squarespace for several years
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:05.620]   and I love it, it's so easy to use.
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.740]   And it's fantastic for me because I'm not,
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.020]   the kind of person is gonna go in there
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:12.100]   and do programming and have to host my site and so on.
[00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.580]   Squarespace will do the hosting.
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:16.620]   They let you build programming free sites.
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:17.980]   Now, of course, if you're a programmer,
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.220]   if you're a developer, you can go in there
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:22.140]   and truly customize, get access to all the code,
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.420]   use their amazing developer tools,
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:26.420]   including the tools that they use
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:28.060]   to build the site themselves.
[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:30.060]   That developer platform is now out of beta,
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:30.900]   so you can use that.
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:34.820]   But they also have this fantastic, easier to use system.
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:38.500]   And of course, Squarespace 7 is fantastically easy to use.
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.380]   I used to think Squarespace was incredibly easy to use.
[00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.260]   Squarespace 7 makes it so much easier
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:45.180]   because for starters, you don't have to toggle
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.980]   between the preview mode and the site manager.
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:50.620]   In other words, you don't have to go back and forth
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:51.980]   and say, okay, I made some changes.
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:52.940]   Okay, what does it look like?
[00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:54.300]   Let me go find out what that looks like.
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.260]   No, you can see what it looks like right there
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.100]   in the editing space,
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:00.540]   which is really a seamless, fantastic experience.
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:03.220]   You want pictures, you don't wanna just go
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.220]   and grab pictures online somewhere.
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:09.500]   You want to actually have sites that you have permission to use,
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:10.900]   but you don't wanna spend a fortune
[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:13.540]   and you wanna use high quality stock photography.
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:15.620]   So Squarespace now allows you to,
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:17.500]   directly from inside the site,
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:21.620]   pick, find, and plug-in images from Getty,
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:24.180]   the stock photography site that is just super,
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.020]   super excellent.
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:28.700]   It costs just $10 an image, super simple to do and to use.
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:31.420]   And those, again, are super high quality images.
[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.100]   They have fantastic templates.
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:34.820]   Your website on Squarespace
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.580]   will always look incredible
[00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:40.500]   because the designers are Squarespace's amazing designers
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:41.420]   and it starts with the template.
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:43.340]   And if you decide you wanna switch to another template later,
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:44.580]   you're gonna swap out the template
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:46.860]   and all the stuff that you've done, all the content,
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:50.180]   the pictures, everything in your site will remain the same.
[00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:52.100]   You'll just get the shiny new template.
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:54.460]   And this is really, really a wonderful thing to do.
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:57.380]   If you ever need help, of course, they have tech support 24/7.
[00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:00.500]   They don't send you off to figure it out on your own
[00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:01.580]   and some knowledge based somewhere.
[00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:03.420]   A human being who knows what they're talking about,
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.300]   who's based in their New York City offices,
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:06.900]   will answer your question directly.
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.260]   I've used their tech support.
[00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:11.460]   I've only had to use it once in truth.
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:13.460]   I had a question that was answered immediately.
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:14.740]   They really knew what they were talking about.
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:16.940]   It was really refreshing to use their tech support.
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:18.820]   And I really, really appreciate that.
[00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:21.060]   Squarespace sounds super expensive
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:22.460]   because of the quality of the designs.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:24.500]   It sounds expensive because the ease of use
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:25.900]   that they give you and it sounds expensive
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:27.620]   because they're hosting is so amazing.
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:29.580]   You can't bring down a Squarespace site.
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:31.500]   Even Leo couldn't bring it down
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:34.940]   by having the Twitter army on Twitch on the Big Sunday show.
[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:35.780]   He drove everybody.
[00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:37.780]   He's done it many times to Squarespace sites.
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:38.780]   Nobody can bring these things down
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.500]   because they throw all the processing power
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:45.380]   that is needed behind these sites when they are stressed.
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:47.060]   So it's just a fantastic name.
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:49.140]   But it's not expensive, just $8 a month.
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:50.540]   It starts at just $8 a month.
[00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:52.180]   And that includes a free domain name
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:53.220]   if you sign up for a year.
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:54.500]   What a deal.
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:55.700]   You can start a free two week trial
[00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:56.820]   with no credit card required.
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:57.940]   Start building your website.
[00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:59.540]   When you decide to sign up for Squarespace,
[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:01.580]   make sure you use the offer code MACBreak
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:02.900]   and that'll get you 10% off
[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.980]   and show your support for MACBreak Weekly.
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:06.340]   And to begin using Squarespace 7,
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:09.180]   if you're already a user, a customer,
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:10.540]   just go to the settings tab
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:12.940]   and you can just activate all the fun new stuff.
[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:14.500]   It's not gonna activate on its own.
[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:17.540]   So you won't have everything change
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.620]   unless you wanted to change, but believe me,
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:20.460]   you wanted to change.
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:21.580]   The new stuff is really great.
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:22.580]   So just go to the settings tab
[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:24.380]   and activate those new features.
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:25.820]   And we thank Squarespace for their support
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:26.980]   of MACBreak Weekly.
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:29.340]   Squarespace, start here and go anywhere.
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:32.060]   Well, the Steamed panel.
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.580]   Apple's got some new patents,
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:35.620]   including a wacky patent
[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:39.260]   that is designed to make your iPhone act like a cat.
[00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.460]   So when you drop it,
[00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.060]   it flips around to land on its feet, so to speak.
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:45.500]   It land on the bumper instead of the screen.
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:48.620]   It uses the built, it supposedly uses the built in,
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:52.260]   I guess it's an actuator for the haptics hardware
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:54.660]   that's inside iPhones.
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:57.580]   And it sort of turns itself around.
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:58.420]   Are they crazy?
[00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:02.420]   Will this, can anyone imagine this ever working?
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:04.820]   - I'm actually a mechanical engineer.
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:06.980]   - First of all, I just wanna highlight.
[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:08.060]   - Go ahead, somebody.
[00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:12.540]   - Oh yeah, I was just gonna make a joke about how
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:17.540]   that looks like the internals of a late saber,
[00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:20.940]   not a changing iPhone in mid-air.
[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:23.580]   I thought that was amusing, but no, I mean,
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:27.100]   I think it's a really interesting idea.
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:31.220]   I think that potentially there might be internals in there,
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:34.460]   but that can detect falls and compensate accordingly.
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:37.940]   In this small of a package though, I'm not quite sure.
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:39.500]   You wanna chime in a little bit more
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:42.300]   with your electrical engineering background?
[00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:44.420]   - Not electrical, mechanical actually.
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:46.820]   Yeah, that's exactly what I was gonna say was, I think.
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:48.260]   - Mechanical, sorry.
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.340]   - I think with a certain length of time,
[00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:53.300]   I could probably figure out how to do this with,
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:56.020]   you know, the actuator that Mike talked about
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:58.660]   and all kinds of different components,
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:01.020]   but making that in the thickness of an iPhone,
[00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:04.020]   I could probably do it in about a four or five inch thick
[00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:05.780]   piece of material.
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:08.340]   So that's pretty cool, but I don't know,
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.940]   maybe they're gonna have nanotechnology in there
[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:12.140]   by the time that they get around
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:14.780]   to actually making something like this.
[00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:17.900]   - Well, so we got a phone that in the future,
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:20.380]   that's gonna be made out of sapphire.
[00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:22.740]   The metal parts are going to be liquid metal,
[00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:23.900]   according to previous patents,
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:26.180]   over continuing to speculate.
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:28.940]   I think, Alison, I think you have an interesting idea,
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:31.260]   though, there, like what if someone were to,
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.540]   like, this would be a crazy Kickstarter, of course,
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:38.380]   but to make a protective case
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:39.860]   that not only has an extended battery,
[00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:42.260]   but also has like higher powered actuators
[00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:44.220]   that could do really cool things.
[00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:48.020]   Like, for instance, actually give you a really good chance
[00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:52.020]   at landing, if you drop a phone, landing it in a safe way,
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:54.580]   but also things like you could turn it into like a mini Roomba,
[00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:56.500]   where if you drop it on the floor,
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:57.700]   you don't know where your phone is,
[00:44:57.700 --> 00:44:58.980]   it won't just find your phone,
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:00.500]   it's like, your phone, your phone,
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:03.820]   it'll (imitates phone buzzing)
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:04.980]   and get closer and closer.
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:06.060]   It's, I--
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:07.580]   - But they've got the camera app,
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:09.340]   though, it's gonna stand it down end, right?
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:10.340]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:12.380]   - It's 360 degrees, yeah.
[00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:13.940]   - And it's like magical, too.
[00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:15.300]   I would have, when I saw it,
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.060]   I would have expected just like vibrate,
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.980]   just like sort of turn around like randomly,
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:20.620]   like one of those old like football players,
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:23.540]   one of those like old tabletop football games.
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:25.300]   But it's like, no, it's like turn 10 degrees,
[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:27.980]   take the picture, turn 10 degrees, it's like,
[00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:30.420]   that's spooky, man.
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:33.260]   And I want to see phones that have interesting,
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:35.100]   weird features like that.
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.780]   I would love it if that's,
[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:38.300]   if there were something that Apple were to demonstrate
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.660]   at a keynote someday.
[00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:40.500]   - I've got it, I've got it.
[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.020]   What was that game when we were little kids?
[00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:44.220]   It was like, it wasn't Rock 'em, talk 'em robots,
[00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:46.140]   but it was around that time area where the little robots
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:49.740]   would kind of go like this and bash it.
[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:51.460]   - That was before my time, too.
[00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:54.260]   But it was like some sort of vibrating like metal plate.
[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:56.460]   And so football players just sort of like,
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:58.660]   the, the, the, the, the, and, but wherever they stopped.
[00:45:58.660 --> 00:45:59.500]   Yeah.
[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:00.740]   - Now we can have our iPhones doing.
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:02.020]   - I have the feeling that-- - I go on metal.
[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:03.460]   - I thought that, well, I always thought that maybe
[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:05.580]   there's an opportunity for a game developer,
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:07.420]   because like maybe this was, this is,
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:08.660]   the time for this has passed,
[00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:10.900]   it would have worked better with like actual pocket pages
[00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:12.500]   that have really powerful buzzers.
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.940]   But what if we have like a bar top football game
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:17.820]   where everybody puts their own personal pages on the table
[00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:20.900]   and by sending text messages, like by, by paging yourself,
[00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:23.620]   you basically have the past plays run and,
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:26.460]   and it would cost you like $1 per play,
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:28.660]   but AT&T would be very happy about it.
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:31.220]   And if you managed to get the peanut on top of your,
[00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:32.980]   on top of your, your, your Motorola pager
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:35.220]   to the end of the table for anybody else,
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:36.980]   there you go, you win a free beer.
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:38.700]   - Andy, you really gotta come to Silicon Valley
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:39.740]   and slant your company.
[00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:42.380]   - Why is my genius wasted on the East Coast?
[00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:43.460]   Good heavens. - Yeah, I know.
[00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:46.340]   - It's the lost to society that I worry about,
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:48.820]   not any monetary gain that I might be missing out on.
[00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:51.100]   - Of course not Andy, of course not.
[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:52.940]   - So, so I've always believed that Apple
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:54.980]   is gonna get into haptics in big time.
[00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:58.620]   Ever since a few years ago, I saw a demo,
[00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:02.500]   I experienced a demo by immersion.
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:05.260]   Immersion is a company that makes haptics technology.
[00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:08.340]   I think it's the leading company that does haptics.
[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:10.460]   And in this demo, they had a tablet.
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:13.420]   It was at the time an ordinary tablet
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:15.180]   in terms of thickness and size and so on.
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:16.780]   And they had a pinball game on it.
[00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:19.300]   And they had the, you know, as the ball rolled around,
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:22.580]   you just really felt the vibration of the ball rolling
[00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:24.820]   and the little, the bumpers,
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:26.780]   going to ding ding ding and clanging and stuff like that.
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:29.300]   And you felt everything, it was,
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:32.620]   it was just really shocking how much could be conveyed,
[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:37.620]   how much sort of content and how believable it was
[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:40.260]   this pinball game because of the haptics interface.
[00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:42.300]   And I thought, well, this is just a matter of time
[00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:43.900]   before this is gonna happen.
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:45.940]   And now we're starting to see some really interesting
[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:48.540]   things happening in haptics in the Apple Watch,
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:50.860]   which, you know, they're calling it the Taptics Engine,
[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:53.380]   but essentially according to,
[00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:56.580]   and maybe Andy, you experienced this yourself,
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:58.660]   there's an interface where if you tap on the watch,
[00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:00.660]   then you can, it feels like somebody's tapping on your wrist
[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:02.940]   and it doesn't feel like something buzzing, buzzing, buzzing.
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:04.580]   It feels like somebody's tapping on your wrist.
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:06.300]   I mean, it feels almost directional,
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:09.660]   it feels very natural and that's in the smartwatch.
[00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:11.820]   So you gotta believe that the iPhone of the future,
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:14.260]   the iPhone 8 or something,
[00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:17.300]   is gonna have some pretty sophisticated haptics
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:21.500]   that may have multiple haptics actuators
[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:23.540]   in different parts of the phone
[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:27.140]   and that sort of, and this is wildly speculative,
[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:28.860]   but that sort of thing could be enough
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:31.620]   to really turn a phone around or do other amazing,
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:33.620]   magical things, but it certainly would be great for gaming
[00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:37.060]   and in fact turn an iPhone into something more like
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:39.460]   an Xbox controller.
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:43.500]   - Yeah, Apple is in a difficult situation
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.820]   in that they're the only makers of iPhones
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:48.140]   and they can really only make two or three models.
[00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:51.620]   So if they decide to do something like as bizarre and weird
[00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:55.220]   and ultimately destined to fail like the fire phone,
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:57.380]   like that would be one third of all the iPhones
[00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:00.380]   they manufacture would fail, but haptics are great.
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:02.260]   It's something that every time I test out
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:04.220]   like an Android phone, I really enjoy it
[00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:06.300]   'cause almost every Android phone uses haptics
[00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:09.440]   in the keyboard and you might wanna
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:12.340]   turn it on or turn it off or dial it in
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:14.060]   when you get your new phone, but believe me,
[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:15.380]   if you're in a noisy environment
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:18.060]   and you're not really sure if you're making quote contact
[00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:20.540]   unquote with a certain button or a certain key press
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:22.500]   you're trying to make, the fact you get a reassurance
[00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:25.340]   that yes, I do recognize that you did press this button.
[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:27.780]   I'm telling you that you can now lift your finger off of this.
[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:30.660]   It's just a nice little bit of reassurance,
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:32.660]   particularly in things like when you boot up
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:35.220]   and it reassures you the, okay, I'm alive right now,
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:36.580]   everything worked out fine.
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:39.600]   It's just another way to have this hardware communicate
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:43.640]   with the user and once you get above like baby,
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:46.080]   like just cries and growls and shrieks
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:48.960]   and you elevate the haptics to communication,
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.480]   boy, what an opportunity that is.
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:53.800]   And yeah, the Apple Watch, I was only,
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:56.240]   like everybody else, I was only experiencing like a canned
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:58.720]   like demo that was just programmed to go through
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:01.240]   whatever emotions it was programmed to go through.
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:04.560]   It didn't feel like it was amazingly subtle,
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:08.820]   like it was communicating anything other than it's buzzing
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:10.380]   and it's buzzing in a different way now.
[00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:13.340]   But even that, just the ability to do nothing like,
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:17.260]   there's a, we're talking about watches and haptics.
[00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:21.860]   I installed like a new thing on my Moto 360 just two days ago
[00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:25.700]   that I forgot about until today, about an hour ago,
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.940]   when I went, I was cleaning up stairs
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:32.300]   and I went downstairs to make lunch.
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:34.440]   And suddenly like my watch buzzes and I'm,
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:35.780]   what do you wear as my watch buzzing?
[00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:38.060]   And it warrants me that, hey, did you leave your phone
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:40.940]   behind somewhere because I just lost contact with your phone?
[00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:42.340]   And that's the purpose of this thing.
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:46.180]   So if you leave your phone like in a bar or in a sofa cushion
[00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:48.980]   or whatever, it will, as soon as it loses contact.
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:51.280]   So as soon as you're about 10 or 15 feet away from it,
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:52.980]   it will say, hey, by the way, take,
[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:54.700]   I don't know if there's something going on here,
[00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:56.100]   but maybe you want to know about that.
[00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:58.940]   It's such a cool thing to put particularly on a watch
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:00.860]   that's designed to alert you to something that you need
[00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:03.020]   to know about right away as opposed to,
[00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:05.240]   okay, I guess this buzzing in my pocket means
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:08.740]   that I might have gotten a Gmail or email from anyone
[00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:12.300]   of 400 different people, I'm not gonna even bother with it.
[00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:13.140]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:15.300]   And speaking of the Apple Watch,
[00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.060]   there's been some new reports coming out
[00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:19.140]   that have been kind of shocking some people
[00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:20.940]   'cause I think a lot of people are kind of on the fence
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:23.300]   about whether the Apple Watch is gonna have
[00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:25.460]   any sort of market success at all.
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:28.340]   And now there are different reports.
[00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:31.780]   One of them is from UBS of Steve Milinovich
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:36.580]   who says that one out of 10 iPhone owners are going to,
[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:39.460]   are very likely to buy an Apple Watch when it comes out,
[00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:41.580]   I think within the first year or something like that.
[00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:44.700]   And that adds up to millions, dozens of millions
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:48.100]   of Apple watches being sold in the first year.
[00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:51.380]   Serenity, let's start with you.
[00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:52.380]   Do you buy this?
[00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:54.580]   Do you think just based on your gut feeling
[00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:57.260]   and what you know about the Apple fan base,
[00:51:57.260 --> 00:51:58.900]   do you think that people are gonna be gobbling up
[00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:03.620]   these expensive and probably unnecessary peripherals?
[00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:06.100]   - Yeah, and I don't even necessarily know
[00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:08.860]   if they're unnecessary perhaps,
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:11.700]   in that we've, I mean, now that the Watchkit
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:12.940]   is available for developers,
[00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:16.020]   we have some idea of what the first six to eight months
[00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:18.380]   of the watch is gonna look like.
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:20.940]   And for people who want more subtle notifications,
[00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:23.900]   for people who want basically a way to connect
[00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:26.100]   with their phone without necessarily having to have it
[00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:28.700]   in front of their face at all times.
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:31.100]   The Apple Watch actually seems like a really useful
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:33.860]   piece of technology and the possibilities for it,
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:35.780]   including the haptic extension and everything else
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:40.140]   as we discussed, I think are actually boundless as soon,
[00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:43.500]   especially, Watchkit is fairly limited
[00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:45.980]   in terms of what developers would be able to do.
[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:50.100]   It basically acts as an extension for your current iPhone apps.
[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:53.700]   But once full fledged watch apps are able to be developed,
[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:55.980]   which we're hearing rumors of that later
[00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:58.860]   in 2015, maybe WWDC area,
[00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:01.540]   I really do think that there's a market
[00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:03.660]   for the Apple Watch and I'm not at all surprised.
[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:06.340]   I mean, it's not, you know, this survey does not say
[00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:10.300]   one in 10 owners very likely to buy an Apple Watch edition,
[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:14.020]   like a specialty $5,000 Apple Watch.
[00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:15.580]   These are people, the majority of these people
[00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:17.140]   are probably looking at the, you know,
[00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:19.940]   the 349 base model Apple,
[00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:22.500]   probably the Apple Sport, right?
[00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:25.220]   And for a lot of people,
[00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:27.340]   I think the Apple Sport will be more than enough
[00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:29.500]   for people's needs and I don't know,
[00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:32.420]   I just, I feel very positive about the Apple Watch.
[00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:34.820]   I got a chance to play with it in the hands-on demo area
[00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:38.740]   when they premiered it back a few months ago.
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:43.660]   And I like, even with the completely canned demonstration,
[00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:45.580]   it's a very beautiful piece of technology.
[00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:47.740]   It's the first watch base, you know,
[00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:51.060]   watch style mobile computing that I've ever considered getting.
[00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:52.460]   And I, you know, I played with the Pebble
[00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:54.620]   and I've played with the Moto, you know,
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:56.140]   I've played with a bunch of these
[00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:59.340]   and none of them actually sort of sparked for me,
[00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:00.580]   the way that the Apple Watch has.
[00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:04.180]   - Yeah, Alison, you know, I remember when the iPhone
[00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:07.820]   first was announced and then shipped in 2007,
[00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:10.660]   January and then summer, I think, respectively.
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:15.660]   And at the time, I was a naysayer and it's hilarious.
[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:20.900]   Now, my main beef against the iPhone was that it was too big
[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:23.500]   because I had a Blackberry Pearl
[00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:25.700]   and it was like about the size of a box of chicklets.
[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:27.460]   It was tiny and I thought, you know,
[00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:29.580]   yeah, it's some big screen stuff, but who cares?
[00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:30.500]   It's boring.
[00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:33.340]   And then sometime after that, what was it, a year later
[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:35.420]   or less than a year later, they came out with the App Store
[00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:38.140]   and all the apps and I started seeing what the apps could do.
[00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:40.100]   And I think like millions of people,
[00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:44.580]   I started to sort of my whole view of what the iPhone was
[00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:47.100]   was completely transformed because of the apps.
[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:49.380]   And I think that's what Serenity is saying here
[00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:52.700]   that once the developers get their hands on, you know,
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:55.100]   the kit that came out recently and build some apps
[00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:59.220]   and you see what this thing is actually going to be used for,
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:01.660]   it's going to really spark people to get excited about it,
[00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:04.740]   talk about it, share the information, it'll be viral.
[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:07.780]   Do you buy that argument or do you think it's going to land
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:08.980]   with a thud?
[00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:11.700]   Well, you actually said almost exactly what I was thinking.
[00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:15.420]   When they talk about what the Apple Watch is,
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:17.820]   I think that we aren't going to know what it is
[00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:20.100]   until the developers tell us what it is.
[00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:22.180]   Now, unfortunately, they're going along the same path
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:24.180]   where they're saying that these first apps that come out
[00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:26.580]   have to just be tied to an iPhone app.
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:28.340]   And I understand the reasons behind that.
[00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:30.380]   But I don't think we're going to really know what it is
[00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:32.700]   until the apps are completely opened up.
[00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:34.460]   I mean, like you said, with the phone,
[00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:35.980]   we thought it was a phone.
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:38.100]   But once the last time you made a phone call with it,
[00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:40.500]   you know, almost everything we do with our iPhones
[00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:42.260]   and especially with the iPad,
[00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:46.420]   the iPad is perfect example of an unnecessary thing, right?
[00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:47.260]   Nobody needed it.
[00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:48.100]   We didn't need it.
[00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:48.940]   I didn't need it.
[00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:49.780]   Why was it going to need that?
[00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:50.940]   Now I can't live without it.
[00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:54.020]   So, but it was the developers, not necessarily Apple,
[00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:55.820]   who showed me why I needed it
[00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:57.980]   and taught me what it was supposed to do.
[00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:02.620]   So I'm not maybe quite as bullish as serenity is on it.
[00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:03.660]   I feel pretty good though,
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:06.060]   that when the developers show us what it can be,
[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:09.500]   that's when we're going to go, "Oh, it's not a watch."
[00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:11.460]   - Yeah, I definitely agree with that.
[00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:12.940]   I think another component is going to be,
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:14.820]   I think it will be a lot like the launch of the iPhone
[00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:19.820]   where we forget that it sold maybe 10 million
[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:23.380]   and it's first, it really didn't start becoming a phenomenon
[00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:25.260]   for about it until about a year after it.
[00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:27.580]   And I think that's not just because the App Store came about
[00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:30.460]   and it was refined and they were able to improve
[00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:32.220]   some of its original limitations,
[00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:35.140]   but also because there were now about 5 million people
[00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:36.660]   with iPhones that could,
[00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:39.140]   everybody knew someone or knew someone who knew someone
[00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:40.700]   who had an iPhone who could explain,
[00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:41.540]   "Gee, why is this?
[00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:43.980]   Why would I want a phone that doesn't have any buttons on it?"
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:47.500]   And I think that smartwatches are pretty much the same thing.
[00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:51.420]   I wind up inadvertently evangelizing wearables
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:53.700]   wherever I go 'cause when someone sees,
[00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:55.700]   when someone sees like my blank watch
[00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:56.500]   and suddenly it lights up
[00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:58.740]   and here's a picture of a squirrel with a time on it.
[00:56:58.740 --> 00:56:59.940]   I see, "Is that one of those smartwatches?
[00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:00.780]   How do you like it?"
[00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:02.020]   And then I will say, "Well, I love it a lot
[00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:04.300]   and here's how I use it and here's what I thought was going
[00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:06.300]   to be that wasn't going to work, but boy, does it work great?
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:08.340]   And every time I travel, I do this
[00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:10.580]   and look, hey, look what you just told me right now."
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:12.060]   And then that leaves them thinking that,
[00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:15.020]   "Gee, it's not a, it's a difficult thing to understand
[00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:17.100]   in the abstract, especially given
[00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:19.580]   that there has never been product like this before.
[00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:23.140]   But once you wind up working with somebody who has one,
[00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:27.420]   it goes from a cursory five or 10 minute demo
[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:29.500]   to a month later casually asking,
[00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:30.900]   "Hey, do you still like that?"
[00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:32.860]   To four months or a year later,
[00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:36.140]   you're really now about 10 cents away
[00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:38.220]   from actually wanting to actually buy it.
[00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:40.820]   And now, "Okay, Steve, you're gonna have to tell me
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:42.340]   what don't you like about it?
[00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:44.220]   What do you ever have any regrets?"
[00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:46.860]   I think it really is wearing people down over the first year
[00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:49.060]   and part of that is going to be, as Allison said,
[00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:50.860]   "Once developers are able to populate it
[00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:53.220]   and really emphatically show you what it does
[00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:56.740]   besides encouraging you to move around
[00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:58.260]   and how it will enhance your life."
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:01.780]   - Yeah, and I think one of the unanswered questions
[00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:05.060]   is with the pricing, you see reports
[00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:07.780]   that the gold version, the edition version,
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:10.740]   is gonna be four, five, $6,000 somewhere in there.
[00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:12.460]   That's a lot of money and then the watch--
[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:13.820]   - Even 350 is kind of a lot, I'm worried about that.
[00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:15.420]   - Yes, yeah, exactly.
[00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:17.540]   That's where it starts and that's not even with Sapphire,
[00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:18.540]   that's with aluminum and so on.
[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:20.580]   But at the very high end, the gold edition
[00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:22.380]   and the watch nerds would chime in and say,
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:23.460]   "Oh, that's nothing.
[00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:25.660]   People pay a lot more than that for gold watches.
[00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:28.260]   They pay $10,000, $20,000 for gold watch."
[00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:31.100]   Yes, but the problem is that they buy a watch
[00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:33.100]   at those prices because they're gonna hand it down
[00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:35.420]   to their great grandkids on their deathbed
[00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:37.540]   to take my watch, it's like that kind of thing.
[00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:39.020]   Whereas the Apple watch is gonna be obsolete
[00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:40.740]   be here in the-- - You're far mumbled this
[00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:41.900]   out of Vietnam. - Yeah, it's right.
[00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:43.500]   Exactly. - So we were talking about,
[00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:47.020]   over at IMAR, we were talking about ways for this not
[00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:49.060]   to be so much of a problem, which is to say,
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:52.100]   like if you're paying $5,000 for an Apple watch,
[00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:55.860]   how might the majority of those components stay
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:58.780]   in your hands, especially if you're gonna do things
[00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:03.460]   like engraving, for instance, on a $10,000, $5,000 watch.
[00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:06.140]   And one of the major thoughts was something
[00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:09.660]   where the internal chip is actually replaceable,
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:12.140]   whereas you know that the screen is gonna be written
[00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:17.140]   in a quality for that size for the 42 and 38,
[00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:20.940]   I wanna say, millimeter screens of the watches.
[00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:24.780]   So the screens may be not gonna need to get so much better
[00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:26.900]   for a couple years yet unless you really wanna cram
[00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:30.100]   a 4K display into a 300 pixel device.
[00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:33.420]   - So-- - It's a Arabia on your wrist.
[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:34.540]   - Yeah, exactly, right?
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:37.860]   Oh man, those sand dunes look amazing.
[00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:40.260]   No, I mean, to be perfectly honest,
[00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:43.180]   if Apple figures out a way to just basically like,
[00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:45.460]   oh yeah, we just take it to an Apple store,
[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:48.060]   we take off the back panel, and for $100,
[00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:53.060]   we'll replace your A8X mobile chip with a A10.
[00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:57.100]   And then all of a sudden you have all of the new fancy things
[00:59:57.100 --> 00:59:59.620]   and you still have the majority of your $5,000
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:02.260]   beautiful watch chain and beautiful watch body
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:06.700]   and personally engraved message about your family crest
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:10.020]   or something like that, which is keeping in line
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:12.020]   with traditional watchmaking as well.
[01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:14.420]   When you think about how watches are repaired,
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:16.980]   they're not, it's not just throw away the entire thing,
[01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.180]   get a new watch.
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:19.380]   If you have a really nice watch,
[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:22.260]   you go to a watch repair shop and they take it apart
[01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:25.460]   and they put in little batteries and they tweak with it.
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:27.420]   So I don't know, I mean, I feel like that's a--
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:28.900]   - That sounds really fun, Serenity.
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:30.140]   That sounds really fun, Serenity,
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:33.820]   but do you think that sounds like Apple to do that?
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:36.260]   To not encourage us just to buy another one?
[01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:39.380]   - I mean, I think the problem is Apple has never really sold
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:43.580]   a $10,000 machine unless you count like a souped up Mac Pro.
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:45.060]   - For you think anniversary.
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:46.820]   - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:48.580]   You know, I mean, I really,
[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:51.260]   it's a very different market that they're getting into
[01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:53.460]   and they've already acknowledged some, you know,
[01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:55.100]   they've acknowledged that they know
[01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:56.340]   they're getting into a different market
[01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:59.100]   by the way that they've been courting the fashion industry
[01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:03.460]   and by, you know, taking on fashion industry advisors.
[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:05.380]   I don't know if that's actually how it work,
[01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:07.340]   but I feel like it might be a good way, you know,
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:12.340]   it might be more of a good thing
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:16.980]   with whatever it is.
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:19.260]   - Either she's having something that I'd like to have
[01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:23.380]   or Skype is freaking out again.
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:24.780]   Sorry about that Serenity, I think Skype
[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:26.740]   is not your friend today.
[01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:28.020]   - I think a point she made was,
[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:31.900]   I just got what she was saying was that maybe the addition,
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:33.940]   you can do that, but the sport,
[01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:35.380]   you wouldn't be able to swap it out.
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:36.900]   You wouldn't be able to swap out the components.
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:39.220]   That might be, now I see where you're going with it.
[01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:40.620]   Yeah, that kind of makes sense.
[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:41.700]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:43.380]   Well, in just a second, we're gonna come back
[01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:46.220]   and talk about an area, two areas actually,
[01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:50.380]   where Apple is getting its butt handed to them by Google,
[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:52.460]   maybe, we'll talk about it and figure out
[01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:54.980]   what is going on exactly, but first I wanna tell you
[01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:56.940]   about NatureBox, one of our sponsors today.
[01:01:56.940 --> 01:02:00.580]   NatureBox is a fantastic product for health
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:03.860]   and for better living because they're delicious snacks.
[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:05.780]   We all like the snack, and I think one of the reasons
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:08.460]   we like to snack is that when we're relaxing,
[01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:10.900]   when we're at home, just watching TV
[01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:12.700]   or around the house doing whatever,
[01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:15.460]   we don't really feel like going through a big chore
[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:17.860]   of making a healthy meal, going through all that kind of stuff.
[01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:20.940]   We just wanna grab something that's maybe a little sweet,
[01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:23.100]   a little salty or whatever that's delicious
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:25.980]   and just eat it between meals.
[01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:28.220]   We all like to do it, we're all gonna do it, let's face it.
[01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:30.900]   And oftentimes most snacks are just not good for you.
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:33.220]   They have trans fats, they have way too much salt,
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:35.620]   way too much sugar, they have unhealthy ingredients
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:37.220]   and they're really nothing good for you.
[01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:38.940]   And that's why NatureBox is so fantastic
[01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:41.140]   because it's super, super easy for you to go ahead
[01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:44.220]   and do what you're gonna do anyway, except you have healthy food.
[01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:46.780]   Like here's an example, Lone Star Snack Mix,
[01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:51.420]   these are delicious with a flavor the size of Texas.
[01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:54.140]   These are really amazing, and one of the fun things
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:55.260]   about NatureBox, by the way,
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:58.300]   before I get into what's innovative about this company,
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:01.980]   is the fact that their flavors are always so shocking.
[01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:05.180]   So they have blueberry nom-noms,
[01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:07.780]   all kinds of really innovative flavors.
[01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:09.500]   Sometimes when you hear it, you're like,
[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:13.060]   wait, I've never really heard that flavor combination ever.
[01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:14.620]   How could that possibly be good?
[01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:16.500]   And then you try it and it's absolutely fantastic.
[01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:19.580]   But here's the innovative part about NatureBox.
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:21.580]   Basically what you do is you can just get
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:23.580]   a complimentary trial box.
[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:25.740]   You just pay $2 for shipping and they will send you
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:29.060]   a trial box to your house or to your place of work
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:31.300]   if you wanna have it come to work.
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:35.060]   And you just try the various things that they send you.
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:36.300]   And then you go to the website,
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:38.020]   if you decide to sign up and subscribe
[01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:40.500]   to Subscription Snack Service, essentially,
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:41.340]   you can go in there and say,
[01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:43.460]   you know what, I really like these two,
[01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:44.860]   but I didn't like this one.
[01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:47.460]   And they'll send you those two again in the future,
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:50.340]   and then they'll send you another one to surprise you
[01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:53.780]   in the future, and they have so many different flavors
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:55.420]   and different styles and so on.
[01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:58.300]   They have apple pie oak clusters, sea salt,
[01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:00.300]   cracked pepper, pumpkin seeds,
[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:01.300]   all kinds of things.
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:03.180]   Many of these are dried fruits or nuts.
[01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:05.460]   Many of them are granola type things.
[01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:08.220]   They're just so many different types of snacks
[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:09.300]   that you can get.
[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:12.220]   They're fantastic and they got zero artificial flavors,
[01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:15.500]   zero artificial colors, no artificial sweeteners,
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:19.100]   zero grams of traspats, no high fructose corn syrup,
[01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:21.460]   and you can even find snacks with no added sugar
[01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:24.740]   and without gluten, gluten-free snacks, if you like.
[01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:27.140]   You can choose your dietary preferences,
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:28.940]   whether you're vegan or whatever it is,
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:30.700]   and you just go in there to the website,
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.740]   it's a modern service, so you can go in there
[01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:36.620]   and optimize and customize exactly what you want to get.
[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:39.340]   And then they send you stuff and over time,
[01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:42.260]   you'll just, I guarantee you, as we have right here
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:43.500]   in Twitter in the break room,
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.340]   that you'll discover your favorites,
[01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:46.620]   and you're really gonna be thrilled
[01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:49.340]   because they have snacks you've never, ever even heard of.
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:51.660]   So I pass some of these out to the studio audience here.
[01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:52.500]   What do you think?
[01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:54.220]   What do you think is a nature box?
[01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:55.620]   They're good, yeah?
[01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:58.580]   Very good, okay, so the reviews are coming in.
[01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:00.060]   Thumbs up all the way around.
[01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:00.900]   - I'm hungry here too, Mike.
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:01.740]   - What's that? - I'm hungry over here.
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:03.580]   I would really like some of that nature box.
[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:05.100]   - We'll fax you some right now.
[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:07.780]   Yeah, it's some of the flatter snacks.

[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:24.340]   of Mac Break Weekly, and I thank Nature Box
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:26.900]   for your delicious snacks.
[01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:29.900]   I eat them all the time, and I really appreciate
[01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:32.180]   the fact that they are healthy.
[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:36.220]   Well, you know, Apple has a former hobby.
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:38.500]   Now they're very serious about Apple TV,
[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:41.660]   and this is an area like the sort of,
[01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:45.140]   I guess the iPad area where Google is kind of encroaching
[01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:47.420]   on the territory with lower cost alternatives
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:51.060]   that are, in many cases, found to be maybe superior
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:52.500]   by a lot of consumers.
[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.020]   So let's start with Apple TV.
[01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:58.140]   The market researcher, Parks Associates,
[01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:01.900]   is reporting that Apple is losing ground to Chromecast,
[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:05.500]   and also Roku in the first three quarters of 2014.
[01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.220]   Chromecast, of course, is very cheap.
[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:09.820]   What is it, $35 or something like that?
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:12.140]   It's a little dongle that plugs into your TV
[01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:13.980]   and just lets you stream stuff from your device.
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:15.980]   Very easy to use, very friendly.
[01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:18.580]   It's a great stocking stuffer, as I think Leo said,
[01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:20.380]   on Twit over the weekend.
[01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:21.980]   It's a very compelling offering,
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:25.940]   whereas Apple TV is kind of feeling kind of old and busted.
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:27.900]   These days, they're really not updating it,
[01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:29.980]   like people expected them to.
[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:32.100]   So let's talk about this.
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:35.860]   Andy Inako, is this an important business or isn't it
[01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:37.340]   for Apple, and what are they gonna do
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:40.060]   to sort of prevent everybody else,
[01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:42.580]   from the Googles, to the Roku's, to the Amazons,
[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:45.860]   from stealing this out from under them?
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:49.340]   I really have to conclude that Apple
[01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:51.740]   is planning not an improvement on Apple TV,
[01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:53.740]   but a reinvention of it.
[01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:56.940]   They didn't just simply, oh, we put in a better processor
[01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:58.980]   and look at the new Graphical User Interface
[01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:00.980]   and hey, look at the new channels we have.
[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:05.020]   I have to believe that there's gonna be a keynote level event
[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:07.420]   in which they talk about the new role that Apple TV
[01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:10.940]   is there to fulfill inside the house.
[01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:14.060]   Maybe even going beyond just simply streaming entertainment,
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:18.100]   but also by being a fixed location,
[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:19.940]   the ability to know that, okay,
[01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:22.860]   now the user of this iPhone is now in the living room,
[01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:26.660]   and therefore I'm gonna allow this person not to have to
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:30.620]   even use Touch ID at all to open up and unlock their phone
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:33.380]   'cause I'm gonna trust the fact that this person is,
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:36.100]   or this phone is in front of this Apple TV.
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.220]   I'm gonna let people send files to each other
[01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:39.940]   based on proximity, that sort of stuff.
[01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:41.740]   And that's just one example of stuff.
[01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:43.540]   And the reason why I have so much faith in that
[01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:46.100]   is because Apple has let this thing lie fallow
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:47.940]   for so many quarters.
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:50.860]   And at this point, there is no question about it.
[01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:54.100]   It is the worst major streaming media box you can buy.
[01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:56.740]   I mean, it is barely okay.
[01:07:56.740 --> 01:08:00.460]   I have on my TV over there in the living room,
[01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:03.340]   I've got no joke, I've got the Fire TV,
[01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:08.300]   I've got a Chromecast and I've got a Roku 3 and an Apple TV.
[01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:11.140]   And the times when I switch it over to that HDMI port
[01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:14.460]   to use the Apple TV, it is actively painful.
[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:19.460]   The user interface is really so 25-inch Sony
[01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:21.820]   Trenotron Tube TV grade.
[01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:25.660]   After like days and days of getting so much of my entertainment
[01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:28.100]   through Roku, I switch over to Apple TV and say,
[01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:28.940]   what is that thing?
[01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:32.540]   I don't recognize, oh, that's a weight cursor.
[01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:34.780]   I have never, and three days of using the Roku,
[01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:36.620]   I've never had it say, hey, you have to wait
[01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:38.980]   'cause I have to load stuff in.
[01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:43.980]   The fact that there's so many open apps for the Roku
[01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:47.540]   that I've got the Plex Media Server
[01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.540]   that connects to anything inside my house,
[01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:52.580]   I've got a media player that if I just simply take
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:56.740]   like any USB stick and just like put it right there
[01:08:56.740 --> 01:08:59.340]   into the Roku, it will play any file, any picture,
[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:00.740]   any movie that's on there.
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:03.180]   There's just no reason for me to recommend that
[01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:05.420]   to the Apple TV to anybody.
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:08.460]   And because Apple is usually very, very smart about,
[01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:09.820]   once they give up on something,
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:13.060]   they don't just simply let it sort of peter out.
[01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:15.460]   They just simply say, okay, this is canceled
[01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:17.860]   'cause we don't have any legal reason to do this,
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:19.780]   we don't have any profit reason to do this.
[01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:22.940]   Okay, maybe the iPods are kind of a contrary
[01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:23.940]   to what I'm talking about,
[01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:25.860]   but there's so much opportunity,
[01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:28.620]   given how much business they do in streaming media,
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:30.180]   given how much business they wanna do
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:31.860]   and controlling things inside your home,
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:33.740]   such a big opportunity for Apple TV.
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:37.020]   I cannot but believe that sometime in 2015,
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:38.340]   there's gonna be a huge event
[01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:39.980]   in which everybody's suddenly gonna want
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:41.100]   to have an Apple TV again
[01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:42.860]   'cause God knows no one wants one right.
[01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:45.100]   But Andy, it has that amazing game
[01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:48.140]   where you have to type words
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:50.940]   by moving the cursor.
[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:52.300]   I love it challenge.
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:54.100]   My favorite is the heightened seat game
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:56.780]   where okay, tying a little remote control,
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:58.180]   that's only this thing.
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:09:59.300]   Where are you?
[01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:00.620]   Three to one, I'm coming.
[01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:02.260]   (laughing)
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:03.740]   Maybe it works with the Apple watch.
[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:06.820]   I noticed that you need 1,000 more steps
[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:09.420]   to reach 10,000, so I'm gonna let you have to
[01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:11.060]   not just find the one Apple remote,
[01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:13.180]   I'm gonna have to find, have you find one out of three
[01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:14.220]   that's inside, oh, anyway.
[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:15.180]   It's part of health kit.
[01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:17.020]   It's just no good, it's no fun, it's no fun.
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:19.580]   So, Rani, go ahead.
[01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:22.340]   Yeah, no, I'm saying I have to agree with Andy, 100%.
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:24.220]   Especially, you're getting hits.
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.380]   This entire, the Apple TV has not been refreshed
[01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:28.780]   since January of 2013.
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:31.100]   So that's almost two full years with,
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.860]   you know, with nothing going on.
[01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:36.500]   Which says to me, and despite all of that,
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:39.500]   Tim Cook repeatedly goes,
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:41.060]   we're still interested in this.
[01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:43.260]   This is still, this is definitely more than a hobby.
[01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:45.380]   We have lots of interest in Apple TV,
[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:47.620]   and you're seeing that despite the fact
[01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:49.860]   that it hasn't been updated in nearly two years,
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:51.780]   hardware style, the software improvements
[01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:54.700]   has actually been getting it to gain market share.
[01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:57.420]   Now, granted, you do have the Chromecast and the Fire TV
[01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.900]   coming in and impinging upon that,
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:02.220]   because they're better deals at half the price.
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:03.100]   I mean, that makes sense.
[01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:05.860]   If you want, the only reason to buy an Apple TV right now
[01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:08.820]   is if you want iTunes content on your television,
[01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:10.900]   and the AirPlay, you know, the AirPlay support,
[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:15.900]   which again, Chromecast and being able to send web pages
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:19.340]   and stuff like that, that's almost, it's almost as good.
[01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:22.700]   But the fact that Tim Cook constantly reiterates,
[01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:24.660]   we are gonna, we are interested in this.
[01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:25.500]   We're gonna do it.
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:26.340]   - Two years is nothing.
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:28.980]   And look at how long we've been expecting the Apple watch.
[01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:31.180]   The watch formerly known as the iWatch,
[01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:33.140]   I mean, it's just every single announcement,
[01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:35.380]   we're like, well, this is gonna be it, and then nothing.
[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:36.280]   - Watch. - And then when they finally
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.500]   announced it, it was a big initiative
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:41.220]   that obviously sucked in a lot, tons of resources,
[01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:42.820]   and they put a lot of thought and money into it.
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:45.540]   And so yeah, it's gotta be something like that happening
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:47.020]   on the Apple TV front.
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:49.900]   But Alison, I wanna ask you about home automation.
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:52.980]   Do you think that the Apple TV or a TV box
[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:55.780]   is the right place to have a hub for home automation,
[01:11:55.780 --> 01:12:00.780]   serving up a home kit type stuff through Apple's system?
[01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:04.100]   Or is that just not a good way to do it?
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:07.940]   - I don't know that that's really a good way to do it,
[01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:09.500]   because there's a lot of people
[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:12.620]   who don't have televisions these days, right?
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:13.820]   These kids today, you know,
[01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:16.300]   with their crazy internet stuff.
[01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:18.380]   So I don't know that that's the right place for that,
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:20.100]   but I did wanna say, I mean,
[01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:21.540]   I would think that's a lot more logical
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:23.940]   to have on your mobile device, 'cause if you're upstairs,
[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:26.060]   you don't wanna have to go downstairs to the Apple TV
[01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:27.940]   to go unlock the door.
[01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:30.540]   That kind of thing doesn't really make much sense to me.
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:32.060]   But I do wanna say like Andy,
[01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:33.940]   I've got one of everything my fire TV stick
[01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:35.780]   comes December 18th.
[01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:39.420]   And what I'm finding is that I use the Apple TV a lot,
[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:41.180]   but I don't like it.
[01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:43.940]   So just like Andy's saying,
[01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:45.300]   so many of those things drive me nuts.
[01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:46.620]   My single favorite thing,
[01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:48.500]   I mean, I would buy a Roku over an Apple TV
[01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:51.780]   for one single thing alone, and that's the 32nd back.
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:54.300]   And I've noticed that one of the things it does on,
[01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:55.840]   I don't know if it's in all applications,
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:57.660]   but I'm pretty sure I saw it in Netflix
[01:12:57.660 --> 01:12:59.220]   or it might've been Amazon Prime.
[01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:03.300]   When I did 32nd back, it automatically turned on subtitles,
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:04.260]   'cause why do you back up?
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:05.740]   'Cause you didn't hear what they said.
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:07.380]   Not 'cause you didn't see usually,
[01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:08.380]   it's 'cause of what you heard.
[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:11.260]   And so I use the Roku all the time for Amazon
[01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:15.180]   and for Netflix, but I use iTunes to rent movies
[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:17.140]   and I use AirPlay all the time.
[01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:18.980]   Every time I go to use the Chromecast,
[01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:21.380]   I sit there for about a minute and a half going,
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:23.980]   where's my Chromecast remote?
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:25.380]   Oh, wait, there isn't one.
[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:26.220]   That's what it is.
[01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:28.500]   It takes every single time.
[01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:30.060]   I mean, I've never turned it on and gone,
[01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:32.140]   oh yeah, grab my phone and go do what I gotta do.
[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:35.220]   So I still think the Apple TV has a place
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:37.060]   and it's amazing that it does have a place
[01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:41.060]   considering how awful it is in so many ways.
[01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:42.940]   I did run into an interesting problem
[01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:45.140]   where for about three months straight,
[01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:47.100]   every time I went to play a movie,
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:50.900]   it would come up and say, okay, you can play it in seven hours
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:53.180]   or nine hours or six hours and it would change.
[01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:54.580]   It wouldn't be the kind of thing where it said that
[01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:56.060]   and then immediately started to play.
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:57.660]   It would literally take hours.
[01:13:57.660 --> 01:13:59.580]   And so I got in the habit of rent the movie,
[01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:00.940]   tell Apple to give me my money back.
[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:02.780]   Rent the movie, tell Apple to give me my money back.
[01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:05.500]   And I'd flip over to Amazon and the Roku and rent it over there.
[01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:08.060]   And finally, I got this crazy idea.
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:10.340]   I called up Apple.
[01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:12.380]   It's weird to think of actually asking for tech support,
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:15.340]   but I called them up and they told me this double secret
[01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:18.420]   remote control thing you can do to reset the Apple TV,
[01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:21.500]   which is different than the reset that's on screen
[01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.540]   and it's different than a full factory reset
[01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:25.380]   and it's different from unplugging it.
[01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:26.780]   It's actually, I forget what it is,
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:29.340]   like hold down the down arrow and the home button
[01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:30.860]   at the same time for five seconds.
[01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:32.940]   And the woman said, we don't know why this fixes it,
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:34.940]   but it seems to fix it for almost everybody.
[01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:36.460]   And ever since then, it's been perfect.
[01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:38.900]   I never get that weird waiting delay anymore.
[01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:39.740]   - Wow.
[01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:40.580]   - Yeah.
[01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:41.420]   - That is amazing.
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:42.980]   - I've had the same sort of bad experiences.
[01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:46.300]   I actually had to, I'm not averse to giving George
[01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:49.240]   to Kay more money because I think I should give George
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:50.700]   to Kay as much money as I can afford to give him,
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:54.100]   but I wound up having to rent his documentary twice
[01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:56.380]   because I rented it on, I rented it on,
[01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:59.980]   I made the rental on my laptop, figuring that,
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:00.980]   well, I bet that of course,
[01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:02.380]   as soon as I go into Apple TV,
[01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:04.820]   I'll be able to simply play from there, but no, no dice,
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:07.140]   but I am able to write a second copy
[01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:08.180]   from the device itself.
[01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:10.540]   I'm like, really?
[01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:13.900]   It's like, yes, I did have $8 worth of desire
[01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:15.300]   to see this movie that very night.
[01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:16.180]   So I did rent it again.
[01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:18.020]   And I know how to blood donation come up
[01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:20.620]   so I could go see the other copy.
[01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:23.700]   But it's like, it's such a non-Apple product
[01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:27.660]   in that it really is a very ordinary product.
[01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:30.260]   You have the exact same expectations you have
[01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:32.940]   with anything you spend $100 for it best by,
[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:35.180]   which is some parts of it are gonna be fine,
[01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:37.540]   most of it is going to be okay,
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:38.860]   and lots of it are gonna be okay.
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:40.540]   Well, they didn't think about that at all.
[01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:41.940]   And what an odd thing to think about,
[01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:43.300]   anything with an Apple logo on it.
[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:44.980]   - With a horrible remote.
[01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:46.140]   It's horrible. - Oh God.
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:48.660]   Well, there is a way that you can actually,
[01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:50.980]   there's actually a menu inside the setting
[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:53.380]   so that you can actually teach it your,
[01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:56.260]   whatever remote that you're using with your cable box
[01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:57.980]   so that you don't have to,
[01:15:57.980 --> 01:15:59.940]   before I found out about that,
[01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:03.940]   no joke, I actually had the little stick of gum remote
[01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:06.300]   taped to the back of my usual remote.
[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:07.300]   'Cause it was the only,
[01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:09.380]   it was like the mens room key at a gas station.
[01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:11.300]   It was the only way not to lose it.
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:14.580]   - So Andy, my trick has always just been
[01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:17.220]   setting it up on my phone and completely just getting
[01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:18.620]   rid of the tiny remote, just being like,
[01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:20.700]   nope, sorry, it's got, you know, I'll put you in a--
[01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:22.460]   - You have to enter your password.
[01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:23.460]   - Yeah. - Get it on the network.
[01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:24.780]   And then you gotta go back to the remote.
[01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:27.860]   Of course it's long and complex and annoying is all get out.
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:29.620]   - At that point, you hide the remote
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:30.860]   so that you know where it is.
[01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:32.900]   You're like, okay, you're going in the top drawer
[01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:34.340]   of my media center buddy.
[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.300]   And then I'll find you if I ever need a reset,
[01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:38.740]   but otherwise you don't get lost in the calculations.
[01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:40.580]   - That might be the last final frontier
[01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:43.300]   for certain generations where I know that,
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:45.060]   I can have a remote app on my phone.
[01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:47.180]   I also have the remote app for my cable box,
[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:48.580]   like on all my phones.
[01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:50.420]   But there is something about,
[01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:52.700]   one of the things I love about the Roku is that you have
[01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:54.740]   this big, thick remote with big, fat button
[01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:57.060]   because when I'm sitting on the sofa,
[01:16:57.060 --> 01:17:00.020]   I'm not, my mind is not in operating
[01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:03.340]   a multi-touch interface application sort of mode.
[01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:05.620]   It is, see where my thumb is?
[01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:07.780]   That is the button that starts the entertainment
[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:09.380]   and pauses the entertainment.
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:10.940]   And if I want to-- - It's too good.
[01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:13.060]   - And if I want to stop watching this entertainment
[01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:14.660]   and pick out another entertainment,
[01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:16.540]   I simply move my thumb up and like this
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:18.780]   when I feel a button underneath, I press that
[01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:23.780]   as opposed to, now let's see, now, okay, so this swipe,
[01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:24.660]   there we go.
[01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:27.380]   And I don't, I want to be able to do things by feel,
[01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:29.740]   which is why, another reason why I think
[01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:31.140]   that the Roku is so well thought out,
[01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:35.660]   it's a big TV watchers remote as opposed to a,
[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:39.620]   we figured a different way of processing aluminium
[01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:43.140]   and bonding it to electronics to make the lowest profile
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:44.860]   remote that's ever been made.
[01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:48.220]   We think it's the greatest remote you can buy today.
[01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:49.620]   - So I know where your remote is.
[01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:51.220]   - And they're not even in my sofa.
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:52.540]   - I know where your remote is, Andy,
[01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:55.220]   because my daughter lost her Apple TV remote
[01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:56.980]   and we suspected that maybe she got it stuck
[01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:59.260]   in her cross-ditch bag and it fell out at my house.
[01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:00.860]   So I looked around and I found I had two,
[01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:02.700]   so I gave it back to her, but then she found hers.
[01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:04.260]   So we're up one right now.
[01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:05.300]   (laughing)
[01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:06.900]   - They're like socks.
[01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:09.300]   Well, I think we can all agree that the Apple TV
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:12.540]   is the least Apple-esque product that Apple makes.
[01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:14.900]   Let's talk about the most Apple-esque product
[01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:17.220]   that Apple makes, which is the iPad,
[01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:19.980]   which is getting trounced in the education market
[01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:22.700]   by the Chromebook, by Google's Chromebook,
[01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:23.780]   according to IDC.
[01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:27.060]   IDC says that for the first time ever,
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:30.140]   Google has overtaken Apple in American schools.
[01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:33.820]   They say that Google shipped 715,000 Chromebooks
[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:35.140]   to schools in the third quarter,
[01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:39.620]   while Apple shipped only 702,000 iPads to schools.
[01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:42.740]   And Chromebooks now as a whole account
[01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:46.940]   for a quarter of the educational market overall.
[01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:50.980]   This sort of is in line with my own thinking
[01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:52.540]   about what's best for education.
[01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:53.980]   I happen to think that the Chromebook
[01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:57.020]   is a fantastic device for the schools
[01:18:57.020 --> 01:18:58.660]   and the iPad not so much, in part,
[01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:00.380]   because it's so expensive.
[01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:02.420]   What do you think about that, Andy?
[01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:04.820]   - I agree completely.
[01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:07.900]   Because it's, these things are dead simple,
[01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:08.900]   they're dead cheap.
[01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:11.020]   I recommend them all the time to lots and lots of people,
[01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:12.220]   just over Thanksgiving.
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:14.140]   Someone's asked me, "Jim, think about buying a notebook
[01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:17.380]   for this person, and I've got a budget of X dollars."
[01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:18.900]   And they had $500 to spend,
[01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:20.460]   what they thought was gonna be,
[01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:22.780]   obviously the best thing is gonna be to buy a cheap
[01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:23.620]   Windows notebook.
[01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:25.860]   And I said, "I gave them, well, here we want
[01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:27.780]   "or two ideas that are good at that price point,
[01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:31.460]   "but think about $200 for an Acer Chromebook
[01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:33.700]   "and then give them an iPad as well.
[01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:35.180]   "They might even like that combination,
[01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:36.620]   "might get more use out of it."
[01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:37.980]   And the other things that we're talking,
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:40.620]   so if you're selling something that costs $200
[01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:43.140]   and they're high quality things, they're not junk,
[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:45.140]   the keyboards are as, I will say,
[01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:47.700]   it's gonna sound like I'm trying to be snide here,
[01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:50.340]   but I absolutely tell you that the keyboard
[01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:53.340]   on a $200 Acer Chromebook is as good as the keyboard
[01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:55.980]   on my MacBook Pro that I bought just last year
[01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:58.900]   because the keyboard on the MacBook Pro is not very good.
[01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:02.740]   They're so much cheaper, but also they remove the problem.
[01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:04.860]   Since they don't run really anything,
[01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:06.780]   they're really easy to administrate.
[01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:08.300]   It's hard for someone to get in trouble
[01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:09.420]   using one of those.
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:12.980]   And also they don't have the steel ability of an iPad.
[01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:15.340]   You don't feel like you're putting kids' lives in danger
[01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:17.940]   by making sure, by broadcasting the entire world,
[01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:21.740]   that there are 300 children that are much smaller
[01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:23.620]   and can't run as fast as you,
[01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:27.420]   that are carrying around a $500 thing in their backpacks.
[01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:31.740]   So yeah, I mean, it's, if Apple made a better statement
[01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:35.220]   about how their software is going to be much, much better
[01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:37.780]   at what schools need in a Chromebook,
[01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:40.420]   maybe they would not be doing quite so poorly,
[01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:42.100]   but they have not made that case.
[01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:44.020]   It was the last time they even talked about iBooks Author
[01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:48.460]   about making even high school textbooks available on iPad.
[01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:50.460]   So I don't, I think that maybe this is another thing
[01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:53.460]   where Apple is interested, but maybe they're not,
[01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:55.860]   they didn't see that quick Vana Gold
[01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:57.700]   and they don't like the numbers that are coming in
[01:20:57.700 --> 01:20:58.940]   and they're just going to wait and see
[01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:00.180]   how well this can do in the future.
[01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:01.260]   I don't know.
[01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:03.420]   - Absolutely. - They're just juggling too much.
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:04.700]   - Yeah. - You know, they're just,
[01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:06.300]   they're just trying to juggle too much.
[01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:08.500]   iBooks Author is a great piece of software
[01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:10.420]   that's now a year out of date and granted,
[01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:13.420]   they'd made some really, really wonderful
[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:16.100]   under the hood improvements when Yosemite came out,
[01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:18.460]   but overall, like Apple basically said,
[01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:20.420]   "Hey, we're really interested in education.
[01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:22.580]   "We've always been really interested in education.
[01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:25.620]   "Now put that on pause while we work on the Apple Watch
[01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:29.780]   "and the Apple TV and the new iPhone and the new, yeah,
[01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:32.300]   "we'll get back to you eventually, right?"
[01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:33.140]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:34.140]   - And no, it's,
[01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:37.740]   - I was gonna say, I think the administrative costs,
[01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:40.540]   just by itself is what this really should be.
[01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:45.540]   If I were in administering a group of machines for a school,
[01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:49.180]   I'd be hard pressed to not go with Chromebooks.
[01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:52.460]   We've talked before about how Apple had the great deal
[01:21:52.460 --> 01:21:54.820]   with the LA school district on the iPads
[01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:58.940]   and it fell through because the minute the student got them,
[01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:01.060]   they just figured out how to get around all the restrictions
[01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:03.940]   and personally, I would have taken that group of students
[01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:06.100]   and said, "Okay, we're gonna put you in computer science class
[01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:09.140]   "right now and encourage that behavior instead of punishing them."
[01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:11.940]   But when you think about dealing with the administrative costs,
[01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:14.060]   in fact, that's one of the reasons we've always pushed max
[01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:16.740]   over PCs, even when PCs were cheaper,
[01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:19.980]   you just spend so much less time screwing around with the updates
[01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:22.060]   and all that kind of stuff on the max side and viruses
[01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:23.580]   and all that nonsense.
[01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:26.580]   Now you've got the Chromebook where that's a really tough sell
[01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:29.420]   'cause you don't have to hardly administer those at all.
[01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:32.420]   And so if you've got reasonably good hardware,
[01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:34.660]   I think that's a great point.
[01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:38.780]   - Another person, shoot, I lost it here in the live chat room.
[01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:42.020]   Somebody pointed out, does anybody steal Chromebooks?
[01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:44.660]   - It's never happened, ever, in the history of mankind.
[01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:45.620]   (laughing)
[01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:49.780]   Except a Chromebook pixel, I might even steal Chromebook pixel,
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:51.820]   but the regular ones, no, never happened.
[01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:53.140]   - Sure, that might be a consideration too.
[01:22:53.140 --> 01:22:55.260]   - They're like stealing paper napkins at McDonald's.
[01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:56.740]   - Yeah. - Okay, maybe you can,
[01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:58.340]   but why would you and why would you admit it?
[01:22:58.340 --> 01:22:59.260]   - And who would report it?
[01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:00.620]   - Well, the resale value, right?
[01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:02.220]   - The resale value is not great.
[01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:03.540]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:05.020]   Well, we're gonna take a break,
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:07.460]   and when we come back, we're gonna have PIX Galore.
[01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:09.540]   We're all gonna have PIX, Alison,
[01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:12.020]   you're gonna have a PIX of the week for us as well.
[01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:13.660]   - I will pull something out.
[01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:14.540]   - Okay, great.
[01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:15.380]   - See what we can do.
[01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:17.780]   - You work on that, I will work on the break.
[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:19.740]   I wanna tell you about personal capital.
[01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:24.940]   Andy was showing off and waving around his fancy Moto 360 watch.
[01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:28.020]   Personal capital is a service
[01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:29.900]   that will help you get your financial life in order.
[01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:33.260]   They were one of the very first apps on Android Wear.
[01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:36.260]   That's right, I think it was a week into Android Wear,
[01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:38.940]   and I was getting a buzzing feeling on my wrist
[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:42.020]   wearing my, I think it was an LG G-Watch at the time.
[01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:43.860]   And it was telling me that I had,
[01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:48.740]   that I was about to incur a $35 fee from my bank,
[01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:51.380]   and this is an alert that I didn't see on my phone,
[01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:52.540]   I didn't see it on my desktop,
[01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:54.660]   I didn't go to the website, I felt it on my wrist,
[01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:56.060]   I looked down, I took action,
[01:23:56.060 --> 01:23:57.620]   and I say to myself, $35.
[01:23:57.620 --> 01:23:59.580]   Wham, personal capital is free,
[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:01.460]   and I already saved $35.
[01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:03.700]   This is what a fantastic service this is,
[01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:05.300]   the basic way that you use personal capital,
[01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:07.860]   usually you're not gonna use it mainly through the watch.
[01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:09.340]   You're mostly gonna use it online,
[01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:11.460]   what they do is you plug in all your different
[01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:13.500]   financial accounts, your bank accounts,
[01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:16.540]   your investments, your 401K, all that kind of stuff,
[01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:17.980]   and then it brings all that information
[01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:20.580]   and shows you in charts and graphs,
[01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:23.020]   in an intuitive, easy to understand way,
[01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:25.500]   what the heck is happening with your money.
[01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:28.380]   And when you can see that sort of 10,000 foot view
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:29.500]   of what's happening with your money,
[01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:31.140]   you can make better decisions.
[01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:33.900]   It'll alert you and prevent you from wasting money
[01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:36.740]   on unnecessary fees and fines.
[01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:38.940]   It's just a fantastic way to get your financial life
[01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:42.060]   in order, and I think most of us just have vague ideas
[01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:43.620]   about what's happening with our money,
[01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:44.620]   and it's not good enough.
[01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:47.060]   You have to have a specific, clear understanding
[01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:48.860]   of where it's going, what's happening,
[01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:50.980]   where the danger spots, how you can make changes
[01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:53.580]   and adjustments so that you lose less money
[01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:55.660]   and make more money, save more money,
[01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:57.340]   and basically get control of your money
[01:24:57.340 --> 01:24:59.140]   because eventually you're gonna want
[01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:00.900]   to have as much money as you possibly can,
[01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:04.100]   you don't want to waste it on unnecessary stuff
[01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:07.620]   that goes on within the financial services world.
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:10.780]   So just take a minute, it pays big dividends,
[01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:13.620]   personal capital gives you total clarity and transparency.
[01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:16.380]   And again, the thing is that you can make better decisions,
[01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:18.460]   better investment decisions, better decisions
[01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:21.140]   about the fees you're paying, better decisions
[01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:23.740]   about how much to spend just all across the board,
[01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:25.460]   better decisions, and that's the right way
[01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:27.780]   to get your financial house in order.

[01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:39.500]   for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:43.380]   Andy and Otko, do you have a pick of the week?
[01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:46.060]   Yes, I do, let's see if I can get Creme Cam 3000,
[01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:48.100]   the future video podcasting set up for you.
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:51.860]   I've been talking a lot about really good folding pocket
[01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:55.900]   keyboards, 'cause ever since the iPhone 6 Plus came out
[01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:58.460]   that's really nice big screen, you kinda want to be able
[01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:01.300]   to blast through emails or even just like actual
[01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:02.820]   right full things with it.
[01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:06.140]   And one of my picks a few weeks ago was one of my first
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:09.260]   nice discoveries, which was the iWorks keyboard,
[01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:13.260]   a W-E-R-K-Z, which folds out nicely.
[01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:16.540]   It has this big, big kinda ugly gap, but I found that
[01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:18.940]   you can actually sort of make your way,
[01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:21.900]   you get used to it after your first like 100 words
[01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:25.740]   or whatever with it, and it has this nice little actual
[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:28.260]   case that doubles as a phone stand.
[01:26:28.260 --> 01:26:31.300]   But I since then have found something that's even better,
[01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:33.620]   even though it's about twice as much,
[01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:37.980]   this is the fly shark folding keyboard.
[01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:42.620]   It is almost twice as much, which is sounds bad
[01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:44.620]   to realize that this costs $30.
[01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:46.820]   This is also a folding Bluetooth keyboard and it sells
[01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:48.940]   on Amazon for 50.
[01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:52.500]   And the reason why I like it so much, already too much
[01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:55.580]   clutter on this desk, sorry about this, is that you flip
[01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:59.140]   it open and here's what you get.
[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:01.860]   And what I'm calling your attention to is that what
[01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:06.500]   you don't get is that really big gap between these two halves
[01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:07.580]   of the folding keyboard.
[01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:10.300]   You also get a space bar that is, you can basically put
[01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:12.180]   your thumbs wherever you want.
[01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:17.260]   I also like the fact that, like the iWorks, it also has
[01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:20.540]   mechanical switches on the side so that the battery will not
[01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:24.620]   run down until you actually turn it on, turn it off,
[01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:27.420]   the battery won't run down inside your bag.
[01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:29.540]   And it's very, very comfortable to type with.
[01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:33.300]   The only disadvantage of it is that the numbers, as you can
[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:35.660]   see, are accessible by a function key.
[01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:39.420]   So, whereas the $30 one actually has its own little row
[01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:43.540]   of numbers here, this one, you actually, to get numbers,
[01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:45.500]   you have to hold on a function key in order to get that
[01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:46.300]   working.
[01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:51.020]   But all in all, I actually find it fast, a lot faster to
[01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:54.260]   type on this than on this because, I don't know if you
[01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:58.100]   can actually see this, but there is actually, some of these
[01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:00.820]   keys actually overlap over the hinge, like look at the
[01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:02.060]   H key right there.
[01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:04.820]   So, as a result, when it's lying flat like that, you get
[01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:07.940]   something that's almost identical to the feel of a real
[01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:08.740]   keyboard.
[01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:14.100]   And it is almost the same size and layout, if I can do this
[01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:16.620]   without spilling all over the place.
[01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:21.900]   Almost the exact same size as my MacBook Pro keyboard here.
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:23.260]   Pardon the crumbs and the mess.
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:25.420]   It's been a long, long holiday.
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:28.900]   And so, I think that this is the one that I'm going to wind up
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:31.100]   with as my final recommendation.
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:35.660]   It's not perfect, but no pocketable foldable keyboard is
[01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:39.620]   going to be as good as like an Apple wireless keyboard.
[01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:42.460]   And it does get me right to the solution that I want to get
[01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:46.380]   to, which is the ability to simply travel for the day with
[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:50.260]   just this inside my pocket and realize this is the iPhone
[01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:51.260]   6 Plus.
[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:55.060]   You put even an iPhone 6, it really takes up no extra space
[01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:55.980]   in your pocket.
[01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:59.340]   And I feel as though if I have that extra unexpected hour
[01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:02.700]   and a half, two hours, if I miss my train, I can actually
[01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:04.820]   set up on a table and I feel as though I can get an hour's
[01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:07.220]   worth of actual typing and actual work done with it.
[01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:08.820]   So, it's $50.
[01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:14.740]   The only, a lot of people might require a recommendation
[01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:19.220]   from somebody on to, before they would trust this.
[01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:21.940]   Come on, Crane Cam 3000.
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:25.300]   Because the only place I can find to buy it is Amazon.
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:29.500]   And it has that sort of imported from China and it might or
[01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:33.460]   might not work, marketing lingo, where it is best freshest
[01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:41.780]   blue tooth key type for great with iPhone, iPad, Nexus phone.
[01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:43.660]   But trust me, it really is the works.
[01:29:43.660 --> 01:29:46.500]   It started off as a Kickstarter as a matter of fact, which is
[01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:47.900]   how my attention got called to it.
[01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:50.700]   But now it's an actual shipping product.
[01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:54.140]   And for $50, I mean, there's the only keyboard I've found
[01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:58.100]   that's better is this one from Lapworks, which folds out
[01:29:58.100 --> 01:29:58.580]   twice.
[01:29:58.580 --> 01:30:03.380]   It's based on the old handspring keyboard that folds in and
[01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:04.500]   folds in like that.
[01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:06.060]   It's very, very good.
[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:09.380]   But the problem is that the only really trustworthy place
[01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:11.660]   to get it, I mean, it's good enough that I would actually
[01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:14.980]   recommend it, is Lapworks and they charge $140 for it.
[01:30:14.980 --> 01:30:17.860]   So for $140, you really have to be certain that you're
[01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:19.420]   going to get a lot of use out of this.
[01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:21.580]   For $50, it makes a good present.
[01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:24.700]   It makes a good, oh, I may as well just buy this just in case
[01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:27.660]   and put it inside your handbag and just keep it in there.
[01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:28.860]   Really, really a nice, really nice.
[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:29.860]   Excuse me.
[01:30:29.860 --> 01:30:31.060]   It is one that you are recommending.
[01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:32.460]   What is the name of it one more time?
[01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:34.140]   It's called the Fly Shark.
[01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:36.780]   The name, the company is Fly Shark.
[01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:38.500]   They call it the I-lepo.
[01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:40.780]   I don't know why they call it I-lepo.
[01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:43.580]   It's the seventh Mark's Brothers, I know.
[01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:47.460]   And if you look for either of those two names, you will only
[01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:49.140]   find references to the Kickstarter.
[01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:52.660]   You will not find a store page or a product page.
[01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:56.540]   The only place I can find that actually has it is Amazon.
[01:30:56.540 --> 01:30:58.940]   The only other thing that could say that be prepared about it
[01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:01.900]   is that like a lot of these other folding keyboards,
[01:31:01.900 --> 01:31:02.820]   it really works.
[01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:06.540]   It's a lot more stable if you have your screen cleaning cloth
[01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:09.140]   or a handkerchief and you put that underneath it.
[01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:10.580]   Because otherwise, the bottom, these
[01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:13.540]   are supposed to be rubberized, like anti-skid things.
[01:31:13.540 --> 01:31:16.180]   But they're not quite grabby enough.
[01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:18.620]   So it's possible when you're typing for it to just slide around
[01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:19.220]   a little bit.
[01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:21.260]   But if you put like any sort of--
[01:31:21.260 --> 01:31:23.820]   Oh, does it fold up?
[01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:27.220]   Your lap is daintier than I than mine.
[01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:29.860]   It's not lappable by any means.
[01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:32.700]   You do need to have on top of a hard stable surface
[01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:33.820]   in order to make it work.
[01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:35.980]   But if you put it on top of any sort of cloth,
[01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:38.220]   I find that that stops it from skidding around.
[01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:39.060]   That's the only hassle.
[01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:40.660]   And it's winter time.
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:42.180]   You should have a handkerchief with you anyway.
[01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:44.260]   So that's not a bad thing.
[01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:44.780]   Wonderful.
[01:31:44.780 --> 01:31:48.900]   The fly shark, Eyelepo, I guess the brand name Eyelepur,
[01:31:48.900 --> 01:31:49.660]   was taken.
[01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:51.820]   So they went with Eyelepo.
[01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:52.380]   What are you going to do?
[01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:54.740]   Serenity Caldwell, what do you have for us?
[01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:55.100]   All right.
[01:31:55.100 --> 01:31:57.100]   My pick of the week is an app.
[01:31:57.100 --> 01:32:00.420]   And I blame Jason Snell entirely for this.
[01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:02.020]   Over Thanksgiving, he was talking about--
[01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:03.420]   Usually safety do so.
[01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:04.180]   It's true.
[01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:04.820]   It's true.
[01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:07.700]   I blame him for a lot of things in my life.
[01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:11.820]   He was talking about an app that had captivated him
[01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:15.260]   during the Thanksgiving weekend called Crossy Road, which
[01:32:15.260 --> 01:32:17.100]   is very similar to--
[01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:18.260]   I know this game.
[01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:19.260]   Yeah.
[01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:21.540]   It's like Flappy Bird meets Frogger
[01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:23.620]   is how I've heard it described.
[01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:26.900]   It's very well designed.
[01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:30.940]   The sort of 3D blocky graphics are really delightful.
[01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:34.740]   It is an infuriating game, an absolutely infuriatingly
[01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:38.700]   delightful game that I played way too much of this Thanksgiving
[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:40.900]   when I had Floridian Sun to sit out.
[01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:44.860]   Instead, I was inside trying to beat this silly, silly game,
[01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:46.620]   which you can't beat it because, of course,
[01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:51.340]   it's a never-ending series of cars and trains and leap
[01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:53.580]   frogs that you have to dance around.
[01:32:53.580 --> 01:32:56.580]   And although it does have some little in-app purchase gimmicks
[01:32:56.580 --> 01:32:59.900]   that are kind of silly, I just really enjoyed playing this.
[01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:03.300]   I had a seven-year-old hanging out who saw me playing it.
[01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:06.020]   It was like, oh, it's the chicken game.
[01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:07.660]   Can I play the chicken game?
[01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:08.940]   Oh, you shouldn't press on that.
[01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:09.940]   That's bad.
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:13.220]   Oh, if you do-- he got so into it with me.
[01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:17.660]   So it was a really good way to bond over vacation
[01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:21.780]   with a seven-year-old and a way to escape actually going
[01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:22.620]   outdoors.
[01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:24.220]   I thought it was a lot of fun.
[01:33:24.220 --> 01:33:26.020]   I definitely recommend everybody play it.
[01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:28.300]   It's just silly.
[01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:28.820]   It's silly.
[01:33:28.820 --> 01:33:29.700]   It's a good time.
[01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:32.580]   And it's really like-- it's more addicting than you think
[01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:35.180]   about hanging out and just--
[01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:37.540]   who's playing that right now or is it just a video?
[01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:41.340]   Because I'm now slightly captivated watching this.
[01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:43.340]   Just a video.
[01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:45.540]   Just as I look at these games--
[01:33:45.540 --> 01:33:47.860]   even if there were just a screen saver,
[01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:50.100]   I would spend $5 just to have that as a screen saver.
[01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:52.100]   It's a really beautiful piece of art.
[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:53.180]   It really is.
[01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:54.700]   Yeah, very, very cool.
[01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:56.380]   All right, well, that looks fun.
[01:33:56.380 --> 01:33:57.220]   That looks really fun.
[01:33:57.220 --> 01:33:58.180]   I want to try that.
[01:33:58.180 --> 01:34:00.220]   Alison, what do you have for us?
[01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:03.100]   Well, unfortunately, I don't have a Chromecast 3000,
[01:34:03.100 --> 01:34:05.020]   the future of video podcasting.
[01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:06.820]   But I will try to show off.
[01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:08.700]   I'm going to go very old school here.
[01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:10.300]   I'm going to show off a book.
[01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:12.260]   George from Tulsa, one of the listeners of my show,
[01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:16.220]   sent me this for my 500th episode.
[01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:17.380]   It's called Iconic.
[01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:20.220]   It's a photographic tribute to Apple Innovation.
[01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:22.780]   It's a giant hardcover coffee table book,
[01:34:22.780 --> 01:34:24.620]   and it is just beautiful.
[01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:27.300]   It's got an introduction by Jim Darrow-Rumpel
[01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:29.620]   and won by Steve Wozniak.
[01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:31.820]   And it doesn't do what you would think it would do.
[01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:34.740]   It doesn't go chronologically through everything Apple ever
[01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:35.060]   did.
[01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:39.140]   Instead, it's got sections for things like peripherals.
[01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:43.260]   And so it's got a lot of the cool old school stuff.
[01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:43.740]   Let's see.
[01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:45.340]   I bookmarked a couple of pages that
[01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:46.900]   look kind of cool in here.
[01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:49.660]   And they're just beautiful photographs
[01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:52.460]   and little tiny short explanations
[01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:54.580]   of what they're showing you.
[01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:58.140]   And when things were introduced, the very last page of it
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:34:59.780]   has a picture--
[01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:03.020]   I'm going to bring this up here is kind of pointed.
[01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:06.540]   It's got a picture of Steve Jobs glasses at the--
[01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:08.140]   oh, that's bright on that camera.
[01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:10.540]   But anyway, you can believe me, it's his glasses.
[01:35:10.540 --> 01:35:11.740]   It is beautiful.
[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:12.300]   It's thick.
[01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:13.340]   It's heavy.
[01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:18.260]   It's just yummy coffee table-ness for that sort of thing.
[01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:21.900]   It runs $62 on Amazon right now.
[01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:23.500]   And again, it's called Iconic.
[01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:26.020]   And I probably should remember who did it.
[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:27.260]   But it's just beautiful.
[01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:29.060]   I'm really, really digging this.
[01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:30.260]   I just got it a couple hours.
[01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:32.220]   Jonathan Zoufi is the guy's name.
[01:35:32.220 --> 01:35:32.720]   Cool.
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:33.580]   Just wonderful.
[01:35:33.580 --> 01:35:34.260]   Yeah.
[01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:36.180]   That looks very, very cool.
[01:35:36.180 --> 01:35:37.380]   Can't wait to see that.
[01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:41.460]   Well, my pick of the week is an application called typed.
[01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:44.540]   I hope you guys didn't cover this on a previous show.
[01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:45.140]   It's called typed.
[01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:46.940]   And basically, it's a word processor.
[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:48.620]   It's a minimalist word processor.
[01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:50.500]   We've all seen them, the kind of thing
[01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:52.460]   where you want to type, you just want to write.
[01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:54.460]   And it takes over the screen and blocks out
[01:35:54.460 --> 01:35:57.580]   all the sort of clutter and that sort of thing.
[01:35:57.580 --> 01:36:01.980]   The problem with most of those types of word processors
[01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:03.900]   is that they're too minimalist.
[01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:07.260]   They clear out the distractions, but they also
[01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:08.820]   clear out the tools that you need.
[01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:11.380]   And they also don't produce the kinds of documents you want.
[01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:13.060]   One of the great things about typed
[01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:15.860]   is that it's a markdown editor.
[01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:19.260]   So it'll generate web friendly HTML versions
[01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:22.180]   of your documents if you want to, if you want them, which
[01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:22.980]   is really useful.
[01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:25.660]   I think most of us write for the web.
[01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:26.620]   I certainly do.
[01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:28.380]   And if you're going to do anything that's
[01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:30.820]   going to have any markup in it, it's nice if that is automated.
[01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:33.940]   You don't have to sit there and type that out.
[01:36:33.940 --> 01:36:37.500]   It also has a Zen mode, which will basically
[01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:41.620]   get rid of all the controls and play like new AG kind of music
[01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:43.580]   in the background, sort of ambient music.
[01:36:43.580 --> 01:36:45.300]   That's a little cheesy.
[01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:47.540]   They have another thing called responsive layout,
[01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:49.700]   which basically it'll resize itself automatically
[01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:53.340]   to whatever size you want to use it in.
[01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:57.540]   Now, the good news is that it's a really great functional word
[01:36:57.540 --> 01:36:59.780]   processing document that helps you write because it clears
[01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:02.820]   your mind and helps you focus on your words
[01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:05.460]   instead of the tools, instead of the environment.
[01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:07.060]   And that's, again, the good news.
[01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:09.540]   The bad news is available only for the Mac.
[01:37:09.540 --> 01:37:11.420]   And it cost $19.99.
[01:37:11.420 --> 01:37:13.340]   They don't have a freemium model.
[01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:16.060]   They don't have a free version, which I think is a mistake.
[01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:16.940]   They should have one.
[01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:17.740]   So you can try it out.
[01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:19.980]   People are very particular about their writing tools.
[01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:24.060]   And $20 isn't-- that's real money.
[01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:26.380]   And so it'd be nice to have a free version you could try
[01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:29.300]   for a trial period or upgrade for more features or whatever.
[01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:32.020]   But no, you have to pay the money in order to try it.
[01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:36.540]   But having said that, it's a very, very nice editor.
[01:37:36.540 --> 01:37:39.380]   And it's just a fantastic way to write.
[01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:43.580]   And I know that those of you who write the biggest barrier,
[01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:45.140]   I think, for most of us in writing
[01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:48.140]   is the fact that there are distractions everywhere.
[01:37:48.140 --> 01:37:48.620]   And so--
[01:37:48.620 --> 01:37:51.060]   Have you seen Focus Writer, Mike?
[01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:52.060]   I have.
[01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:55.580]   I think it's open source, but it's Windows and Mac
[01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:56.820]   and Linux, I think.
[01:37:56.820 --> 01:37:57.620]   I think it's on all three.
[01:37:57.620 --> 01:37:59.500]   It's at least on two of the three of those.
[01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:02.220]   And it has sort of the same kind of thing with the themes
[01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:04.700]   and really definitely does help you focus.
[01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:06.980]   But I'm always just flipping away from it anyway,
[01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:08.260]   because I want to do something else.
[01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:08.700]   Yeah.
[01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:10.860]   Well, I'm a big fan of that genre.
[01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:12.140]   Sometimes I just want to--
[01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:14.340]   and that's one of the reasons why I often use my iPad
[01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:17.740]   for writing, because it's more clutter free.
[01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:21.340]   But if you've got to use a MacBook Pro with Retina,
[01:38:21.340 --> 01:38:24.060]   this is the way to get that iPad experience of minimalism
[01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:25.380]   and nothing else going on.
[01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:27.740]   So you can focus and concentrate.
[01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:30.660]   Well, that is, ladies and gentlemen, Mac Break Weekly.
[01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:33.140]   I want to thank you, Andy and not co-serenity Caldwell,
[01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:35.860]   Alison Sheridan, and thank you, Jason Howell.
[01:38:35.860 --> 01:38:38.100]   Thanks to all of you, viewers and listeners,
[01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:43.260]   the Mac Break Weekly audience, the hordes of ravenous Apple
[01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:45.900]   fans out there who watch this show every single week.
[01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:48.220]   And I'm one of you.
[01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:49.140]   I enjoy this show.
[01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:50.900]   And it's nice to be able to talk back to these people
[01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:53.980]   for a change rather than just listening.
[01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:55.380]   So this has been a thrill for me.
[01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:59.260]   And I appreciate Leo Leo's kite surfing or something today.
[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:03.620]   And so it's great to be able to step in and take his place
[01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:05.340]   for one day, at least.
[01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:08.700]   Andy and not co-Chicago Sun Times technology columnist,
[01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:10.980]   thank you so much for joining us.
[01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:13.060]   And what's been going on?
[01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:14.900]   What are you looking forward to this month
[01:39:14.900 --> 01:39:17.300]   and over the holidays?
[01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:20.020]   Basically, a lot of deep soak reviews
[01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:21.860]   are coming out in the next few weeks,
[01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:25.420]   starting with finally my iPad Air 2 review, as usual.
[01:39:25.420 --> 01:39:28.580]   The Ken Burns effect to apply to review, which is,
[01:39:28.580 --> 01:39:29.860]   let's have the slow pull in.
[01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:32.700]   Let's talk-- let's read letters from colonists
[01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:35.500]   before we talk about what the CPU clock speed is.
[01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:37.780]   And also, of course, the obligatory holiday gift
[01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:39.340]   guys are coming out this week.
[01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:40.140]   Wonderful.
[01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:42.500]   And serenity Caldwell, thank you so much for joining us
[01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:42.900]   as well.
[01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:46.180]   You're a panelist on the incomparable podcast.
[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:50.780]   And you are the manager of editors over--
[01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:52.500]   What manager of editors?
[01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:55.820]   I'm joined by Peter Cohen, who is the manager of Mac editors.
[01:39:55.820 --> 01:39:57.100]   I see.
[01:39:57.100 --> 01:39:57.460]   I see.
[01:39:57.460 --> 01:39:59.180]   And what are you guys working on this month?
[01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:02.140]   Oh, we're working on tons of really exciting stuff.
[01:40:02.140 --> 01:40:05.020]   We're revamping a little bit about how we do content.
[01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:08.340]   So look for a lot more stuff on apps, including stuff
[01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:10.500]   by yours truly to come out soon.
[01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:12.820]   We've got a ton of gift guide stuff that's already up
[01:40:12.820 --> 01:40:14.900]   that we launched over Black Friday.
[01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:19.580]   And I hear rumors that we might be doing e-books.
[01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:22.180]   That's an interesting rumor you heard of here first.
[01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:24.260]   You need to have some sort of an expert on staff who
[01:40:24.260 --> 01:40:25.300]   knows e-books.
[01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:27.060]   It's a fool's game you're getting into.
[01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:28.060]   Oh, thanks.
[01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:29.420]   Wait a minute.
[01:40:29.420 --> 01:40:31.420]   It's one of the greatest experts in--
[01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:33.580]   OK.
[01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:35.780]   Don't give away my secret identity, Andy.
[01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:38.220]   Does that mean that now I can't hit you up for a free advice
[01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:39.580]   on putting together my own e-books?
[01:40:39.580 --> 01:40:40.700]   That's fine.
[01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:41.940]   I should have been paying you anyway.
[01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:44.340]   That's all right.
[01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:46.300]   And I will still give you the giant top-letter on box
[01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:48.860]   that I was going to give you her Christmas.
[01:40:48.860 --> 01:40:50.620]   Merry Christmas to you.
[01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:51.660]   It's only December 2nd.
[01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:52.180]   Come on.
[01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:53.500]   Merry Christmas.
[01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:56.620]   Allison Sheridan is at the Nozela Mack Podcast.
[01:40:56.620 --> 01:40:58.700]   Thank you so much for jumping in.
[01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:00.660]   We pulled you in at the last second.
[01:41:00.660 --> 01:41:03.540]   I really appreciate you coming on the show and sharing with us.
[01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:07.380]   What else is going on with you besides the Nozela Mack podcast?
[01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:10.060]   It's actually Nozela Cast Mack podcast.
[01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:12.580]   I managed to work it in twice, but I'm going to do it a third time.
[01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:16.020]   This week will be gratuitous excitement about having
[01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:17.660]   done 500 shows.
[01:41:17.660 --> 01:41:20.900]   My one strength is that I come out with the show absolutely
[01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:22.420]   every Sunday night.
[01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:25.380]   If I'm ever going to be late, I'll make sure the previous ones
[01:41:25.380 --> 01:41:27.900]   early, that kind of thing to make it all wash out.
[01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:30.060]   Been going nine and a half years, and it's kind of just
[01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:34.940]   going to be a big old gratuitous, yay party this coming Sunday.
[01:41:34.940 --> 01:41:37.780]   But in general, the show is, like I said, a Mac bias.
[01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:39.780]   But we do stuff on accessibility.
[01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:41.900]   I'm really interested in tools for the blind.
[01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:43.220]   We do--
[01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:46.500]   I've done reviews of things like the Nokia 635 Windows
[01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:48.500]   phone that I actually really kind of liked.
[01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:49.860]   I don't know if I'm allowed to say it on the show.
[01:41:49.860 --> 01:41:53.340]   But it's a lot of fun, and it is a tech show,
[01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:56.020]   but it is very, very Mac biased for sure.
[01:41:56.020 --> 01:41:56.540]   Wonderful.
[01:41:56.540 --> 01:41:59.740]   Well, thank you again for coming in on short notice.
[01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:01.100]   Really appreciate it.
[01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:02.140]   Great to see you.
[01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:03.700]   The chat room loves you.
[01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:07.180]   I'm fun to finally get to talk to you directly and to serenity.
[01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:08.460]   I'd never met serenity before.
[01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:09.660]   So hi, serenity.
[01:42:09.660 --> 01:42:11.180]   Hi, Allison.
[01:42:11.180 --> 01:42:13.260]   And of course, everybody's met Andy.
[01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:13.660]   All right.
[01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:15.940]   Well, we do Mac break weekly at 11 AM Pacific
[01:42:15.940 --> 01:42:19.940]   2 PM Eastern 1800 UTC every single Tuesday,

[01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:30.860]   So get to work.
[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:32.740]   Break time is over.
