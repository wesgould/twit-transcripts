[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.120]   I can't pull that off.

[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:54.720]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 694 for New Year's Eve,
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.320]   Tuesday, December 31st, 2019.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.000]   The year's best.

[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.520]   So we're going to do this everybody in chronological order.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.720]   This goes back to earlier in the year, the spring time.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.880]   When Apple released News Plus.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.360]   So I subscribed to the New Yorker app.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.560]   The experience in the New Yorker app is very different
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.800]   if you compare that to this experience of the New Yorker
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.960]   on Apple's News Plus.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.000]   You'll get the same New Yorker typeface, which is nice.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.040]   If you open the magazine, you get a cover.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.720]   This is that new Apple interface
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.440]   where you kind of get a table of contents.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.800]   But when you want to read it, if you don't swipe it,
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.880]   you have to tap it.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.720]   Tap on it.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.680]   So it is actually New Yorker has done something different
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.160]   than other magazines.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.760]   They actually look like they've done something
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.640]   a little fancier.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.720]   Most other magazines was very much like Texture
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.360]   where you would swipe over and then you get basically
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.880]   a PDF scan of the magazine, including ads.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.960]   So other magazines.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.520]   Yeah, each one is different or some of them are different.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.000]   That's how it was on Texture, yeah.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.160]   Glad to see the New Yorkers put a little more energy
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.160]   into the digital version on here.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.680]   Didn't they mention either yesterday or sometime
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.680]   that for certain screen combinations like the iPhone,
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.080]   they will actually break.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.480]   If they have access to the actual text of the PDF,
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.320]   they will break up the PDF and make it more readable for phones.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.920]   You don't have to pinch and zoom
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.120]   on this tiny little iPhone SE screen.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.960]   Good.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.080]   Well, they do because that is a big issue, of course.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.240]   Well, let me just show you, I don't know if this is going to
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.040]   look bad on my screen.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.360]   This on my iPhone is Retro Gamer.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.840]   It's the tiny little--
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.040]   It's page by page.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.080]   Tap a page and open it up.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.960]   Let's see.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.120]   Do you have to kind of move around within it to read it?
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.120]   See about there.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.920]   It's a little right.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.800]   Yeah, so--
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.680]   Yeah, that's not--
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.680]   Yeah, you have to pinch it zoom.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.720]   You have to pinch it.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.240]   So some of them are still like that.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.800]   Apple, when they demonstrated it--
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.680]   they demonstrated on an iPhone and iPad.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.800]   But I was surprised when they demonstrated on the iPad,
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.640]   they did it in portrait mode.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.040]   But I guess that actually now that I've used it for a while
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.480]   makes more sense because if you're doing it in landscape mode,
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.440]   you get this permanent--
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.600]   well, not permanent, but you get a gutter on here.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.600]   Whereas if you do it in portrait mode,
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.680]   it just kind of-- you see--
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.760]   it's a more natural experience.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.360]   And the gutter is a floating gutter that
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.800]   goes away when you're reading.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.600]   And again, this depends on the production of the magazine
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.440]   because some magazines, you can tap the image and zoom.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.240]   And some magazines, there's no zooming at all.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.880]   So obviously, it's still up to the publisher
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.600]   to decide how they want-- you can't zoom the text here
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.600]   on this-- a New Yorker magazine.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.680]   You know, when I thought about Apple News plus yesterday
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.840]   and the magazines, one of the first things
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.880]   that I thought of was I actually stopped reading magazines
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:34.720]   years ago and get more detailed news through RSS feeds.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.440]   And I like what Apple News does.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.840]   You know, you have different sections,
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.840]   and there's content from a lot of different publishers.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.360]   But actually-- and I wrote that yesterday,
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.320]   and I get a lot of news and tidbits and things
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.240]   like that from podcasts that I like to listen to.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.160]   But when I subscribe to Apple News plus
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.200]   and you go through that front page,
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.640]   it's actually quite nice because you do get stories
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.360]   from a lot of different publications.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.520]   So you can read more in-depth magazine stories
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.680]   from these publications based on a topic, you know,
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.640]   whatever they put in there for you,
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.360]   whether it's sports or cars or--
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.400]   Be careful though, because for instance,
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.840]   I don't read People magazine, Never Wood,
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.640]   have no interest in the content.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.920]   But because in demoing this yesterday,
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.400]   I opened an article on People magazine.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.000]   It is now in my 4U section.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.520]   Elizabeth Hasselbeck tells all about her time on The View.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.560]   I never watched The View.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.760]   I don't even know who Elizabeth Hasselbeck is.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.520]   And I certainly don't want to read that article.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.440]   But it is front and center.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.120]   It's like the top article in 4U.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.160]   And I only opened People once.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.600]   So I think there's a way to voice that though, isn't there?
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.600]   Well, I think once you open it, you can unheart it.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.680]   I don't know.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.800]   I think actually-- I think it's just because you are subscribed
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.640]   to News Plus right now because I literally
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.160]   didn't open a People magazine.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.240]   And you're getting it too?
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.800]   And I get it.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.440]   And I have People front and center.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.840]   And I have variety--
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.200]   Well, I don't mind variety.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.720]   --very fair.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.920]   --populated heavily in there too.
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.720]   And these are both magazines that so far I haven't opened yet.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.120]   So I think they're just spotlighting information.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.960]   So this isn't for you.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.960]   For everybody.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.840]   OK.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.760]   Because it knows I subscribed to The Wall Street Journal,
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.600]   though it's given me a good selection of Wall Street Journal
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.360]   stuff.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.960]   NFL football, I've selected these because of years
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.080]   of use of Apple News.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.360]   So a lot of this comes from my previous use of Apple News.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.440]   It would be very interesting.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.240]   I subscribed to Apple News this morning.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.200]   And I just got an alert that your Apple News subscription
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.200]   has expired.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.640]   OK, there's some growing pains.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.640]   In fact, there's some people who, in addition to the crash,
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.480]   which as far as I know, has fixed, it was a server update
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.920]   that they did.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.560]   They didn't have to push out an operating system update.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.640]   But some people have been complaining or commenting
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.640]   on the fact that they haven't been able to get family sharing
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.800]   to update.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.120]   And I think it's just a matter of just weight.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.720]   A couple of people that downloaded it yesterday at IMOR
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.600]   had the same situation where their family sharing devices
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.680]   weren't--
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.760]   it just wasn't showing it.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.400]   And it's supposed to just happen automatically.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.560]   You literally open your News app,
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.000]   whether you had anything to do with the lead family members
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.160]   subscribing or not, you just open it up and there you have it.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.200]   And some people, it just wasn't showing up at all.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.880]   And they would delete the app and reinstall it,
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.800]   restart their devices, do all the normal things that you would do,
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.720]   make sure that they were signed in with the right Apple ID,
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.560]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.560]   And it just never worked.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.720]   And then just suddenly it worked.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.440]   So I think in some circumstances,
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.480]   is just weight.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.680]   It'll update, hopefully.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.560]   I mean, now we're nitpicking, but the sharing feature
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.080]   leaves a little bit to be desired.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.720]   And I wasn't sure what would happen.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.400]   But if I share a story from Apple News,
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.160]   if somebody has Apple News, they'll get that story.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.760]   But if they don't, they'll get a link that promotes Apple News.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.880]   That's kind of an issue for me, because honestly,
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.280]   mostly what I want to do when I'm perusing news
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.240]   is bookmark it for use on our shows.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.480]   So I can't really use this for that.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.600]   Johnny Ive is leaving Apple.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.480]   And the hot take from John Gruber,
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.240]   I think to me remains the best hot take.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.720]   His last sentence of his piece is,
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.120]   I don't worry that Apple's in trouble because Johnny Ive is leaving.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.800]   I worry that Apple's in trouble because he's not being replaced.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.720]   - John has walked, I got him on my show,
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.840]   and he got Ben Thompson on his show on Friday.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.440]   And he has, he has, I think he said his words
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.040]   where he regretted that part of it.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.240]   - He's walked it back a little bit.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.960]   And in fact, that the Wall Street Journal article
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.280]   that said Johnny I was leaving because
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.360]   he just didn't get no respect, is apparently--
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.880]   - It's a very bad knock-out article.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.240]   - It's apparently really irritated Tim Cook.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:26.240]   Tim sent a message to Dylan Byers from NBC News saying,
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.760]   "Hi Dylan, hope you're well."
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.640]   Talking about, I guess Dylan must have asked him
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.680]   about the Wall Street Journal story.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.640]   The story is absurd.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.880]   A lot of the reporting and certainly the conclusions
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.960]   just don't match with reality.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.160]   At a base level, I always worry about this exact problem
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.000]   with our coverage too.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.560]   At the base level shows a lack of understanding
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.600]   about how the design team works and how Apple works.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.640]   We who are not inside Apple have a very different view
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.480]   of what's going on inside Apple than those who are there,
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.080]   of course, of necessity.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.000]   And that's true of every organization,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.840]   that's just an inherent flaw in reporting.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.080]   It destroys-- - But I did Leo.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.880]   - I'll finish the email then you can tell me.
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.120]   It distorts relationships, decisions, and events
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.240]   to the point that we just don't recognize the company,
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.840]   it claims to describe.
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.760]   The design team is phenomenally talented,
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.560]   as Johnny has said, they're stronger than ever
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.200]   and I have complete confidence that they will thrive
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.480]   under Jeff Jeff Williams, who's now the COO,
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.400]   now in charge of the design team.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.320]   Evan's Hanke, who is also a design team member
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.640]   and worked closely with Johnny Ive,
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.200]   and Allen's leadership.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.360]   We know the truth, we know the incredible things
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.080]   they're capable of doing, the projects they're working on
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.400]   will blow you away.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.960]   With everything except that last sentence,
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.800]   which is kind of classic, Tim Cook marketing speak,
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.480]   I would say this is very credible.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.840]   This reads right to me, which is that the journals
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.440]   reporting wasn't wrong, but that it's hard to understand
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.480]   what it's like inside a company and how the structure is
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.640]   when you're looking from the outside.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.040]   Go ahead, Renee. - What not?
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.560]   - Yeah, no, what I was gonna say is because I had
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.840]   the exact same thing as you and I happen to know
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.120]   some people on that team and as soon as that came out,
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.440]   and I'm sure you can speak to other people who know
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.000]   people at Apple who tell you the same thing,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.920]   it just didn't jive with what I'd heard from them
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.920]   over the years and I asked, he said,
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.240]   "These stories didn't happen and I'm sick
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.600]   "to my stomach right now and I don't know
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.120]   "how I'm gonna spend my weekend."
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.640]   And that's like a horrible position for that.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.160]   And they can't go on record, they are not allowed
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.000]   to go on record unless ApplePR allows them to.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.160]   And ApplePR, I don't think we'll let them do that.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.280]   So what I did was I talked to Miley Quo,
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.920]   who was at Apple until a couple of years ago
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.200]   and she was on the design and prototyping team
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.200]   and I put live a 30 minute interview with her this morning
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.160]   where she actually describes how those teams work
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.240]   and why operations is so essential.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.480]   And I think the key part that both the journal missed
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.000]   with their flippant exit thing and some of the early analysis
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.640]   missed is that Jeff Williams isn't running operations
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.680]   at Apple anymore, he's been replaced in that role
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.360]   by a new senior vice president.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.920]   Jeff is now effectively helping run Apple,
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.640]   like the way that Tim Cook used to help Steve run Apple
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.360]   and Jeff is way more interested in the day-to-day product
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.440]   development process than Tim's time allows him to be.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.480]   And so you have now a vice president of industrial design
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.680]   who is amazing and Miley talks about how I'm a,
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.720]   she just says that Evans gets S stuff done
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.480]   and you Allen Dye has been leading human interface
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.760]   since iOS 7, these are seasoned leaders.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.160]   Apple doesn't just give away SVP titles,
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.440]   I wouldn't be surprised if one or somebody got that title.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.600]   But for now putting them with Jeff Williams makes a lot
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.000]   of sense to anybody who understands how Apple is running
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.160]   design these days.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.480]   And it gives you two separate heads,
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.800]   which is what people were complaining about
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.040]   for years under Johnny.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:46.880]   - Yeah, I mean, that's, I can't improve upon that,
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.040]   but I'm gonna talk anyway because I'm bored.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.400]   (laughs)
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.920]   But that was exactly my reaction too.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.600]   I don't think that my contacts inside the design team
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.200]   are nearly as rich as Renee's.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:02.160]   But my immediate reaction was none of what I've seen
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.080]   in this article corresponds to what I understand
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.000]   the situation inside the design team to be.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.040]   None of what I've seen this jibes with what I've heard
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.760]   about Johnny Ives relationship with the rest
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.200]   of the executive team.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.560]   And so I was, when I saw this come out,
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.840]   I was really waiting for either they've totally got it wrong
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.560]   or they got it right, which means that over the weekend,
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.960]   we're going to hear from a lot of former members
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:32.360]   of employees of Apple who are now safely outside of Apple
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.560]   and no longer restricted by NDA or anything,
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.960]   who will have been, who will almost certainly have had
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:41.520]   pent up feelings about this, that they wouldn't just simply
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.160]   make a medium blog post just to air dirty laundry.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.440]   But hey, if there's a Wall Street Journal article
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.040]   that's finally blowing the lid off this big problem,
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.160]   that's when you see lots of other people
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.600]   suddenly raise their hand to say,
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.240]   yeah, let me tell you a story that I've been holding on
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.640]   to for a few years that really shows the problem
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.000]   that the Wall Street Journal finally thank God
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.560]   for the journal has illustrated.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.360]   And we're really not seeing that.
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.800]   And I can and I absolutely and knowing about the how passionate
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.800]   things are people are inside of Apple,
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.480]   I can absolutely believe that there's a lot of heartbreak
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.000]   going on to see this article, particularly because,
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.840]   as when I said, you can't then go onto Twitter
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.760]   and say hi, I work for Apple, hi, I've been working
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.000]   intimately with this team for years.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.680]   And boy, this is a no, you can't because you have to go
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.120]   through Apple PR.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.200]   And given that this was supposed to be sort of a valid victory
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.960]   for one of the, if you were to come up with a list of five,
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.960]   let's make it 10 names of Apple employees,
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.640]   including founders who are critical to Apple being
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.440]   in the position it is today,
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.000]   Johnny I was definitely on that list of 10 people.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.520]   And this really should be like a lifetime achievement award
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.320]   sort of thing, like of the, we're going to,
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.560]   it should be like David Letterman's last show.
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:00.120]   This should be, let's just tell stories about how wonderful,
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.000]   not only his work, but his work with the design team has been.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.160]   And but now it's been sort of tainted by, well, now we kind of,
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.680]   now we have this really big,
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:13.960]   intestinal, gas just emission that's now clouding the room
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.560]   that we have to now ventilate before we can get back
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.920]   to wishing Johnny I well and talking about how design works
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:21.760]   at Apple.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.560]   I'm, I kind of feel bad for people inside of Apple
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.760]   having to deal with it right now.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.560]   And again, if this, if all the people who have similar stories
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.520]   from experience at Apple have been waiting almost a full week
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.120]   to talk about them, I'll apologize for having jumped to a conclusion.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.320]   But yeah, I don't think this, this doesn't seem credible at all.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.080]   Laurie.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.120]   I think that's the problem with the nature of the internet
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:48.200]   and the immediacy of reporting these stories that this,
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.880]   this is a editorial piece or a sort of deep research piece
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:56.440]   that would have needed a week to get done and to get done right
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.360]   and to get all the right voices in.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.120]   Cause I'm sure there are a lot of people that either do work for
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:05.160]   or used to work for Apple that have certain sentiments,
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.960]   but this didn't have enough voices outside of one directive.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.680]   And because of the immediacy of trying to get this out there to the public,
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.280]   because, you know, we're constantly digesting this information
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.760]   like immediately it lost the opportunity to have deeper voices.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.880]   Even the opportunity to speak with Apple PR to sort of like negate
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.040]   some of these statements and some of the things that were said.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:34.800]   So you almost can't blame news organizations,
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.280]   though you can blame news organizations.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.120]   No, you can't.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.280]   We're doing it wrong.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:43.680]   What I'm saying is like it's almost not a surprise to me
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:48.360]   that they got it wrong because they're trying so hard to do it fast
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.200]   that they're not doing the work to do it right.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.120]   You know, you're not.
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:56.200]   You're too young to remember Time Magazine, but this is a.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.560]   I'm not, but thank you.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.800]   Well, the old, not the current time in my age, in my era,
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:07.200]   40 or 30 or 40 years ago, this is a style that was created by Time Magazine
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.360]   of the of the birds.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.840]   I view inside the organization style and you could tell as soon as you read
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.840]   the lead from the Wall Street Journal as the deadline loom for the 10th anniversary
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:21.120]   iPhone software designers gathered in the penthouse of an exclusive San Francisco
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.320]   club called the battery.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.440]   They'd been signing goes on.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:28.320]   It's the fly on the wall reporting that's very compelling for readers because it
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:31.840]   puts you inside, but it has that flaw no matter what.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:36.120]   And I know maybe I'm sure they had many sources for this, but it has that flaw
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.640]   no matter what that you really can't be a fly on a wall that organizations are
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:44.280]   complex, understanding them from within requires being within and nobody on the
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.160]   outside can really get enough information to tell the right story.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.360]   So I think that that's where I would blame the Wall Street Journal, Lori, because
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.360]   they're they're adopting this fly in the wall style.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:00.320]   Whereas I think I would stand by what John Gruber wrote, even if he won't.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.760]   And and what we've said, because we're not observing, we're not trying to think
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.280]   of what's we're not saying what's going on inside of Apple.
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:13.200]   We're observing it as Apple customers and Apple users and Apple journalists from
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:13.840]   the outside.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.720]   Here's the impact from the outside.
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.440]   And what's been apparent from the outside for many years is that Johnny
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.360]   I've, I don't know how many times he shows up inside Apple Park, but it's been
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:23.840]   apparent.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:28.040]   He's kind of been distant from the whole process.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.320]   You don't see him on stage.
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.920]   Well, you never saw him on stage, but you don't see him in the videos.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.120]   You don't, you know, you don't see him in the, you saw him at the event at WWDC
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:41.080]   with Tim kind of looking at the computer, but it's not the same involvement as in
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.160]   the Steve Jobs era.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.320]   Isn't it funny?
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:47.280]   That story from Johnny of Johnny I've leaving was from July.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.920]   It wasn't until just recently, this month, I think that Johnny, I've actually was
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.760]   taken off the masthead at Apple.com.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.120]   Our next story might be the biggest Apple story of the decade.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:02.320]   You remember Apple sued Qualcomm saying you charged too much for the chips that
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:08.160]   we put in our iPhone, went to Intel, said quick, develop a modem to replace the
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.120]   Qualcomm modem.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:14.320]   It'll until when, you know, scramble, develop the modem, then Apple settles with
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.040]   Qualcomm.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.880]   Qualcomm agrees to sell them Qualcomm chips at a good price for the next five years.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:23.640]   Apple says, Sayonara Intel Intel says, what?
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:29.120]   And sells Apple, the modem business for, it turns out, was a pittance.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:35.960]   According to nine to five Mac, Intel had to take a fire sale price for their for
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:41.400]   their modems that this this this wasn't a billion dollars as much as that sounds
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.760]   like wasn't wasn't what Intel was hoping for for this.
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:48.000]   I think though, there were other people in the bids, right?
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.160]   They closed bids two weeks before this was even a rumor.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.880]   So that meant that meant that there really wasn't a big bidding war.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.480]   Otherwise, they would have basically kept, kept apples feet to the fire.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.600]   Apple, they're worth more to Apple than they aren't anybody else, clearly.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.280]   Yeah, because Intel realized that they they're only this.
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.120]   They're only real customer was going to be Apple.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:14.280]   Once Apple aced them out, then they realized that there is we have, we're
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:18.520]   making some, we are businesses in so many different successful areas.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:23.440]   We don't need or have the desire to keep bleeding into a brand new industry.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.160]   That's going to require a great deal of compliance.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.480]   It's going to require a great deal of new marketing, a great deal of new
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.360]   new relationships.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.960]   Why not just sell it?
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.400]   They don't I don't think they took a loss, but they were more interested in
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.880]   making sure that they have this thing that is not terribly valuable on the open
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.960]   market, but it's very valuable to Apple and making the best deal they could.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.000]   I don't think they I don't think they're crying over with over the deal that made
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.720]   does no, I doubt they are.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:53.280]   Does the fact that T-Mobile sprint merger looks like it's going to go through to
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.760]   and that is all about 5G.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:01.000]   Dish is going to become a new fourth cell phone network and start with 5G.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.520]   They're not even going to bother with building an LTE network.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:08.000]   That also must have put some pressure on Apple to get going with its 5G modem.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:08.200]   Right.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.240]   I think Apple would have otherwise sat back and said, we can wait a couple of years
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:15.080]   because there isn't really a lot of pressure to make a 5G phone yet.
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.880]   I think they're I think they're well, their planet was originally the 2020.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.640]   Oh, and I don't think that's changed.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.520]   I think that that's when they were hoping they would.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.800]   And they always see that's kind of contrary to the way Apple works, right?
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.120]   Usually Apple's the last to adopt a new technology.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.720]   Well, they will be the last by that.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:34.320]   I mean, every manufacturer is going to roll it out by spring of next, which is silly.
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.040]   Because honestly, maybe Google, we don't know.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.120]   There's all sorts of issues with 5G.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.480]   We were talking on Sunday about battery life, which at this point is terrible with 5G.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.880]   Those minus parents are on melted.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.280]   Literally.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.600]   There's also the issue of 5G not being available.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.240]   And if it is available in your neck of the woods, maybe very, very expensive.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:59.240]   I don't know if consumers are going to be in 2020 saying, oh, I got to have a 5G phone.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.360]   Yeah, that's that's exactly it.
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:05.640]   It's mostly, I think the biggest impact is going to be for services and also for
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:10.040]   broadband companies who want to build up coverage that they would normally have to
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:14.440]   get the pull rights or cable rights for because it's not it's not just all the
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.720]   problems that Renee's talking about.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:20.920]   It's not like because it's not like 3G or LTE where you can put up one antenna or
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.960]   repurpose and attendee, you already have 3G stuff on.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:30.160]   You really are going to have to just throw a 5G bomb in the air that does nothing,
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:36.440]   but penetration scatters, 5G stations on every single street corner, every single block.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.080]   They just don't penetrate.
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.920]   They just don't propagate very well.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.520]   So you're going to need to cover a wide area.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.200]   You're going to need so many pieces of hardware to make that happen.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:54.240]   And you're still delivering features that aren't necessarily going to convince
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.400]   consumers to upgrade their mobile plan.
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:02.320]   Now, if they get into if it's certainly a feature that will that will get
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:07.120]   someone interested in saying, well, I will definitely buy this 5G enabled security
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:11.840]   camera because I will not have to run a special, a special internet cable or
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.400]   a special internet service out to this remote location.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:19.960]   It can just access an network on its own or if there's a low latency sort of product
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:24.640]   that they need to get going on like a drone project or something that's a little bit
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:30.120]   more active than what you can get with normal 4G and LTE right now.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:36.120]   That's going to work, but the the idea of it being like the transition between 3G
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.520]   and 4G is just not going to be it.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.120]   You're not going to be able to get faster.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.400]   You're not going to necessarily get get better TV out of it.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.840]   You're not going to get better Netflix out of it.
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:51.000]   And there has yet to be the case of people wanting to stream at a very, very, very
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.760]   higher rate to a phone yet.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:57.240]   Games might change that, but 5G availability is going to be a problem.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:01.200]   Intel will still be able to make modems for PCs for other devices, just not
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.000]   the phone. Yeah.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.360]   The other thing to remember though is that 5G is like it's a huge mess.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.800]   And it's like Andy was saying is a way bigger mess in LTE because it's also not
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.640]   really a thing. It's like three different things.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:15.320]   There's sub six gigahertz, which is what's going to be in rural communities and suburbs,
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.200]   which is going to use a lot of existing infrastructure and be just a little bit
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.560]   faster at first, but steadily gain speed.
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:24.440]   And then Europe has the mid range sort of version of 5G.
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:29.400]   And then in cities, it has the millimeter wave, which is that bomb cluster bomb
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.600]   that Andy was talking about.
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:34.360]   That's going to take, you know, at least a mini tower on every block,
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:38.040]   if not on every balcony in a major city, just to provide distribution.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.840]   And we will probably see sub six gigahertz phones, especially low cost
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:46.560]   phones, especially in markets like China that won't require as much, you know,
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.280]   that people have slightly better service much faster.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.440]   But for the North American market, you're probably going to have to support both.
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.880]   And that was the Mingshi Quo rumor this week is that Apple is going to go all
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.120]   in with all three phones in 2020.
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.400]   Finally, for the pro, only the pro.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.040]   Okay.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:07.600]   Yeah, the pro gets the USB C 18 watch charger and the 11 gets the usual lightning.
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.320]   That's nice, though.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.040]   I want lightning.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:14.320]   And I noted that you and others on Twitter are still bemoaning the off center
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.360]   lightning for.
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:20.720]   I mean, it's the there's a they put they basically who cares.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.960]   What are these people that care about that?
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:27.640]   Industrial design geeks, Leo, we care about everything, every hole,
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.720]   every notch, every, every bit of construction.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.840]   I guess so.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:31.720]   Right.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.600]   When I would be, would you be, would you and your like be made more happy?
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:41.600]   If let's say that we sold like a special sort of case where the phone is offset
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.560]   inside the case to make it look like you've got the you've got the.
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:46.560]   I'm sorry, Andrew.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.760]   That's a clue.
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.720]   I don't want to come.
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.960]   But it's also a little bit.
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:55.360]   It's also a little bit of, of, you know, because people like Apple people were always
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:59.240]   making fun of Samsung for never being able to align their ports, like at all,
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.480]   you know, different ports, like someone took them and threw them on the phone at some point.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.800]   And now they can't even do it.
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.000]   I was like, you know, it's just a little bit.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:05.840]   Well, we get in front of there.
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.800]   Well, that's, that's, that's why like maybe we shouldn't have been making fun of Samsung
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:10.400]   for doing that.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.440]   It's like, I mean, it's, it's, it's nice.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.720]   It's details do matter.
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:21.040]   And if it, and I, you're always correct whenever you say this is how this thing makes me feel.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:26.880]   But there's an difference between, I'm, I'm, I'm, the thing that makes me roll my eyes is when it goes from, oh,
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:31.840]   gosh, it does look a little bit weird with it offset like that to fail loser.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.240]   This is why Samsung just doesn't get it.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:40.080]   It's like, dude, dude, we, there's a, there's an ASIC that had to go there.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.080]   So we were kind of like, okay with moving.
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.280]   But if you just planned the ASIC last fall, like I told you to.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:53.760]   I, you know, I bet, I bet during the I fix teardown, they didn't even paint the inside of the case as well as they painted the outside.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.760]   Oh, shocking, shocking.
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:56.800]   Can never use it again, Andy.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:57.200]   Thank you.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:57.440]   Right.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.560]   Speakers better.
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.160]   So there's two, there's two things that they can do.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:13.000]   One is if you have Dolby 5.1, Apple has their own custom virtualizer that will do spatial placement for the sound.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:13.680]   Oh, come on.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.920]   It's just a small little speaker in the bottom of the phone.
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:17.600]   You can't tell me.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:17.920]   I would.
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.680]   Yeah, you say that, but then I was watching.
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:23.040]   So I'm, I'm the kind of person who've been using my cell phone speaker forever.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.960]   Like I used to listen to Mac break weekly on the speaker of my Trio.
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.320]   So I do not encourage that.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:34.080]   I don't encourage putting it to your ear when you're in a cafe and yelling at a person on FaceTime on your ear.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:38.680]   But like if you're on your own, like the, you know, privacy of your own home, you can listen on a speaker if you want to.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.520]   But this, this will place it.
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:45.960]   So like I was watching Godzilla and I was watching Bumblebee and you hear like moving around.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:50.920]   And if it has Dolby at most encoding, it'll just use the at most encoding and just make a sound state.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:55.760]   And the thing that's really cool about this is Apple built this world class audio lab.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:28:00.080]   And I remember they took us there for the home pod and I was in the analyst track for that.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:05.160]   So I was with a bunch of like all the analysts that you know, basically, and they're like, we've never been in one this big.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:09.520]   This is like five times the size of any of any quiet room we've ever been in.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:12.000]   And this is like, oh, we can see down eight floors.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:12.520]   Wow.
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.800]   And they were like super impressed.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.440]   But I think Apple's doing things in there like the AirPods, like the home pod.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:24.520]   Like they're now doing this virtual thing where it tries to detect where the earpiece is on your ear and project the sound in the right direction for you.
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:28.240]   And all of that is paying off now across like every product they're making.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:32.200]   And that's when you have these, this many billions of dollars and you can make a building like that.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.640]   You start to earn dividends from it.
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:42.280]   Renee, though they're not promoting it like this, would you say the new spatial speakers are kind of are more like true stereo?
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:48.000]   Like there's left and right channels or at least like maybe a computational version of left and right channels.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.360]   Yeah, it's like a sound stage.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:53.280]   It's like the previous ones had wide stereo, which was very much like that.
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.480]   You'd hear like the right and the left.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.320]   And here it's like it's it's all the way right is halfway right.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.680]   It's a quarter of the way right.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.760]   It's center.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.040]   It's a quarter left, half left, all left.
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.120]   That's kind of amazing.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:13.000]   I have to say, and we're going to talk about Apple Arcade in a little bit, but the games on Apple Arcade all have really spectacular sound and playing the one the iPad Pro.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.560]   You really noticed that Apple's put a lot of detail, a lot of attention to audio playback.
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.440]   And the developers are so proud.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.560]   We had a chance to chat with them too.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.320]   And they're like, we want to make the Mac version amazing and the Apple TV version.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:24.920]   Amazing.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.400]   Because usually we don't have time or money to bother with those.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.000]   Nice.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:28.600]   Nice.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.880]   Well, we'll get to that in a little bit.
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:33.280]   I want to take advantage of the fact that you didn't get a phone, right?
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:33.880]   Laurie, I'm just.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.240]   I did not.
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:35.600]   OK.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.840]   I don't mean it.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:41.640]   I don't mean it to one, but yeah, I don't mean to focus on Renee, but he's the one who has the phone.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.760]   That's he's the one who's holding them in his eyes.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:44.680]   We would be sure.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.800]   Yes.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:46.320]   Yeah.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.640]   And I presume you didn't get a watch a series five watch yet.
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.520]   You still just have the phone or do you have a watch to?
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.800]   I'm not wearing anything today.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:54.440]   I do not.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.680]   OK, and Renee's not wearing it today.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.040]   That's right.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:58.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:29:59.320]   Sorry.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.240]   But OK, got it.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:02.720]   Got it.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:03.200]   Got it.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:03.840]   And where I goes?
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:04.360]   Not off.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:04.960]   I understand.
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:05.360]   It's funny.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:10.360]   I'm having a laugh at your expense, but I am also the person who snuck like a pre-release
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.880]   phone into the studio.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:15.080]   I remember that hidden hidden inside a case for an older phone.
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:18.320]   So we are just we're just watching Andy.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.080]   I'm not very good with ask him.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.520]   And he would be like, what is that over there?
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.040]   Is that a bird?
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.000]   And is my is my sensei, my Yoda?
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.520]   I don't want to believe it.
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.520]   I did order.
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.280]   I did get to look at them.
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:29.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:34.360]   And if you if you have some questions on what that titanium looks like,
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.120]   I ordered the titanium.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.640]   I'm thinking I'm not say I ordered the dark.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.680]   The dark titanium with the link band.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.280]   I hope that was a good idea.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.480]   It was a lot of money.
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.400]   So it better be a good idea.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.720]   Titanium is absolutely gorgeous.
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.520]   I love this color.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.760]   In terms of the difference in brushed metal.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:56.240]   It's definitely the winner, in my opinion, over aluminum.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:59.560]   And then when you're getting when you're getting into that comparison between the
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:04.000]   polished metal of stainless steel versus the brushed metal of titanium,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.800]   it's a little more complicated as to what you like better.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.120]   But I absolutely love the way that titanium looks.
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.560]   It's deep and rich.
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:15.000]   So it really feels like real jewelry when you look at it.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:15.960]   It's it's gorgeous.
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.120]   And I think I prefer.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.920]   I don't usually want I don't prefer the black case.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:26.520]   But in terms of between the two titanium colors, I prefer the black just because it
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.520]   has this nice shine to it, even though it's brushed.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.400]   So it's really, really gorgeous.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.080]   You're going to love it.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.040]   I got the right one.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:33.800]   Thank God.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.920]   I got the same one.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:35.960]   Did you get that too?
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.040]   They ordered it.
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:37.280]   Yep.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:41.280]   A little pricey, but I thought, well, in fact, you know, last year, I ordered just
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.640]   the cheapest one I could get.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.640]   But I thought, oh, I kind of like I've had titanium watches.
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.320]   I always say that.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.480]   I'm like, I'm never going to buy more than the aluminum again.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.080]   And then every year is like, oh, we have a new, new material for you.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:52.480]   Right.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:52.920]   No.
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:58.000]   So I got the this this black titanium with a space black link.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.160]   You think that's a good choice.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.840]   That's what you got, Renee.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:03.320]   Yeah, except I didn't get it with the space black link.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.160]   Because I already had that.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:07.400]   My first first Apple watch was the black steel that came with that.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:07.720]   Right.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.480]   So I got it with one of the new two tone bands, which I really like.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.600]   This will be my first link.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:16.720]   Because I've always resisted it because it's like ridiculously expensive.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.440]   You know, it's hundreds of dollars for a watch.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.960]   Funny thing about it, though, is like other watchmakers had those for a
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.680]   hundred years and never thought to make them easy.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.640]   And now they all do it.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.680]   Like Apple makes it once and out the entire world.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.360]   Easy to take or add a link so that it fits just right.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:29.520]   Yeah.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:33.200]   This doesn't have a magnet in it, though, because I noticed that they said,
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:38.280]   don't if you want the compass to work in the watch, don't use a magnetic wrist bracelet.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.440]   There's no magnet in the linker is there.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.920]   No, no, it's not.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.400]   Not that I need a compass, but I.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.560]   You know, you say that, but.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:47.680]   Let's talk about the compass.
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.880]   I'm very excited.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.960]   Why are you an orienteer?
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.560]   Do you get lost on stage?
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:56.080]   I get lost in the woods, actually.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:56.480]   Do you?
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:04.640]   It's fantastic to me that they've been able to fit an actual magnetometer.
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.200]   I cannot say that magnetometer.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:06.400]   I'm not.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:06.720]   For that.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:10.040]   You say it's named after the X man Magneto.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:10.560]   Magneto.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:19.560]   Into that tiny little Apple watch and it's, you know, it's not digital or it's not based on, you know,
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:20.720]   that's what surprised me.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.520]   It's not GPS.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:22.640]   It's it's a company.
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.760]   It's a literally a magnetic compass.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:25.720]   Yes.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.080]   I mean, and that's right there on your wrist.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:28.720]   It's crazy.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:29.760]   The impressive.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.720]   Well, I learned to me about this because I didn't think it was a big deal.
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.160]   And then she said it was a really big deal.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.520]   So I started asking around.
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:41.200]   And the first thing people told me was you're out with your family, but you've gotten separated.
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.400]   And you just say, find my wife, find my kid.
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:47.240]   And then without even touching your phone, it shows you exactly which direction to go as well.
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:53.520]   And you know, well, that's that also brings up this U one chip, which Apple mentioned briefly.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.680]   Did they brief you on ultra wide brand?
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:56.840]   Did they talk about that at all?
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:04.600]   They did not very much because the the first feature using it, which is going to be a spatial
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.080]   air drop is not shipping until 13.1.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.600]   So they just said, this is what it does.
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:09.400]   And this is what's coming.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:09.920]   Right.
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.800]   I still love my iPhone 11 Pro Max.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.840]   I think it's really the best iPhone I've ever had.
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.120]   This time, Apple really told the truth.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:20.960]   It's also the most expensive iPhone of all time, but that's another matter for another day.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.240]   After this, we talked about another big announcement.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:30.680]   I think maybe kind of the sleeper announcement of the year for Apple, Apple arcade.
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:33.120]   Let's see.
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:33.960]   There's arcade.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.360]   How do you guys like arcade?
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.240]   Love the Houston.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:39.680]   Oh, Jim, you got to get out of that.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:40.880]   Music shell you're in.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:44.120]   No, I'm just not a gamer.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:44.880]   Yeah.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:50.880]   You know, I understand why people use arcade and I understand that it's going to be very popular.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:55.280]   But it's just not something that I use.
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.120]   I just don't play games.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:01.840]   So Jim, can I say something that I'm I'm not a gamer either.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:07.320]   And of course, I signed up for it as soon as I activated the iPhone 11 and been downloading
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:08.280]   so many of these cool games.
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:12.200]   They're they're not really the games that I've been finding are they're more like puzzles.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.320]   They're more like interactive pieces.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.240]   A lot of them are like interactive pieces of art.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:21.200]   They're not the sort of games that get me all like wound up and nervous.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.560]   They're like calm with their tranquil.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.400]   So I like them a lot.
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:28.640]   But they just frustrating to me.
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:32.600]   I don't know that I would have signed up if I didn't.
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:37.240]   I mean, I guess I would have anyway, but I signed up because I knew it would actually save us money.
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.640]   Have a 17 year old son.
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:40.480]   Absolutely.
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:42.120]   But is he happy though?
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:46.280]   That's a good question because he's a totally he's presumably a hardcore gamer.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.240]   Right at that age.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.920]   He plays a lot of games for sure.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.240]   No, he's happy.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.800]   In fact, he was showing me while we were having lunch.
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.280]   He doesn't seem to go to school a whole lot.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:55.560]   I don't know.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.200]   He's worked out a nice thing for himself.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:00.800]   But anyway, we were having we're having lunch together today.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.360]   And he's like, have you seen hot lava?
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.840]   This game is so fun.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.720]   It's so fun.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.160]   And I was like, oh, yeah, look at this.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:08.640]   OK.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.760]   This is operator 41.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:14.640]   You have to sneak around and get to the phone before the Gestapo guy gets you.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:18.400]   And it's it's kind of I'll tell you what I love about these games.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:23.440]   They're games that probably wouldn't kind of make it on the app store without.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:28.480]   Because they're just some of them are really more already with those ads without.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:28.680]   Yeah.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.720]   But I think this is these are these is just really.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.240]   Oh, God, get in there, get in there.
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:34.800]   Oh, oh, yes, I did.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.560]   I got there.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.040]   I snuck around him.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:40.840]   It's like it's like Castle Wolfenstein on rails.
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.600]   That's what there's no shooting.
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:47.080]   And this is, you know, kind of pretty typical of Apple stuff is that they don't they don't
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.560]   like to do, you know, shoot them up.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:52.840]   There is there's some, you know, there's some fighting, but this is a real.
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:54.240]   It's just creative.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.160]   They're very creative.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:01.960]   And five bucks a month and it seems like an unlimited supply of entertainment.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.160]   I worry about the game.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:07.760]   I worry about the what's going to do the game ecosystem outside the arcade.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:09.520]   Yeah.
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:15.080]   How many games need to move into arcade as arcade sort of moves along, right?
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:18.440]   That's that's the real question is what does it look like a year from now?
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.600]   And does the exclusivity remain?
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:27.040]   And if it does, can people migrate into it in order to take advantage and participate
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:27.240]   there?
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:28.840]   Like I got a lot of questions.
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:33.440]   I would not want to be launching a big title on the app store, especially
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:39.040]   a freemium title right now on the app store within that purchases because I feel like
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.920]   people are going to go, yeah, no, I'll do the one I got.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:42.840]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:49.040]   But particularly, I hope there I hope that I get to like actually pay for and keep a
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.240]   game like what the golf.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:52.360]   Oh, it would be awesome.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:53.720]   Yeah.
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:58.720]   It's it's almost like a stand up routine that you're just in the audience of because
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:37:59.480]   it's it's not.
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:03.400]   I mean, it's it starts you off thinking that, OK, look, it's a cute little
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.240]   cartoony, like mini golf game.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:10.160]   But then like you you take a swing and on the second or third hole, you take a swing
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.160]   and you've actually just like thrown the player.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:15.120]   And now like every time you swing, you're throwing the player onto the green.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:18.840]   And all and now it's just a level after level after level.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:26.080]   And I just I I would like to be able to own the games I really, really like and have
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.520]   access to play them and replay them whenever I want.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:37.600]   That would be disappointed if someday it left it left Apple Arcade and the developers
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:42.000]   didn't find a way to put it back in the app store or whatever.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.800]   Because it's it's the same problem you have, like with Netflix and other streaming
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:49.840]   services where you hate to think that, OK, well, I can only see I can only watch
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:55.240]   friends or Seinfeld until Netflix or whoever or Hulu loses the rights to it.
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:58.760]   And then maybe if I sign up for this other, it's you like to own things.
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:03.200]   I would also like to I would also like the pleasure of taking five dollars out
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:06.720]   of my wallet and giving it to the people who wrote this app.
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:07.520]   Well, you're right.
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:09.040]   I'm going to cry.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.200]   Here's some money.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.440]   I want you to have some money.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:15.480]   I want the next time that you buy a muffin at Starbucks, I want you to maybe
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:20.680]   think that it was the $18 that I gave you four of those singles paid for that muffin.
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:23.440]   I'm going to cry if I if they take this away.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:23.800]   You're right.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.120]   I never even I never even thought about that.
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:28.360]   You know, this is.
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.000]   Yeah, this is this is like this.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.960]   This this game is hours of fun.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.360]   And if they said, oh, yeah, it's no more.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:35.840]   But you know what?
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:38.520]   Maybe that's actually now that you mention it.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:41.840]   That's going to be the secret of this is, oh, you want to keep playing it?
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.080]   I'll just pay us five bucks and you can keep playing it.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.440]   Maybe that's why these guys are putting up with that.
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:51.040]   That's an I'm sure these guys go ahead.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:55.400]   That's the nature of the streaming world or the subscribing world that we live in,
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:55.720]   right?
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.960]   Things leave Netflix and say, oh, crap.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:58.800]   Like, right.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.280]   Maybe that is a reality.
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:00.880]   I don't know.
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:01.480]   What is it?
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.440]   It's interesting to see.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:08.880]   Maybe they're the thought of this whole thing is that when games do leave the
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:13.080]   arcade because they bring in new games, then you'll buy it.
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.280]   People will be allowed to sell them.
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:14.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:15.840]   I think that's probably it.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:16.240]   Yeah.
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.880]   Now I'm going to be bummed because in a couple of months, I'm going to have to buy this.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:23.720]   But that is a good incentive for the developer, isn't it?
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:24.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:27.160]   I wonder if Apple allows that.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.880]   Like, like what kind of long term deal?
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:34.960]   Cause if if everybody's like, well, cool, I'll use Apple Arcade to get people hooked.
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.720]   And then a month in, I'll bail and now you got to pay me 20 bucks.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.000]   I don't think I don't know.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.240]   I don't think that you can bail.
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:49.080]   I think it's going to be a situation of where maybe Apple, you know, they keep adding
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:49.440]   games.
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:53.920]   So at some point they're going to have to trim if they trim, then your game is gone.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:57.800]   But let's not forget that Apple is helping to fund these games too.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:58.200]   Right.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:02.600]   So it could be that you're being paid for, you know, the development and everything
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.440]   by Apple.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:08.720]   And then if they want to shelve it, it's theirs to shelf.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:09.040]   Right.
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:09.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.040]   But at least it's, at least it's not.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:17.360]   It's only exclusive to iPhone regards to mobile, mobile platforms.
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:21.880]   So there's nothing, there's nothing for any of them for making a version for windows
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.760]   or for consoles or for the Switch.
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:25.920]   So at least there's that.
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:26.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.720]   This is now on the Apple TV.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:34.680]   Today's the day you can update your Apple TV and go out and get.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:35.200]   I'm built.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.280]   I don't know what I'm doing here.
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:39.080]   Apparently building, building something.
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.920]   I don't know.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.400]   Definitely not podcasting.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.360]   Oh, that, that podcasting.
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:44.720]   Yes.
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:45.400]   Yes.
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.240]   I remember that.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:49.480]   That's so 1995.
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.040]   I showed it.
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.120]   I got a good idea for you.
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:57.440]   If you deliver content to customers, whether it's podcasts like ours or apps,
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:03.280]   our sponsor, CashFly, is actually more than a sponsor from day one, practically.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.400]   We've used CashFly.
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:08.240]   I was really struggling with how to get these shows out in a timely fashion.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:11.240]   You may remember how hard it was to download them.
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:14.800]   I was begging people to seed them on BitTorrent.
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.120]   We were trying all sorts of things.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.200]   Matt Levine of CashFly came along.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:24.920]   This is probably 2000, I want to say, eight, 2007, very early on and said, let us help.
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:28.040]   CashFly is a content delivery network.
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:29.120]   This is what they do.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:35.200]   A CDN is by its very nature, a faster, better way to deliver content.
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:40.240]   CashFly CDN is up to 10 times faster than traditional delivery methods.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:43.320]   And because they have servers all over the world and when you download it, you
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:47.200]   download from a server that's near you, not only is it faster, it's more reliable.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:52.720]   They can offer a 100% service level agreement, SLA, 100%.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:54.720]   100%.
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:58.840]   It's also, it's also about 30% faster than other major CDNs.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:00.240]   CashFly is awesome.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:05.680]   They, they literally are the, are the reason we can deliver petabytes of data
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.160]   to you every single month.
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.720]   Thanks to CashFly.
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:13.760]   The other thing I love about CashFly, they will bill you on a yearly usage basis,
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:17.480]   not on a day to day, hour by hour, or even week by week.
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:20.960]   One of the problems we have, and I bet you do to anybody who has apps or
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:24.960]   podcasts or content or anything that they delivered their end users over the internet,
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.240]   it tends to be spiky, right?
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:30.240]   You, nothing will happen then boom, everything all at once.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:35.920]   And the problem with some CDNs is suddenly you have to start, oh, am I going to exceed
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.920]   my limit this, this week or today?
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:38.920]   Is this going to be a problem?
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.640]   My hit is my spike going to kill me?
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.240]   Is my bill going to double?
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:43.800]   Not with CashFly.
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:49.960]   CashFly averages out your costs over a year of usage so that you know exactly what
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.120]   you're going to pay month to month.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:54.040]   You don't have to constantly check your bill, make sure you're all right.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.760]   So we're very spiky.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.920]   You don't want to show comes out.
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:59.080]   Everybody downloads it and then it tapers off.
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:01.680]   CashFly has handled that.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.520]   We literally deliver petabytes of data every month.
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:05.560]   I haven't checked last time.
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:09.640]   I thought it was seven or eight petabytes every month through the CashFly network
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:13.400]   with not one hitch in 10 and over 10 years.
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:17.840]   Join thousands of people who trust CashFly's reliable network.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:18.680]   It's not just me.
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:19.680]   LG uses it.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.400]   Even Microsoft uses it.
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.440]   Adobe uses it.
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:23.520]   Ours, Technica.
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.960]   No billing spikes.
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:30.640]   You'll save on average more than 20% for the best possible service.
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.280]   I don't know where you can go wrong.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.520]   In fact, why aren't you using CashFly?
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:35.760]   I got a deal for you.
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.240]   If you go to twit.
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:42.440]   CashFly.com right now, bring your bill and they will analyze it.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:43.400]   They'll look at the spikes.
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.640]   They'll average it out over a year.
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:48.960]   So bring them as many bills as you can and they can give you a quote.
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:54.240]   And really you'll get the best sense of what you will save using the best CDN out there.
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:55.600]   CashFly.
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:56.160]   Twit.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.080]   CashFly.com.
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:57.720]   No high pressure.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:58.240]   Don't worry.
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:44:59.840]   They're great guys.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:02.000]   Matt Levine and his team are fantastic.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:02.800]   Twit.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:03.920]   CashFly.com.
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:05.400]   They deliver Twit.
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.040]   They should be delivering you.
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:08.760]   Thank you, CashFly.
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:12.160]   So DeepFusion is coming out and that changes everything or what?
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:14.160]   That's in the developer beta now.
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:19.880]   Neelai Patel calls it sweater mode because all of Apple's demos with the life.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:26.560]   I can see why they would do that though because the sweater you can zoom in to see the
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.000]   knit of the sweater.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.640]   So I can see why they're doing that.
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:31.600]   They're using like a very textured.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:32.320]   OK.
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:35.560]   So what does DeepFusion do that's new, Laurie?
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:38.560]   Look at your article.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:41.080]   Are you still writing it?
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:45.760]   Well, you know, we didn't do a whole lot about DeepFusion because it wasn't out yet.
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:48.840]   So nobody has written anything about DeepFusion yet, but don't worry.
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:49.280]   It's coming.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:49.760]   OK.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:57.560]   It enhances it and sort of like makes it like a little bit brighter and deeper.
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:03.120]   It's almost like having not and this is silly to go this far, but it's sort of like
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.400]   having a film camera.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:10.360]   You really get it captures the detail in a much better way and a much deeper way so
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:15.080]   that you kind of get like a brighter, clearer picture going.
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:21.560]   So if you can remember, you know, your old film photographs, if you were to like,
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:26.000]   you know, put them into your computer and like zoom and zoom and zoom, you get really
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.280]   deep and get really detailed way in the background.
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:33.480]   You can do that not quite like that, but you can really get that kind of extra detail.
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:36.800]   With with the DeepFusion going.
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.840]   Here's from the Virgis article.
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:44.640]   The iPhone 11 11 pro cameras will now have three new four modes of operation.
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:47.720]   We'll automatically kick in based on light levels and the lens you're using.
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:49.400]   The standard wide angle lens.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:52.560]   Standard wide angle lens is not ultra wide.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.920]   And that's what I'd call the normal lens, the middle lens, right?
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:59.800]   We'll use Apple's enhanced smart HDR for bright to medium lit scenes.
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:05.480]   Deep fusion will kick in for medium to low light and then it's night mode for dark
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:12.960]   scenes. The tele lens will use mostly deep fusion with smart HDR taking over for very
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.040]   bright scenes night mode for very dark scenes.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:19.600]   The ultra wide does not support either deep fusion or night mode.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:21.400]   It always uses smart HDR.
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:24.000]   That's confusing.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   The whole point is Apple isn't why you even know this, right?
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.240]   They don't even want you to think about it.
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.440]   You know, I was going to say exactly that.
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:36.200]   Something that confused me was, OK, when is it using a regular picture?
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:39.920]   When is it using smart HDR and when is it using deep fusion?
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:45.680]   I know that it's giving me a visual reminder whenever I'm using night mode where they
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:50.560]   could have just simply said, and we've we've used a lot of new, we've used a lot
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:54.520]   new technologies to make sure that no matter what the situation, it will take the best
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:58.200]   picture possible when they're talking about, OK, now it's using.
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:59.760]   Now it's using deep fusion now.
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:01.440]   It's using smart HDR notes.
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:02.600]   No, we're in there.
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:04.720]   So we want to know what the hell's going on.
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.440]   Yeah, I just put it in a blog post.
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:10.680]   Like Google would just say we use HDR plus for older pixels and we use super zoom for
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:12.520]   newer pixels and here's all the nerdy details.
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:13.240]   And it's in a blog post.
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:13.640]   Only yours.
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:13.960]   All fine.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:21.160]   It's also a little confusing because supposedly night mode only uses the white
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:22.440]   ultra wide super button.
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:22.680]   Yeah.
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:23.600]   Yes.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:27.520]   No, it only uses the regular wide angle.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:33.240]   Well, it says though, it will use night mode for standard and telly if the scenes are very dark.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:38.000]   Yeah, I believe it'll crop in like simulate the way it does for for some of the other shots
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.440]   when there's not enough light, it'll simulate the telephoto because you have enough data.
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:44.240]   You can't simulate ultra wide because so the ultra wide.
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:49.120]   The main shooter, the wide angle has 100% focus pixels, really good.
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:49.640]   OIS.
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:52.840]   It's like the best 12 megapixel camera you can get.
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:54.440]   And it does all the heavy lifting.
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:59.280]   The telephoto has some focus pixels and OIS, but it's because of the aperture.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.440]   It's not as good at low light.
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:06.800]   So sometimes it'll switch to the main camera and just machine, learn it to make it look like the telephoto.
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:12.480]   The ultra wide angle has no focus pixels and no OIS, but it can get wider shots.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:17.280]   But you can't simulate that with the wide angle because you don't have the ultra wide data to work off of.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:17.480]   Right.
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:22.080]   So this is what Apple told me a lie.
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:26.360]   There's no indicator in the camera app that deep fusion is on.
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:27.640]   It's invisible to the user.
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:29.280]   There's no indicator in the photo roll.
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.000]   It doesn't show up in the ex-if data.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.920]   Apple says that's very much intentional.
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:36.200]   It doesn't want you to think about how to get the best photo.
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:40.160]   The idea is the camera will just sort it out for you.
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:44.680]   By the time it's different than smart HDR, I guess that's important.
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:47.480]   By the time you press the shutter button, the camera's already got three frames.
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:50.360]   They talked about this on stage at a fast shutter speed.
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:52.000]   That's to freeze motion.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:50:01.080]   Press the shutter, it takes three more shots, and then one long exposure shot over exposed, probably, to capture detail.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:08.840]   The three regular shots in the long exposure shot are merged together into what they call a synthetic long.
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:14.360]   Then deep fusion picks the short exposure image with the most detail.
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:17.640]   It has three, remember.
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:25.240]   It emerges it with the synthetic long exposure, but it only merges those two frames.
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:31.880]   The two images are also processed for noise differently than smart HDR in a way that's better for deep fusion.
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:33.720]   Then that's not all.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:38.040]   The images are run through four detail processing steps.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:42.520]   This is all, by the way, in the blink of an eye, while you, you know, basically while you're looking at the picture.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:43.960]   Pixel by pixel.
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:46.840]   Each tailor do an increasing amount of detail.
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:49.560]   So this is where the machine learning comes in.
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:57.840]   The skies and the walls, lowest band, skin, hair, fabrics, the highest or sweaters, the highest band.
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:07.640]   And then this creates a series of weightings for how the two images are blended, taking detail from one and tone, color, and luminance from the other, then generating the final image.
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:10.320]   I presume Renee, that you already have this.
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.040]   You're a developer, baby, yes.
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:16.480]   Yeah, although it hasn't shown up for me yet, but Matthew Pansvino also has a really good write up on tech
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:20.680]   crunch where he gets into a lot of the details about how the two images are generated and merged.
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:22.320]   But it's really smart.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:28.440]   Like it takes those two final images and generates a double size, I think 24 megapixel final image out of it.
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:37.800]   And it's a little bit like I know some people really want to be able to manually control night mode and they can't or they want to manually control deep fusion and they can't.
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:39.400]   He has a good work around though.
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:45.760]   If you turn on what we were just talking about that magic crop, it turns off deep fusion because it's forcing the ultra wide to shoot
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:47.960]   and deep fusion can't use the ultra wide.
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:54.160]   So right now, because of that technical limitation, you have to choose between having the extra crop data or having deep fusion.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:56.280]   But you can play one off the other.
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:59.520]   I have to say, the sample images that apples provided.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:00.720]   Here's another guy in a sweater.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:02.760]   It's it's amazing.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.320]   I mean, because you can see an eyelash on one of the sweaters.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:06.480]   It is really astounding.
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:11.560]   Yeah, the details really good and that yet where you don't care about detail, it's fine.
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:20.240]   Neil, I says it takes about a second longer for the image to be processed, but that's a second is one thousand.
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:21.160]   One you can't beat it.
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:26.200]   Like when I was trying it at the at the event by the time you hit the gallery button, it's pretty much done.
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:30.360]   So like you'd have to be a super fast interface person to to even see the end bit of it.
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:30.880]   I think.
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:31.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:37.760]   And that's really something that Apple needs to be praised for in addition to the quality of the images that when the frustrating.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:43.600]   I think that my pixel camera takes really good pictures, but the number of times where it just takes all
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:51.560]   while to process something, the number of times where I can't get the next picture in as fast as I want to take it is just frustrating.
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:53:01.120]   The biggest fail of any camera, no matter who's designing it, no matter whether there's a phone or whether it's a traditional camera, is you press the button to take a picture and it does not take a picture.
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:12.240]   No matter what the excuses were as every single iPhone I've ever used from the very, very beginning when you press that that white button, it will take some kind of a picture that will never be anything less than good.
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:14.960]   And that's what a phone camera is supposed to be able to do.
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:16.280]   It's not necessary.
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:25.200]   All the extras that you can get in an app like Halide camera and everything you can do within the regular camera app to adjust exposure, change focus points, use different modes.
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:31.600]   Those are all great, but the whole purpose of a phone camera is here is a big white button.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:38.440]   And when you push this, you will get a picture that is not less than very good because that's what people use phone cameras for.
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:41.160]   I mean, people like me who are nerds for photography.
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:44.680]   They I love I love editing it on the device.
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:51.960]   I love putting it my my MacBook and then seeing what what all kinds of monkeying around with Photoshop can do.
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:54:01.440]   But people want a good snapshot of this place where they went to of the or their friends at this bar or their parents seeing their grandkid for the first time.
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:05.240]   They don't necessarily care that, Oh, well, the shadow details and very, very good.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:07.040]   Or there's a blown highlight right here.
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:10.720]   They want to make sure if they press this white button, all they got to do is press the button.
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.520]   They'll get a really, really good picture.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:25.600]   They don't want to they don't want to have to like shake the camera to figure out why is it kind of locked up right now and why is the the white button gray for the next for the next two or three seconds, which is what you get sometimes with Android cameras.
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:31.520]   So that's I don't want that to be lost in the shelf with all this technical stuff about what it's doing with machine learning and processing.
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:40.160]   The fact is push a white button, get a really good picture that's always been the thing that is almost exclusively a feature of the iPhone.
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:40.880]   Fundino.
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:42.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:49.360]   Panzareno Panzareno points out that while there this is actually a really good tip, make a note of this when you get deep fusion.
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:57.800]   There's currently no way to turn off the deep fusion process, but but because the over cropped feature of the new cameras uses the ultra wide.
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:08.440]   A small hack to see the difference between a deep fusion and not deep fusion is to turn on over crop, which will disable deep fusion.
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:11.120]   As it does not use the ultra wide lens.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.960]   Renee, would you explain what he just said to me?
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:13.720]   I don't understand.
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:15.320]   What is there?
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:21.480]   There's a hardware limitation where because there's no optical image stabilization and no focus pixels on the ultra wide.
[00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:23.280]   It's not used for a lot of the fancy stuff.
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:26.080]   It really is just a regular camera.
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:26.840]   It's not used for night mode.
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:28.040]   It's not used for any of those things.
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:31.880]   So when that is enabled, it can't do a lot of the extra things.
[00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:34.000]   But when you turn that off, it's going to.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.480]   So I'm not explaining this very well.
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:39.280]   Defusion can't have the ultra wide camera on at the same time.
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:45.320]   And the extra area data can't be used when diffusion is on.
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:48.280]   So you can pick between the two and which one ever one you pick is on.
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:52.480]   The other one turns off and remind you, how do we turn on the extra area data?
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:53.200]   Is that live?
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:54.160]   That was what we did before.
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:57.120]   When you went to the camera app and you said capture outside of capture.
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:01.520]   So if you turn that off, you'll have to turn that off to get any deep fusion.
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:02.720]   Yes.
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:04.240]   And if you turn it on, it turns off.
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.200]   So that's why Apple leaves that off by default.
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.920]   So I'm going to go back into my camera.
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:11.440]   No, they said they said that wasn't there was like other technical reasons.
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:12.920]   I understand his privacy based.
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:13.920]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:14.520]   You said that too.
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:16.560]   It'd be better for people to have it off.
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:17.800]   When do we get deep fusion?
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:21.200]   If it's in beta developer beta now, it's still a little ways off, right?
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:25.600]   Yeah, usually a couple for the dot the point releases were pretty fast, though.
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:29.200]   I mean, 3.1.1 came up at the torrid rate of point releases.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:29.800]   Who knows?
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:37.440]   They are they are paddling while not every story was cheerful and positive, of course.
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:42.640]   Apple has gotten a lot of heat from us and many others for how they've worked
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:48.760]   with China and Russia and other countries, in particular, the back and forth over
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:51.120]   the Hong Kong protest app.
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:59.760]   Last time we spoke, Apple had restored the app, HK map dot live that showed
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:02.720]   police presence in Hong Kong.
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.760]   They have now removed it again.
[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:06.160]   And I think finally removed it.
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:16.280]   Tim Cook said a memo to internally to Apple employees saying that the company
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:20.960]   had removed the app after receiving quote, credible information from the authorities,
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:25.240]   IE, the Hong Kong police, and people in Hong Kong that the app was being used
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:30.080]   maliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimize
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:32.560]   individuals of property where no police are present.
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:37.040]   As a result, Cook said the app violated Apple rules and local laws.
[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:39.880]   And so we have to pull it down.
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:45.240]   John Gruber was a little critical of that memo.
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:50.000]   As was Machea Glawsky, Machea is the creator of Pinboard.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.960]   His blog, idolwords.com has in the last few months been recording what's been
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:59.520]   going on in Hong Kong because he's on the ground and following the protests.
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:04.120]   Machea says the first application that the app was being used maliciously makes no
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:04.720]   sense at all.
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:08.080]   The app does not show the locations of individual officers at all.
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:13.720]   It shows general concentrations of police units with a significant lag.
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:18.320]   The app is aggregating reports from Telegram, Facebook and other sources.
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:20.320]   It beggars belief.
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:25.000]   Machea writes that a campaign to target individual officers would use a world
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.360]   readable crowdsourcing format like this.
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:29.800]   Uh, can Mr.
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:32.440]   Cook point to a single example of that?
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:33.280]   Can anyone?
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:37.160]   So he says it not only goes against the evidence, it goes against the
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:41.360]   documentary record of 18 weeks of protests and not even possible given the
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:42.960]   technical constraints of the app.
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:47.760]   He also says the second allegation that the app victimizes individuals and
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:49.560]   property where no police are present.
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:51.320]   He says, does Mr.
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:52.600]   Cook have any evidence for this claim?
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:54.480]   The app does not show an absence of police.
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:56.320]   It shows concentrations of police.
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:59:00.280]   So a Gruber concludes.
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:04.760]   I can't recall an Apple memo or statement that crumbles so quickly under scrutiny
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:09.160]   for a company that usually measures umpteen times before cutting anything.
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:12.120]   It's both sad and startling.
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.120]   Thoughts?
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:16.840]   No, I think I said something very similar.
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:20.760]   You usually see like a little drop of thoughts on flash and you think that
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:24.240]   you know, so much time and effort went into this and Apple's not been known for
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:24.880]   crisis PR.
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:29.560]   They've been known for very methodical, very thought out, almost bulletproof PR
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:34.040]   where you can disagree with it, but you can't just quickly say how it has no
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:35.600]   foundation or a substance.
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:39.600]   And this just came off as really fast and really fragile and very different
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:41.960]   than I think we've ever seen comms from Apple before.
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:44.040]   And remember, it wasn't public comms.
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:48.360]   It was intended for the Apple employees, but that doesn't always come out.
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:50.880]   Does all know, I think that those always come out.
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:51.160]   Yeah.
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:52.720]   It's a way of it.
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:53.680]   It's really about it.
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:57.960]   Should we impress release and the what really marked it as kind of gutless for me
[00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:02.160]   is that they didn't take a stand as we think it's the right thing to do at this
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.960]   time, given the situation in Hong Kong.
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:06.000]   It was we have to read.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.480]   We are we are our hands are tied.
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:13.760]   It violates local law and we are we always say that we have to obey local law
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:17.720]   and it violates app developer guidelines and we always say that things have to
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:20.360]   we have no opinion one way or another.
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.040]   It could be any country of anyone.
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.280]   It's like for heaven's sake.
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:26.200]   It's like just take a stand.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.640]   Even if it's a stand that you think you're going to get jumped on for, don't
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.160]   just say our hands are tied.
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.720]   It violates local laws.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.600]   Again, debatable.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.160]   It violates app guidelines.
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:41.920]   Well, again, look, are you going to take down the ways app because it shows
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:45.760]   people where police are staked out on highways so they can avoid speed tracks
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.560]   straps and drunk checkpoints.
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:50.720]   Are you it's it's again, it's just godless.
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:51.680]   Lori.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:54.280]   That that's exactly Andy.
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:58.400]   My the point I was going to make was just that the original when Apple
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:04.040]   originally pulled it, the developer said, you know, we're not giving where this
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:07.720]   is not an app to help you, you know, avoid the police.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:09.920]   This is not an app to help you find the place.
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.840]   This just shows some things.
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:15.880]   What you do with this information is is out of our hands.
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:22.360]   So Apple led it back into the app store under those under that that idea and then
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:28.000]   pulled it again because they have, you know, evidence that, you know, it's being
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:28.920]   used to hurt people.
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:33.040]   Well, you know, I have evidence that Tinder is used to rape people.
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:37.480]   So that doesn't mean anything, you know, that like just just because somebody is
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:41.080]   using it inappropriately from its original intent doesn't mean that it should be
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:45.560]   removed from the app store because then under under that circumstance, you'd
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:49.960]   have to pull a lot of things like you'd have to pull ways for, you know, showing
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:56.200]   where there's drunk DUI checkpoints like that, you know, it's the app itself is
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.160]   not committing an illegal act.
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:01.560]   It's what people are doing with it, which is out of the hand of the developer.
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:07.160]   And under their circumstances, Apple should have fought against the Chinese
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:11.800]   government's opinion that it's illegal, which I don't think it is.
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:17.440]   Well, let's also reflect on the fact that when they approved the app, the Chinese
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:22.280]   Communist Party newspaper had this editorial that was, I think I can't remember
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:25.960]   the headline off the top of my head, but it was all on the lines of our as Apple
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:26.880]   out of their minds.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:31.400]   And the text of the editorial was like I can't believe they're they're
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.800]   aligning themselves with hooligans and criminals.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:38.880]   And we have no, we should question their motives and we should and it's it's
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:42.880]   unbelievable stuff for them to take given that there will almost certainly be
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:45.160]   consequences for Apple in the future based on this.
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:51.240]   And I can't I believe that this this editorial with appropriate
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:54.960]   translation landed on the desks of people in Cupertino.
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.520]   And that might have influenced their decision.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:00.240]   It was aimed at them.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.400]   It was read this.
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:05.800]   This is what the Chinese government, this is what president she says.
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.280]   Now what are you going to do?
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:12.560]   It is startling how EU regulation cannot not affect change as much as a single
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:14.320]   sigh in the Chinese government.
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:18.080]   And you know, I don't want to re litigate it because we we spent a long
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:22.360]   time on Wednesday last Wednesday on this week in Google and again on Sunday
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.920]   on a twit talking about this.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:29.440]   And I don't you know, I want to I want to sit on the fence on this one.
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:33.320]   On the one hand, I feel like if you're an American company, you should stand up
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:34.960]   for freedom of speech, liberty.
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:38.880]   And and if you're in a country that is authoritarian and trying to sell products
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:42.400]   there, maybe you should think rethink your stance there.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:46.640]   On the other hand, Apple has a responsibility to a shareholders, if not
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:50.760]   at stakeholders, to a shareholders to make a lot of money.
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.320]   And there's no bigger market than the Chinese market.
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:55.200]   And they're making a lot of money there.
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:59.480]   And so, you know, they're not going to pull out of China.
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:04.240]   And that's really the choice is pull out of China or follow the laws in China.
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:08.080]   And I so I don't I don't it's a tough place to be.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:11.720]   I'd like to see more spine from Apple, but it's not me.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:12.760]   It's not my choice to make.
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:13.680]   It's their choice to make.
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:16.840]   Yeah, that that's that's true.
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:19.280]   And but the thing is, that's I keep saying this.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:22.040]   I don't know where the line is that Apple is not willing to cross when it comes to
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:22.800]   China.
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:26.400]   I wish I wish I could say that I knew that there's a line which they would say, no,
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.280]   we will absolutely we will absolutely not acquiesce to this.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:37.520]   And the fact that the fact that even the idea of complying with local laws in the
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:42.520]   United States of America, how many horrendous injustices in the past hundred years have
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:45.200]   been committed that was absolutely in line.
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:51.760]   Has actually been underscored and promoted by actual laws that help these injustices
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:52.280]   to happen.
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:56.680]   At some point they have to say, which not enough that that an app simply abides by
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:57.800]   our developer guidelines.
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.840]   It doesn't it's not enough to say that it's legal.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:02.440]   It does things that are legal in this country.
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:08.080]   At some point, Apple has to say either you have to say, here is lines we do not cross.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:12.800]   Here's why we're making these decisions or they have to stop pretending that they
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:17.000]   are actually for justice, that they are actually for freedom, that they are actually
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.600]   for privacy, because otherwise they have to really defend themselves against the
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:25.200]   argument that they are for these things when the optics are good and when it suits
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.240]   or running late, we'll get sorry.
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:30.320]   Sorry, I'm talking to somebody in the studio, not you.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:35.240]   I'm just telling folks in the studio that we're getting to right now and about half
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:36.080]   an hour running a little.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:36.440]   OK.
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:41.480]   And that's because we started Mac Break weekly, a little late because Leo goes on
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:41.800]   and on.
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.640]   And it's all my thing.
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:46.920]   Just worth pointing out is that Tim Cook gets into a lot of trouble because
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:48.200]   he believes in engagement.
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:51.960]   And I said last week, it sometimes engagement becomes a piece, and you have to be very
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:52.400]   careful.
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:53.280]   Yeah, it's a fun line.
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:56.600]   But there's editorial slamming him for for working with the Trump administration,
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:59.960]   the editorial slamming him for working with some of the governments that extract
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:02.720]   rare earth materials in Latin America and Africa.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:04.720]   And he he is very consistent in this.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:08.920]   But to Andy's point, there has to be a line because there are things.
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:10.400]   And it's not an Apple question.
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.720]   It's a tech question because we see.
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:12.680]   That's just a tech question.
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:16.600]   It's a question for American companies in general.
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:20.480]   And these broke my heart last week in many, many ways.
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:22.960]   And it's not going to and they've been doing it for for week.
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.040]   Like you, there's always like there was a story with, can you still use EMAX?
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.080]   Can you still use Android?
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:31.160]   Like what point do you have like, do you have your own sense of ethics and your
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:31.840]   sense of products?
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:33.240]   You may be on great example.
[01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:34.160]   Richard Stalma.
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:35.200]   Android is to now.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:35.720]   Richard Stalma.
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:36.360]   The Andy Rubin.
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:37.920]   Andy Rubin created Android.
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:46.440]   And and on and actually honestly, we're increasingly surrounded by authoritarian
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:47.480]   countries.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:52.720]   Are you just going to stop selling to everybody with Microsoft for having ice
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:55.880]   deals, but also for like being pro environment, but selling to a lot of
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:56.560]   anti environment.
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:00.920]   And yet the only tool consumers have, the only tool even journalists like us
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:05.880]   have is either is not buying the products and for us to call them out.
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:09.280]   I don't think Tim Cook would an Apple would be getting as much heat on this
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:13.480]   if they didn't constantly say how they stand up for privacy, freedom.
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:13.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:14.880]   You know, they.
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:20.080]   Liberty, yes, civil liberties, environmental causes of the Kennedy.
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:20.600]   Yeah.
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:23.320]   If they didn't say that over and over again, I don't know.
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.640]   I mean, nobody's yelling at Ford Motor Company.
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:26.160]   Nobody's.
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.000]   I mean, it's just.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.800]   I mean, Disney opened Disney Shanghai, right?
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:30.160]   Right.
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:31.800]   Like, but it's right.
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:35.320]   So I don't know what the answer is.
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:36.600]   It's there.
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:39.640]   This kind of opens up like a larger global discussion.
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:40.840]   I've mentioned this before.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.480]   Really, there isn't.
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:47.640]   There isn't a lot that you can argue against.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:50.680]   Adhering to regulations in a different country.
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:54.640]   You know, like I think I had mentioned that that becomes ethnocentric when we
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:57.800]   start trying to impose our beliefs on them, though there in some circumstances.
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.680]   I do think that we should try to impose our beliefs.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:05.160]   But to me, the more frightening thing, the thing that's bigger and deserves
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:09.880]   more conversation is how right now using this example, the Chinese government
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:15.920]   is influencing how we censor our own people here in the United States by banning
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:20.560]   people from, you know, Twitch, firing them for being a part of the interview, by
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:24.520]   finding NBA players for speaking out.
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:30.360]   Like these, this is censoring people in the US because of influence from an outside
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:30.720]   country.
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:34.600]   That to me is much bigger than we're pulling an app from the Chinese app store.
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:35.560]   That's their own country.
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:36.440]   That's their own thing.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:37.280]   It is big.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:41.880]   But bigger is that we're allowing another country to censor us because of
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:43.400]   because of finance, because of money.
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:45.680]   And it's going to happen more and more and more and more, by the way.
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:46.280]   Yeah.
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:48.920]   And that's that's very frightening to me.
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:54.440]   It sounded from everybody's reports that this was the MacBook Pro we've
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:57.040]   been waiting for, that they fixed the keyboard.
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.840]   They fixed the thermals.
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:05.600]   So the I-9 in this is is is is given you its full juice, a new speaker system,
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.400]   which is supposedly really good.
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:09.240]   Renee, you love it, I think.
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:12.280]   Yeah, I've been using it for about a week now.
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:14.600]   And it's like, I'll get out of the way up front.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.680]   I think the webcam is in a front to the machine.
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:17.960]   It's still 7.20.
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:18.960]   What's the deal?
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:19.800]   And it does nothing.
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:24.800]   It does nothing for like if this camera was 1080p or 4k, I could use it for
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:28.000]   mobile video production because the microphone, while not outstanding, is like
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.400]   is is really USB, like it's pretty good.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:33.240]   You ask people to compare it to a Yeti or something like that.
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:34.240]   It's certainly good.
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:35.480]   And you can do a 5.6.
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:36.360]   You could do a podcast.
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.240]   Those are the two dings.
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:42.960]   And it's not Wi-Fi 6, which is weird because even the iPhone 11 is is Wi-Fi 6,
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.640]   the new 802.11.
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:45.240]   The Apple does.
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:46.440]   So we ask something to complain about.
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:48.480]   It's just it's that one thing every time.
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:51.840]   You know, it probably has more to do with chipsets than anything else, right?
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:52.360]   Yes.
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:54.320]   So let's say everything else is my wish list.
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.080]   Let's see if they did everything I wanted them to do.
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:59.280]   It really it really is the system seven of Macbooks.
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:02.360]   It's because the logo is it sucks less.
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:07.720]   Now I got the the darker one of the two that or did I?
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.160]   Yeah, that's slight.
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:12.200]   It's not quite as dark as the expected.
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.760]   It's it's almost aluminum, isn't it?
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.760]   I yeah, that's the darker one.
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:17.360]   It is.
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.160]   But it's but it's really over though.
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.160]   It's real pretty.
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:21.600]   I think it's very nice.
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:23.640]   Is the is the hinge changed as well?
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.000]   I think it is.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.600]   It's just a little taller because the thing is a little deeper.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:28.120]   Yeah.
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.760]   But you get you get space blocks,
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:30.760]   a space gray sticker is Leo.
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:31.560]   That's the important thing.
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:32.360]   What?
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:33.720]   Oh, that's worth it.
[01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:34.800]   That's worth every penny.
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:36.560]   And it's already booty.
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:37.560]   And it's already booty.
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.080]   Yeah, look at that key.
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:43.760]   For me, the separate escape key is also important because I use e-backs.
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:46.760]   So I actually use this gate key.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:48.360]   So that's that's pretty cool.
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:52.160]   Apple shouted out Vim during the demo or or Vim or V.I.
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:52.760]   Absolutely.
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:53.040]   Yes.
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:53.400]   Escape.
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:54.720]   He's really important in V.I.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:58.760]   Also, they've separated out the fingerprint reader.
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:00.840]   So it's just kind of a separate button from the touch.
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:01.360]   Yeah.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.160]   The keys, caps is I don't have to recapitulate.
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.400]   Everybody knows all of this.
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:09.000]   Oh, it's talking to me.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   Hey, I see.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000]   Yeah, you haven't you haven't clicked the button fast enough.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:12.760]   I see.
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:13.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:17.480]   It talks about new arrow keys that are just like old arrow keys.
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:18.200]   And the way they should be.
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:22.760]   You know, I that's all anybody wanted was a 2015 Mac book with a new Intel
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:24.360]   processors, right?
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.360]   That's it.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:26.160]   Yeah.
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:31.000]   There were it's really all they had to do was say, let's take all the bad
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:36.040]   ideas we put in three years ago and not actively make it stink now.
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:37.720]   Let's just we don't have to innovate.
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:39.520]   We don't have to even iterate.
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:40.920]   We don't have to have courage.
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:45.640]   We just have to say, let's take a look at the design that has worked for every
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:50.520]   computer used by a human who types with fingers and emulate that instead of
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:55.280]   anticipating humans having different sorts of hands in the next thousand years.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.480]   So yeah, the the inverted T is a big.
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:03.520]   I was kind of surprised by how how welcoming the new keyboard was simply
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:06.840]   about virtue of the fact that it doesn't seem like it's off balance.
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:09.240]   And there was something about the touch bar that really just rendered
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:14.080]   everything like it's tilted to the left a little bit, having the escape key
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:17.840]   that's anchoring the upper left hand corner and as visual creatures, we
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:20.920]   start at the top left of things and work our way down and right.
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.800]   So when there's something when the first thing you see on a keyboard isn't
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:27.480]   there, that's discombobulating the in again, going back to a
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:32.640]   standard inverted T configuration of the arrow keys, just let's make this familiar
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:36.560]   again. They didn't have the keyboard is better.
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:44.040]   I will I now I am now so relieved that I no longer have to say that I there's no
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:48.400]   way in how I can imagine myself buying a MacBook anytime in the future because
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:52.920]   the key the keyboards of all the other Mac books were just like I'm saying, a non
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:55.120]   starter. This one, it's not a great keyboard.
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:58.600]   It's not even particularly good keyboard, but it's an adequate keyboard at least.
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:02.400]   It won't it won't be the reason if I if if I don't buy another MacBook,
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:05.960]   the keep it won't be specifically because the keyboard, which is not a deal
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:09.120]   breaker, which is it's it sounds like it's it sounds like the most faint
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:11.560]   praise backhanded compliment I could possibly make.
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:15.120]   But really, I'm just excited by the fact that, okay, we have a workable
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:18.400]   keyboard and that and that and that trackpad is that's got to be the biggest
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.560]   trackpad Apple has ever put on anything.
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:25.040]   It is. So I remember the last time I compared the trackpad
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:27.920]   to the iPhone and it was about iPhone size.
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:32.120]   Let's just put the iPhone on the trackpad today and oh, yeah, it's it's
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:36.320]   considerably it's it's the iPhone plus an extra inch.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:39.000]   You know, that's that's a big on the top.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.280]   That's a so it's the width of the iPhone's height and it's maybe a three
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:44.480]   quarters of an inch taller.
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:46.000]   That's that's a big trackpad.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.480]   Yeah, I don't think it was.
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:50.040]   Apple's planned all the way along though, right?
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.360]   Put out rollout.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.080]   All these changes that everybody's going to hate for three years.
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:57.560]   And then when we rolled this machine out, we don't have to worry about them
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:58.840]   complaining about no wife.
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:03.480]   Six because because because as we all know in business history,
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:06.960]   new Coke was such a shot in the arm for co-classic.
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:09.880]   It was worthy of emulation by the by the most valuable tech.
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:13.120]   All right. I'm going to type on it the first time and I what I'm going to do
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:18.440]   is a password because passwords are my best way of judging accuracy
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:22.960]   on a keyboard because if I have to re type the password a bunch of times,
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:27.480]   that drives me nuts and I have very weird passwords and I type
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.480]   actually do it on camera.
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.360]   So everybody can see me.
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:30.520]   Yeah, I just did by accident.
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:31.720]   It's okay.
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:33.000]   It's just a Wi-Fi password.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.720]   It's not you won't gain any real benefit.
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:37.840]   Yeah, it feels better.
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.000]   It doesn't you're right, Andy.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000]   It's not the 15.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.600]   It's not a Lenovo ThinkPad, but the 25.
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:45.840]   But it's good.
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.840]   It's almost twice the key travel.
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:48.960]   Isn't it like 1.0?
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:49.640]   1 millimeter.
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:50.160]   Yeah.
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:50.720]   Yeah.
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:53.880]   And I actually like the spacing.
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:15:01.040]   So I think, you know, it's Ben Thompson on Stutecary had an interesting article
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:04.880]   today about Apple and the perils.
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:07.960]   Really, he talked about the perils of being dominant.
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:11.160]   He said, I don't like to use the word monopoly as a technical term,
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:15.480]   but in this in effect, Apple has a monopoly on iOS and Mac OS products.
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:19.200]   And he said, the problem with that is people are going to continue to buy.
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:25.240]   They've sold more than $90 million worth of Mac books since the keyboard debacle.
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:26.800]   People are going to continue to buy.
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:30.200]   You're not going to get the signal you would get if there were a choice, because
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:33.800]   even if people hate it, you can kind of kid yourself.
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:35.600]   Oh, no, they like it.
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:38.600]   It's just a few lab mouths because they are buying it.
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.840]   So there's a peril.
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:44.680]   And I think that was his point to being so successful.
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:45.920]   And we this is nothing new.
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:47.120]   We've known this for some time.
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:50.080]   So Ben is a genius.
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:51.560]   So far for me to second guess him.
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:56.080]   But it's not an exact parallel, but you have companies like Nintendo who, you know,
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:59.800]   they make the Wii and then they make the Wii U and then they come back and they make
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:05.080]   the switch. And the danger is, you know, Apple takes these big swings.
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:06.800]   Steve Jobs used to call them Babe Ruth swings.
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:09.720]   And a lot of times they hit it, you know, they don't make very few phones.
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:11.000]   They make very few computers.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.240]   They don't work like Dell or HP.
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:17.720]   But when they miss, you know, that ball goes flying by them and that's the risk.
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:21.240]   And I don't want them to stop swinging because a lot of times when they do take
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:23.440]   those swings, they make really innovative things.
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.560]   Like I think the force touch trackpad, that was a risk.
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:29.480]   They made the best track pads in the business and they reengineered them.
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:31.560]   And you can debate whether you like the size or not.
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:35.160]   But I think from a technological point of view, these new touch pads are way better
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:36.280]   than what they had before.
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:39.200]   And they had the same confidence level going into these keyboards.
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:42.800]   And they're one of their issues is that they get pushed back on almost any
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:44.160]   change. They don't change anything.
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:46.920]   People say they're not innovating, but when they do change things, people don't
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:48.200]   like it because we're changed adverse.
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:51.360]   And sometimes they're going to be right and the new way is going to be better.
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:53.840]   And after like a couple of days of us getting used to it, we'll say, hey, I kind
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:54.360]   of like this.
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:57.600]   But when it's wrong, they're still in the mentality of, oh, you know, they're
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:00.760]   just still getting used to it and they're going to see the same things, the same
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:02.960]   good qualities that we see in it, they're going to see in it.
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:07.280]   And that just makes when it's wrong, it's like they double down on the wrong.
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:11.200]   And then it takes them an extra cycle to get back on and rebuild a keyboard or
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:11.560]   something.
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:16.120]   So in light of that, this is a pretty amazing thing for a company like Apple, a
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:20.520]   dominant company, a very, very successful company to say, yeah, maybe we did make
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:21.000]   a mistake.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.560]   Now they're not going to say that out loud because all the other books don't
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:25.760]   have the whole keyboard.
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:26.880]   But is it?
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:31.960]   This is, I think this is, it's new Coke unprecedented that Apple would say, okay.
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:37.280]   We give they rolled back on the RAM to like they were all in on low power RAM
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:40.280]   and just the LPDDR four did not come and it did not come.
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:43.640]   And now they've gone back to DDR4 RAM and they've had to increase battery to
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:49.760]   compensate for it, but they've gone up to like 64 megabytes of RAM, eight
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:51.560]   terabytes of SSD.
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:55.000]   They also, you know, they thought that we're going to get to 10 nanometers and
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.880]   they thought we're going to get to 10 nanometers and we're still not at 10
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:58.400]   nanometers.
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:01.200]   Now they've redone the thermals and they could always burst.
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:04.160]   They could always deliver the I9 at burst speeds, but now they can deliver it
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.760]   for longer sustain as well.
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:11.200]   So in many ways, it's a regression and it's a very pragmatic regression given the
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:14.160]   lack of advancement in the silicon that I think that they were counting for.
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:17.120]   And they've also done a really good job in totally abstracting away that
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:17.480]   silicon.
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:20.600]   So if you look at a modern Mac, it's got a layer of metal onto it and most
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:24.280]   people wouldn't realize when it's hitting those GPUs or the CPUs and they're
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:28.680]   shoving a bunch of stuff onto the T2 chip now like HEVC N code decode that
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:31.000]   doesn't still doesn't work well on Intel.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.800]   So they're shoving all that onto the, I was equivalent to an A10 processor
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:38.520]   inside the computer and it's sort of it's sad because I'd love to see a Mac
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:42.920]   where we did get 10 nanometer cannon lakes like three, two, three years ago
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:44.880]   and I'll end DDR4 two, three years ago.
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:49.560]   But I think this is this is them fixing their mistakes and also doing their best
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:53.160]   to work around the general lethargy of the x86 silicon.
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:19:01.160]   It sounds it sounds like they for most the most part kind of are took the
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:02.920]   correct the turn in the correct direction.
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:04.040]   Is that a fair way to put it?
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:06.320]   Yeah.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:09.920]   Oh, away from the ground away from the mountains into the sky.
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:12.880]   Having having typed a little bit and I have to say a little bit on this
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.280]   keyboard. Yeah, you're right, Andy.
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:15.800]   It's not the 2015 keyboard.
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:16.800]   I did on I fix it.
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.560]   They said, Oh, yeah, it's pretty much identical.
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.080]   It doesn't feel like that.
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:21.640]   The travels different.
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:22.840]   It has a different.
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:26.440]   So the the scissor mechanism is very it's very, very similar to the magic
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:27.640]   keyboard that comes with the iMac.
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:31.080]   It they just had to reengineer it because the iMac keyboard is slightly
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:32.480]   angled and this one is flat.
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:32.840]   Right.
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:36.040]   And what they ended up doing because they they still really, really believe
[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:39.840]   in in not having it be very loose if you hit it on the sides.
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:41.440]   So they rearchitected the rubber.
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:45.040]   It's gone back to using a rubber dome and they rearchitected slightly so that
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:48.160]   when you get to max when you get to max up key travel, you got to punch a
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:51.240]   little bit to push it back down and that equalizes stability for them.
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:52.160]   It feels pretty good.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:54.720]   It's not it definitely seems a little bit quieter.
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:58.840]   Yeah, I think it's I think you you nail it, Andy.
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:19:59.720]   It's good enough.
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:01.960]   Yeah, it's not it's not a bad keyboard at all.
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:04.040]   It doesn't distinguish itself either way.
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:08.040]   And again, after the past few iterations, I'm happy with it.
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:12.000]   Just not, you know, you don't you're you're hoping when you when you get
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.440]   behind the wheel of a new car that the steering wheel doesn't surprise you
[01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:17.000]   at all.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:17.400]   Right.
[01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:18.960]   You don't want to see any innovation there.
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:19.200]   Right.
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:22.120]   You want to see a round thing that responds to you doing this to it.
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.200]   And the keyboard is I think the exact same thing.
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:28.760]   You really can't quote innovate and quote because you're you're you're taking
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:33.400]   away the best feature of that that component, which is consistency and
[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:38.880]   reliability in the face of whatever whatever mandate you think that you're pursuing there.
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:43.480]   I point you to Marco Armin's blog post Marco.
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.600]   He came in with teleporously.
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:46.960]   It was the most amazing thing.
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:48.480]   He's pretty happy.
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:55.560]   He said he had a list, a wish list to fix the Mac book pro, many of which were not, you
[01:20:55.560 --> 01:21:01.920]   know, fixed, but he says really it came down to the keyboard for me and they fixed that.
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:05.480]   So he he says, I couldn't be I couldn't be happier.
[01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:07.760]   They didn't move the headphone jack to the other side.
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:10.320]   And some of the things he was hoping for.
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:12.000]   I'm on cloud nine.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.200]   Look at this glorious keyboard and escape.
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:18.840]   Inverted Tiro keys, a millimeter of key travel.
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:21.160]   It's funny.
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:27.520]   It's funny that we were talking about it as if, you know, the heavens have opened.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:33.680]   But the truth is I think a lot of people I'll include myself want to use Mac books.
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.400]   We want to love Mac books.
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:39.560]   We love Mac OS and we want to use Mac books and for Apple to do something.
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:47.120]   So as Ben Thompson called it user hostile with the keyboard was a real show stopper.
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:50.440]   That was a show.
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:52.000]   Microsoft makes that keyboard.
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.520]   You can just go buy a Dell or go buy a Lenovo or go buy anything else with.
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:59.280]   If you want to use Mac OS, you can't like you're stuck with whatever Apple gives you.
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:01.000]   And that's a far greater responsibility.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.760]   Yeah, that's a real challenge.
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:05.560]   It didn't that didn't upgrade for several years, right?
[01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:12.080]   Because of this and held on hoping for this moment, but not necessarily expecting it, you know,
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:17.960]   when it came, like you, a lot of folks, I think, thought we were into 2020 before we saw this.
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:22.400]   And so I mean, I think they're going to sell a lot of these, but I think they would have
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:27.560]   sold a lot more of the previous iteration had they not taken this particular detour.
[01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:29.840]   But, you know, we would have found something else to complain about.
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.120]   Oh, we always will.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:37.560]   I would have boy cotted, but I and I did keep my 2015 for many more years than I would have
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:40.680]   liked to, but kind of as part of the job, I bought the Mac book.
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:44.200]   I bought a MacBook i9 MacBook Pro last year.
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:48.960]   I bought a MacBook Air ended up using only the MacBook Air because that seemed to have
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:51.040]   the least undesirable keyboard.
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:55.560]   But I'm really I'm ready to retire all of the above for this one.
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:59.200]   I should point out that there are some people who are really angry about like people who
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:22:59.920]   love there.
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:01.160]   I like the butterfly keyboard.
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:01.920]   I didn't love it.
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:04.520]   But like my Twitter feed is filled with the better not have changed the keyboard.
[01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:05.960]   I'm not going to go back to the old field.
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:11.280]   I hated those old key and you know, Apple will tell you they have a segment of people who really
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:11.880]   love it.
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:17.000]   And I really like it, but I still maintain that it's not nobody hated the old keyboard.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.280]   And you can't have a keyboard again with one manufacturer that some people really like.
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:23.120]   And others actively hate its breathing guts.
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:25.640]   That's just not terrible for a single vendor product.
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:29.240]   But there are a group of people who are angry and put out by the mushiness.
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:31.360]   They return to the mushiness of the keyboard.
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:33.280]   I think that's hilarious, but they exist.
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:36.160]   That has to be an arnie.
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:41.320]   No, there when you look at the actual numbers, like again, Apple won't disclose them, but
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:42.880]   the these sold better than any.
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:46.400]   What Apple sold well, but again, that's what Ben Thompson was saying, or they're
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:50.800]   going to sell well because there are people who have a man was wrong is that they sold
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:55.000]   well, like they sold astronomically better because there was a huge amount of people who
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.560]   wanted a MacBook Air Pro, but Apple just did not provide a MacBook Pro on top of that.
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:01.080]   But that's not a very large segment.
[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:05.600]   They sold well, people really liked them, but they had I still maintain it.
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:07.800]   Doesn't matter if it's like 50% of people like them.
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:09.880]   You can't have a keyboard that 50% of people hate.
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:12.080]   But it doesn't work.
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:16.240]   And I think that you hit it on the head earlier by talking about it's harder for
[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:21.240]   because Apple really doesn't have any competition in the notebook or desktop space
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:23.160]   because let's face it.
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:28.680]   You can't buy Mac OS hardware that is not made by Apple.
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:32.040]   So it's very, very easy to point to numbers and say, well, look, we're still selling
[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:32.680]   lots of them.
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:34.480]   Look, how many pre-orders there are for the new one.
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:39.600]   Hey, look, look how excited people are for their new innovative cylindrical Mac
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:39.960]   Pro.
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:41.840]   We are building things that we do.
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:42.960]   We do our research.
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:43.720]   We do our homework.
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:46.080]   We're not just simply doing style over substance.
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:49.320]   We were building things that people want, but it's hard to get the numbers on.
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:56.320]   Yes, but imagine that there was a simple, very dull, gray, even beige metal box with
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:01.320]   the power with the power and the expandability that people wanted for $300 less.
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:06.760]   Then see how much you're in how much people are appreciating your innovation
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:10.240]   and how much they love the cylindrical design and the lack of a fan and the lack
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:11.080]   of upgradability.
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:14.720]   So yeah, Apple is unique.
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:17.360]   That's one of the reasons why we love them so much.
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.840]   They do so many things that no other company can possibly do.
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:23.280]   But of course, that does come with problems that no other company really has to deal
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:24.280]   with and response.
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:26.760]   Yeah, they put it on the spoon and we have to eat it.
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:28.560]   There's no right.
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:30.000]   That's just how it is.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.520]   We don't get to hold the spoon.
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:34.280]   We don't get to see where the spoon was before.
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:37.560]   We just take it when they put it in our mouths and we say, thanks.
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:38.720]   Can we please have some more?
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:39.280]   Please.
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:39.640]   No.
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:41.040]   Exactly.
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:42.800]   I love it.
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:44.600]   Anyway, I'm very happy.
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:45.920]   I haven't heard the speakers yet.
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:46.960]   Should I play the?
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:48.120]   Should I play something through?
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:49.520]   It's like a mini-hole poddly.
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:50.440]   It was really remarkable.
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:53.200]   Yeah, especially how flat that damn thing is.
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:59.840]   I'm still going through the interminable setup and I'm trying to do this, you know, while we're
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:02.640]   while we're talking, I'm almost done.
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:04.480]   I think I just chose dark mode.
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:10.080]   They put Dave could explain this better than I could, but they put a subwoofer
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:15.200]   back to back and drivers back to back to cancel out the vibrations while keeping the audio to sound.
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:21.120]   Yeah, because you don't want to machine that's shaking while you're listening to Kanye.
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:23.200]   Well, no, that makes sense, right?
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:27.200]   Because if you put it out of phase, then that way it would keep the thing from
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:29.040]   but you still it still sounds like bass.
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:29.920]   Correct.
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:30.320]   Interesting.
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:30.480]   Yeah.
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:31.440]   All right.
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:32.400]   I have to think about this.
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:32.880]   That makes sense.
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:32.880]   Yeah.
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:33.840]   Because I need to place.
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:34.640]   I didn't realize they'd done that.
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:35.440]   That's pretty cool, right?
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:35.920]   Yeah.
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:37.600]   I need to place those two levels deeper on that.
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:40.000]   I forget what the scale is, but it goes two levels lower.
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:41.600]   On bass than the previous one.
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:45.280]   Immediately there's updates available, of course.
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:47.760]   And they said because they know where your head is in relation to it,
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:50.560]   they don't they don't have to do everything that a home pod does because a home pod tries to
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:51.680]   fill the entire room.
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:54.560]   It doesn't know where you are, so it has to try to spatially place things.
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:56.080]   But this has Dolby Atmos.
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:01.200]   It has the Apple system, the custom system that works to make non-Atmos content sound more like
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:01.760]   Atmos.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:04.880]   And it does all of it assuming you're generally sitting in front of it with your head,
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:08.320]   you know, positioned over it so it can play sound in three dimensions around you.
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:09.440]   All right.
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:09.920]   Yeah.
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:12.640]   Uh, I'm already a subscriber to Apple Music.
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:16.240]   Are you looking for Kanye, Leo?
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:19.600]   I'm just trying to get some Kanye as any as one does.
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:21.680]   I was using Donald Williams.
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:22.800]   I think you some churching up.
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:24.240]   Well, yeah.
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:30.080]   Part of the problem is YouTube now is really finicky about the use of any commercial music at all.
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:32.560]   Oh, it's the copa stuff.
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:36.240]   Leo can't even upload to YouTube most days now because the copa warnings pop up so often.
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:39.520]   Are your, are your, are your shows child attractive?
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:40.800]   No, but it doesn't say that.
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:44.240]   Like it's just like warning this, warning that like, you go to our new uploader,
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:46.240]   new uploader is not working, doesn't load in error.
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:48.480]   I'm a little nervous about that.
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:51.120]   We probably have kids watching.
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:55.200]   And the laws are ambiguous, which is the best thing you want when you
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:56.720]   craft new laws about this kind of stuff.
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:57.280]   All right.
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:57.760]   All right.
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:58.560]   What should I play?
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.480]   Let's see.
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:01.840]   What did I listen to last night?
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:03.200]   The Beach Boys.
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:04.320]   That doesn't show.
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:05.200]   I play some beach boys.
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:06.400]   What needs to have some bass.
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:07.200]   It would be nice.
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:07.840]   How about some?
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:08.880]   Yeah.
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:09.920]   But I can't, right?
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:10.960]   You played some Beach Boys.
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:11.760]   Oh, right.
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:12.160]   You can't.
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:12.160]   Yeah.
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:12.720]   Yeah.
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:14.320]   Classical.
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:14.560]   Yeah.
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:15.680]   But even then there's.
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:17.280]   Eight to the 1812 Overture.
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:17.920]   All right.
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:22.400]   I'll give you, I'll give you permission to play a fling song, Leo.
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:28.240]   I have the rights to, to grant that permission because I, I happen to know the songwriters.
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:28.640]   Okay.
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:28.960]   Okay.
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.000]   Plan a plan.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.600]   People sit on Apple music though, Dave.
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:31.840]   Is it?
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:32.160]   Yes.
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:34.400]   You got to play my album and you got to play Renee's album.
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:35.840]   Yeah.
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:39.760]   Well, I could say now a couple of months in on that 16-inch MacBook Pro.
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:41.120]   I love it.
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:42.240]   Apple did everything right.
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:43.360]   What a great keyboard.
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.440]   It's super fast, super quiet.
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:50.400]   I agree with Renee, the sound that comes out of that 16-inch MacBook Pro is great.
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:54.640]   I waited all year for Apple to announce the 16-inch gave up.
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:56.880]   I thought they'd never do it.
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:57.840]   They finally did.
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:04.000]   And I guess we should end this best of Mac break quickly with a big thank you to Apple.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.720]   You've made it a very interesting year.
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:11.280]   I hope you've enjoyed these little clips, these memories from 2019.
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:16.560]   We love doing Mac break weekly and we'll be back just a week or two from now.
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:16.960]   Let's see.
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:23.040]   This is, yeah, next week we'll be back with Andy, Renee, Lori Gill, and Mac break weekly.
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.080]   We'll see you then.
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:24.560]   Okay.
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:25.520]   And happy holidays.
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:26.320]   Happy New Year.
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:39.200]   [Music]
