[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.160]   shouldn't really call a Mac break weekly because we really don't talk about the
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.520]   Mac at all anymore. iOS weekly or something. Joining us from Tampa Florida
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.240]   ladies and gentlemen I give you in the brown trunks. Mr. Alex Lindsey. It's
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.400]   hot. It's humid. It is. Yeah. Work in there right not on vacation. No I'm
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.560]   working here. Yeah. And it's very stormy here. We landed on one I think we
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.160]   landed on one tire last night. It was kind of really I send my wife I always
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.000]   send her a text that I'm safely in whatever city I'm in. I did safely in
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.520]   Tampa but I didn't send it until we actually landed because it was a
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.680]   little rough safely in Tampa. Also with us from Bast in Massachusetts. Mr.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.400]   Andy and not go of the Chicago Sun time. How are you?
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.440]   I agree with you. I think Alex still reading still reading the PDFs from the
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.480]   trial. Still trying to keep up. We're going to and I was right as before I left
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.360]   to come down to the studio. I was reading like the live blog of the jury
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.400]   instructions. Can you believe they're live blogging this now? Isn't that? Yes.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:06.200]   Isn't it awesome? It's kind of amazing. So we're talking about Sam
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.080]   Sung held hostage day 57. It's Apple versus Samsung closing arguments began
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:19.040]   today. The highlight of the week though Judge Lucy Coe with the jury out asking
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:26.640]   one of the Apple attorneys if they're smoking crack. The apparently the Apple
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.600]   attorneys gave her a 75 page brief covering 22 potential rebuttal witnesses
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.200]   that the company might want to call after Samsung finished presenting its case
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.040]   which it did last week. The jury was out of the courtroom. Judge Coe said why would
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.080]   you forgive me such a lengthy document when unless you're smoking crack you
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.040]   know these witnesses aren't going to be called Apple attorney William Lee steps
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.760]   forward. This is all from the Verge which apparently has a reporter in the
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.320]   courtroom saying first year honor I'm not smoking crack. I can promise you that.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.120]   Oh my goodness. That is in a courtroom and then the next step was Samsung
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.120]   subpoenaed your analysis results because it was entering new evidence. Well new
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.560]   evidence. Yeah I wouldn't be surprised because both sides are pulling out every
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.920]   stop here. I've never heard a judge talk about someone smoking crack so I found
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.480]   that. I'm stunned. Obviously Judge Coe is just like she's had it. It's like yeah
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.280]   can we have that. Can we can we she said she told him Cook and the CEO of Samsung
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.000]   whose name I can't pronounce you guys you got to settle this so they had a phone
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.800]   call you remember at the beginning of the trial they also had a phone call
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:46.560]   Judge Coe says quote it's time for peace. Obviously she's not been paying attention
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:54.400]   during the trial. She she she said I see risks here for both sides which is an
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.520]   important point. I'm sure the judge has been aware of this as we have all along
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.800]   that both Samsung and Apple have had to reveal stuff that they wouldn't like to
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.640]   reveal that you know Samsung runs a risk of as as high as a two point seven
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:16.520]   five billion dollar damages claim. I don't know what the risk is for Apple except
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.800]   maybe public relations. I don't know unless unless they lose and then Samsung
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.480]   could counter sue right. I talked to a corporate trial attorney about this because
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.360]   I wondered why this close to the end of the end of the this close to jury
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.600]   deliberations that the judge would actually say something like that out loud
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.000]   and he offered an opinion to me that some judges can have a really good way of
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.040]   testing the temperature of a jury and saying that if you want if both of you
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.320]   want a positive outcome to this you will find a way to at least agree on what
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.600]   the result will be before you have a result handed down and inflicted upon
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.200]   you. Sometimes that means the person who thinks that they've scored points is
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.880]   got but to lose badly. Sometimes it means that this this jury is not going to be
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.840]   able to find it not going to be able to find anything and they're going to have
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.360]   to start all over again. He couldn't the person I was talking to couldn't really
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.400]   elaborate on that. He was just he just said that sometimes if you're inside the
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.240]   courtroom and you have the experience with this you can tell them the judge is
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.600]   trying to signal to the to the to the attorneys that I believe I know something
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.320]   you don't know and I think it'll be best for the entire cause of justice as well
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.040]   as my overburden docket if you find a Ramada in conference room you can stay
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.400]   in for the next two days and hammer some agreement out. They talked they
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:34.760]   talked attorney Kevin Johnson for Samsung said the CEOs did speak there was no
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:40.840]   resolution just as there hadn't been when they talked about the talk that they
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.920]   had though was well do you think we're gonna work this out now and I don't think
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.840]   we're gonna work that out.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:53.240]   Danish? I'm not sure. I'm not sure I could see Samsung saying look let's let's
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.360]   settle this this is not good for either of us Apple saying we agree but but
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.240]   you guys have got to give us you know $30 a phone which is I think what Apple
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:08.760]   said it was getting for the patents and the trade dress and we want damages and
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:15.240]   you have to stop selling the Nexus the Samsung Galaxy tab the Galaxy S3 and
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.080]   whatever else you ever make in the US and at that point what are they gonna say
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.520]   I think Apple doesn't have I mean other than the money they're spending on this
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.080]   I mean Apple doesn't have a lot of downside here there if they if they don't
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.400]   continue this case then they haven't set the precedent that people can
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:36.560]   copy it if they win the case and they they so not not settling and losing is
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.960]   unsettling almost the same for Apple in the same way but if if they win this
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.640]   case it it it will ripple through the entire you know industry because suddenly
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.200]   there's a precedent and suddenly it's going to create all kinds of issues for
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.400]   everyone else using the platform well that's the risk right Apple could lose
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.160]   so Apple win Apple giving up is no is you know Apple loses then everyone's
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.200]   gonna make phones that look like the iPhone and Apple have to compete on a
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.280]   on you know on that plane is not gonna lose Apple's not gonna lose though they're
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.120]   not gonna lose this one right and Apple wins it means that everybody has to be
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.240]   thinking about every time they build the phone they have to be thinking and
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.240]   rethinking and be thinking how this works because now those precedent Tim Cook
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.640]   has to be sitting there saying we you're exactly what you say we can't lose this
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:23.240]   even if we lose it's not the end of the world but we aren't gonna lose and Samsung
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.320]   why would Samsung not settle do they not feet you know one thing Samsung might
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.040]   be thinking is that it will be a puric victory for Apple that Apple will lose
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:35.640]   but there will be no fines and no injunctions against product and and and
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.720]   Samsung would win if they could if they could pay even a billion dollars and
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:44.080]   continue to sell their products right that's a win for Samsung but I think if
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.440]   they lose I think that the issue is they get injunctions and I think that that's
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.640]   I mean an Apple would it seems like Apple would roll up and start hitting
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.960]   everybody else I mean this is this is once they have the this ruling behind
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.640]   them and with the victory you know it's it's not just Samsung it's effective it's
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:06.480]   every Android you know platform it's not even and every Android platform it
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.720]   really is every phone remember every phone remember that we we were all talking
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.920]   about how wonderfully different Microsoft's Metro based phones and tablets are
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.480]   really excuse me I have I don't speak for everybody else here but remember that
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.440]   it's not only that they were different because they are signed an agreement
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.840]   that they said they would not do anything that's similar to the iPhone in the
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.720]   iPad they also have cross licensing agreements with Apple so what Apple is
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.400]   essentially saying and it's hard to avoid this conclusion is that you're
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.560]   right every the every the every company in the world they're right to produce a
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.280]   phone or a tablet comes through Apple and so if you do not approach Apple and ask
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.600]   for permission to make a phone or a tablet you're gonna be vile you're
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.320]   gonna be subject to for each future legal action the PDF I was talking about
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.040]   last night the presentation that Apple gave to Samsung in 2010 when they
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.560]   attempted to resolve this by offering them licensing terms again ranging from
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.880]   22 to something like $50 per handset as really it didn't just say all Android
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.360]   devices or all phones that are similar in trade dress to the iPhone it actually
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.880]   even apply to every Nokia phone they made everything that was that did not
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:16.960]   have you know like a 12-digit LCD panel on it as as it screened Apple was
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.120]   saying at least in this document that they believe that they are that Apple's
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.240]   owed money for every phone that conforms to any feature phone of any kind so
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:30.080]   Samsung I think if Samsung saw an exit in which they could allow except that yes
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.400]   we're gonna license stuff from we're in a license technology from Apple we don't
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.880]   feel so we have to but we're going to if they saw a future in which they could
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:41.680]   make money without having to go buying it's scraping to Mr. Potter to do business
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:46.040]   I think they'd go for it they're really are just a company Apple is just a
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:50.920]   company too but even Samsung is even more of just a company than Apple is but if
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.360]   I think what they really are fighting for is the ability to actually do business
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.720]   in the mobile mobile computing workspace which is some place they can they kind
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:04.800]   of have a right to be well maybe and maybe what Judge Ko was talking about is
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:11.840]   not Samsung but Motorola because now Google's fired this you know and this is
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:16.580]   never gonna be over by the way even Samsung will probably go back to the
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:24.360]   court with its own suits Google via its Motorola subsidiary is now suing Apple
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.920]   actually there's suing the US International Trade Commission to ban the
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:36.240]   import of iPhones iPads and Macs yeah so maybe that's what Judge Ko's thinking
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:43.920]   is you know it's more than just Samsung here you pissed off Google yeah it's
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:49.880]   it's we're all and when when Google bought Motorola some people thought maybe
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.840]   they're just they they want to get into the hardware business they can manufacture
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.000]   their own stuff maybe there's this strategic reason I think they wanted to
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.600]   make sure they had a big stick that they could they could use to hit Apple
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.640]   with so that if Apple continued to hit them over Android they could at least
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.000]   return the fire or at least be enough of a threat that they would have a
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.760]   negotiating position that's what Stephen Jay Vaughan Nichols who writes about
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.120]   Linux and open source for ZD net says it's mutually assured destruction yeah
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:20.960]   that's the old nuclear era doctrine that if we have enough missiles the
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.800]   Soviet Union will never attack us because we'd blow them into the Stone Age just
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.280]   as they blow dust in this Stone Age so we'd be mutually assured of destruction
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:34.880]   there therefore no war will ever occur that worked I don't know if it's gonna
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:39.400]   work with sepsi unfortunately Chris Gedd was more balanced and rational than
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.760]   the average tech CEO and he had nuclear missiles and he had to be it's no
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.880]   accident that Steve Jobs says he's going thermonuclear war on Google
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:59.080]   very beautiful and elegant 40 kiloton merve holy cow this is not good for
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:04.320]   consumers I would grant I would grant Apple the fact that until the iPhone all
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:09.520]   smartphones were crap we all said that we all couldn't wait and when it came out
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.720]   it did change how everybody thinks about smartphones and much of what we've seen
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.920]   since has been heavily influenced by Apple but it does go both ways and I
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:23.520]   think that you know much of what we see in iOS 5 and 6 like notifications for
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.840]   instance we're heavily influenced by Android that's how the tech industry is
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.360]   from the point of view of consumers regardless of the merit of these cases
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.600]   and that's I you know that's for the lawyers and the jury and the judges to
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:38.880]   decide regardless of the merits of these case I think it you don't want every
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:45.200]   single smartphone in the world to have to be licensed to Apple or do you doesn't
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.760]   that hurt us as consumers as it raised the cost of because by the way the
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:53.000]   license fees paid by us not paid by Samsung or Motorola or anybody else
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.600]   well the issue though is I think that in the Android market I think a lot of
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.080]   that is much more cost-sensitive and so I think that those those licensing fees
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.960]   could equal for some of those phones could actually equal the same margin and
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.480]   Samsung's making on the phone so I mean Apple could be theoretically making as
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.920]   much on the on the Samsung phones the Samsung does for some of the lower
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:18.880]   margin hardware so it definitely because it's it is more price-sensitive and so
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.240]   it's not something that they can just simply add the cost to the to the to the
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:26.000]   phone all the time in the way that sometimes it feels like Apple's doing
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.440]   you know it's not unique there's a much more competitive marketplace so it'll
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.520]   be it'll be interesting and you know what people tend to do is in vay against the
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:41.480]   idea of patent software patents but you know this isn't just about software
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.240]   patents this is also about trade dress this is a much more traditional this is
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:52.040]   like you know Eve Saint Laurent suing a cheap Hong Kong knockoff and that's what
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:58.640]   this is more like and part of this is as much time have I spent over the past
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.760]   four weeks in the show defending Samsung this is a lot like saying yes I know
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.680]   the defendant has been bilking widows out of their retirement funds for five
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:12.600]   years what I'm telling you is that he didn't kill that storekeeper and we
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:19.960]   can prove it because because the the the simple answer the question has Samsung
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:24.460]   been stealing stuff just outright stealing stuff from the iPhone yes yes of
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:28.960]   course they're starting starting with the galaxy at least the galaxy to which
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:33.080]   the first one where I where I really said oh man that you didn't even change the
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:38.320]   icon all the way to the galaxy three where it was like really you're making a
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:43.400]   push to talk spoken like search as a search personal assistant you didn't
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:49.840]   even change anything about Siri you just decided to take the oh man don't you
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.320]   know that you're being sued by a lot of people Samsung just quite can't you be
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.880]   like those nice boys and girls in the labs at Google when they decide to say
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.600]   we're gonna do something that's kind of like Siri but we can do a whole new
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.280]   interface that's no that's like another weekend's work let's just get some sushi
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.360]   in for everybody and just have a whole new interface just so that we can make
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.280]   sure that people know we're not really being that blatant about it oh Samsung
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:15.520]   Samsung Samsung by the way in the trial I think one of the other things Lucy co
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:19.840]   it was referring to the judge was referring to is that Samsung itself is
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.840]   claiming that Apple has copied it and wants 400 million dollars from Apple
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:32.160]   per handset so I mean she what she may be saying is look you may you know this
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:37.440]   may go badly from either side here I do not envy the jury I don't know what the
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:42.840]   instructions will be among other things the instructions will be that both sides
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:47.480]   are destroyed evidence originally was going to be a judge co-instructing the jury
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:53.760]   that Samsung did not uphold document retention laws Samsung said wait a minute
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:17:03.080]   and it turns out Apple sent out emails that that that there was gonna be a
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:10.280]   trial and but but Apple did not begin its document retention policy until much
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:20.440]   later so the judge said you know what you're right so in the in the instructions
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:27.760]   which she will give probably today or tomorrow unless Apple succeeds in
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.600]   changing your mind which anything could happen she will say Samsung Electronics
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:36.040]   Company has failed to preserve evidence for Apple's use in this litigation after
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:40.480]   Samsung Electronics Company's duty to preserve a rose whether this fact is
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.600]   important to you in reaching a verdict in this case is for you to decide that
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:49.320]   by the way this there is a huge burden placed on the jury if you've ever served
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:54.480]   on a jury trial it's a fascinating fascinating process and also the the
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.720]   by the way before you say that now there's I got to give the other side before
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:03.040]   the then you could say it she also said Apple or will say Apple has failed to
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:07.920]   preserve evidence for Samsung's use in this litigation after Apple's duty to
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.840]   preserve a rose whether this fact is important to you in reaching a verdict
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:15.120]   is for you to decide okay so basically basically what you saying is offsetting
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.640]   penalties yes you know yes both sides did it
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.800]   defensive holding and off it's a yeah but the questions are we can just replay
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:29.160]   the down or not that's the yeah the jury is such an X factor here because I
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:33.280]   I again I had a stop reading the live blog for the jury instructions to come
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:38.800]   down here but the first batch where it seemed like if there the jury the
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.000]   judge was talking about how trade dress is really really important on top of
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   everything else and so much of it is do does the jury understand that just
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.160]   because Samsung built a rectangular tablet in which icons are presented in a
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.680]   grid format it does look like an iPad but do they necessarily go well if it
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:01.280]   looks similar that must have been stolen are they is it okay for them to say
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.600]   well they're how was gonna put things but in a grid that that's how windows
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.080]   works in the desktop that's how so many other things work what how what are the
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:11.600]   shape of your what you're gonna do have them build a triangular tablet that just
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.640]   randomly splatters things like drippings of pigeon droppings on the screen and
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:19.520]   that's how you can represent apps so I don't I really don't know how how the
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.640]   jury is going to go with this the evidence to the evidence could really
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:27.000]   fit almost any conclusion that any analyst wants to make I agree it could
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.120]   be it could be very for anybody it really will depend on how well this was
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:35.120]   all assimilated we're even those of us were being a little bit overboard and
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:41.440]   trying to follow all this stuff we we really we really can't get a we really
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.040]   can't get a handle on this so the live blog that you're referring to is the
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:48.560]   San Jose Mercury news which is the Journal of Record in Silicon Valley
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:52.640]   really a great newspaper one of the last along with the Chicago Sun times and
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.320]   the New York Times and the Wall's Washington Post so to the last great
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:20:01.360]   thank you Leo yeah so the poor guy who's doing who's doing this Howard Mintz in
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:07.440]   the courtroom live blogging this 836 this morning about three hours ago said
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:13.800]   the judge will start with jury instructions all 109 pages if jurors
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.360]   don't jump out of fifth floor window when that's finished will proceed to four
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:30.440]   hours of closing arguments the jury verdict form alone is 20 pages the the
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:37.480]   jury is faced with an almost unimaginably complex task and do read these
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.040]   instructions as he's live blogging them because it's just here's an example key
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.840]   instruction on apples trade dress infringement claims whether apples I
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:51.480]   phones and iPads had acquired distinctiveness before Samsung started
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:56.800]   selling its accused phones and tablets and whether Samsung's devices were
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:02.360]   likely to cause confusion I don't know how a jury can even decide whether normal
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:08.240]   people were confused by this or not even the presses is argued this constantly
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:16.720]   back and forth is the number of instructions that this jury has to absorb
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.600]   and by the way these instructions are the law that they have to decide the case
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:25.560]   on the judge telling them what the standards are for the decision and the
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.160]   other challenges is that these are these are not patent lawyers these aren't
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.640]   these are not people who work in this industry that's the whole point that's
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.080]   why we have a jury of your peers they're not attorneys they're kind of it is
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:42.560]   supposed to be common sense yeah judges now according this is the last post from
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:47.000]   Howard it was about 15 minutes ago and then I think he passed out judge now in
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.680]   the final stretch instructing jury on apples anti-trust claims against Samsung
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:56.760]   the anti-trust claims so you've got patent infringement claims trade dress
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:01.640]   infringement claims and anti-trust claims he says these have gotten the least
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:06.000]   attention and deal with Samsung's alleged handling of its standard utility
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.120]   patents these are the friend I believe this is the friend stuff where these
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:15.000]   standard utility patents are supposed to be appropriately licensed at a
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:23.320]   reasonable price he says they're sort of the icing on apples legal cake breach of
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:27.080]   contract this is again Howard Minser in the mercury news breach of contract
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:32.120]   friend patent instructions are the types of legal oatmeal that should never ever
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.840]   be decided by regular people
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:44.520]   so so the entire future of smartphone technology sits in the hands of these
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:48.520]   12 on do we know of 12 people who had enough spare time to sit in the in the
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:54.520]   courtroom you I mean usually the people on the jury are older people retirees
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:23:06.880]   I wish we knew more about this jury it nobody has I guess you can't reveal
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.000]   anything about the jury till after the trial by the way after the trial get
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   ready because the next thing is everybody's gonna jump on this jury I
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.440]   remember I remember being in a trial and then the press jumps on you and says
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.280]   well and by the way not just the press but the attorneys and the judge everybody
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.880]   jumps on you says well what happened what do you think why did you decide
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.920]   would you decided and this is going to be one jury that's going to get a lot of
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.720]   attention they were told
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:36.600]   wait a minute judge they have been more among other things the jury was told not
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:42.520]   to do software upgrades or install apps on the mobile gadgets they receive while
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:46.040]   they're in deliberation apparently they're going to get all of these things and
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.400]   they've been told whatever you know you're gonna have tablets and phones you
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:55.440]   can have every bit of this crap in your jury room not installing apps on it or do
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:59.840]   any software upgrades okay well that's that's got to work in Samsung's favor
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:04.320]   because it's one thing to look at screenshots but the thing that
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:09.280]   differentiates iOS devices from Android devices is how well the how well the
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.480]   thing actually works live and so once they say that okay I got three apps to
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:17.280]   crash on this Samsung thing the iOS thing is working no one would ever
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.720]   confuse this crappy bug you are understanding the Apple thing
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:26.680]   congratulations Samsung go with God you win it's crap the physical devices you
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:29.600]   receive this has been the instructions to the jury the physical devices you
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.920]   received are evidence in this trial you may use them in your deliberations you
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.920]   may connect to the internet through the web browser application but you must not
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:41.840]   alter or modify the devices in any way you may not insert sim cards into the
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:49.160]   license once connected you must decline any software update notifications it may
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:53.080]   be presented to you you also must not download any content apps music photographs
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:57.520]   or games must be tempting put a little angry birds on there that's a happy jury
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.840]   room well I saw that angry bird is really one of the only ways that you can test
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.680]   you know you have to put that on there that's kind of like a basic test wow this
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:11.480]   is just I know I know people aren't I always I don't like to lead with a trial
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:15.240]   but this is it this is the this is it that is the bit that is the big news of
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:20.000]   August right now this is a big summer tech story yeah and and we're at the end
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.080]   she she's about done with the instructions there's gonna be four hours
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.480]   of closing arguments that'll be after the lunch break then the jury tomorrow
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:32.440]   returns and deliberates why and I think that if they if they side against Apple
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.000]   or they side forcing just ended just ended that's the there's the latest from
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.600]   the mercury news at 1140 pacific time one minute ago 60 seconds ago 109 pages of
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:50.080]   jury instructions were completed but I think I think I think if it's largely
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.960]   against Apple I think its business as usual I don't think anything I think you
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.880]   know Apple will continue to try to find other ways to sue people but
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:59.920]   everything will continue to look like like it but if Apple wins significantly
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:05.840]   I think it is it could be one of the biggest rulings in the industry yeah if
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:10.680]   if they if Samsung couldn't mount a defense against Apple everybody else is
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:14.160]   just gonna knuckle under and the issue that you have is that you now have two
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:17.960]   operating systems that pretty much run the run the show me obviously Microsoft
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:22.360]   is is working on the third but right now there's two that represent what is it
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:28.320]   eighty ninety percent of the market and and with one suddenly significantly
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.560]   crippled you know and I think that's the that's the interesting thing if it
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:36.640]   is but there's a there's a there's a possible upside here I think I really
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.760]   hope that Apple doesn't win or doesn't win significantly enough that they can
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.640]   now go out and enforce their will against other tech companies but what I would
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:49.040]   really if Apple does win what I would really love to see is every other hardware
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:53.840]   manufacturer say we have to unite and make sure that we can create a product
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:58.800]   that is essentially Apple proof so we're gonna build an entirely new unified
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:03.520]   hardware and software platform where feature number one is gonna be for us
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:07.760]   the manufacturers where our patents are rock solid the design is rock solid we
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:11.400]   design it in a clean room environment and nothing could possibly be said that
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:15.360]   this is a copying from iPhone and then because this is now the free and open
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:19.520]   standard that Apple really can't sue you for using this becomes the world
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:23.520]   standard for phones and the fact that it was designed to make sure that it's
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.720]   not duplicating the iPhone in any way shape or form means that it is not going
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.800]   to be designed to duplicate a phone that was designed six to seven to eight years
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:37.360]   ago and it could be something magnificent and brand new so if there's any reason
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.800]   to think that there could be good news from from Apple winning the suit it's
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:45.840]   the industry getting together and for now having finally a crushing financial
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:50.240]   incentive to innovate well and I think that the other big winner could be you
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.680]   know Microsoft you know and that's the you know they they could ironically
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:59.200]   Microsoft could be the big the big winner from a from a lawsuit but you know
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:03.880]   that definitely creates an opening there for for the Windows phone Windows 8
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:09.480]   no with what they're we don't think it creates an opening for when it's
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.240]   they got it's an opening I don't know if they can take into it I think the biggest
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.600]   problem people have is that it's just so hard to nobody wants Windows phone 8
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:21.640]   it's so hard to design without using the metaphors that have been used the
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.920]   I disagree I think that Windows Phone 8 is a really good example of how you
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:31.800]   can innovate the OS and not step on anybody's toes although you know there's
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:35.760]   stuff in Windows Phone 8 obviously Microsoft licensed from Apple like you
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:40.640]   know slide to unlock it sliding up not sideways but that slide to unlock tap to
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.440]   click many of the patents at Apple's suing Samsung over are clearly licensed
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:49.320]   in Windows Phone 8 but I think the real issue is all about ecosystem and they
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.040]   think that's why Windows Phone 8 doesn't have a chance there's just not the apps
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:59.600]   you now have two incumbents that have more than 350,000 distinct apps in their
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:05.760]   app store it's over well it's it's it's not over because because Android got
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:09.120]   there fast enough and now they're a really credible marketplace there's now
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.320]   they need to create the next part of the puzzle in which they can attract
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:17.400]   developers who want to make a lot want the same same Russia the gold bag a
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:23.160]   gold that they feel is there for iOS but what gets me kind of bothered here is
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:27.720]   that I would be okay with if Apple punishing people for making anything
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:32.000]   looks remotely like the iPhone if they could if they limited that to just
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.160]   things elements of the iPhone that I can't go through my closet back in my
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:39.800]   office and pull out other phones and other mobile devices saying no here's a
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.680]   device that has that same feature no here's another device that has your
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.280]   icon set up like that no here's another device predating the iPhone that has
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:51.440]   like a row of like home icons that stay persistent you know if they if they're
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:55.920]   saying that you can't do vertical scrolling you can't do icons on a grid
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:00.440]   you can't have a smartphone that does things other than receive and make calls
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:04.560]   and occasionally get photos by SMS that's where I have the disconnect with Apple
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:10.880]   so I think I really do think that Android is okay I don't think that Android is
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:14.520]   stolen outright then at least not in the way that people are claiming that it
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:18.880]   was just a copy paste into new hardware I just I think there's an important
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:22.000]   principle here that I hope doesn't get trounced but with all the legal ease
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.600]   well we're gonna watch with great interest I'm not sure how I feel I would go back
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:30.760]   and forth on this I carry my daily driver as they say is a is a Samsung
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:35.600]   Galaxy S3 but I'm but of course like everybody I can't wait to see the new
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.200]   iPhone the only reason main reason I don't carry the current iPhone is that
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:42.600]   it's three and a half inch screen after you use a big screen for a while it's
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:47.200]   really hard to use it it really is like the difference between the retina iPad
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:53.440]   and the iPad 2 it's I still carry both phones every single day today I ran out
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:56.400]   of the house really quickly because I overslept for breakfast thing it did not
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.640]   have time to go and figure out which of the other three rooms I happen to drop
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:03.960]   my my Android phone in and so no problem I have the same apps actually
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.760]   identically the same apps for navigation on my iPhone as on the Android phone and
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:12.400]   all throughout the drive to breakfast I'm like gosh that's a small screen like
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:16.600]   you know what that's a really small screen like that's really
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:21.080]   it spoils you doesn't it it does ruin you even it does it doesn't even
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:24.120]   necessarily matter what the pixels per inch it are no the fact that you've
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:28.280]   actually magnified it so it it's a larger square in your field of view at
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:31.440]   least when you have it on your dashboard and using as like entertainment a
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:35.480]   navigation thing that's at least one area which I'm like I wish you were
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:39.400]   larger yeah and there's lots of people who like a 3 1/2 inch screen they may be
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.160]   a little disappointed in the new iPhone because I don't think it's gonna be 3 1/2
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:46.600]   inches but there the people who want small screens people with small hands
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:52.000]   people with small heads but but people like their hands to look real big yeah
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.920]   but I is as I got as and you know of course I started with this the galaxy
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:01.160]   no which it's ginormous and the next one's gonna be even bigger so I don't
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:07.400]   know well you know it's just I think we all agree innovation and competition is
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:12.800]   good Apple has a right to protect its interests and a duty indeed to protect
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:17.320]   its interests I'd be very interested to see what the jury decides I hope that it
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:22.480]   doesn't limit choice that's my main main main hope I hope we continue to have the
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:26.640]   kind of choice that we have right now that from my point of view what
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:32.360]   concern I think that Apple has some viable complaints here but my number
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:36.600]   one concern is that if Apple gets too much of a dominating position it really
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:42.840]   will limit the growth of the of the phone Apple Apple is not fast and furious
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.360]   about anything and if they don't have any competition I don't think they'll be
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:48.920]   less so right we're gonna take it they didn't they have that one the right to
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:52.280]   be president of phones we don't have to get out the Attorney General of phone
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:56.840]   all law does not pass it on but it could have to the jury decision we just will
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:03.080]   have to see him hey Tom we should probably be ready for breaking news
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:07.760]   whenever that jury comes in with a decision just a thought it won't be
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:15.120]   tomorrow I don't think it may not be next year it's a 22 20 page jury verdict
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.760]   form alone but I think we should be ready with breaking this could be like
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:23.640]   nightline during the Iranian hospital start every show on to a jury held
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:29.760]   hostage jury standoff day 273 no movement yet in the jury room we have
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:34.520]   attorneys oh I feel sorry for Howard Mintz who probably is gonna have to sit on
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:40.560]   that very very hard bench outside the jury room for more than a day or two
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:45.400]   very interesting very interesting we're gonna find some Mac there's no Mac
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:54.080]   news we'll find Mac rumors that's your assignment Mac rumors coming up but first
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:58.120]   a word from our friends at Citrix the folks who do that great go to meeting
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:01.600]   you've heard me talk about it I one of the things I like and as for Mac people
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:05.960]   this is important is that you can hold a meeting on a Mac or PC and attend the
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:11.320]   meeting on a Mac or PC it doesn't matter or really like this on an iPad or an
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:15.720]   iPhone go to meeting works great in fact if you have an iPad you can not only
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:19.960]   attend a meeting you could send video this new HD faces feature means that
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:25.120]   you can use the iPads camera built-in mic and speakers and attend and
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:28.920]   participate in the meeting just as somebody at a desktop would but you're
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:33.160]   holding an iPad I love that with the iPhone I bet you they had this feature
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:37.280]   the iPhone but right now with the iPhone you can attend but you can't send the
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:41.240]   video out you can listen you can speak I bet you that's the next maybe
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:45.080]   they're waiting for the new iPhone I want you to give it a try it's a good time to
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:49.600]   do go to meeting because after all aren't we all like traveling all around
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:53.760]   for the summer we're on vacation we want to just spend more time at home but
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:56.840]   doesn't mean business stops that's why go to meetings a really great way to meet
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:01.240]   with clients and to pitch colleagues vice versa meet with colleagues and pitch
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:06.520]   clients and collaborate to because go to meeting has screen sharing plus the
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:12.640]   camera to give you the chance to to see the screen and to see the person you're
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:15.960]   talking to I just am a big fan I want you to try we've got a deal go to meeting

[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:48.840]   have a plant in my office you have a plant in your office yes I see the
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:56.560]   plant in your office guess what this is my bedroom that a ficus yeah look at
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:03.800]   that you get that sheeps can throw it IKEA my sister has one like it
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:12.880]   as much as my sister does it's what video could do for you I don't know if
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:19.120]   it's true or not but I everybody has now absolutely consensus is here that it's
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:25.440]   September 12th is the announced date for the new iPhone that that seems to be
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:30.840]   consensus and then it will be available September 21st right I don't know that
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:37.280]   Apple has said nothing so I don't know how they know that sounds good obviously
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:43.320]   I've gone all in on yeah you booked a plane ticket yeah if they were to announce
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:46.680]   it on the 12th and release it about a week later that would be also consistent
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:51.240]   with what they've chosen to do in previous iOS devices so the XM start
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.520]   previous hardware devices that gives them that they have a big media event
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:59.120]   certain people will be ushered into rooms and receive free release hardware and
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:02.600]   then they'll their reviews were arrive a week later two days before we want that
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:10.400]   to be Andy happens I've got as as always everybody who everybody who covers
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:15.240]   Apple who new reviews hardware if you're smart you have a plan A a plan B and a
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:19.240]   plan C and plan C is always what if I don't even get access to loaner hardware
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:22.680]   at all good have a plan C never can never count on anything it's not an
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:29.720]   entitlement have a plan C so what are you gonna do what's your plan C could go to
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:32.000]   the beach
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.280]   well see this this is why this is why it's important to make sure that whoever's
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:40.320]   paying for your hotel room pays up in advance make sure that money's gone
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.920]   we'll give you the check come on well don't worry we're good for you can always
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:48.640]   pitch on the show that that Tuesday so we know so it's a Wednesday is that that
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:51.880]   is that what the September 12th is a Wednesday right the 12th is Wednesday
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:55.720]   that would also be consistent so you're gonna I don't know what I guess what
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:59.920]   we'll do is flip-flop with security now and have security now be on a Tuesday
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:04.360]   as we usually do because Apple always does it this to us have Mac break weekly
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:09.760]   on Wednesday you'll be in the room if you you haven't received invitation yet I
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:14.500]   wouldn't until probably everybody else yeah well the last week in August right
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:18.640]   so I pray that you're not been tarnished you have been receiving
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:23.440]   invitations all along right yes you are not tarnished by your association with
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:28.440]   you know no the only if there have been couple times I haven't been invited I
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:32.840]   don't I don't believe I've been disinvited it's mostly mostly a choice of
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:40.200]   mostly mostly a case of I live you know 3200 miles away you can't go and well
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:44.640]   yeah and also and also given the given the distance between when they usually
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:49.400]   announce and when the event is they kind of know that in the past I sometimes
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:57.480]   will even when I expected an invitation every single time it was like maybe I
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:00.760]   would go to two out of every three to out of every four because sometimes it's
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:06.640]   like I just there are the things I need to spend $300 $300 for like I'm
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.880]   I'm covering this other event on the other side of the planet like two months
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.760]   from now I really don't I really can't spend $1200 bucks for two days in
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:18.480]   San Francisco and so I have to have to decline but I've been this so don't
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:21.920]   don't worry I don't believe that I've been tarred and feathered by by my
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:29.320]   association with the mighty Twit Network so we have from YouTube the source of
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:35.680]   all things good and wonderful in the world this leaked official Apple iPhone
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:40.880]   5 promo video that will be shown Andy while you sit in the keynote watching
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:46.440]   this is what you will see before designing the iPhone 5 we studied how
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:49.800]   customers use their iPhones and we discovered something pretty interesting
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:55.200]   people only use iPhones to take photos of their food they're sad and alone so
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:59.280]   they use pictures of food to create the illusion of a fulfilling life with that
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.320]   knowledge we went back to the drawing board introducing the iPhone 5
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:08.040]   we thought everything from big stuff like screen resolution to small
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:12.080]   details like the size of the screws and the inclusion of a 50 millimeter
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:16.480]   macro lens these pictures look so good that nobody would ever imagine you lie
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:20.800]   awake at night wondering why you can't feel happiness and with a maximum ISO of
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:26.760]   6400 the iPhone 5 takes stunning photos in whatever dimly lit exposed brick no

[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:47.600]   happy I am happy I am happy the iPhone 5 is a game changer its photos are sure to
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:51.960]   garner all the likes hearts plus the way stars repost read logs re-tumbles and
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:55.680]   retweets that you've used to replace it's a digital SLR for those who are
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:58.800]   listening I've been using the iPhone 5 for a few months now and it's already
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:03.000]   turned my life into a seemingly enjoyable life last weekend I was having
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.960]   brunch with my girlfriend but we had nothing to talk about so I took out my
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:11.120]   iPhone 5 I snapped a pic of my eggs Benedict connected my iPhone to my Mac
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:15.320]   book found a Wi-Fi hotspot uploaded that photo onto Facebook and within
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:20.000]   minutes I had friends telling me how much fun I was having and you know for
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:26.560]   one brief moment I almost believed in myself
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:34.280]   the iPhone 5 picture your life better see and and we return to the eternal
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.880]   philosophical question that's been played out ever since Scott invented high
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:42.440]   school who is the bigger loser the loser or the loser who spends time
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:47.840]   pointing out what a bunch of losers the losers are at least when I at least
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:51.400]   when I take a picture picture my of a really spectacular like plate of sushi
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:55.120]   that's over and done with about half a second that took like half a day to
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:59.160]   shoot another half a day to edit he had a probably probably went and bought
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:04.600]   lighting and bought sound equipment it's funny it's funny and it's it's it's
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:08.280]   you know okay it will probably be a very good camera but I think they'll
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:13.040]   still be a phone I still be a I believe there won't be a hand grip or a bayonet
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:16.600]   lens but there is a point to be made though and this was it I found this
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.760]   interesting I talked to some real people the other day it was a bit amazing
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:24.600]   experience and I don't want to not one I'd like to repeat but it was it was a
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:30.400]   really at the time I found it really informative and one of the things they
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:33.680]   said which surprised me we were talking about phones and I thought oh
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:37.640]   here's a chance to get some you know get some on the ground research and I
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:41.480]   said well because some of them had Android some of them and I said well you
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:45.800]   know why don't you have an iPhone and they and they universally agreed that
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:50.720]   people buy iPhones not because of the technology because they because it's
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:56.120]   hip it there's a lot to do you think that that's true that the one of the
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:00.080]   reasons people buy iPhones is because it's the cool phone to have as opposed to
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:04.720]   anything else I mean I definitely think that that for some folks it's definitely
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:07.600]   some areas it's a status symbol I mean I know that's a status symbol that's
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:11.240]   exactly the word they used in Africa and I know I can tell you in Africa it's a
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:14.680]   huge status I mean because a lot of them you can't get it you can't get it
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:18.800]   locally so if you have it it's like having a rare you know rare car you know
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:22.480]   because it's not something different but it but yeah I understand that that's
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:25.520]   like wearing blue jeans is you know that's like hip yeah but yeah but it is
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:28.640]   specifically that brand I mean it's not it's not that they have Android it's
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:31.640]   not that they you know that those are also can be hard to get but it there
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:34.680]   really is this thing about the iPhone and I think that which means we may be
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:38.240]   missing the point because we keep talking about speeds and feeds and
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:42.560]   screen size and and stuff like that and ecosystem they don't they're not
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:48.240]   they're not asking those questions yeah but nonetheless there's the difference
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:53.680]   between style and fashion Apple is very they the old saying is that style is
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:58.120]   forever fashion is just this season and Apple really is more into style than
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:03.160]   fashion it's it's not enough it is it is emphatically the a hip phone to get it's
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:06.400]   it's the great brand it's the great thing you want to be seen holding in your
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:11.040]   hand but the reason why Apple holds on their customers is because after you get
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:14.480]   over that that initial endorphin rush of holding this really cool thing in your
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:18.320]   hand and everyone saying is that the new iPhone well I yes that is I'm an early
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:23.000]   adopter I have the new iPhone it prove it produces such a great experience that
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.320]   they really don't want to wander away from that whereas I think that there's a
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:30.800]   little bit more mobility when you buy an Android phone that I have been getting
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:35.800]   lots of comments about the SG the Samsung Galaxy 3 people I've never had
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:39.720]   people tell me that the Android phone I was using was a hot cool phone that
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.680]   there that is their dream phone but it's been happening quite a bit during the
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:46.560]   summer but nonetheless I think that even if they did get their their their hot
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.400]   dream phone and was an Android phone next time they need to get a replacement
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:54.080]   hardware when their contract runs out I don't think they'd be as committed to
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.520]   getting another Samsung or even another Android phone as an iPhone user would be
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:02.080]   to be getting an iPhone they've just there's just so many knock-on advantages
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:07.760]   of the iPhone that go beyond the styling well but I think that that you do make
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:11.040]   decisions I mean I when I see someone with an Android I think they're geekier
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:15.600]   than then then someone with an iPhone that's not true that's not true I think
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:18.520]   these people in this in this was in Pilates class all right I'll tell the
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:21.360]   truth and these people had Android phones and they were very comfortable
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.000]   with them they they knew how to use them they in fact were not high-end
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.440]   Android phones either they were inexpensive I think one of the reason
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:32.240]   people choose Android is there's a perceived cost factor right right I
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:35.840]   because I've said for the folks that I see most of them you know mostly I think
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.760]   that either they they just walked in and got a phone or their or their geek here
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.880]   and they want the extra features if I see a blackberry I usually think that
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:45.480]   they're either connected to the government or just really having a hard
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:50.920]   time figuring out how to move forward and an iPhone is kind of the the the
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:53.720]   average I mean really I mean you look at the blackberries you're like really
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:59.480]   you have one of those I mean it's am I the only one that thinks that yeah no it's
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:05.080]   I do keep I do keep my eyes out I I am the guy who will who will be looking at
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:07.920]   someone's hands every time I pass through any public space see what kind of
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:11.760]   phone they're using and I've been seeing more and more non iPhones of people's
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:15.240]   hands as proportion of the marketplace I don't think it's I think part of it
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:19.680]   is because other iPhones have been excuse me other smartphones are becoming
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.840]   better and better and better like they've they've they're not as good as the
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:27.160]   iPhone but they've certainly gone beyond that level where people say okay this
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:30.360]   is good enough that I'm not noticing how bad something is and a lot of other
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:35.640]   factors come into play and once you get above that level they're it becomes an
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:41.400]   issue of I have devoted exactly one hour of this afternoon to replacing my phone
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:44.960]   I'm gonna go to the Verizon store that's near the near my house on my way back
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:47.840]   home from work I'm not gonna go seek out an Apple store I'm not gonna go
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:51.200]   comparison shopping on a walk in there and which everyone strikes my fancy I
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.800]   got a good deal on that's the one I'm walking out with and then they'll be very
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:56.720]   very happy with that for the duration of their contract because they're not
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:01.040]   looking for those finer finer points those finer finer elements you can spend
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:04.800]   three months and two million dollars trying to figure out exactly the right
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:08.340]   pixel dimensions of a back button to make sure that ergonomically you have the
[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:12.120]   most perfect design possible but there's a good chance that nobody's gonna notice
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:16.520]   or appreciate it well and I think that I don't think I think really between the
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:22.560]   high-end Android phones like the S2 S3 I think those are I don't think they're
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:25.360]   better or worse anymore I think that they are equal they're just different you
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:29.000]   know or and some in some cases better so I don't think that there's a I think
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.680]   it's just an interesting thing with the with the interface like if you go to DC
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:36.720]   I fly a lot through Dallas and Reagan and then there's blackberries that's
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:41.040]   blackberry because of the government yeah yeah yeah exactly yeah it's still
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:46.680]   blackberry still there they're only see it in two places it's still a popular
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:51.000]   fleet phone that's the sort of phone that you signed and also I see them in
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.320]   movies where somebody's seen using a smartphone because a blackberry will
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:58.640]   probably pay you to put a put a smartphone in Steve Martin's hand in the
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:02.760]   big year they probably will not iPhone is saying no we'll let you do that we're
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:04.960]   not we're not gonna give you know we're not even gonna give you a freebie I mean
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:08.960]   we don't need to buy that phone you can see you can use his own iPhone if he
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:13.800]   wants yes well I could tell you one you think you think that I just I'm I'm
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.640]   starting to think that maybe I should move to LA and start like a consultancy
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:20.560]   business like that because in every one of these phones like it the big year
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:24.120]   is a particularly good one where Jack Black is using like an old-fashioned
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:29.600]   flip phone yeah is using a blackberry I'm thinking that my job is to be I will
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:33.520]   hire myself out to movie productions to teach these actors how to use a black
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:37.040]   berry and how to text message using a 9-digit keypad because they're used to
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:40.880]   using iPhones they have no idea how these damn things work backwards tech
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:46.880]   help retro tech help that's a good business Alex help me set up the LLC
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:51.000]   and this give him some lawyers retro tech help well you know you know most
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.480]   of the time when we do those with the movies that there's no there's nothing
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:56.040]   on the screen at all they're hitting whatever they're hitting then and it's
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:49:00.480]   you know it's a green screen they try not to show it because it looks dated when
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:03.240]   you do I was just somebody saying in the chairman this is true just thinking
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:07.240]   Aaron Sorkin's newsroom it's all blackberry they're all using blackberries in
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:11.160]   that I don't know if that's because of parochial consideration or because Aaron
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:14.880]   Sorkin is kind of a Luddite you know where they're not using blackberries
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:23.440]   or Android Yahoo Marissa Meyer just gave her entire staff new iPhones
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:31.160]   10,000 iPhones now the the articles are saying oh this proves a Marissa was
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:34.720]   bitter about Google and it's a little shot across the bow I don't think so I
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:38.560]   think she just doesn't want to revolt if she gave that step Android phones they'd
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:43.800]   be pissed well I think they want iPhones but wouldn't wouldn't they if she had
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:47.880]   given out all Android phones the Yahoo staff would have been like oh here it
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:51.880]   comes yeah Google Google you know executive comes in and forces Google
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:55.200]   they're trying to make us Google I think this is kind of an obvious choice well
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:58.960]   isn't it also possible they want he she wants every single one of her employees
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:02.800]   to be running the exact same platform so if they're gonna be using Yahoo
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:06.320]   internally as a skunk works for their own social media stuff they know that
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:09.120]   they don't have to worry about having three or four different platforms
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:14.320]   supported it is you know even Google gives you a choice Google said you can
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:18.040]   have a Google phone or an iPhone or maybe even more they might even offer
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:22.200]   blackberry in and I'm in this fine I don't know but it but it's interesting
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:27.200]   because what that also kind of presages is that for Yahoo mobile
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:32.600]   development is going to be primarily iOS yes or no I don't know if it
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:36.600]   necessarily says that I think I think that it's interesting that she decided to
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:41.240]   do it could be a simple goodwill gesture saying everybody gets a it's an
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:45.200]   Oprah moment you get an iPhone you get an iPhone and saying well thank you you
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:48.800]   could you not have given us an iPhone in November when the new phone comes out
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:52.080]   that's a good point she got a deal but she was trying to also avoid that
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:56.840]   Christmas moment we've all had it where you go oh Aunt Bell and and and

[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:43.040]   a camera outside the room or a Skype system up outside the room so you can come
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:47.380]   out a media after you try it you got to try because I'll have the demo room if
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:52.180]   if if if I am if I am if I am favored with an invite I shall do exactly that
[00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:56.460]   bring your oh okay then I won't say this out loud because I was gonna say bring
[00:51:56.460 --> 00:52:01.380]   your portable broadcasting kit so that you can go into you know what I he
[00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:05.180]   would never do that I should probably bring like a laptop or something and hold
[00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:09.780]   it up in front of me no states we can he will you know that's it that's exactly
[00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:14.680]   not what you should do yeah no and he is and as a journal is a journalist with a

[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:27.600]   rules to the letter so he's a safe invite I will be too busy typing live
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:32.880]   blogging we're brought to you today by the Ford Motor Company and they have a
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:39.980]   new site they want you to know about social dot Ford dot com it is a really
[00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:44.880]   interesting idea it's a it's a place where you can put your ideas for new
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:49.280]   Ford vehicles it's a place where you can read articles it's designed really for
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:54.740]   I would say the geek in fact you can go there they have a badge thing which is

[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:13.560]   this badge you can download I don't know what you do with it you could share it
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:17.720]   I don't I don't I don't really know what you do with it you just you get it
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:23.880]   here's my tech geek badge oh I have quite a few I didn't know that I have I've
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:28.200]   quite a few tech geek badges here what's gonna happen now that I've opened it I
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:33.560]   don't know social dot Ford dot com you can also go there and read articles lots
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:37.640]   of great stuff I have a little article on there you might want to read I a couple
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:42.920]   weeks ago got to talk with a guy named Jim Butchkowski he is one of the chief
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:50.240]   technologists elite technologist there at Ford and he is and he and I talked
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:55.000]   about a wide-ranging number of subjects including autonomous vehicles
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:59.400]   there's some good articles here we talked a little bit about some of the new
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:04.720]   technologies that are coming some of the apps that are coming the sync app link
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:11.920]   the API and more so if you're interested check it out social dot Ford dot com
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:16.120]   grab the tech geek badge there's videos there and that this is I think one of the
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:22.640]   neat things is the ideas you can you can say look I think this would be really
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:31.960]   cool and this is a guy saying he wants he wants the lower ride height on the F
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:35.760]   150 because of the convenience of a four by four I mean these are great he
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.800]   says you should offer an F 150 with a four by four ride height I don't even
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:43.080]   know what that means but those of you who do you see here's one a track app
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:52.040]   migration package to owners of oh that's 2012 Mustang owners oh oh yeah okay I
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:59.000]   like that oops I guess I guess they didn't see me I got a 404 when I clicked
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:06.560]   on it some really cool stuff here seating them seating eco boost I love it I
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:10.360]   wish you check it out if you've been wanting it this is better than a
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:14.000]   suggestion box if you've been wanting to pass along your ideas to Ford if you've
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:19.400]   been wanting to share your Ford story share your Ford images or videos I love
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:26.480]   this all look at that there you go there you go here's your chance social
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:32.320]   dot Ford dot com we thank Ford for doing such a great job and really in
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:38.480]   involving the geek community us in the design of their future cars so I did
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:42.960]   find a Mac story actually thanks to our chatroom and this is something actually
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:47.000]   I you know he said you should talk about the display problems on the retina and I
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.840]   thought what display problems I love my retina display but then when I read this
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:55.400]   article I said oh yeah that does happen to me some retinomac book pro owners
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:56:00.440]   seeing interface lag I tell you where I see it is when I'm sliding from screen
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:04.120]   to screen there could be some real sluggishness there I see a lot of that
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:10.120]   there's a lot of pixels there's a lot of pixels being moved I I definitely I
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:16.200]   definitely see a lot of of drag and slow slow movement between that and I'll be
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:22.080]   honest with you I don't what I love about the retina 15 inch is all of the
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:25.120]   features and the speed and the two thunderbolt cables and everything else
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:28.320]   what I don't care at all about is the resolution it just doesn't mean anything
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:33.960]   to me I nice and sharp but the love it yeah I love it and I can and you know I
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:36.720]   also see a lot of complaints from people who clearly don't own retina
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:40.520]   displays saying well the all these apps look crappy but it's only the Apple
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:43.800]   apps no most apps look great anything that uses text looks great most of the
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:50.320]   web looks great you well a lot of a lot of apps don't because there's so many
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:53.800]   tricks to making sure that you can get make your app interact with the user the
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:57.440]   way you want it to so even as if you if you were to just simply put a text
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:00.680]   view in the middle of a window and that's really all your your app does you
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:04.160]   don't require any kind of performance then yeah it'll probably look great
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:08.320]   without any modifications but as any as anybody uses retina maybe there are
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:12.440]   times when you'll just the first time you reinstall an app you haven't used for
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:17.000]   about two weeks that's the time when oh why is this simple text there are some
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.960]   bad ones but I have but I tell you what I must have gotten rid of all of them
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:24.440]   like the Twitter app which still sucks because I've been using better apps and
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:28.640]   I know I have not run into this problem recently however I have run into the lag
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:32.640]   problem so I get so your mileage may vary depending on what apps you like is
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:35.360]   there an app in particular that you like Scrivener or something that you use
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:40.640]   Andy that you wish would just give you a retina update office because I spent
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:44.680]   a bunch of time well I say you go time it's weird is where does it important I
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:50.280]   were using office I might complain to now I use pulse also pages looks great but
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:53.200]   I understand you have to use office because you're probably filing in DocX
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:58.160]   format yeah but and the big realize I don't have a retina retinomac book so
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:01.940]   I occasionally get to use one for like maybe a couple hours when someone
[00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:05.040]   needs to work on something so it needs to be to you know jump on their machine
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:11.280]   for well I had one for I had a loaner for a while I was I didn't I didn't feel as
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:15.680]   though the upgrade to retinom was that big a deal for me use it I've used it
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:19.800]   I've well I was using it like every day for about a month and even that even
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:23.440]   then I was switching between my my actual personal 15 inch MacBook Pro and
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:27.280]   this one and I absolutely appreciated the higher definition but it wasn't like
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:31.640]   the difference between the new iPad and the iPad 2 where I almost can't use the
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:35.320]   iPad to the same way I can use the I the the new iPad because of because of the
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:39.560]   glaring difference but but but but but the real but the real point is that it's
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:43.520]   not whether you value the extra resolution or not the fact the matter is
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:49.360]   that an app that doesn't display high quality text really looks like garbage
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:53.240]   next to one that does display high quality text so this is yet another thing
[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:56.960]   that a developer has to worry about where if you have a really good word
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:01.520]   processor a really good art program or really good anything and you were focused
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:06.360]   on spending 2012 putting the next in the next one point whatever release up
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:09.720]   there and adding all kinds of new features well now you really have to put
[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:13.720]   the new features in the next revolution on the back burner because it's now your
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:16.960]   job to make sure that it looks as good as it did before Apple released the
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:23.560]   brand new MacBook have you had that problem Alex was apps not looking good
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:28.400]   because boy I tell you I don't see it I mean I stopped using my 27 inch Mac Pro
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:34.080]   and I don't find I think that it's it's one of those things that the you
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:36.880]   definitely notice it with some some browsers and some stuff where everything
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:41.440]   looks really small I mean I mean my I thought I was I'm most updated Firefox
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:44.680]   but it still seems to come up where oftentimes it's coming up really
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:51.600]   microscopic yeah I have an answer yeah and so but you know that's been that's
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:54.560]   been the big issue as far as the other apps and I have to admit I I'm
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:56.880]   frustrated because I feel like there's lag I feel like there's a lot of
[00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:00.960]   processor speed going to all I care about is performance and so I'm frustrated
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:05.600]   that I feel like there's processor speed being used up on the display that that
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:09.200]   could be used up somewhere else and so I don't I haven't really gotten to a
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.360]   point where I really like the new display preferences of all this make it
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:15.520]   better for the external monitor internal monitor and all those little bits I
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:20.240]   really want I felt like I didn't have enough control with the last version where
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:25.480]   I had you know where where I couldn't select 1080p or 720p or whatever now I
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:30.040]   have even less control or I have even less dials on the you know on my display
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:36.120]   preferences and so so I find you know I'm a little I have to admit that I I
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:39.680]   think it definitely looks better I don't think it look it doesn't change my
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:42.920]   world as much as the performance and all the other things that are going on in
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:48.640]   the there you know everything else about the laptop is the best computer I've
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:53.240]   ever used the the monitor looks great but I just feel like I'm I'm giving up
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:57.400]   processor speed to something that I don't really care about well here's what
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:03.040]   CNET is saying people are finding if you're having this lag which I have had
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:06.320]   and I just you know I kind of live with it it's like it's only when I'm
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:10.040]   sliding there's only a few situations when you have Safari running and you're
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:14.120]   sliding screens yeah I see it now I know that I've read all these articles I'm
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:17.920]   seeing it but I was just I think I was internalizing and saying well it's laggy
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:23.080]   because it's moving a lot of pixels so here's what they suggest that these
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:26.400]   are things people have tried and apparently have helped run a general
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:33.320]   maintenance routine that deletes caches turn off automatic graphics switching
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:36.520]   you know the first sounds like voodoo this second one sounds like it might do
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:41.120]   something there's a control panel or I'm sorry system preference pain oh I
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:47.520]   used Windows there's a system preference pain in the energy saver where you can
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:52.080]   uncheck automatic graphics switching so what it will do is there's two graphics
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:59.760]   cards on the Macbook Pro all of the Macbook Pro's one is an Nvidia G-Force on
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:03.280]   ours is a 650 m and the other is the motherboard the Intel motherboard
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:07.960]   graphics and to save power to save battery it will switch to the cheaper
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:12.360]   motherboard graphics and I do think I think if you're on battery my experience
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.800]   has been I think that if you're on battery it almost always goes to the
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:18.760]   lower the you know it is really doing the best can to extend your battery so I
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:22.280]   think that I because I definitely noticed that I had that on and when I wasn't
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:25.040]   connected to a power source I was definitely noticing a lot more the drag
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:31.680]   that makes sense and then finally for some people apparently reinstalling OS 10
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:37.840]   can fix it that's a pretty extreme they say format and install not just a
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:42.880]   system upgrade now I did do the upgrade in place and maybe that's maybe that's
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:47.760]   it so I'm gonna have an opportunity to do that because I just ordered and I'm
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:54.360]   kind of excited a new SSD for the retina this is the first third-party SSD you
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:58.880]   remember I fix it saying there's no user serviceable parts in here it's all
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:04.320]   glued together well other world computing and I've bought these upgrades
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:09.600]   for my air and I really like them is offering a upgrade for the retina to
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:15.960]   five well 480 gigabytes for 579 bucks it's a little pricey but I'm gonna do this
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:20.120]   on I'll you know maybe I as I could do this on know-how we can take the part
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:24.640]   the retinolive TV that'll be yeah I as likes that yeah because he wants to see
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:30.000]   me Safa this has they say it not only is it bigger it's obviously bigger but
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.360]   they say it's faster uses the folks full six gigabits six I'm sorry six
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:40.200]   gigabytes per second SATA performance so I'll do a benchmark to to see if it's
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:46.440]   worth the upgrade we'll see how easy it is to do now another another thing I
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:50.400]   tried on the retina I put window the new windows 8 you know windows 8 is at last
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:56.240]   week the RTM version of windows 8 shipped to developers and I think there's
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:00.960]   even a free a vowel addition that you can get for enterprise and so I put that on
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:03.520]   I thought well what this is be interesting so put that on the retina
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:07.280]   because I don't know if I don't know if windows 8 has the drivers yet for the
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:12.240]   screen it did it worked pretty well it's it's pretty it's fine print but it
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:15.520]   looks good it's usable I'll bring it in you know what I should have brought it
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:20.760]   today I should show you and then I'm told by Windows experts there is a
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:25.280]   DPI setting in there that I can change it maybe make it more like what the
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:30.400]   max doing this high DPI right now Apple kind of has them market cornered on
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:36.800]   that but if I could turn the DPI I don't up or down whatever it is I need to do
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:41.040]   Windows 8 looks pretty nice on it it looks in fact looks fantastic on it
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:45.920]   yeah this is that that's got a stick and somebody's craw like that to
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:50.840]   consistently the greatest windows it's always an apple are made by apple it's
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:54.720]   like the best ultra book is an apple the best 15 inches an apple and if you
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.640]   want the super high resolution display yeah you got to go to the Apple store
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:00.320]   and arbiters asked me in the chat room but what's the point of having high
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:03.920]   that kind of resolution on a such a small display and I can I finally
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:08.360]   understood it I didn't get it I asked the same question before I had one and
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:11.240]   really it's you're right you're running at 40 you're running at half
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:15.920]   resolution for you know for the for the the problem is confusing dots with
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:22.080]   pixels so a dot is still 1440 by what is it 990s I can't remember what it is
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:27.480]   it's half the resolution but each dot is composed now of four pixels so you have
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:31.600]   sub pixel rendering and that's why text looks so good and then on a few
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:36.460]   apple apps like aperture it aperture knows enough to use all the
[01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:42.160]   resolution so so for picture editing it's amazing I just I love it but I'm
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:47.360]   using mostly Apple apps I guess I'm not using a Microsoft Office so I'm I've
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:52.040]   been happy with it anyway I'll I'll I I bit the bullet and I bought this I
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:58.320]   I will admit that I bought the I bought my out of my my ninth Lilith
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:02.760]   reach reached end of life usable life last year and so I bought a 2011
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:08.760]   MacBook Pro like last spring if if this had been available then I might have
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:12.000]   waited another month or two to put another five or six hundred bucks in the
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.480]   kitty and got one got retina but I do not regret it I said I don't miss it right
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:19.240]   I do not regret it and I'm one of the things surprising that I like about it
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:25.480]   is USB 3 which I guess you get with the other new MacBook Pros as well it's
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:29.560]   really fast and you can buy you have to spend a little extra USB keys to take
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:34.320]   advantage of that and it's a huge huge difference yeah 1440 by 900 thank you
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:37.560]   that's well and from a production perspective the USB 3 there are a lot of
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:42.360]   a lot of choice especially from black magic yeah that lets you interface you
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:45.960]   know high resolution cameras be a USB 3 now of course you have Thunderbolt to
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:49.520]   do that as well but it is a pretty revolutionary I mean it from a
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:54.240]   production perspective the retina 15 is incredible I mean it's just it's just a
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:59.640]   really incredible machine I mean we we use a lot of them so and that this has
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:03.800]   become kind of our workhorse for you know doing on locate especially talking
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:09.520]   about on location you know you can take we've hooked four HD cameras into into
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:15.280]   a laptop and stream to you know you know stream to online in multiple
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:17.800]   resolutions and it just just burns right through it it's pretty incredible
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:22.800]   machine it's fast and I like well I don't I'm the one I sound like we're doing
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:29.680]   an ad for Macbook right now and I'm not doing an ad for it to me I I I I'm I'm
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:33.920]   drank the Kool-Aid on this one I really really like it I will say I will say that
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:39.000]   I do have to say that Andy and I have to eat some crow because I just really
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.360]   took said that didn't really matter that they didn't have anything at port and
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:46.800]   does it matter once a day about once a day I'm like oh where's that where's that
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:50.520]   Ethan that good doctor and I think oh Andy's right Andy's right he's right he's
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:53.960]   right he was right I can't find that ethernet cord I was like oh darn it you
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:57.880]   know so I look for it like now that I don't have one I look for it like once
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:01.880]   a day I bought the Thunderbolt adapter have not used it once but I but I have
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:06.080]   it now I Thunderbolt and I the Thunderbolt and the USB 3 because I don't
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:09.240]   know and the USB one because I don't know which port will be left over and I
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:14.920]   do I really wish I had one more USB port because I use the two constantly and
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:25.040]   thanks to the chatroom this Justin Verizon is now imposing vacation
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:30.360]   embargoes September 21st through the 30th according to Mitch Craig and our
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:37.080]   chatroom thank you Mitch so it sounds like and the email that went out was
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:44.600]   prepare for impact tech crunch has the story that a trusted Verizon employees
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:50.040]   confirmed the carriers having an all-staff vacation blackout Friday September 21
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:55.040]   which was the nominative date that the the iPhone would ship for the to the
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:09:01.320]   following Friday but you don't do a vacation blackout unless something
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:05.520]   important maybe the Queen's coming to town I don't know yeah you you suspect
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:10.880]   that maybe somewhere somewhere inside Apple there has been a discussion about
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:15.840]   how useful secrecy can be and how sometimes secrecy is not terribly useful
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:19.840]   right that if they if sometimes if you decide to say that it's now that we're
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:23.240]   if we're two months away from the launch of the iPhone where everybody and his
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:26.960]   mother knows it is going to be an eye new iPhone almost certainly this time if
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:31.080]   it helps our partners to be able to plan things a little bit earlier if it helps
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:35.000]   journalists to be able to plan things a little bit earlier to simply create a
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   creative world in which they can be a little bit more open not not open enough
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.880]   to actually you know let advertising materials out the barn door but at least
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:46.920]   enough so that it doesn't matter to us that we tell our people two months in
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:50.160]   advance that no we're not gonna allow you to get you you don't please don't
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:53.160]   book a vacation then because I know normally it's not a problem it's not
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:56.480]   but it is going to be a problem this specific week of the year I what I don't
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:59.760]   I don't know when we're another but it makes me suspect over the past year that
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:05.200]   maybe at some point Apple's experimenting with sometimes being so
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:08.240]   sometimes when you when you when you keep the lid in the pickle jar that tight
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:12.080]   it becomes a lot more difficult to do business well doesn't it feel like it's
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:15.560]   but it's become more open in the last year in general I mean I just I just feel
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:18.400]   like it's we have a lot more information we're not back to the
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:21.560]   pre-steved days where you know you know everything Apple was gonna do for the
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:24.600]   next year and a half but but I definitely feel like those dates and and
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:28.360]   what's gonna be part of it have become much more certain it's not really
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:33.160]   secrecy is not the point controls the point right and judicious control of
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:37.360]   what people know is a great marketing tool that's obvious what and in fact I
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:41.640]   would say this is a refinement over the idea of blanket secrecy the refinement
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:45.720]   is yeah we'll tell them exactly and we'll use the Wall Street Journal to do it so
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:48.320]   everybody knows it's true and we'll tell them exactly what we want them to
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:52.920]   know when we want them to know it no more no less and in the news outlets that
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:56.800]   are getting that are you know by giving it to certain news outlets obviously
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:01.280]   you're also doling out influence like if you want to have that you will not do
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:07.360]   knockdown articles about our manufacturing success is interesting point sorry about
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:11.360]   that New York Times you won't be getting that tip all right we're gonna take a
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:14.720]   break and we're gonna find out what the most valuable company in the history of
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:21.840]   the world is the answer might surprise you but first this picture of the of the
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:27.000]   Twitt staff reading the hottest new novel in modern fiction today ladies and
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:34.400]   gentlemen I give you the diamond club oh my gosh this is this whole diamond club
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:41.920]   thing has gotten out I was shocked shocked I tell you it seemed to be written in
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:47.640]   gibberish all right how many personal days the staff gets a take off for
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:53.720]   spanking is that become a thing now it's a thing it's spanking Saturday
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:59.600]   here at the Twitt brick house we're brought to you today good folks at
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:04.760]   squarespace.com the new squarespace is here the new squarespace is here we're
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:09.720]   very excited squarespace six we've been waiting for it I've been playing with
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:14.400]   it for gosh it seems like since September I think and it is beautiful
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:17.840]   it is sweet and it was a complete redesign so let me tell you what squarespace
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:22.720]   is before I get a go much farther it's not the software alone it's the best
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:27.640]   hosting plus the best software and really by tightly coupling the two you
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:32.080]   really get the best of both for instance you cannot bring a squarespace
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:36.320]   site down because it's such great hosting and because they know what kinds
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:39.840]   of traffic they're gonna get they can they can do things that not no other
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:45.760]   host can do it's really a very sweet system and the new squarespace 5
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:50.800]   rewritten from scratch 15 plus newer improved features including and this is
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:56.200]   the oh the hottest thing right now in the on the web responsive design so
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:00.400]   instead of having a mobile version that's different from your desktop version
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:04.600]   that's what everybody did until recently you have one design that is so cleverly
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:09.080]   implemented that it works on any size platform and as mobile becomes more
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:14.320]   important than desktop this becomes key you know used to be a mobile site was
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:17.400]   just kind of an afterthought now it is your site it's the full site so
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:20.960]   squarespace for instance automatically resizes photos so they look great on
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:26.920]   any screen the tools for designing have been very much refined you have you
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:31.800]   don't need to know JavaScript or CSS or HTML5 but you'll be using all three
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:37.240]   automatically and it by the way if you do use those they have great great popout
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:41.040]   editor that does syntax coloring and everything I mean they're really designed
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:47.280]   for a user to be able to use it who just wants to get a great site up all
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:51.000]   the way up to the professional designer many many many very professional
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:55.520]   designers use squarespace.com maybe it's the integration with all the social
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:59.160]   networks look at this they're putting a Google map dropping it right into the
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:05.560]   page it's just so sweet of course the import and export from the major platforms
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:09.640]   including all comments and images all SEO all links are preserved I want you to
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:15.000]   try the new squarespace six it is spectacular go to squarespace.com and
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.680]   they have a button right in the front as they always have it's one of the things
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:22.760]   I like about squarespace it says get started just press that and you don't
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:26.520]   need a credit card you'll get a free 14-day trial complete 24/7 support they've
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:31.600]   always had free webinars so webinars.squarespace.com so you can learn
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:35.240]   everything there is to know about squarespace as you use it you can get
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:40.280]   more and more proficient and if you decide to buy the pricing is I you know
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:45.200]   in all seriousness I don't know how they do this the pricing is quite
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:50.720]   remarkable if you buy an annual plan this they look at the $16 a month
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:54.240]   remember this is hosting this is everything including by the way a custom
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:57.440]   domain name when you buy an annual plan so they'll do the alpha hookup and
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:03.120]   everything plus unlimited pages unlimited bandwidth unlimited bandwidth
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:08.240]   unlimited storage you can have multiple contributors no limit to the number
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:11.560]   contributors they all have their own individual permission level so you can
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:15.480]   have an editor you can have a contributor you can have a writer you can
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:20.760]   do it all I mean it this is and this is $16 a month when you I mean as soon as
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:23.720]   you consider as soon as you consider the the whole hosting thing and then the
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:26.960]   hosting costs and realize that everything else is was you work on top
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:31.000]   this is just kind of a no-brainer you know for $16 a month. Zen says it's not
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.280]   spectacular it's gonna put us web developers out of business no it's not I
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:39.880]   promise because you can you can then on top of it put JavaScript CSS 3 8 you know
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:44.800]   5 it's really great that way and both pixel core and GB garage sites are both
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:48.320]   sit on top of Squarespace and we have tons of custom code that we've had
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:54.480]   developers build for it so we we got 80% of it done by you know by Carolyn and

[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:54.160]   this wrong in jeopardy every news every news organization jumped on this one and
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:58.640]   announced that Apple was the most valuable company in the world ever seen
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:03.320]   Bloomberg CNN money Wall Street Journal Apple is now the most valuable company
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:10.960]   of all time USA today all things D Reuters well yeah but you got to adjust
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:17.120]   for inflation so Apple's 600 billion 622 billion dollar market cap is good I'm
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:22.800]   not saying it's not good I'm not saying it's not big it's huge it's massive it's
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:29.040]   it's okay I'm not down I would I would like to see it slightly better next time
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:34.960]   I'm I'm I'm saying that let's not get out of control like a cocky yeah I mean
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:39.000]   there's more always more can every can every one of you at Apple say that you
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.240]   really did your card is every single hour this is gonna come up during the
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:48.080]   performance review interestingly it is not IBM at first the Columbia
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:50.960]   journalism review said oh we've done the calculations and if you adjust for
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:55.360]   inflation it's a nope it's not the largest company of all time in history
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:18:01.960]   adjusted for inflation is Microsoft 1999 Microsoft was actually worth about
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:10.640]   856 billion in US and US in 2012 dollars so there's still a way IBM 1.3
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:16.720]   trillion no that was an error they made a mistake they double adjusted for
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:20.880]   inflation they adjusted it once and then they adjusted it again it was a
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:25.080]   little a little mistake so they've it's funny this is when we think about value
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:28.800]   this of course is the publicly traded market cap that's all it doesn't
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:32.840]   mean anything because there are there are quite a few companies that are that
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:36.360]   are private companies that are considered more valuable than than this
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:39.560]   right large infrastructure companies that oh that's interesting like a
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:43.120]   back-tell or something or halibutin might be I'm not sure I don't know what
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:46.960]   their value is but I think that there are I think right there are are ones that
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:50.520]   are considered larger than this that just simply stay very quiet because they
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:59.160]   are not publicly traded right car gill art archer Daniels Midland the
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:05.040]   the country of China those might be worth more but but the public they held it
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:09.080]   publicly traded companies Microsoft 1999 is still the benchmark so you're right
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:17.160]   Andy don't get complacent Apple workers there's still more to go I just I don't
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:22.120]   know I'm always amused by these things as though unless you actually have like a
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:26.680]   money bet on what Apple's market cap is going to be at any given moment why do
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:31.240]   you care yeah they are there but really all you care about is a company healthy
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:36.680]   or is it not healthy is it growing or is it contracting I mean when there's the
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:43.600]   other another non non Apple news story was how many units Microsoft thinks that
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:47.920]   they're going to sell of Microsoft surface later on this year and a lot of it is
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:51.040]   a lot of the speculation is just completely irresponsible there are a
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.840]   couple numbers I've seen that seem like they're kind of on target and some that
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:57.720]   are absolutely irrational but and but they're people lined up to say oh they'll
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:01.920]   never sell three million these it's a complete failure ignoring the fact that
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:05.960]   so long as a company creates a market for themselves were none existed before
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:12.040]   that's great see people it reminds me of the late night wars a few a number
[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:17.720]   three years ago when Letterman moved from NBC to CBS and he was the the Letterman
[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:20.120]   show was the number one late night show in that slot for about a year and a
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:24.200]   half until Jay Leno took number one and pretty much kept it for the next four
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:28.160]   or five years and a number of people again as though they had money bet on
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:32.960]   this outcome we're saying oh Jesus NBC did wrong what a bunch of losers CBS are
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:38.000]   too bad for Letterman CBS is like we had nothing going on in that time slot and
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.000]   now we have a hugely successful program that sells a lot of advertising we
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:47.000]   are not sad about this outcome so it's it's when I kind of just dispirits me when
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.400]   I hear so much of this rah rah you know hell this work our companies doing
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:53.160]   better than this other company went no it's not your company you purchased a
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:56.680]   phone that doesn't give you any that doesn't give you any stake in this
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:21:02.280]   company whatsoever yeah you know it's it's what it really is horse race
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:06.000]   journalism and we're all guilty of it and we just love a winner and you know
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.160]   and their band is coming around the turn and it's Apple it's Texaco it's
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:14.360]   Texan it's Apple it's Apple it's a Texaco by the way Aramco the Saudi Arabian
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:24.040]   oil company is worth 0.718 pardon me 781 billion dollars so that's I guess the
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:28.920]   largest and it's it's that's governmently held as prior but that now now I really
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:33.840]   haven't pressed Apple is officially oil it's in it's in the oil rich it's beaten
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:41.640]   next son and it is now on its way to beat Aramco yeah like if if if Apple were
[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:46.480]   like a musician they would own giraffes in their backyard that's how that's
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:50.280]   well like at this point they're actually beating the state grid
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:56.000]   corporation of China they look if Apple if Apple was this size they would build
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:03.040]   an absurdly round headquarters oh spaceship I still think it's I still think
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:05.080]   it's gonna take off I think they're not telling us that yet it's just gonna
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:08.000]   start spinning and just go off into space a couple of quickies before we get to
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.880]   our tips and picks of the day Apple I don't know what to I don't know what to
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:16.600]   make this I'm not gonna do the retail Apple firing and then not cutting back on
[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:21.400]   it I don't care what that I don't I think it's kind of a meaningless story I
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:24.480]   talk it sounds like just just a it just sounds like they were tinkering with
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:27.160]   how many sales staff they have compared to what they're doing it doesn't sound
[01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:30.040]   like they were making any big decision they were just playing around with the
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:35.400]   mix of technology and and and staff it's it's not a story I mistakenly were
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:38.280]   talked about it and twit and I realized what am I talking about there's nothing
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:45.040]   to say here not that move along move along Apple TV big kind of rumor stories
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:48.080]   in the journal and elsewhere about Apple wooing cable companies and wooing
[01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:53.920]   content companies very confusing Apple is preparing a new Apple TV says PC
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:59.960]   magazine but it's not a set it's it's it's a maybe a set top box that
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:04.080]   they're trying to get the cable companies to go for will it announce it at this
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:09.640]   announcement coming up next month I don't know this is Will Greenwald
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:18.680]   writing in a PC magazine this is speculation I'm guessing not not informed
[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:23.480]   at this point if I were putting ten bucks on it I would be putting money not on
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:28.360]   an Apple branded TV said it would be on just getting iOS into TVs that's
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:35.560]   sensible right sell the Apple TV technology as a platform in televisions
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:42.600]   or I don't think I don't think Apple doesn't why I'm sorry I don't mean
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:46.800]   actually building the TVs I mean I mean more like build an Apple TV that is more
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:50.720]   like a cable box that can interact more intimately I still just don't see why
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:55.720]   how Apple would make money I don't know why Apple would want the complexity of
[01:23:55.720 --> 01:24:00.200]   trying to create a TV so that they can make enough people happy that it would
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:03.880]   be it would do what Apple would need it to do by the way Tim Cook in the end in
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:07.600]   the quarterly conference call did say the analysts call did say they sold
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:11.960]   four million Apple TVs which is not with I would call it bigger than a hobby I
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:16.560]   think it pales only compared iPads and iPhones it's roke roke who is selling more
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:20.720]   but they're very it's it's as a hobby they've got that one of the dominant
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:23.320]   platforms for internet they're in there it's pretty good and it's pretty good
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:30.040]   two sources said that the Apple's looking at a cable compatible Apple TV to be
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:35.440]   integrated into television sets this is according to ours Technica Jackie
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:42.680]   Chang writing in her infinite loop column and what some have said is that
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:47.240]   Apple the idea Apple has is essentially that there's no difference between live
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:52.480]   and on-demand that even 30 seconds into a live show you could press play and
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:56.840]   watch it from the beginning but it's instantly on demand and that makes sense
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:25:04.240]   for users the only question is is are the cable companies in the in the
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:09.480]   content creators going to allow this and it's such a mess out there it's so
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:14.200]   complicated also television set is absolutely the most proletariat consumer
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:18.360]   device you can possibly find everybody expects you pick up remote control you
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:22.360]   push the the red button on it and things happen and so there are a lot of people
[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:25.960]   out there who even people who are not necessarily you know 80 years old who
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:30.720]   expect them to pick up a program guide scroll down to this show they want to
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:33.480]   watch press the okay button and be watching that program but they don't
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:36.600]   really think in terms of lying from a store and then streaming so it's it's a
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:39.920]   really difficult complex problem a lot of layers to it you know it strikes me
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:43.520]   that's a problem we should be solving it to it I mean we don't have the the
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:47.520]   complex stakeholder in a relationship so we could just do it I think people
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:50.360]   just gonna have to age out of the system true right that's right I mean that is
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:55.080]   a joke I mean that's a hundred percent well and I think what one of the things
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:58.360]   that I think is interesting is what we saw in the Olympics where you know we
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:04.000]   found ourselves fairly detached from the live event it was it was at first that
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.080]   was very upset that we weren't seeing it live and then I just learned that I
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:09.960]   kind of want to see it happen anyway and I'm gonna watch it on demand later and
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:14.240]   I'd rather have it you know all in one place and not jumping around and and I
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:19.840]   thought that that was actually possibly a huge liability for the live sports
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:23.800]   industry of spending two weeks watching a high profile event where you got used
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:28.240]   to the idea that you wouldn't watch it live you know that you just just watch
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:31.960]   it some other way if you've read about changes in the Twitter API and a lot of
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:36.040]   Twitter developers very upset but tap bots which makes in my opinion the best
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:40.480]   iOS Twitter client I really love the tap bots client on iPhone and iPad and
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:44.800]   tap bots has been saying that they're gonna make tweet bot for the Mac as well
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:52.560]   a desktop version their response to the Twitter API changes is don't panic tweet
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:57.520]   bot for the Mac is still coming out tweet bot for iOS isn't going anywhere he
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:02.360]   says that because we have so many users already we're not threatened by the user
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:11.920]   caps we will modify our client to comply with any API display requirements we're
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:17.280]   going to work with Twitter so he says the beta of tweet bot for Mac will be
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:20.560]   coming soon shortly followed by the final release of the Mac App Store I
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:27.960]   currently use and and love Ospora on the desktop that was an iOS app that
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:32.360]   Donna Callister told us about and they made a desktop app and the reason I use
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:36.880]   it is because it's retinized but it's also just great you know you can you can
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:42.400]   shrink these icons down on the left and it just makes it very easy to tweet in
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:45.520]   real time I'd like to see more of a real-time fee but I think that might be a
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:52.480]   Twitter issue all right I think we're gonna take a break come back with your
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:57.920]   iOS you're lying and your picks of the week are you ready gentlemen if not you
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:05.720]   have one minute red five standing by a red leader red leader let rover come over

[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:05.160]   can I can say I want to see everything I've ever purchased in the I don't know
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:09.720]   20 years I've been 10 years what is it since that says 2011 I think no I'm
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:17.560]   sorry 2001 or 2000 so let's see more than 600 items now I love it and they're
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:22.320]   all available to me anytime not only here to download and put on my iPod but
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:27.560]   also in the in the app which on the iPhone or Android phone what do you
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:30.400]   listen to and he always has some great recommendations effect I may I pay
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:34.680]   careful attention to his because I tend to listen to his stuff I'm nearly at the
[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:37.360]   end of that Phil Rosenthal book I recommended a week or two ago you're
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:41.040]   lucky you're funny which is quickly becoming one I think it's certainly one
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:45.360]   of my favorite books ever on audible but certainly be in the in the top five no
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:49.080]   question lined up on deck when I finished that is a book I encountered
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:53.000]   fear and loathing at enrolling stone the essential writing of Hunter s tops
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:01.320]   which is a highly curated selection of prime Hunter s tops and correspond
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:06.320]   excuse me pieces for Rolling Stone back when he was still able to really step up
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:11.680]   to bat and swing and connect to the ball the legend of Hunter s tops is kind of
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:15.760]   expanded beyond his actual output we have to we get it's I mean it's it's it's
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:19.240]   almost not it's almost not something we should joke about me he was part of
[01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:23.200]   what made his writing so dynamic and his story so rich were all the drug abuse and
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:26.880]   all the craziness he got involved and unfortunate had a really serious effect
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:29.960]   on his ability to focus and do that same kind of journalism later in his
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:34.320]   career so the idea of having a really good curated collection of his stuff so
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:38.040]   this is all been picked handpicked by Jan winner and there I think they're also
[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:44.080]   letters and also comments from Jan winner himself about how this thing works so
[01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:47.760]   it's I did listen to the sample it's the other good thing is that it's not it's
[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:51.600]   not narrated by Harris Thompson I have listened to something narrated by
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:56.320]   Harris Thompson in like the 80s and that the charm wears off pretty damn quick
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:31:02.800]   yeah I'm done when we started good or what but I'll tell her give me the
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:09.160]   stuff I'm gonna read and then there's an expletive pastors I don't think I'm
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:12.040]   gonna read it and figure I don't know I'm looking through the Hunter s Thompson
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:15.720]   bibliography on audible there's a ton of stuff but I don't think any of it's
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:19.760]   narrated by him so I'm sorry this is a commentary track I think on Fear and
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:23.400]   Lothic okay William and I'm looking for all this is gonna be great he's gonna
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:28.080]   talk about like the experience and all of it is just like an open mic as he
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:32.520]   watches this movie and I think it tends to be and it's wrapped blanking bastards
[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:39.440]   became part of my vocabulary for the next I'm gonna read that movie just for
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:43.560]   the track I can't wait to hear that it's my own but it can't be used in mixed
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:49.320]   so this is good this is 18 hours worth of Hunter s Thompson's best writing as
[01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:54.220]   as carefully edited it's called fear and loathing at Rolling Stone the
[01:31:54.220 --> 01:31:57.120]   essential writing of Hunter s Thompson that was where he did his best work I
[01:31:57.120 --> 01:32:01.400]   highly recommend that I I've read most of this stuff but I would love to hear
[01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:05.120]   it again but that's just one of many books that you could choose from I'm just
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:09.280]   looking through my library here on my iPhone I mean just have a ton I just got
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:13.080]   the end of money which I'm really curious to read about it's talking about
[01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:18.960]   the new ways of exchanging value that are you know post post money but look at
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:24.480]   these are every book I've ever had it goes on and on and on and on there's a
[01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:28.720]   really good auto-plap for all platforms so great gets in the crowd it's like I
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:32.120]   can switch between the iPhone and the Android phone and an iPad really easily
[01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:37.000]   yep I love it I dig it the one thing I wish they'd have and I'm sure at some
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.360]   point they'll add the Amazon owns them so whisper sync which means that when I'm
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:44.280]   whatever point I'm at on one device it would automatically jump to that point
[01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:48.280]   on every other device I would just a pitch to get that because I would love
[01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:51.560]   that feature but I just you know what I just make a note of what minute and
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:55.800]   second I'm at and it's easy to go to the next step here's how you can get a

[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:17.520]   started listening to audible I get tweets all the time in emails now from
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:20.360]   people who say you know I've heard you talk about audible for years and it
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:24.000]   literally has been some like four or five years and I finally joined it why
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:29.720]   didn't you tell me because you weren't listening I guess audible.com/macbreak
[01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:34.920]   really this is something you want to try. Mr. Alex Lindsey do you have by any
[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:39.600]   chance an iOS tip for us today? I do this is a bit of a travel tip along with an
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:43.560]   iOS tip because I'm spending a lot of time in airports so one of the things
[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:46.920]   that a lot of airlines have been doing is giving you these apps that let you
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:51.400]   you know open up or they'll do HTML5 or whatever where they'll send you a link
[01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:55.440]   of your check-in yeah and they send you a link of your boarding pass that sits
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:34:01.360]   on your phone yeah the problem is is that most of those are something that is
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:05.160]   web driven so they're you know they're they're popping you into Safari and
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:09.120]   they're showing it that seems great except that a lot of airports don't
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:14.400]   work really well on the you know as far as your 3G and 4G service because
[01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:18.360]   there's so many people hitting it right and so literally I've walked up to you
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:21.880]   know I've walked up to a to the thing going like like shaking it thinking it
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:25.600]   would go faster like I can't get my boarding pass you know up and then I
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:29.240]   have to go ask for a paper pass and it's very embarrassing I look like an
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:36.200]   idiot so the way to handle that is if you if you get your boarding pass set up
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:40.400]   like that and then you the best thing to do is take a screen capture so get
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:43.720]   your boarding pass filling the screen make sure that the QR code is showing
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:47.300]   and then simply capture the screen like you would do an image and then don't
[01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:50.840]   tell them that you know you just but but you know then you just have your
[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:55.080]   iPhone you instead of opening the web page you open iPhoto and then you can
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:59.000]   simply put it over there you always have it so soon as you get it right you always
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:04.440]   you always get it because it doesn't it doesn't stay stay permanent and it's
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:06.960]   something that hopefully that will save somebody some brain cells because it's
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:14.680]   very just take a screenshot screenshots are forever yes that's it mr. and not
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:19.400]   co a lion or I guess it's mountain lion now but I always tend tip from us from
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:23.440]   you for this is one of my favorite kinds of tips the kind where I came across
[01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:28.160]   this by accident and then felt stupid stupid stupid to the factor of 10 to
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:33.840]   the 23rd for like days after it for you know why did I not notice this beforehand
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:39.000]   it involves the it involves the color picker that's that most Mac OS apps
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:44.920]   used for for picking colors and so I got I brought up a picture that I used
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:49.120]   last week and this is a picture of a bunny mr. but mr. hair is in my backyard
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:53.480]   and sometimes you're designing things and you're like you're designing a
[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:58.360]   website or you're designing like a logo or something and you know if you went
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:01.960]   to art school you know color theory and color palettes if you did not go to
[01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:05.960]   art school you don't understand why you shouldn't put brown and purple next to
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:11.360]   each other but the shortcut to that is to find an existing product an existing
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:14.560]   book cover or an existing picture with a color palette that you actually like
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:20.960]   that what you can do is in the standard color picker you can actually open up
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:26.120]   that picture there's there's separate tabs inside the color picker for if you
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:30.280]   look at here I got it open right here that the third one along is actually
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:33.400]   there's the color wheel there's the sliders there's swatches there's crayons
[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:38.120]   but in the middle there is actually a spot so that you can select an actual
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:42.320]   picture normally this is pre-loaded with a color spectrum and so for years I
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:45.560]   thought okay there's there's giving me every possible color I can just click
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:48.840]   on one of those and just choose the color I want no if you pulled it that
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:53.400]   drop down you can actually select the image that is going to be used as your
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:56.360]   palette and then you can just basically eyedropper all the colors that you
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:37:00.960]   actually want so here I've designed a web page that uses colors selected from
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:06.480]   that bunny photo so it is such a great show that looks nice yeah exactly it's
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:11.000]   like looks good these are colors that actually like exist in nature it's
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.960]   not brown yeah the works not a single one of those colors like came from any
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:19.880]   other color picker or the color palette I just simply said I want to let's see
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:24.320]   for the sidebar how about the bunny fur the fur of the bunny like how about I
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:28.560]   want that leaf for that green up there and for this text I'll use the that
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:32.880]   fleck of beautiful beige fur on the bunnies cheek it's gonna be the bunny
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:36.920]   cheek but you can imagine how well it would work if you would do things like
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:42.160]   their times especially another thing that I often do using this is you know
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:45.680]   that I read a lot of comic books and there are brilliant colorists who do
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:49.720]   nothing but understand color theory when they color these books and so you will
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:53.920]   see a dramatic page where it's a night scene all painted in blues and bages and
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:58.360]   oranges and reds and just scan that picture in and just use that as your
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:01.680]   color palette for the next project you're working on be it a blog be whatever
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:05.240]   else like I said this this this this feature has been staring me in the face
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:10.480]   you know for years must be for the past three or four revisions of Mac OS when
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:13.200]   they've moved to that standard color picker and I can't believe that never
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:16.520]   occurred to me that well what if I what if that's not just a picture of the
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:19.880]   spectrum is is it possible to actually drag another oh you can drag another photo
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:28.280]   oh isn't that interesting I like it what's it's called color picker no it's
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:31.080]   the standard it's the standard color picker that's in so many apps like it's
[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:36.000]   in pages I got it I got it right exactly anytime you ask for color again it's the
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.760]   it gives you the standard picker gives you a bunch of different options for
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:45.040]   that right like again color get you want the color wheel do you want huge
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:47.800]   saturation brightness sliders do you want swatches do you want the crayons
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:50.960]   the third one along the one that actually looks like a landscape is the place
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:54.680]   where you can actually just drag in a photo and use that as that eyedropper
[01:38:54.680 --> 01:39:00.560]   sampler to just grab colors from where you want so if you're using a kind of a
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:05.240]   Mac app that does everything right Safari probably doesn't I would guess well
[01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:09.000]   it's not as far as an app where you choose colors you're right it has to be
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.040]   somewhere you choose colors it works in pages we're taking note right
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:19.520]   through the time for our picks of the week you got the you got the talk and
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:24.160]   stick Andy and I go why don't you kick things off a very quick one grumble g
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:30.960]   r u m l which is a really good free Google reader client app for the Mac it's
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:35.080]   the other standard for pick if you want like desktop client for your Google
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:39.520]   reader subscriptions is net newswire net newswire has a lot more features you
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:44.680]   can do offline stuff you also don't necessarily have to be it does it does
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:48.680]   better for offline stuff the problem is though it's free with ads and if you want
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:53.040]   to use it add free it's 15 bucks grumble is as good at the basic stuff and it's
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:40:00.600]   completely free gr u m l app.com Alex Lindsey your pick of the week so I use a
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:03.680]   lot of webcams and one of the problems with webcams of course is that if you
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:06.200]   don't have we're used to also having professional cameras where you have tons
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:09.720]   of control over your color and exposure and a lot of times a webcam is just doing
[01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:13.480]   some kind of auto exposure auto color and depending on where you put your head
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:17.720]   it can work it or not work well there's a new app I talked about it kind of a
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:21.960]   hat hack that was out there before there's now a new app in the iTunes store
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:26.280]   that actually allows you to control your webcam settings directly and it's a lot
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:30.600]   easier to use it's called webcam settings and I don't know it's 799 if
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:33.760]   you if you really want to look good on a webcam this is much easier than the
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:37.120]   hack that I was that I think I had talked about before so simply what you
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:40.840]   can do is like for instance if I click mine to manual now I have a little slider
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:44.600]   you can see that I'm controlling it this is not like eyeglass which is
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:48.840]   basically overlaying a correction on top of your webcam this is actually
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:53.600]   changing your webcam settings and so you get you know you really get the full
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:58.520]   exposure doesn't flatten out I can also go in here and turn off my auto and and
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:02.760]   start playing you know playing with my my color balance one of the things is
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:08.480]   that we find that there is less effect than eyeglass on the performance of the
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:13.680]   camera as well as that this is truly changing the camera settings so oh wait
[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:17.840]   look at that something that you're yeah if it's something you're attached to and
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:21.800]   you really want to make sure that you can really fine tune your camera to just
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:27.160]   the way you want it for webcam this is really a must-have so webcam settings
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:31.760]   799 on the iTunes store really good everybody who comes on our shows and uses
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:36.280]   a man should be using it exactly you remember that great Atari game called
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:41.920]   pitfall remember that it was like a great 8-bit game where you I I spent
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:47.000]   probably summer summer listening to men at work playing pitfall on my attack
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.800]   let me see if I can get the audio coming off of this because Atari has
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:58.080]   released pitfall for both iOS for the iPad and the iPhone and let me just see
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:01.800]   if because it's gonna play the audio here like literally if I hear cargo by
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:11.080]   minute remember this well it's here ladies and gentlemen no wait a minute
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:16.360]   wait a minute this this is such an eight bit seems like on a modern platform we
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:20.360]   could perhaps do a little bit oh there you go
[01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:27.000]   pitfall is a 3d game actually if you've played that what is that tomb runner the
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:33.520]   game where you run run run temple run this will be very familiar it's a kind of
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:41.440]   a third-person running jumping escaping game but I actually kind of like the
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:45.520]   the pitfall metaphor for it you're you're kind of the oh I missed the rope let me
[01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:52.880]   try that again let's see here whoa yeah rope oh yeah I don't know if you can see
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:56.880]   this but it really is fun 99 cents right now for Atari if you've been playing a
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:02.400]   lot of temple run you'll it'll seem pretty familiar it's not it's not
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:05.760]   straight on its side sideways although as we get a little farther along it will
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:10.240]   come straight on it moves around in its perspective and it's pretty challenging
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:17.160]   a lot of fun oh man pitfall
[01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:25.080]   running running running it really is and you see we get it gets kind of some
[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:29.960]   interesting stuff it's a kind of the next step in running games Alex Lindsay
