[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.600]   here joining me today.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.600]   And you may wonder, why does Leo look like this?
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.600]   Unless you're listening, in which case I sound exactly the same.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.600]   I'm look like this, because it's Halloween.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.600]   Joining us right now, all the way from Baston, Massachusetts,
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.600]   it's Mr. Andy Enoco of the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.600]   So it's not Marcel Marceau.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.600]   No, no, it's just...
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.600]   The number three and a paintbrush.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.600]   That should give it away.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.600]   Gonna paint it by... Gonna paint it three.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.600]   You're gonna paint it three. You are...
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.600]   I think someone's gonna get it.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.600]   And I think that I don't want to disappoint this person who gets it.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.600]   Okay, so we'll let the chat room guess.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.600]   It is deep catalog.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.600]   Somebody's saying, "Clockwork Orange?"
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.600]   Nope.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.600]   You know Sam Downey?
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.600]   You do?
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.600]   Who is it?
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.600]   Oh, he doesn't know. He's trying to think.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   Renee Richie, also here from the fabulous Imore.com.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.600]   Renee's too busy in New York City looking at the new iPhone X
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.600]   to actually be worried about Halloween.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.600]   Wait, wait, no, no.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.600]   I've come dressed as an iPhone X.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.600]   Oh, he's got it in his hands.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.600]   I am now... This is my costume.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.600]   That's actually an excellent costume.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.600]   Excellent costume.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.600]   Wow.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.600]   Halloween.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.600]   So...
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.600]   Apple did...
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.600]   And I know Andy, you defended them on your Twitter.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.600]   I think they did a very interesting thing.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.600]   Certainly nothing that's not okay.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.600]   They're a company that can do whatever they want.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.600]   And the people they see iPhones with,
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.600]   it's completely their decision.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.600]   But they did do something.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.600]   I think that's more aggressively...
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.600]   I want to use the word manipulative.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.600]   I won't use the word manipulative because that implies that
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.600]   journalists can be manipulated.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.600]   But let's say more aggressively favoriting some than others
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.600]   this time out with the iPhone X.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.600]   Some people, one person,
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.600]   Stephen Levy, I think, is the only one who got it.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.600]   And his embargo was lifted on Monday.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.600]   That's early, yeah.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.600]   So he got the first review in Wired magazine.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.600]   And by the way, I should say all the reviews have been very positive.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.600]   As one would expect.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   You said it's the best product Apple's ever made, I think,
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.600]   Renee Richie.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.600]   Was that... Am I quoting you properly?
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.600]   Yeah, it's my favorite...
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.600]   It's my favorite guy just since the original iPhone.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.600]   Very nice.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.600]   It's just so much fun to use.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.600]   You got it.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.600]   You got the embargo lifted today as did everybody.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.600]   Yes.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.600]   Nielei Patel from The Verge.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   Everybody.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.600]   Buzzfeed.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.600]   Nicole Nguyen.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.600]   Nguyen.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.600]   Oddly enough.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.600]   So some people...
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.600]   Okay.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.600]   So what were the...
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.600]   It's complicated.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.600]   Matthew Panzerino of TechCrunch.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.600]   Stephen Levy and a few have had it for a week.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.600]   I think Lance Olinoff and I think Buzz...
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.600]   Lance Olinoff from Mashable.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.600]   And Nicole Nguyen from Buzzfeed.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.600]   Yeah, from Buzzfeed.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.600]   I think they had it longer.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.600]   Now Stephen Levy said, "Well, I got it because I was one of the four that got the original iPhone.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.600]   Except I was to point out David Pogue and Ed Begg who also were...
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.600]   No, for them not.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.600]   So I don't think it has any to do with that with Stephen.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.600]   In fact, it's fun to read the tea leaves about what Apple was up to.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.600]   Some people, and John Gruber was really upset about this.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:22.600]   Some kind of lesser known blogs like A Fashion YouTube Fashion Group and High Snobiety.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.600]   We call them the Lifestyle, Leo, the Lifestyle Channel.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   High Snobiety.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.600]   Judging...
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.600]   I would look at the High Snobiety review on YouTube.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.600]   And it would be my sense that they did not get it to take home.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.600]   That they got to go to a briefing and they were allowed to videotape a review at the briefing.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.600]   That's what a lot of the YouTube videos that went live yesterday looked like.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.600]   They looked like almost like a special hands-on area.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.600]   Do you recognize that hands-on area?
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.600]   I may or may not recognize that hands-on area, but I'm not certain.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.600]   You can't even talk about it?
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.600]   No, I'm not certain.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.600]   And so I don't want to get it wrong.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.600]   Okay.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.600]   Because there's all these YouTube spaces and there's all these places that it could be.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.600]   And I might say something the next time is on business.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:11.600]   So as far as I can tell, their entire review takes place inside this brick-lined Apple table.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.600]   That looks like an Apple table.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.600]   I have no inside knowledge, but that...
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.600]   Well, it's also the charger that...
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.600]   The Belkin charger that Apple...
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.600]   I think it's Belkin, or is it Mophia?
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.600]   That Apple's...
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.600]   Now, Andy, let me ask you, did you get an iPhone?
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.600]   Nope.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.600]   And it's...
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.600]   It's...
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.600]   Well, when I tweeted this morning after seeing that there was some sort of a ruckus online,
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.600]   I promise you I didn't read anybody's reviews.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.600]   I didn't read anybody else's commentary.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.600]   But some people seem to be bent out of shape that some people got it, not others,
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.600]   that what's Apple playing at or what does that mean.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.600]   And I felt the need to remind people that it's...
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.600]   Who gets seeded with hardware early or even on ship date has nothing to do with prestige,
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.600]   it has nothing to do with anything except for...
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.600]   This is a marketing decision.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.600]   They have a limited number of phones to distribute, literally.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.600]   It's not like they can just go into the warehouse and grab a hundred.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.600]   You know, they are assigned 12, let's say, or 8 to give to people in advance.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.600]   And there is a mission for those 8 to 12 phones to fulfill.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.600]   And so every single launch, there is a different priority or a different mission that marketing has in mind.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.600]   Like, what can we do?
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.600]   If we give...
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.600]   Do you think so that market...
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.600]   Of course.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.600]   Although I've never seen Apple so aggressively parse it this way.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.600]   It's so detailed.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.600]   We're in a transition era because it wasn't uncommon before for just the BizPobs.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.600]   There have been years where there were only four or five and it was exactly who you think.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.600]   It was Wall Street Journal and New York Times.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.600]   Right.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.600]   The original launch.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.600]   And I think...
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.600]   USA Today.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.600]   Yeah, I think the audience is changing and Apple and many companies are trying to figure it out because now you have YouTube.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.600]   Google.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.600]   Google was very...
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.600]   Yeah, with a pixel was very clearly catering-favor with the YouTube people.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.600]   And it seems that Apple is doing the same thing as well.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.600]   Yeah, that's another point that I wanted to make.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.600]   That if you've got two people that have roughly the same audience,
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.600]   maybe you're wasting one of those phones by giving both...
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.600]   Ah.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.600]   By giving those two people.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.600]   You want to find something...
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.600]   You want to give one to the tech journalist who has five million followers.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.600]   But you don't want to give it to a second tech journalist who has five million followers.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.600]   You want to use that phone to give someone who's got a really good fashion blog.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.600]   Or you give it to the person that has a really good presence in Asia.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.600]   Again, every one of those phones has a mission.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.600]   And there's always a target for whatever they do with those eight to twelve phones.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.600]   So it's not about, well, we...
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.600]   The fact that someone got a phone and someone didn't...
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:34.600]   Doesn't mean anything, again, positive about Dartanian or negative about Aliosha.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.600]   It's, again, you don't question the motives.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.600]   I'm not assuming that.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.600]   The motives of the Sphinx are impenetrable and inscrutable.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.600]   It's best to leave that question in there.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.600]   I mean, okay.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:50.600]   But Apple is clearly using access, and by the way, everybody does it.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.600]   It's called Beltway Journalism because it's done to a T in Washington.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.600]   But Apple's using access to favor some and not others.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.600]   And what was interesting is John Gruber very much felt put out by this.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.600]   He's well known for carrying Apple's water.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.600]   He was one of the five invited to the IMac apology along with Matthew Panzarena,
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.600]   who got an iPhone and Ena Freed at Axios, who got an iPhone.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.600]   Apparently he didn't.
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.600]   And he's a little snarking here.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.600]   Well, Ena didn't.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.600]   It was someone else at Axios and they let their nephew.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.600]   No, no, no.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.600]   So I think it was Ena's because...
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.600]   Ena got one yesterday, but the person was on it the week ahead.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.600]   Oh, Mike Allen.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:35.600]   So Mike Allen, who writes a very popular, by the way, Axios, daily newsletter, morning newsletter.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.600]   And Mike didn't bother reviewing it.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:44.600]   He gave it to his high college freshman nephew Anders and talked about him using the emoji
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.600]   to which John Gruber wrote.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.600]   Thank God Apple seated Mike Allen with an iPhone X review unit.
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.600]   He's got the insight from his effing nephew, the emoji expert.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.600]   And then he does the same thing.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.600]   Thank God Apple seated fashion with a review unit.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.600]   Thank God Apple seated these insightful critics.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.600]   He's talking about high snobiety with a review unit.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.600]   I'm guessing that John at the time, I think he's got one now, but John at the time had not
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.600]   been offered a review unit and is a little miffed.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:21.600]   I don't blame him because he is after all one of the foremost Apple journalists.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.600]   Jim Dalrymple at Loop Insight got a review unit.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.600]   But then there's review units and there's review units.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.600]   Some people got them for a week.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:35.600]   Some people apparently, Neil I Patel, who hasn't always been positive about Apple and the iPhone,
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.600]   got his, he says, for a day, he has to turn it back in.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.600]   He has one 24-hour period to review it.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.600]   Well, it wasn't for a day.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.600]   The embargo was the next day.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.600]   The video said he has to give it back in a day.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.600]   That would be unusual.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.600]   Well, of course he's probably going to get one Friday, right?
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.600]   Now people, now Marte in the chair says, "What a bunch of babies."
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.600]   But this is not, okay, some of this is people saying, "Well, I should have had one."
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:04.600]   But I think also the point that I'm making is that you as a reader, as a consumer of
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:12.600]   reviews, should have this data as well because Apple is, I think, very much trying to, you
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.600]   know, weigh in on who gets one who doesn't.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:19.600]   Remember, one of the reasons I refuse review units and embargoes and NDAs is because I know
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.600]   myself that I don't want to have a relationship with companies that I'm reviewing their units.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:29.600]   I don't like the pressure from the companies, but also because I want to be a nice guy.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.600]   However subtle, there's always the influence to be nice in a review because you know them.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.600]   So I keep everybody in on strength.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.600]   Well, that's only if you're a dope.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.600]   That's only if you're incompetent.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:43.600]   If that's only if you're doing stuff of nova, I'm saying that you've got to responsibility
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.600]   to do your freaking job.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:51.600]   No, I'm saying that anybody who believes that if you get review hardware or early access,
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.600]   that gives you some sort of obligation to be nice, you're not doing your job.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.600]   You're not being a journalist.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:00.600]   You're just being some dude with a backwards baseball cap on YouTube and you should aspire
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.600]   to be something better than noticing that you have okay the first move.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:10.600]   But again, even so, I'm not, again, I don't know the names of people that they gave the
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.600]   phones to.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.600]   So again, I'm not targeting this at any one person, but it's a good thing if someone
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.600]   who's never had access to the hardware before gets access for the first time.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.600]   The only problem becomes when again someone decides to not do their jobs and say that
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.600]   I want to protect, it makes me feel good.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.600]   It makes me feel really, really important to get early access to hardware.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:35.920]   I believe that if I play nicely that will mean that I will definitely get early access the
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.920]   next time.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:42.520]   But you understand the stakes here because if the Verge is scooped by a gadget or Giz
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.960]   Moto, that's a lot of page views, that's a lot of money that they've lost, there's
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.800]   a lot of prestige they've lost.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.800]   And so there are high stakes here and these companies do not want to be left out of this
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.800]   game.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.880]   And I would submit that they're very aware about why Apple gives people phones and they're
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.600]   going to be very circumspect in future.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.400]   Then that will show in their work.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.400]   Okay.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.840]   I mean, it's not something that will be invisible to how would you know, I could give you I
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.280]   could give you names, but I won't.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.000]   There's obvious, there's obvious ones.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.920]   You see, if there's I'm saying that I'm saying that there are people who are looking
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.000]   for information about, okay, how does Face ID actually work in broad sunlight?
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.880]   How does this how does this is it slippery in the hand is a screen readable from multiple
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.880]   angles?
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.440]   And then there are people who are going to look at one of these early reviews and see
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:34.440]   if it's 900 birds, they were able to pump out in the 24 hours they had 450 of them is
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.440]   like, here's how excited it was.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:41.240]   I was ushered into a back room and showed to an absolute table and offered like, this
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.600]   isn't about how wonderful it was for you to get early access to the phone.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.400]   Tell me something that's actually valuable.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.400]   I this is the thing.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:52.400]   This is just what ticks me off sometimes about some early reviews that there that the
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:57.600]   entire world of consumers who are lined up to get their get their new iPhone, they have
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:03.400]   only access to like whatever eight people who have who can publish something today on what
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.680]   the experience was like.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:09.600]   And if four of those are thrown away by what with videos and articles about how wonderful
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.680]   it was that they got this special access, that's a waste of time and that that will be
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.840]   in print that will be on video that will be there forever.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.920]   And again, I'm saying I will not name any names because there's not any point to that.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:24.120]   But in the past, I have, you know, after I filed my my own review or at least got my
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.480]   first impressions of, I will then go back and take a look at what other people thought
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.840]   and I'm like, Oh my God, you're really talking about like how cold the water was in the
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.840]   room.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.840]   I'm not I'm not quoting anybody here.
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:34.840]   I'm making up here.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.640]   But it's like that these people are dopes and these people shouldn't you know, consumers
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.480]   are smart enough to know that we only have a two hour show.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:47.920]   The I want to get my stuff and then then then then because then Renee's gonna start talking
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.600]   about the iPhone 10 and that's when I start working on my Lego kit here for an hour because
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.600]   there's nothing.
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.840]   That's what that's that love you time for him to say.
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:03.800]   I am glad Renee got one because I think that I all my only concern is the harm to readers
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.120]   who may not necessarily understand the access game that's being played here just as it's
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.200]   played in Beltway politics.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:14.720]   And they may what I also think is harmful is that there are many, many reviews now out
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:20.760]   based on a very short timeframe like like Neeliah's reviews on 10 hours.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.760]   And I think there's a great many features of this phone that we really won't know whether
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.760]   it's worthy.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:31.680]   It's a very expensive phone with whether it's worthy for a week or two.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.280]   For instance, how Face ID changes over time.
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.760]   If there is a screen burn an issue, it won't show up right away.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.840]   There are lots of things that we won't know right away.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.720]   And I think it's a disservice that and I think Apple cultivates this is I guess my
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.720]   only point.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:51.120]   I'll I'll I'll I'll say this in the in a brief that this is the last thing that I should
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.800]   that would really want to say about this.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.200]   But I don't want to I don't want to hear Apple blame for this because this is the this is
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.200]   the journalist fault.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:02.400]   You have the you if I appreciate the difficulty that a site like is Moto is in where they
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.120]   are racing to get the first click.
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.200]   They're racing to get placement and Google searches.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.840]   I understand that, but that's how they decided to run their business.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:17.400]   Everybody can get access to an iPhone by waiting up until 3 AM on a certain day.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.320]   They will get one on ship day and they can start their coverage then if they want.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.440]   If they don't actually doing a good thing.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:28.120]   I think I was I think that I am going to give you a real conspiracy theory.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:33.720]   Lisa and I in exactly the same environment tried to buy on the iOS store T mobile phones
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.960]   at exactly the same time she was able to get in and buy her phone.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.200]   I was not and never got into the iOS store.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.120]   I got in with one phone and not the other Leo.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.920]   I had two phones in front of me and one the store came up and one.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.920]   All right.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.280]   So maybe it's just a random account thing.
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.280]   They're just picking right.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.040]   I thought it hated that.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:54.960]   But the fact that I'm not going to get an iPhone until the 17th at the earliest.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.520]   I don't know.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.520]   That's fine.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:02.840]   All I'm saying is that I would caution consumers to wait first especially on a product is the
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:07.360]   first of its kind to wait not for the first day reviews.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.360]   I would wait.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.920]   Well, fortunately you have to if you're ordering today.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:16.880]   I would wait a month and see and see what happens because there's my only goal for getting
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:21.880]   that review done into the circumstance that I was able to do it is that I know there are
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.360]   people who were waiting to order to get it before Christmas or the holidays.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.560]   And I know there are people who have pre-ordered just in case and we're trying to figure out
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.720]   if they were going to cancel it or take it back.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.720]   We have time to cancel.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:36.320]   I think it's my only job is to give them all the information that I can so they can
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.200]   make the best decision they can.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.200]   And it sucks.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.920]   I didn't have more time with the phone.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:45.280]   But I'm also a grown ass reviewer and I spent a month interviewing and talking and studying
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.640]   and learning everything I could about the technology so I could make the most of the time.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:53.080]   But you will not know and many will not know for a couple of weeks.
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.600]   You may come back two weeks from now and say hey, guess what?
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.600]   There are problems.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.720]   The only mitigation is that people have been having them open carry for over a month.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:01.800]   Some people for several months.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:07.600]   So there are iPhone 10s out there that have been in use for long periods of time.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.600]   And so those are the reviewers you trust.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.760]   Yeah, I mean, there's something you can look at.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:16.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.760]   I mean, what are you going to do?
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.880]   You know, this is Apple's.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.200]   I do not deny Andy.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.880]   Apple's a right to do this.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.440]   In fact, it's probably in their interest to do this.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:29.840]   I just caution people that this is a game being played.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:38.640]   And so if you're deciding to spend $1,149 on a phone plus $279, $200 on Apple care, etc,
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.840]   it might be worth waiting till after Christmas before you.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.040]   Well, I mean, I hope I'm not.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.120]   I don't believe I'm being naive about this.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:52.280]   But I do think that the quality of an in-depth review, even the re and Renee makes exactly
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.280]   the right point.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.920]   Again, there are people who are that want in running information this week.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.920]   That's true.
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:00.840]   Even if it's just based on one day's worth of hands on stuff, there are I believe that
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.720]   Renee is in that club of people that can within that can make it very clear that in
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:08.560]   the context of I have not had this for an entire month, you'll see a much more
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:14.520]   in-depth review by me and many more hands and I'm more in the weeks after it's reviewed.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:20.320]   But if you need information as of October 31st, 2017, here is the value of the information
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.320]   that I have.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:27.240]   I just want to make sure that Apple marketing is doing the job of Apple marketing.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.920]   And I don't fault them for that.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:33.880]   I do fault the journalists who decide that getting what they will claim to be an important
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.920]   review out after essentially time in the demo room, let alone just one day in the field
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.760]   with it, that's on them.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:45.240]   And if they are in a business where they can't make money off of what they do and that
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:49.320]   upsets them, I made that choice a few years ago, three or four years ago.
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:54.600]   I really made a hard reevaluation of what would I like to do better, what annoys me,
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.600]   what's hindering me.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:00.400]   And one of them was the rush to get something out in two or three days when it's like I've
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.680]   been sitting on this for all weekend, I've been saying this for a week, I don't feel
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.080]   like I really understand this yet.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.280]   I'm going to take another few weeks.
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.600]   And yes, that costs me here and there, but it's the job that I want to do.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.400]   And I hope that that's reflected in the quality of the work that I do.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.120]   So do you agree with my premise?
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:21.040]   Do you agree with my premise that Apple is being more aggressive than I can remember
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.440]   ever than ever being in terms of doling it out?
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.760]   No, I wouldn't say so.
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:31.400]   I don't remember, for instance, variable embargoes.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.400]   They've never done that before.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.600]   The embargo for those who got the phones was all the same time.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.840]   Stephen Levy got a 24 hour head start.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:42.240]   I don't remember some people getting a day, some people getting a week.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.640]   I don't remember that because this is new.
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.120]   This is much more aggressive.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.120]   This is 2017.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.120]   This is in 2007.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:55.840]   And also, I'd also met may I say, we don't know how many actual pieces of hardware they
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.280]   had available to send out to people.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.200]   It's possible that they couldn't send out eight or 10 for two weeks.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.120]   It's possible that they could send these things out for one day at a time and make sure they
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.720]   get these damn things back because they're needed elsewhere.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:09.720]   Okay.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.560]   So I'm just saying that there are a lot of when I have to confront situations where
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:18.400]   I realize that there are a lot of variables that I can put letters next to, but I can't
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.400]   define them.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:24.800]   And when it comes to how any large company allocates advanced hardware, I have no idea.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.880]   I talk to some people behind the scenes, especially after they leave.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:33.480]   And they tell me about how they did something for a certain launch in 2014, but I don't
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.360]   know what was on that whiteboard 2017.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:40.000]   And once again, the strengths is inscrutable.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.200]   It is best not to do your job as best you can.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:50.680]   It's not my job to figure out why Apple is allocating iPhone 10s the way they have.
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:56.920]   It's my job that whenever I get mine to do the best job I can and give my focus is always
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:00.680]   on writing review that will be valuable, not only the day I publish it, but six months
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.920]   after I publish it.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.360]   And that's completely within my power to do whether Apple gives me one two weeks in advance
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.400]   or whether I have to wait until December for a ship date.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.400]   Okay.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.400]   We disagree.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.400]   That's all I meant to say.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:15.120]   Well, take a break and come back and I want to get Renee Richie's review of the iPhone
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.120]   10.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.640]   A first look, right?
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.600]   First one, how long have you had it for Renee?
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.000]   About just over a day.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Fair enough.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.520]   And I know you'll be writing more about it.
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.280]   How many, but you've already written how many words?
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.760]   The review is 10,000 words.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.800]   That was again, that was a month of prep for 24 hours.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.400]   You stayed up late.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.880]   All right, dude.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:37.880]   We'll get all the details.
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.880]   That's after a big weekend too.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.240]   You're the iron man of journalism that this particular day Renee.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.120]   So it's okay that you don't have a Halloween costume.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.120]   That's what we're saying.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.560]   I have Star Wars shoes.
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.240]   I have Star Wars shoes, Leo.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.240]   That's all we ask.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.240]   That's all we ask.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.520]   You don't like curtains behind you.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.960]   You can do a half-assed ghost.
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.160]   At least that would be something.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:02.440]   I showed you they brought to you by rocket mortgage from quick and loans.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:06.120]   I am a, I'm dressed today as a, as a banker.
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:10.000]   So put yourself in, you know, you need a home loan.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.280]   You go to the bank and the banker says, well, where's your paperwork?
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:19.320]   And then goes through a little sheaf of loans to find the one right for you.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.600]   And maybe we'll be back to you in a month, sir.
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.440]   Thank you for visiting.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.400]   That is not the way to do it.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.580]   And of course, bankers no longer dress like this if ever.
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.240]   Quick and loans has a much better way.
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:36.080]   They realize that the, the mortgage approval process really wasn't keeping up with the
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.080]   times.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:45.960]   So, to completely computerize it, to do a client-focused technological revolution, no wonder.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:51.400]   I mean, quick and loans has always been known as, as, as customer first, JD power customer
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:55.080]   satisfaction, number one for years.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:59.880]   So they created rocket mortgage, an entirely online mortgage approval process that lets
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:03.400]   you do it all, understand all the details, be, be confident you're getting the right
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.240]   mortgage for you.
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.240]   It's easy too.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:12.040]   You go online, you can do it on your phone, on your tablet, on the web, just go to rocketmortgage.com/macbreak.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:17.560]   And you can apply without going to the attic for paperwork, without contacting your bank.
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:18.560]   They'll do it for you.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.480]   They have trusted partners with all the financial institutions.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.960]   All you have to do is give them permission.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:28.440]   And then they crunch the numbers instantly based on your income assets and credits and
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.080]   give you the home loan right for you.
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.400]   You get to see it happen.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.680]   You get to choose your down payment.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:38.040]   The term, the rate, all of it.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.160]   And then boom, you're approved.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:46.000]   In minutes, in minutes, not only does it say you're approved on the screen, you can download
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.080]   an approval letter, you can send to the realtor or print out and bring to your next open
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.080]   house.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:56.480]   I can't tell you how magical that is to have that pre-approval in your hand.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.640]   Rocket mortgage by quick and loans.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.360]   Look how fast that was.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.880]   Rocket mortgage from quick and loans apply.
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:05.600]   Simply understand fully the mortgage confidently.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.760]   To get started, go to rocketmortgage.com/macbreak.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:13.600]   That's rocketmortgage.com/macbreak, equal housing lender, licensed in all 50 states
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.600]   and MLS consumer access.org number.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.600]   30, 30.
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:22.040]   Yeah, we thank rocket mortgage by quick and loans for their support.
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:24.520]   So I have purchased to date three iPhones.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.520]   I might be tens.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.520]   I might be buying another one.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.560]   Well, I'm thinking now I have to get in line on Thursday.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.560]   Or maybe Wednesday.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:36.920]   I'm going to have to see you.
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.920]   I might get in line.
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:43.040]   Some of the Apple stores will have some, although Apple warned getting in line.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.520]   Lisa gets hers.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.200]   Megan Moroni is getting hers Friday.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:51.200]   So we'll have one in house and we could show it on Saturday on the new screensavers.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.480]   That's nice.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:57.080]   My wife gets hers a week from Friday on the 10th and I get mine on the 17th.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.840]   I bought all three of those.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.040]   So I might have to buy a fourth one by getting in line.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.960]   At least I could cancel one of them by getting in line.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.640]   Renee, as you said, you did a lot of prep work.
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:11.520]   You knew what you saw at the event.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:16.040]   So this isn't even the first time you saw an iPhone 10, but it must have felt good.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.480]   Did you go to a briefing in New York City?
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.280]   Is that why you're in the big Apple?
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:28.320]   So the, yeah, I was like, you basically get to hear their perspective on the phone and
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.320]   you get the phone to review.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.360]   And then it's ready, set, go.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:35.280]   And you have, regardless of how long the embargo is, you have until embargo time to
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:39.760]   file your review and do you have to file it then?
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.200]   You could file it later.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.760]   But of course, you wanted to file it then.
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.640]   So, I mean, this is a whole tangent, but the way that the internet is set up, especially
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:53.160]   with Google, that the value of it is just, it's so much more, if you have, it's more
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.800]   like it's a really hot day and everybody's super thirsty.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:00.280]   And if you open up your drink stand two days later, there's no customers left for it.
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:04.160]   So like you, if at all possible, like I have been late on embargoes.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.880]   I have, you know, just not had time to do the job that I was proud of.
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:10.560]   But this one I prepped really hard for and I thought I could do a good job at it.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.880]   So I went, I went full tilt ahead, Leo.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.960]   Yes, I don't blame you.
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.120]   Did you, have you gotten any sleep?
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.120]   No.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.120]   You've been up all night.
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.120]   Not since I left Rhode Island.
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.120]   No, sir.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.120]   Oh, and gee.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.120]   All right.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:28.560]   And I happen to know that he had a very, very busy weekend as well.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.600]   This was bad, bad, bad timing.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.840]   My life extra tough is the storm took out the train.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:34.840]   So I had to run.
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:35.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:40.480]   And then try to get the bus to get here on time and then lift from the bus to the, yeah.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.320]   Now, how did you, when did you, how did they let you know that you were going to get to
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.400]   see one?
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.040]   When did you get that invite?
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.480]   I mean, it varies.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:51.560]   So like at some point, someone will say, you know, we're doing an embargo for the, I
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:55.120]   have never had the luxury of having a long embargo for anything.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.640]   So I sort of, you know, originally, like there's times when I've just not been invited and
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.880]   if I had to go and line up and buy an iPhone and then try to do something in whatever time
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.360]   I had there, been stuff where it's been day of, you know, like the, like you get it and
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.360]   there's no embargo.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.760]   So it's just go, go, go.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.840]   You know, and there's sometimes when it's 24 hours.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.440]   So it all varies.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.760]   Do you mind what you, are you willing to tell us when you got the word?
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:19.760]   I don't remember.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.520]   You know, to be honest with you, I don't remember this.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.720]   I went to the wedding.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:23.720]   I sold my car.
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.720]   Okay.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.160]   We should mention serenity got married on Saturday.
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.160]   On Sunday.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.160]   She was on a day.
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:33.840]   She came out to roll go on and she danced on roller skates and all of this has been
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.760]   filling my head for the last one.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.640]   So you were in Rhode Island for that?
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.640]   Yes.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.640]   But it turned out convenient.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:43.200]   Did you know when you came down to Rhode Island, you would be then heading over to New
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.960]   York City for a brief?
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:48.520]   Right before the wedding and Apple is not like there's some, I don't know how other
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.800]   companies work because I primarily cover Apple.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.600]   And I know I've heard how Google works because we have Android Central and things, but I
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.600]   don't recall.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.920]   Again, I don't recall my brains while I'm working too great right now.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:57.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.760]   But Apple, I believe it's notorious for not giving a lot of time.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.080]   Heads up for these things, bench for anything.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.160]   Did you see both a gray and a silver one?
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:10.000]   Yeah, at the event they had both gray and silver ones and at the hands ons they've had
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.200]   both gray and silver ones.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.360]   Okay.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.520]   And which do you like better?
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.480]   I ordered a gray one and I have a silver one.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:21.240]   The silver one I like because from an angle it looks like the original iPhone.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.240]   It does.
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.160]   It's just such a homage to it.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:28.160]   But the black one is, I'm so, I'm so superficially the black one looks like my watch and it's
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.160]   got a similar coating.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.040]   So I was just like, ah, it'll match.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.120]   Well, no, that's, hey, you got to have some reason.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:37.080]   And the other thing is you put it in a case almost immediately.
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.640]   I don't, I don't use cases on my iPhones.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:43.560]   Now, well, that's one question I have, especially given that these are going to be the most expensive
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.800]   iPhones ever to repair.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:46.800]   Yes.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.640]   What, what is it?
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.400]   $279 to replace the screen?
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.880]   You don't have AppleCare Plus.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:52.880]   Yeah.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.960]   Because I mean, all that display, I tried to find it because I, there's like, I'm sure
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.440]   there are Samsung stores, but I don't, I don't find it finding them.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.880]   But I fixed it was for a Galaxy phone.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:06.440]   It was like 300 bucks a panel and I, for other OLED phones, it went from 250 to 350
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.440]   depending on the vendor.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.440]   So it's a reason.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.240]   So these things are expensive.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.240]   Okay.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.240]   Does it feel more breakable?
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.040]   Because it kind of feels like it might be a little bit more fragile.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.720]   It feels like an iPhone 8 to me.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.000]   I mean, there's very little difference.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.920]   So I have the iPhone 8 here and I'll pull them back so you can see them.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.120]   But from the back, I mean, they're, they're very simple.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:32.040]   So, and we should point out it's bigger than the 8, but smaller than the plus, 8 plus.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.880]   It's very slightly bigger than the 8, not very much at all.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.240]   Let me see if I can hold them like that.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:40.120]   It's almost identical, but the screen is roughly the size of a 8 plus.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:46.000]   Now, that was one thing that Niall said in his Verge review is that it's deceptive because
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:52.920]   even though it's a 5.8 inch screen, bigger than the 8 plus, there's less usable area
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.080]   because of the notch and controls at the bottom.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.640]   So there's a very aggressive rounding.
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.840]   I mean, turn it on.
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.520]   It's a very aggressive rounding for the.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.280]   Oh, look, he's looking at it.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.880]   Does that face ID work well for you?
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.880]   It is so, so it is so good.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:10.160]   I, I, I have you, I've not had one enrolled on my face before.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:14.520]   I've seen it used and I've seen it used really fast, but the enrollment process is so much
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:18.000]   faster than touch ID and it wasn't until I launched one password.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.520]   I just tapped one password icon.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:24.560]   It came up unlocked and was ready to use like before I even realized what happened and
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:28.680]   suddenly it felt like using touch ID was almost like an encumbrance to me.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.520]   That's how quickly I got lazy.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:34.480]   But yeah, like it just, it is so fast.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:39.280]   It is almost, I don't know the word is like unbelievably fast when you start using it.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.560]   Yeah, suspiciously fast.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:46.000]   No, it's just, I don't, I'm not, I haven't used it for long enough that I know it's going
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   to do it.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   I'm still used to a touch ID world.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.920]   So I don't expect it to unlock.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:50.920]   And then I see it.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:51.920]   I see little animation.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.400]   I'm like, oh, it unlocked.
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:57.800]   One of the things I would totally respect Apple if they decided, look, although not,
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:01.280]   not the consumer ones, but the ones we're giving out to journalists, we're adding, we're
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:05.000]   using special firmware where if it fails twice, just unlock it.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.680]   Well, I feel like I've done, I've done lots of like off, like to see what the angles are
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.560]   and to see you with glasses, no glasses and different things.
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.200]   And I've had it fail.
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.960]   There's two things that I think are really going to trip people up.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.480]   And that is when you have the awareness mode on, which means you have to be like, I have
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.480]   the tiger looking at it to unlock it.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:26.680]   I think people sometimes won't pay attention and they won't remember that and it'll just
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.160]   fail and it'll take them a little while.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.840]   I think that's what Stephen Levy had.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.320]   He just wasn't looking at it.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:32.320]   Yeah, he mentioned that.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.320]   And also because you pick up your phone.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.880]   So that's a switch though you can turn on or off.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:36.880]   You can turn off.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.640]   It's more secure to have it on because someone can't just randomly hold your phone up.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:43.680]   And the other thing is when you're, when you just pick it up and move it around, it is
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.960]   still looking at you and it might try to unlock when you're not looking at it.
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:50.400]   And you could easily go through three, four, five even attempts to unlock without realizing
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.400]   it.
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.280]   And then you look at it and you're like, oh, it's locked.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.280]   Why did that happen?
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:57.840]   Oh, because I was moving it around on my desk and I must have seen my face five times.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:58.840]   Oh, interesting.
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:32:59.840]   And it's yelled at me.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:06.880]   But to get back to the screen size, so it's a little constrained because of it's not.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.480]   So, for instance, I thought, oh, this is going to be great.
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:12.800]   It's a bigger screen than the iPhone 8 in a smaller package.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:14.800]   But it's not.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.560]   So you have the horns, which just contain data.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.800]   And then at the bottom, I'll get into an app so you can see it.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:24.960]   Like in the bottom, you have the gesture area, which that has to be there so that you know
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:29.040]   that there's no home button so that swipe up, which replaces the home button.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:33.040]   And but Apple puts like there's little controls that go on both on either side of it.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.600]   They try to put stuff in almost like an Apple watch.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:39.400]   They put things in the periphery of the display that aren't super critical, but they're there
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.120]   in the use up the space that would otherwise go wasted.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.360]   So this is one of the things that's very interesting about the iPhone 10 is that it's
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.360]   a new user.
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:47.960]   It's not merely a new design for Apple.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.080]   It's a new user interface for Apple.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.640]   It's a little bit web-o-wess, Leo.
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.440]   It's just a little bit web-o-wess.
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.440]   Yeah, I like it.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.440]   I loved web-o-wess.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.280]   You just your, I don't think it doesn't seem to be just your app.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.280]   There we go.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.280]   You pull up.
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.720]   I'm not going to be able to do it.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:02.720]   It's tricky.
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.880]   It's the reasons you have to pull up just right, right?
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:05.880]   You pull up.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:07.880]   You can come in.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.080]   Half way up because you're reasons.
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.600]   You can pull down to go into reachability mode.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.600]   There we go.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.600]   It's reachability mode.
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:17.600]   Okay.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:21.200]   Then you can go to the corner and you can pull down to get control center.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:26.680]   You might not need reachability because you can get it in your hand and it's a smaller
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:27.680]   phone.
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:28.680]   Yeah, it's a slightly funny.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:31.320]   So the control panel is, how do you get to the control panel?
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.320]   You have to touch the corner.
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.320]   The control panel.
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:36.640]   Yeah, so the control panel because the bottom now is this home gesture.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:37.640]   Right.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.280]   You used to go home.
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.560]   They had to move control center to the top.
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:45.560]   So one horn is control center and the other horn is notification center.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.040]   I guess you'll get used to that.
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.560]   That's pretty intuitive.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.560]   It's funny.
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:54.400]   The first 15 minutes or so I had it and there were a bunch of people there.
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:57.960]   We were all still like just instinctively pressing the home button and looking for control center
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:58.960]   at the bottom.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:02.640]   But within, I don't know, half an hour, I was trying to swipe on an old iPhone 8 and
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.640]   pull down.
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:05.640]   That's part of the problem, right?
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:11.600]   Apple really has this problem in spades because the iPads are different from the iPhones or
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.520]   different from the iPhone 10.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.080]   It used to take me a minute to unlock an iPad because it hold my finger.
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.880]   I wonder why my ID wasn't working.
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:19.520]   This is very similar.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:20.520]   I can't remember who it was.
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.520]   Maybe it was Neil.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:25.800]   I said that maybe it was Steven Levy that Face ID sometimes unlocks right to the home
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.400]   screen, sometimes unlocks to a swipe screen.
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:29.400]   Is there Ryan?
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.400]   I've never seen it.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.600]   I've never seen it not go to the swipe screen.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:37.040]   So you have to Face ID and then swipe every time.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:42.760]   Yeah, because some people just, you were never able to please everybody and there are some
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:43.760]   people who are super concerned.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.760]   They won't get their notification.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:49.040]   All they want to do is look at the lock screen and see their notifications and see their
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.040]   data.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.760]   It'd be nice if there was a preference toggle, especially an accessibility toggle.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.280]   And hopefully we'll get that at some point.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:58.280]   But for now, you have to swipe up like do an over user action to actually open up the
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.280]   phone.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.160]   I'm not crazy about that.
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.440]   I've had Android phones like that.
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.440]   It kind of bugs me.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.760]   But okay, Samsung tends to do that.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:10.000]   I figure if I unlock it, it should go right to the home screen.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.560]   Why do I have to swipe as well?
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:16.360]   Yeah, and I'd like to be able to customize those two buttons on the front too because
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:19.400]   like first of all, it bugs me that Siri can still turn on the flashlight.
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.800]   I mean, is she asking for a raise?
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.800]   What do I have to do after you've got a flashlight?
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:25.120]   So there's a flashlight button and a camera button.
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.440]   Yeah, and the camera, you can swipe sideways to get to anyway.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.840]   So I'd like to, you know, you don't need a camera button.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:30.840]   No.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.760]   I mean, some people might want it, but I'd like to change.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:37.600]   So people are reporting now you've used OLED screens from Samsung and others before.
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:38.600]   Yes.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.160]   Since the Nexus one, I think is my first.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:45.120]   So how does this OLED compare to let's say the best screen out there right now, the
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.480]   Note 8?
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.000]   So I have not spent enough time.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   I'm hoping to do that tonight.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.680]   I have not spent enough time with them side by side to actually compare them.
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:58.240]   It is a Samsung Pentile diamond panel, but everything else about it is Apple's display
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.240]   team.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:04.280]   The anti-aliasing is Apple's and it's the anti-aliasing is so good that nobody I asked
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:07.480]   after the event actually realized that it was a diamond arrangement.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:13.360]   It's funny because people in the hate the Pentile, the diamond Pentile in the Android
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.360]   world, the S5.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:21.080]   You just can't see it and Apple's also doing their own anti-burn and technology.
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.800]   It's their own drivers.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:27.320]   They're in the most most OLED screens are not individually calibrated.
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.520]   They're either backed calibrated.
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:29.520]   Right.
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.520]   Or calibrated.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:33.320]   And that means it doesn't really matter what color management you have because you can't
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.520]   tell from one device to the other whether the colors are accurate anyway.
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:41.840]   And Apple is doing like a sub pixel level anti sorry sub pixel level color calibration
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:43.880]   on every iPhone that's coming off the assembly.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:44.880]   That's impressive.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:48.320]   So it's color accurate to RGB, SRGB.
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.320]   DCI P3.
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.320]   It's P3.
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.320]   Okay.
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.960]   And do you feel that that looks muted?
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:58.360]   No, you're used to that because of the LCD on the 8 and the 7.
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:02.520]   There's one thing Apple hasn't been able to fix and that there's no fringing.
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.840]   There's no red tint that I can find.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:07.840]   If you do go about 30 degrees off access, you will see the blue tint.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:11.120]   I think that's still inherent to OLED.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:15.080]   It feels a little bit warmer to me sometimes, but it's hard because I usually leave true
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:19.880]   tone on and true tone is always doing ambient adjustments based on whether you're an incandescent
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.920]   resin or other kinds of lighting conditions.
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.800]   So the panel can look warm, but then you hold it next to a piece of paper and it's like,
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.720]   no, no, it is paper white right now.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:30.040]   Or it could look cool and you go, oh, that's what a piece of paper next to me looks like.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:33.200]   So the human eyes are actually really lousy at determining color accuracy.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:38.000]   So I'm looking forward to the people with those big scientific measurement devices to
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   put it on there.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   But it looks like an iPhone.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.280]   The bottom line is it does not look washed out.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.760]   It does not look oversaturated.
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.040]   It just looks like an iPhone screen.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.960]   Particularly realistic though.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.720]   Some I think Steven Levy said it looks like it's painted on.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:54.440]   It's the first end to end HDR phone, which is pretty exciting because other companies
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:57.680]   like Samsung have had HDR displays, but no pipelines.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:02.360]   And Apple has had an HDR pipeline for several devices now, including the iPads and previous
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:05.440]   iPhones, but their display just couldn't output full HDR.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.840]   And now you're getting the whole package.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:12.360]   And it's really impressive when you see HDR photos in HDR and HDR movies in HDR in your
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:13.920]   hand.
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:19.160]   And it's now, of course, because of the notch, you're probably not going to use the or do
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.800]   you use the full screen.
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:26.360]   So one of the things I'm still struggling with is how do you hold the start thing?
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:30.120]   Because your fingers read it on the sides or they're covering the screen and the notch
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:32.040]   is sort of like an easy place to hold it.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:36.880]   So I've usually lifted off, but because I don't like messing with the aspect ratio of
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:40.320]   films, but I have filled it up for AR apps and for movies.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:44.280]   And because my thumb is covering a lot of the notch anyway, it hasn't bothered me much.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.160]   On white, the worst place for it is on white.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:49.400]   Like if you're looking at a web page or any app that is a pure white screen, it's hard
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:53.280]   not to see the notch, but on colored or dark screens, you start to forget it's there really
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.280]   quickly.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:59.600]   Almost everybody agrees that the notch is something you get used to very quickly.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:00.600]   Yes.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:02.600]   It's just like a little thing.
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:05.120]   Like if you stop and look at it, you're like, Oh, God, there's still a notch there.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.720]   Well, that's not exactly used to it.
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:11.720]   But it doesn't like once in a while, it draws a tent.
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:14.800]   Like once in a while, the speed will go bright white all of a sudden and you'll see that
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.760]   little cut out there, especially in landscape mode.
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:21.920]   And in portrait mode, I almost never noticed it in landscape mode because it's one sided
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:22.920]   sort of sticks out.
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:29.200]   You have a really good image in your review at iMore.com comparing the 10, the Samsung
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.360]   and the LG.
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:34.240]   I think that's a Samsung S8 or is it a Note 8?
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.240]   I'm not sure.
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:36.240]   I think it's the S8.
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.240]   Yeah.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:41.360]   But that'll give people who are familiar with these devices a better idea.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.040]   Apple is absolutely going to the edge.
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.120]   And that's the reason for the notch.
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:50.800]   Yeah, it was can we go edge to edge and while we can't put the camera underneath the screen
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:53.080]   yet, this is the best we can do.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:56.880]   The essential phone, which I have come to really like does the same thing.
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:00.440]   It's a small notch because they don't have the camera arrays that Apple has.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.800]   And you get, yeah, you get used to it.
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:02.800]   And it's real.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:07.160]   I have to say I like having a, I'm calling it a full bleed screen.
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.160]   It goes all the way to the edges.
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.160]   That's a good way.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:15.120]   I'm talking to Matthew Panzerino of TechCrunch said that Apple experimented.
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.880]   They've experimented with bolt-ons, with full bleeds, with everything.
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:23.280]   And this was just the one that they thought gave them the best blend of edge to edge display,
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.800]   you know, with the, without having an ugly sort of lump on the top of the phone.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.440]   But and here you have a comparison on the iMore review.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:30.840]   This is what you're going to have to do.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:35.920]   If you want to watch a movie without the notch impinging on the left side, you can.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:39.800]   You can zoom in, but you're going to have pillar boxes and letter boxes.
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:42.760]   You're going to have a frame all the way around it.
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:43.760]   That's the only way they can do it.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.440]   So it does sort of look just like you're using an old school iPhone.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:47.440]   Right.
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:48.440]   It looks like you just got the bezels back.
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.440]   Big bezels.
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.560]   So which mode do you tend to use?
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:59.200]   I don't use full, you know, on a normal iPhone, I very seldom push things up to full
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.200]   screen.
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.840]   I prefer whatever aspect ratio is filmed in.
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:05.640]   I don't know if that's just me being stubborn about it, but I usually keep it on the non-magnet-ified
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.640]   version.
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:07.640]   Yeah.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:08.800]   Everyone else has told me to make it big.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.800]   They just, they don't like it.
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.280]   Like, no, no, no tap, make it big, make it bigger.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:12.280]   Fill the screen.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.760]   You want to see it all, even if you're going to miss a little bit on the left edge or the
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.000]   right edge, depending on.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.080]   And that's usually camera safe.
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:21.480]   I mean, there's probably our directors who hide things in those pixels.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.000]   Those are usually cameras safe.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   People.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.200]   Because you can't assume that the screens are going to go all the way to the edge.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.200]   All right.
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.840]   So it sounds like they've done a good job with that OLED.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:33.840]   Yeah.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.600]   I mean, I will have to wait and see, but yeah, it's going to be one of the...
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:42.160]   Nobody really cared or knew who made the LCDs in previous generation iPhones because Apple
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:46.400]   is really good at sourcing, quality control, and doing the display drivers, doing all those
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:47.400]   things.
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.400]   And it's the same thing they did with OLED.
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.280]   And Samsung is really good at it, too.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.280]   So who makes the best OLED?
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.920]   I really don't care because they're both really, really good OLED.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:54.920]   Right.
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:56.640]   And really HDR is huge.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:03.760]   And having a well calibrated screen with a wide color gamut, although P3 is more for
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:10.800]   video than photos, nevertheless, with a wide color gamut and HDR is going to...
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.520]   I can't wait to see what that looks like.
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:16.920]   And the OS does support Rec 2020, which is the next bigger color space.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:23.000]   I think Google's all the way at SRGB float 12 extended, I think, but it's so complicated.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.360]   But it's got room to grow as the screens and everything else grows with it.
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.360]   Well, and there's...
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:31.000]   I think Google claimed they were calibrating individual screens, but that is apparently
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.640]   not the case, at least, with those who have been looking at the Pixel XL, Pixel 2 XL.
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:38.380]   My understanding is that they are batch-calibrating and batch-
[00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:39.380]   Ah, okay.
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.280]   Sample several units from a run that goes through.
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:45.840]   So yours may be better or worse, depending on how it stands in the batch.
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:46.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:47.840]   Oh, that is an incredibly...
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.400]   Like, anyone who works with OLED will tell you that it is not as mature as LCD, and it
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.400]   has...
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:54.560]   It is a fantastic technology, but it is incredibly challenging to produce.
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:55.560]   Right.
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:59.040]   Well, and Samsung has really owned this for a long, long time.
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:03.520]   And so LG's been making them and using them.
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:08.080]   There are a few phones that have used them, but this will be probably the single biggest
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.080]   change.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.880]   Well, I can't say that, because Face ID is a big change.
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:18.600]   And the new UI, and you've got a great guide to the ins and outs of the new UI.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:21.240]   Yeah, it takes a little bit of getting used to.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.960]   We have a separate one up that has all the different animations and stuff up to it, because
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:25.520]   I think it's going to be something that...
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:26.520]   It does feel...
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:27.520]   I mean, like...
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.000]   And I think you and Andy can relate to this, but this is the most fun.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.800]   I've had with an interface since WebOS.
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:35.960]   Like, I love that WebOS gesture area, and this gives me some of that magic back.
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:37.240]   And you feel it's discoverable?
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:39.080]   Because that's really the question.
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:42.920]   You know, Microsoft did something simpler with Windows 8, and because it wasn't discoverable,
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.600]   it was really a flop.
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:49.040]   So it is Zelda more than Mario, and that they give you hints when you first set it up.
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:51.280]   They explain to you what the different gestures do.
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.280]   But then they...
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.280]   So they do this other trick too.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:57.880]   It's like the minute your finger touches the panel on an iPhone X, they boost the touch
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:01.960]   response rate to 120 Hertz, which is double what any other iPhone has had.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:06.800]   So it is incredibly fluid, and it feels like it's literally stuck to your finger.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:09.800]   So it makes it an incredibly good experience, and then you just want to play with it.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.400]   And you want to keep doing it because like, "Ooh, I can make the card do this."
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:13.400]   Dance card, dance!
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.400]   And you just...
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.640]   You keep moving it and swiping it and pointing it up.
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:17.720]   And after a while, it just...
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:21.200]   It feels like you are literally pushing around these digital cards.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.400]   And the apps look like cards.
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.400]   They're called cards.
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.400]   You pull them down.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.400]   It's very much like WebOS.
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.400]   You pull them down.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.400]   There's a card view.
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:29.920]   You get the whole card down for each ability.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:33.400]   It makes intuitive sense.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.560]   Camera roughly the same as the iPhone 8 Plus.
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:39.760]   But the only thing I can think is different is it's got a OIS in the telephoto, right?
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:44.960]   Yeah, it's about a third of a stop better because it's got a 2.4 instead of a 2.8 aperture.
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.720]   And it's got a OIS.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:47.720]   Okay.
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:48.720]   And Animoji.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:52.040]   And I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.040]   Should people buy this phone?
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:55.040]   Who should buy this phone?
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.040]   Who shouldn't buy this phone?
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.360]   What's about Animoji quickly is they are delightful.
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:00.520]   I'm going to be sending them to everybody, including you.
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.760]   And the annoying everybody who doesn't have an iPhone tailing, you're going to piss
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:04.760]   us all off.
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:07.480]   You know they're going to be like digital touch in which I think there'll be a glut
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:08.640]   of them in the beginning.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:09.640]   And then...
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:13.520]   But I think it's more a tech demo is to show what you can do with ARKit more than anything
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.240]   else because if you don't...
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.240]   Face...
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.560]   Sorry, Snapchat is already doing similar stuff.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:19.440]   It's really interesting and cool too.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.840]   So it's sort of like your gateway into a face tracking for AR.
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:28.360]   Renee, can you think of anything like in the first 10 minutes of using it that you thought,
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.560]   "Oh my God, this is such a fail."
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:33.040]   That at the end of the day, I thought, "Oh, I was wrong about that.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:36.120]   I just didn't get used to that," or "I didn't know how to use it correctly."
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:37.120]   No, I...
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:39.040]   Like, let's say someone gets a...
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:42.680]   Their new iPhone is like, "Oh my God, this is such a bad thing."
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:46.880]   Or maybe something you might see in someone else's review after a day saying, "Oh, this
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:47.880]   is a total fail."
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:48.880]   That kind of thing.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:52.640]   Yeah, I mean the biggest thing I think for people, I mean, Face ID, if you are a single
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:56.680]   person and you're okay with the use case, it's fine.
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:59.040]   But if you're used to having multiple fingers enrolled for different...
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.120]   Like maybe your partner has it when you hit a point.
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:02.280]   Oh, that's a good point, yeah.
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:03.280]   Or you're used to using...
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:04.280]   And you shouldn't do this.
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:07.160]   I had one person complain that he won't be able to use Face ID while he's driving.
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:09.960]   And you should be using Siri for that.
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:14.400]   But some people are used to using it in situations where the camera will not be facing them.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.880]   So it could be...
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.680]   For them, it will be a downgrade.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:21.240]   And they're going to maybe be much happier sticking with an iPhone 8 or the phone with
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:26.120]   a fingerprint sensor rather than let Face ID mature for a generation or two first.
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:30.880]   That's to me, that's the biggest thing that might hit some people the wrong way.
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:35.280]   I'm feeling that a lot of people who get their new iPhones are going to think that,
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:37.000]   "Oh, Face ID is always failing.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.600]   It's always asking me for my password, not realizing that, yeah, that's because when
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:44.520]   you get home, everybody wants to look at your new phone.
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:46.920]   At work, everybody wants to look at your new phone.
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:50.640]   And each one of those new faces looking directly at the screen records as a fail.
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:53.720]   And after five, they're going to turn that feature off."
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:58.080]   That's what happened, by the way, in the demo.
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:01.280]   Was it Craig Federighi who didn't recognize?
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:07.680]   But that was because five stage hands had looked at the phone and it required his passcode
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:09.200]   after the five failed.
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:11.520]   And like I said, even if you're just moving your phone around on your desk, because you
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:13.240]   can tap the screen, it's got a whole new touch layer.
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:14.240]   It's been already done.
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:15.240]   You can tap the screen to wake in.
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:18.080]   If you're just picking up from your desk to put it on a charging pad, it might try to
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:20.600]   authenticate you without you looking at it and it will fail.
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:23.320]   So it's like with the fingerprint sensor and water.
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:25.520]   Like when your finger was moist, touch ID wouldn't work.
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:28.440]   There's going to be situations where the face ID won't work either.
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:31.480]   So there are, of course, issues with a 24-hour review.
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:33.920]   One is how face ID will age over time.
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:35.000]   The other is battery life.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.040]   I'm sure you don't have any sense one way or the other of how the battery life will be.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.040]   No.
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:43.240]   Apple's reported numbers are similar to a plus-size iPhone and the smaller iPhone package.
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:47.080]   And I can tell that it's much more aggressively, they're doing, they're much more aggressively
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:51.640]   managing power, but they're also using the face ID camera to recognize when you're looking
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:54.920]   at it and then, they're doing this really interesting thing.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:49:00.120]   It's a awareness, a contextually awareness based computing where if you're looking at
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:05.040]   it, notifications will expand, alarms will go down, ringers will suppress.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:09.040]   The screen won't dim as quickly because they know you're paying attention to it.
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:11.960]   But conversely, when they think you're not paying attention, they'll ramp the screen down
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:12.960]   faster.
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:14.160]   They'll ramp up down other processes faster.
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:16.800]   I think they ramp down GPS faster too.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.600]   It's much more conservative with battery life.
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:23.040]   In sum, let me read the two paragraphs Renee wrote at 5.59 AM.
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.040]   Oh, so.
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:25.040]   Very good.
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.040]   God bless you, Renee.
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:27.040]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:33.680]   I know the weekend you had and I know the Monday you had and I don't think of the storm.
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.120]   God bless you.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:42.160]   You reminded me of, I had a pre-release iPad and I had to go to New York to be on one
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.720]   of the network warning shows.
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:47.760]   And that's when there was like flooding in a hurricane and all Amtrak service was suspended
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:53.080]   all the way into New Jersey and I had to drive at 4 AM.
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:59.760]   It's like, no, God hates the person who has pre-release hardware.
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:01.440]   It's expensive Renee writes.
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:02.440]   It's hard to get.
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:06.840]   It will take some getting used to and it will have its share of quirks, but it's not
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:12.840]   just tomorrow's iPhone today and it's not just the beginning of what comes next.
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:16.480]   It's the best damn product Apple has ever made.
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.720]   And I think that's true.
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:22.400]   If you'd asked me like before iPhone 10 came out, I would have not said iPhone 8.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:27.080]   I would have said the iPad Pro is with promotion or the AirPods were the best product Apple
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.760]   is made in the last year or so.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:33.360]   But I think iPhone 10 is just further ahead than those even.
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:37.480]   And now of course, there's a lot of iPhone 8 users who are kicking themselves.
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:38.480]   Right?
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.520]   Because we bought this a month ago.
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.320]   I mean, some people won't want this.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:43.320]   They'll want touch ID.
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:44.320]   They'll want what they're used to.
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:45.320]   And they're waiting for that experiment.
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:49.600]   They'll look like, "Yeah, Leo, you use that when you tell me how it is and maybe in a
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:50.960]   few months I'll get it."
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:52.960]   Oh, man.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:54.480]   Some people don't like Rev A boards.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:55.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:57.720]   As somebody who bought the iPhone 8 Plus.
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:59.240]   You bought the Mac Pro.
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:01.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:02.240]   I mean, this is my job.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:03.320]   So I can't very well complain.
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:10.880]   But if somebody did buy the iPhone 8 because they wanted the new iPhone and then now they're
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:15.760]   starting to hear all of this about the iPhone 10, this was a risky strategy for Apple.
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:22.400]   And of course, it seems to be the case that iPhone 8 orders were very much down and iPhone
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.960]   10 orders are through the roof.
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:29.160]   So those of us dumb enough to buy an iPhone 8 when we knew we wanted the iPhone 10, there
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:32.240]   are few and far between or at least fewer than usual.
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:35.680]   But still, it's kind of a don't.
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:38.680]   It's like getting your iPhone.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:41.840]   It's like getting your iPhone SE the same day they shipped iPhone 6.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:43.840]   It's for some people they just want the damn spot.
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:45.480]   It always happens to me.
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:46.480]   Always.
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:51.560]   And also, if you're happy with your iPhone 8 or even if you're happy with your existing
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:54.920]   iPhone 7 or 6, don't be sad about this.
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:55.920]   It's easy.
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:52:00.640]   Ask yourself if you're still going to be sorry a week or two from now when we're not
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:03.240]   all talking about the iPhone 10.
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:09.680]   It's for a lot of people that extra $150 to $300 is a really big deal.
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:12.520]   And so don't feel bad that you don't have the brand new shiny shiny.
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:17.480]   It means that you'll get the iPhone 10 plus 2 that you'll get two years from now.
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:20.840]   When it's time to replace a iPhone 8, it will be that much better.
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.320]   Maybe there'll be no notch.
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:27.880]   Maybe there'll be the holographic Jarvis module in places to speak real.
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:33.200]   I think that's really the only consolation is this is the first iPhone.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:38.760]   Of this new generation and it will, you know, obviously be better next time.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:40.640]   And so you'll get the better one.
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.640]   It just you have to wait a little.
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.840]   I remember when the original iPhone came out, it was very expensive to get in Canada
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:47.000]   because you had to get it unlocked and I wasn't sure I'd like it.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.720]   I had a trio pro and I loved that.
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:49.720]   Right.
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:52.520]   So I bought the iPod touch and I had the iPod touch a couple months and I kept watching
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:53.840]   and I kept listening to my break weekly.
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:55.440]   I kept looking at all the reviews finally.
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:56.440]   I'm like, no, okay, I'm sold.
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:58.360]   I'm getting the iPhone and then I paid for it.
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:00.560]   So for me, it was like a plateau in the water.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.560]   Yep.
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:06.880]   And if you any remember if you bought it, if you bought it less than 14 days ago, you
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:09.360]   can take it back and get a refund just in case.
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:13.280]   If you don't mind not being having a phone for four to seven weeks.
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:15.280]   What is it up to now?
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.280]   Let me just quickly.
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:17.280]   I think it's still five to six weeks.
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.280]   Yeah.
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:20.240]   That's an inch by the way, it is not into next year yet.
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:24.880]   And so all those rumors that people would be waiting until 2018.
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:25.880]   They're ramping up.
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:28.840]   I think they're ramping up future production faster than they expect.
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:31.360]   We're not faster than the financial analysts dreaded.
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.360]   Right.
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:33.800]   We're not more than the rumor mill.
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.760]   And this isn't like the Nintendo classic.
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:39.760]   It's not as though they intend to keep this in short supply.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:40.920]   They intend to make it.
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:43.400]   They'll be continuing to manufacture and continuing to make them.
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:46.800]   And they're hoping towards a day when you can walk into any store and buy the one you
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:47.800]   want.
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:54.600]   Well, and if you're a sprint customer, apparently you could order it even like on two or three
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:59.880]   days later, a lot of sprint people were able to get theirs.
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:02.600]   But I was, I'm sure Verizon is very difficult.
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:03.600]   T-Mobile.
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:04.600]   Same thing.
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:05.600]   Yeah.
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:06.600]   I wonder.
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:07.600]   Five to six weeks still.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:12.120]   Was this the first time you couldn't just simply buy a completely unlocked iPhone?
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:15.040]   No, they did that for quite a while.
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:16.760]   And then they stopped.
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:20.680]   But for a while, in fact, I think it was the iPhone 6S.
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:23.600]   They didn't sell it unlocked until a few months later.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:24.600]   And then they sold it unlocked.
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:25.600]   Right.
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:26.600]   Is that right?
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:28.360]   Most of the world they will sell it unlocked in the US.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:30.080]   It is always a crapshoot.
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.720]   Some years they have, some years they haven't.
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:36.720]   But you can typically, in the last couple of years, I think the T-Mobile one and the Verizon
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:39.280]   the GSM sim slot have been factory unlocked.
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:41.480]   So you could get one of those and do what you wanted with it anyway.
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:46.200]   The conventional wisdom last year was get a Verizon because the FCC is requiring them
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:48.600]   to unlock the LTE chip.
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:52.240]   And Verizon has both CDMA and GSM radios.
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:53.240]   Is that right?
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:54.280]   They have the call combo on that.
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:56.280]   Yeah.
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:58.280]   So if you get it from, if you get the Verizon, probably in other words, if I wait in line,
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:04.080]   which I'm going to, on Thursday to get the phone on Friday, I will get the Verizon phone.
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:05.920]   Except I'm not a Verizon customer.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:06.920]   Do they validate?
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:08.640]   Do they verify whether you're a customer?
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:10.120]   It depends because some people are resell.
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:13.240]   I know there was an investment in best buy, I think, selling them unlocked for $100 more
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:17.840]   than retail price because they make more money off contract phones than they do off.
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:21.600]   You know, flat fee phones, but it's a bit of a mess.
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:26.440]   So as I could go in, I know I can get a, well, if they have any, I can get it as a T-Mobile
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:29.200]   customer, but I'm not currently a Verizon customer.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:32.600]   Would I be able to go into the Apple store and buy a Verizon phone?
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:33.680]   Because that would be the one to get.
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:35.960]   You could always put a T-Mobile store.
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:39.080]   I think resellers might push back on you because they want, you know, they want to
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:40.080]   make money off.
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:41.440]   I believe so.
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:43.440]   I can't remember.
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:48.200]   I know sometimes, I know when you buy it online, they go through the carrier, right?
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:55.200]   But when you buy it in the store, especially if there's a long line and they're in a hurry,
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:56.400]   well, I'll, I'll, I'll let you know.
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:57.400]   No, next week.
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:59.240]   Please do.
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:07.840]   How early would you suggest, guys, from your vast experience, I should get in line?
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:14.480]   If I were, if I were trying to get one by one on Friday, my target would be a Verizon
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:16.280]   store or an AT&T store.
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:17.680]   Oh, not the Apple store.
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:18.680]   Not something there.
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:19.840]   Cause it's weird every time.
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:24.280]   I remember the every single time that this comes up, people, people can still get them
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:29.680]   like the day of at like 10 or 11 or noon because no one is thinking to all the people who are
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:33.400]   excited about getting at the first day are heading to the mall to the Apple store.
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:37.920]   They're not going to the AT&T store next to the Dunkin Donuts off the, off the interstate.
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:41.040]   I actually did that on the first iPhone.
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:44.800]   I bought it from AT&T because I knew I could get it there.
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:46.720]   And I knew that the lines were horrific at the Apple store.
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:49.480]   You just have to be more flexible in which model, like sometimes they don't have as many
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:50.960]   of each color as an Apple store.
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:52.720]   John, John's the last guy I went in the line with.
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:55.240]   And I know Josh Windish is going to go to Berkeley and get in line.
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:58.040]   I'm going to have to communicate with him because he says if he can get one, he's going
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.920]   to get one for me.
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:01.000]   You can get two.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   I may have more.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   Anybody want an iPhone 10?
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   I may have many.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.280]   Well, I feel an obligation.
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:12.600]   You know, my, my deadline is the radio show this weekend.
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:16.800]   I feel somewhat of an obligation and I will have at least looked at one on Friday, but
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:21.040]   I feel somewhat of an obligation to have something to say on Saturday and Sunday on the radio
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:22.040]   show.
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:26.160]   And Apple, by the way, just in case you're interested, that's a show that speaks to 200
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:31.280]   markets to a million people who potentially are interested in iPhone 10.
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:35.840]   And I'm going to have to apologize to them and say, hey, I'm sorry, but I don't, I can't
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:39.080]   tell you anything about the iPhone 10 till November 17th.
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:41.400]   And I don't, I feel like that's doing them at his service.
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:42.400]   Not doing me at his service.
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:45.080]   I'm not in that big a hurry, but it's doing them at his service.
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:49.120]   I will probably get in line just for that reason because I owe it to them.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:54.800]   And I'm thinking midnight, midnight Friday, 1201 Friday morning, right, John?
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:55.800]   It opens at eight AM.
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:58:00.560]   I do around 11, but I would watch Twitter for people who I knew were at the store I was
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:03.600]   going to go to and see what they were saying about the line and then either hurry up or
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:04.600]   slow down.
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:05.840]   Yeah, that's I'll watch.
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:10.680]   But our line in Santa Rosa, nobody tweets and it's going to rain, right?
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:11.680]   And there's no shelter.
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:13.120]   We are, I remember that.
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:18.240]   So I'm going to, oh Lord, I'll, I'll tweet some green pictures of me and my, and by the
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:20.640]   way, I'm going to wear this outfit.
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:27.320]   I'm going to say I have arrived to purchase an iPhone 10 young man.
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:29.360]   I am the male of the line.
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:30.360]   Have you any?
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:32.360]   I want to be the treasure.
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:33.360]   Yes.
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:36.720]   You are deputy of doughnuts.
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:40.600]   Go get me a crawler.
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:44.120]   We have, by the way, deciphered Andy's outfit.
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:47.920]   Somebody actually put a YouTube video up.
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:48.920]   Is it Patrick Delahanty?
[00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:53.280]   Oh, we deciphered it in house.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:54.280]   Very good.
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:55.280]   Patrick Delahanty recognized it.
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:57.600]   Let me, let me play the video.
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:01.600]   It is, you are the artist from Sesame Street.
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:02.600]   That's right.
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:03.600]   The mad painter.
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:11.440]   The mad, the mad painter and I can't find the video, but all time Benedict.
[00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:13.440]   Oh, here it is.
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:14.440]   Got a pain to three.
[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:15.440]   Here it is.
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:16.720]   Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:21.040]   The mad painter.
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:24.160]   You look exactly like him, Andy.
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:26.120]   I also have the pants and I have the sneakers.
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:27.120]   Oh, really?
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:31.480]   So this wasn't something you threw on when you saw I was wearing a strange outfit.
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:38.840]   No, I got, well, I had it ready for Rhode Island Comic Con and also maybe greeting people
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:39.840]   at the door tonight.
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:40.840]   Got it.
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:42.120]   It might be too deep catalog for the kids.
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:44.960]   I think the kids are going to go as I did.
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:49.520]   Oh, you're Marcel Marso because it is a little bit of a tribute to Mimes, right?
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:51.280]   I mean, it's silent.
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:57.160]   Yeah, there's a, or it's a tribute to like low budget early Sesame Street where they
[00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.760]   couldn't afford to roll sound during remote shoots.
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:06.760]   But yeah, you know, if I, if I had a girlfriend who looked like Stalker Channing, we'd be
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:07.760]   like that.
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:10.160]   She would, we'd have, she'd be having a vital purse.
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:11.160]   And who is that actor?
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.160]   I recognize it, but I can't.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:14.600]   It's Paul Benedict, a legendary Paul Benedict.
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:20.160]   Character actors, we all know their faces, but often can't place them before she married
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:21.160]   Martin Sheen.
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.160]   I'm so confused.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.160]   Yes, it is.
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:26.960]   And who doesn't love Stalker Channing?
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.760]   It's just, just a governor.
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:29.760]   Pinkie Tuscadero.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:35.920]   Yeah, Sesame Street was kind of like, like the, the CSI or the, or the law and order of,
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:40.080]   of TV back then where it's like, if you were a working actor at some point, you would be
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:45.760]   sent out on audition for a Sesame Street and you'd earn enough money to stay in New
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.680]   York and continue trying to get work.
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:51.200]   Is, is by the way, the only number he can paint the number three?
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.400]   No, no, he does.
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:57.320]   He, there, there, there are video films for I think up to 11.
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.320]   Oh, good.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.160]   I know I chose the three.
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:04.480]   I chose the three because my first intent was to wear this at New York Comic Con, but
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.920]   I couldn't, but I couldn't go.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:11.280]   I selected the three because I could get this into a pocket and I'd have to, I'd have to
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.440]   walk around like this all the time.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.240]   That is a great Halloween costume.
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:18.320]   Cause it's people look at it and go, I know it's a costume.
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:21.120]   My, my, I have no idea what it is.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:24.080]   For years, for years, like I love taking pictures of cosplayers.
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:28.040]   For years, I thought I'd love, it's sort of like my attitude towards tattoos that would,
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:32.520]   I would love to do it, but only about like something that I really was like excited about.
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:37.000]   I also knew that I didn't want to be another Spider-Man or another stormtrooper.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.160]   I wanted a costume where one out of 10,000 people would get it, but that one person would
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.960]   like not stop talking about it for the entire weekend.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:50.240]   This is what some people guessed you were and actually could be adapted, I think.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.160]   Again, I could, I could make that day two.
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:54.600]   You've got the bowler.
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:56.880]   I don't know if that's worth wearing a tie for though.
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.120]   It's McGree and the green apple.
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:00.120]   Yeah.
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:06.120]   I also, I did cosplay technically as Bill Cunningham last year at near ComCon.
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.600]   The New York Times fashion photographer.
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:08.600]   Oh, that's right.
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:09.920]   I remember that from last year.
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:10.920]   Yeah.
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:11.920]   With your little camera.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:12.920]   Yeah, that was cute.
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:13.920]   I had a, I had the blue.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:14.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:18.120]   Like, all I did was, oh, if I pack my base, my base pants.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:24.080]   By the way, I just want to point out that, uh, Apple's jail does not last forever.
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:28.880]   Gizmodo also got an early look at the iPhone.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:35.160]   Although I think they were the 24 hour wonders as opposed to the seven day reviewers.
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.160]   I'm not sure.
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:38.400]   Only Nixon could go to China.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:39.400]   That's right.
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:40.400]   That's right.
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:41.400]   Only.
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:42.400]   Yes.
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.400]   Yes.
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:46.880]   You trust them because, uh, I don't know.
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.360]   Um, all right.
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:54.320]   Anything else you want to say before we move on, um, people seem to love the display.
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:59.800]   The general agreement is that face ID works well, doesn't, as Apple said, work well with
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:00.800]   identical twins.
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:05.000]   Although there's some disagreements, some identical twins were not able to unlock their
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.240]   siblings phone, but some were.
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:10.920]   We actually, Megan Maroney has identical twin sons.
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:14.400]   So I asked her when she gets hers on Friday to try it on.
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:17.080]   Hook and Milo, the unfortunately they have different hairdos.
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:20.440]   I don't know if that will be considered or not.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:26.080]   Well, I do, I do want to, I do want to tease my upcoming iPhone 10 review that I've, if
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:29.880]   I've got there's some, there's some things in the works I'm going to have the most wonderful
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:31.680]   test of face ID possible.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:35.320]   It's going to involve some travel to make it happen and also have to get permissions that
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:36.880]   go up and down a certain ladder.
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:37.880]   Good.
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:40.040]   But if that, but if it works out, oh boy, am I going to be proud of this?
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:41.880]   When can we look for that?
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:48.160]   Uh, if it, if, uh, if it happens, then I will probably post something about the face ID thing
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:53.920]   like the day after I do it, which would be sometime hopefully and by the next week, the
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:57.200]   review will have to wait until I've had it for two weeks.
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:01.160]   So you, and you ordered and, uh, when is yours coming the seventh?
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:04.360]   I mean, the 10th, this you got, you got November 3rd.
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:07.520]   Yeah, maybe because I kind of, I kind of game the system.
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:10.360]   I thought that no one was going to want the 64 gigabyte one.
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:14.760]   Ah, I also thought what's the least popular, uh, telco.
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:18.320]   So give me the AT&T 64 gigabyte silver one.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:21.040]   And I don't know if that, I don't know if that was a positive or negative, but I got
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:24.520]   in, but I also was like, they're a three oh one AM.
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.080]   So that was probably part of it.
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:28.800]   And you, and you use the iOS app.
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:31.440]   I had the iOS app on the iPad.
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:37.480]   I also had the web, the web app open, uh, on my notebook and cursing like hell because
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:40.200]   there's, there's no refresh button on the iOS.
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.680]   I know you have to force quick.
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:43.880]   We've got great things to store for you.
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:44.880]   Like great.
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:47.120]   So why don't you just tell me if you're open yet?
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:48.120]   Yeah.
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.040]   So I had four screens.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:56.120]   I had, uh, the Apple store on the web team mobile on the web and two iOS, my iPhone and
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:01.120]   my iPad, force quit iOS store, you know, every minute.
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:05.040]   Um, I'd again never got into the iOS store after half an hour.
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:08.480]   It was still, you, we've got wonderful things in store someday.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:13.920]   Uh, well, and by the way, I finally, I finally did get through on the web store and purchased
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:20.680]   a silver 256, which I'm getting two weeks later on this on the third, 10th, 17th, the
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:21.680]   24th.
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:22.680]   I don't know how that works.
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:25.400]   Cause I was logged into the same account on a one on the iPhone eight, one of the iPhone
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:28.520]   eight plus iPhone eight plus one came up like 15 minutes before the iPhone eight.
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:29.520]   It's not weird.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:33.720]   I don't know how they're doing it either, but, um, Lisa who decided she didn't want to
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:39.880]   get up, just lay in bed and ordered it on the iOS app and went back to sleep.
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:42.720]   And when I finally got mine, I went running in, I said, did you get yours?
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.760]   Did you just, why are you waking me up?
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:45.760]   I got it.
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:46.760]   I got it a long time ago.
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:47.760]   Yeah.
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:50.120]   I don't, I don't know what that says about me.
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.560]   I did not get out of bed at 11 a.m.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:55.880]   for the solar eclipse, but I did step at three a.m.
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:57.840]   to get something about you.
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:58.840]   Yes.
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:05:59.840]   It's only midnight for us.
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:01.640]   Nothing I'm ashamed of by the way.
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:02.640]   Yeah.
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:08.560]   Apple store was slow to open as always and was, uh, was, uh, actually once you got in,
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:10.080]   it worked fairly briskly.
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.540]   Um, so that's good.
[01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:19.040]   Some people had prop had problems with the validation at the, uh, at the, of the carrier,
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.560]   but that was the carriers problem.
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.920]   And Apple was actually helping them out a little bit on the carrier's head as always
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:24.920]   had miserable.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:29.720]   But Apple, Apple had a fail safe and was saying that, okay, I sense that I sense that
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:31.800]   T-Mobile is screwing you over.
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.040]   We will hold your place.
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:34.400]   We reserve this for you.
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:36.320]   You have 24 hours to get this working.
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:37.320]   Right.
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:38.560]   Yeah, you get a reservation number.
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:43.520]   Although I heard some people say that theirs did not work subsequently, you know, it's
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.520]   on Twitter.
[01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:46.720]   You see a lot of different stories.
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:52.880]   I'd love to, I hope I live long enough that I can read somebody's oral history of the
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:58.560]   people at Apple that work the back room for three oh one a.m. on ship on, on sale day.
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:03.640]   That must be, um, that must be like, it makes the, the, the team of people that were sitting
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:08.000]   there, huddling at every bank, uh, at the turn of the millennium, just multiply that
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.280]   by a hundred.
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.640]   That must be the situation.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:15.400]   And the, the, the mere fact that Apple still has to shut down the entire store until, and
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:18.320]   reopen the doors when they're ready for pre orders.
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:22.400]   There's got to be an interesting story behind that, why that has to happen.
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:25.440]   And, uh, Renee has Pokemon go on the iPhone 10.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:30.440]   They haven't updated it.
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:31.440]   It's lettering letterbox.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:35.440]   Yeah, I see that on, uh, on your article on the, uh, on the key things.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.440]   Big bars at the top and the bottom.
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:42.080]   Well, that's actually something we didn't mention, but, uh, apps that are used that are
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:47.240]   written using Apple's preferred method of screen, uh, adaptability do not adapt well
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:49.000]   to the iPhone 10 screen.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.080]   That's like Pokemon go.
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:52.960]   They have, uh, bars at the top and the bottom.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:57.560]   Uh, there, and, uh, Neel I Patel reported there were a great many of those.
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.800]   So, uh, there, be prepared.
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:02.840]   There will be apps that don't take advantage of the full screen.
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.680]   It's not, to me, it doesn't seem horrible.
[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:05.680]   Is it horrible?
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:09.680]   No, it's like when the iPhone five came out and the iPhone four S apps that hadn't, uh,
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:12.200]   you know, adjusted yet had the bars on top and bottom.
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.800]   I don't know the intricates of the details.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:18.640]   I mean, almost everyone uses adaptive UI and, uh, size classes.
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:24.840]   And it is the iPhone, the iPhone 10, even though it has a screen the size of an iPhone
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:27.800]   plus is still compact, compact.
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.280]   It's not compact regular.
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:32.920]   So it's, it's a small interface like an iPhone eight or an iPhone seven would be.
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:35.480]   That bugs me because I have trouble with the small keyboard.
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:38.440]   Uh, I have fat keyboard is stretched out.
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.000]   Like it's not, the keyboard is not smaller.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.320]   It just when you rotate it, you don't get that extended keyboard.
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:43.320]   Oh, okay.
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:44.320]   All the different characters.
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:45.320]   Oh, okay.
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:46.320]   So it's, is it a little narrower?
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:47.320]   Like it's a narrow display.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:48.320]   And it's a little narrower than it is.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:50.800]   I mean, the aspect ratio changed, uh, but I haven't had any trouble.
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:54.640]   I've been using iPhone pluses since they came out and I've had no trouble typing on it.
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:55.640]   Good.
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:56.640]   Yeah.
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:02.040]   I have sausage fingers and I need big, I never liked the iPhone keyboard to be honest.
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:07.400]   Um, and it comes with 11.0.3.
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:11.040]   It will ship with 11.0.3, but iOS 11.1 just came out.
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:14.080]   So you'll be able to, um, upgrade it as soon as you get it.
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:17.520]   And that lets me segue to our next story.
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:18.520]   We're going to take a break.
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:19.520]   Are we going to cover emoji?
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:20.520]   Are we going to cover emoji, Leo?
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:21.520]   Oh, you, okay.
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:23.040]   We'll do 11.1 in a bit.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.040]   What about emoji?
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:27.600]   No, I mean, I was, I was skipping the an emoji.
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.320]   Are you going to send me one so I can show it?
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:32.080]   Oh, do we send you an, I'll send you an an emoji, but I was just talking about 11.1 and
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.080]   an emoji.
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.080]   I was getting all excited.
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:35.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:38.240]   When we talk 11.1, you can yesterday, you can talk about the new emoji.
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.880]   Leo, nobody cares about anything else in operating system.
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.400]   Oh, you know, emoji.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:43.400]   So sad.
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:44.400]   A world.
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:45.400]   What a world.
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:46.400]   And hamburger and lettuce, but litter.
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.400]   Yeah, please.
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:50.400]   So send me a, I guess I gather we'll have to be on Apple's messages.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:51.400]   Right?
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:52.400]   Yes.
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.400]   I'll send it to you.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:55.400]   Let's see.
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:56.400]   I'm, I'm all excited about this.
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.640]   I'm going to do it on my iPad.
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:03.040]   So we'll be able to, uh, after, after, after the nuclear apocalypse when there's no technology
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:07.160]   for emojis, it's only us old time, which remember how to type a colon and a, and a,
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:08.160]   and a parentheses.
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:10.240]   God, I still have those skills, Andrew.
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:12.280]   Convey our emotions via text messages.
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:16.240]   All right, let's watch Renee, uh, make a fool of himself, uh, making recording.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:17.520]   Oh, you're going to watch me do it?
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.520]   Okay.
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:19.520]   All right.
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:20.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:21.520]   So I'm going, I'm going in here.
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:25.400]   I am choosing Leo LaPorte, uh, from my contacts.
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:26.400]   Okay.
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.320]   I am going, which, which emoji do you have?
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.520]   Whatever you like the best.
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.400]   No, I, I'm not, I'm not picking.
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:33.960]   So if I do it, if I do a poop emoji, that's okay.
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:34.960]   Poops fine.
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:37.000]   Turn off the camera first though.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   Come on.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.360]   I don't know your hotel room.
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:40.360]   What do you mean?
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:47.160]   Well, you know, it uses a 3D camera to sense what you're doing to how to, oh, I'm sorry.
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.640]   I might, I may have misinterpreted how that feature was.
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:52.160]   Hello, I am your friend, Mr. Poop.
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:54.120]   This isn't any emoji.
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:55.120]   Okay.
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:57.160]   So we saw his face.
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:59.720]   Now we're going to get the emoji and we will see.
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:00.720]   Yeah.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:01.720]   Yeah.
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:02.720]   Send it.
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:03.720]   Send it.
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:04.720]   Send it.
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:05.720]   I want it.
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:06.720]   I want it.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:07.720]   I think it's Andy.
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:08.720]   I know.
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:09.720]   It's the end of times.
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:12.360]   I think it's that they spent all this billions of dollars that you could send people out of
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:13.360]   a mated poop.
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:14.360]   It is money wells.
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:17.640]   Well, what the irony of the whole thing is that this is that those are the, those are
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:22.800]   the sensors that you frankly really want to put on the other side.
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:25.800]   So you could do really good augmented reality.
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:28.080]   All the augmented reality is facing you.
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:31.880]   So now it's said it comes through on iOS as a video.
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:32.880]   Yes.
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:33.880]   Okay.
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:34.880]   So it's compatible with everything.
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:36.480]   You could copy it and send it to anybody.
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:38.800]   So let me, I like, I like the animation.
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:42.520]   I think my sound must be going somewhere.
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:45.520]   I don't know about Leo from that camera angle.
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:47.000]   Looks like your cosplaying is Prince.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000]   I like that.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.520]   Game blouses.
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:52.520]   I, it's very expressive.
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:53.520]   I just can't hear it.
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:58.600]   I don't know where the audio is going, but very expressive and I even got your eyebrows.
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:01.480]   Yeah, it does 50 points of face tracking.
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:05.440]   So like your eyebrows, your eyes, your mouth, like your head, your head.
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:06.960]   It's like your forehead's jiggling.
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:07.960]   Yeah.
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:13.320]   I'm going to think of you as a nice chocolate soft serve if you don't mind.
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:15.000]   Tasty chocolate soft serve.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000]   I am.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000]   Brothers and brothers and sisters.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.400]   Oh, I mean, I see.
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:20.560]   I see why don't hear it.
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:21.560]   There's an audio.
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:22.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:23.560]   You're making a bigger.
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:24.560]   This isn't an emoji.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:25.560]   Okay.
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:27.560]   Let's put my microphone on you.
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:28.760]   Hello Leo.
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:31.120]   I am your friend, Mr. Puke.
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:32.880]   This isn't an emoji.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.220]   Okay.
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:35.680]   That's pretty cool.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:38.680]   Okay.
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:39.680]   Okay.
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:40.680]   It's so free.
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:41.680]   What do you want?
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:42.680]   Okay.
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:44.240]   I want it now.
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:45.720]   All right.
[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:50.000]   There are a lot of I'm glad you and I'm going to refer people to this article as well.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.000]   There are a lot of new gestures, but Renee and I more have put together a whole article
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:02.080]   with animated illustrations so you can know what they're what what to do to do what.
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:06.200]   And I think that that's going to actually be very, very handy.
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:11.600]   I'm sure Apple has some high high production value video to do this.
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:12.600]   Yeah.
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:14.280]   I think it's really I like to read.
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:16.440]   I don't like to sit through a video.
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:18.080]   So this is good.
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:23.200]   The big one that surprises me a little bit is switching apps.
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:25.040]   You slide along the bottom.
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.040]   Yeah.
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.600]   That's super fast.
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.600]   Yeah.
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:32.840]   That actually looks better than the force touch technique, which has been disabled anyway.
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:33.840]   Yeah.
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:34.840]   Okay.
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:35.840]   All right.
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:42.720]   We're going to talk a little bit about 11 one in a moment as we continue on Mac break weekly
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:48.200]   and we and just to live up to the name we better find some Mac news.
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:51.200]   I don't know what we'll say, but we'll find some actually I do know we'll say there's
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:54.720]   a new version of Mac OS.
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:14:00.040]   Our show today brought to you by fresh books, love fresh books, the life's I call them the
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:05.480]   life savers because when I was working as a freelancer, flying up to Canada, one week
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:10.280]   a month, I had to invoice them at the end of the month for the trip for the expenses
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:13.160]   for my time, the whole thing in Canadian dollars.
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:14.160]   It was such a pain.
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:15.560]   I would put it off and put it off.
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:19.000]   Amber is the one who told me about fresh books.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:23.560]   At the time it was, you know, I mean, this was 10 years ago, the hot, you know, web 2.0
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:24.560]   property.
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:28.680]   You know, 10 million people use fresh books and they do much more than invoicing and it
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:32.720]   begins with invoicing, but it really is a full cloud accounting system, which is kind
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:38.720]   of neat because it's the invoicing and you can put expenses in your invoices or just
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:42.800]   keep track of them by taking a picture with the fresh books app.
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:48.800]   So you have all your expenses, you have all your outbound invoices, you have your inbound
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:49.800]   payments.
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:54.520]   When you put that all together, you actually know you've got your accounting.
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:58.600]   You know what your outstanding balances are, your total profit, something a freelancer
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.680]   often doesn't know till tax time.
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:03.640]   It's all those reports are there on the fresh books dashboard.
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:05.360]   And by the way, it's little things.
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:09.560]   They're always improving the app because it's, you know, it's a web app.
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:14.120]   So little things like, you know, how sometimes when you're scrolling up columns, you lose
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:18.040]   the context because the headers grows up, not on fresh books, the sticky headers, you
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.360]   sc-- I love this.
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:22.480]   You scroll through the page while the headers shrink and remain at the top so you know
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:25.040]   what you're looking at.
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:29.240]   Of course, you're professional looking invoices that you're sending out, get you paid faster
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:31.680]   because there's always a pay me bill.
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:38.160]   You can have your clients pay you through all the best known web payment systems.
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:41.280]   That means you're going to get paid on average 11 days faster.
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:44.000]   Yes, it works with Apple Pay.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.960]   See what invoices have been sent, which invoices have been paid, but also which invoices have
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:48.960]   been viewed.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:51.640]   So no more sneaking around saying, "I didn't get your invoice."
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:53.600]   We know, we know.
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:58.360]   You can reward prompt clients and encourage customer loyalty by adding discounts to recurring
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:15:59.360]   templates.
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:00.760]   You could automatically send invoices.
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:03.840]   You could set up with your client to automatically pay even.
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:08.080]   Build for time and client and buy specific projects, assign services to projects, then
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:12.000]   designate different rates for each service.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.520]   You could press play on the website or on the app to track your time to the minute and
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:18.800]   all the time entries are sorted chronologically on the invoice.
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:23.560]   So it looks like you got somebody full time doing your invoices, but it's just you.
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:25.800]   It's easy.
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:29.240]   The full description of every line item is now visible and viewing an invoice on mobile.
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:30.640]   So that's nice too.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.160]   There's no mystery about what's going on.
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:39.320]   Employees can use the app to let them invoice as well if you give them permission.
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:43.880]   They have great help to the new help widget makes it really easy to access information.
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:46.600]   Just click on the blue question mark at the bottom right at the desktop.
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:51.000]   FreshBooks was named one of Forbes small giants for 2017.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.000]   I'm not surprised.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000]   I love them.

[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:14.160]   We thank them for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:17.320]   So should I, iOS, this is not the beta.
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:18.320]   This is not the developer.
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:22.800]   This is the final real push out and use iOS 11.1.
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:23.800]   Yes.
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:27.800]   Am I alone?
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:28.800]   Renee.
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:29.800]   I was muted.
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:30.800]   I apologize.
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:31.800]   Oh.
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:32.800]   Yeah.
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:37.720]   11.1 is live just in time for 11.2 going to beta Leo.
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:38.720]   That's how we live.
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:39.720]   That's fine.
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:40.720]   That's fine.
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:44.120]   You guys can go ahead with your little beta and be happy.
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:52.520]   What are we, so even Apple says in his thumbnail description of iOS 11.1, iOS 11.1 introduces
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:57.280]   over 70 new emoji and includes Bud fixes and improvements.
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:00.480]   So clearly that's the chief feature, right?
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:03.720]   I've heard in the industry that almost nothing drives upgrades like new emoji.
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:05.560]   Like people will say, "I don't really need something I need."
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:07.160]   "Oh my God, a unicorn."
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:08.160]   And then it's just like your--
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:09.160]   Oh, a mugger.
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:14.080]   Well, and Kevin, who does the technical direction on iOS today.
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:18.040]   Is so in love with the new emojis, he throws them in all the time.
[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:20.120]   So we see a lot of those.
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:21.120]   What are your favorites?
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:25.400]   Well, if you just have the boxes on your screen, Leo, you got to have the new emoji.
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:31.020]   I mean, I like-- I met this crossroads with emoji that I feel like it's become a pictographic
[01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:35.960]   language that can help overcome the lack of emotion that was plaguing our text-based
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:38.480]   society or text-based messaging society.
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:41.240]   But it feels like I'm not sure what their priorities are anymore because there's a lot
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:43.800]   of other emotions and other variations I like to see.
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:49.000]   But now we have fairies and zombies and other stuff that I thought maybe weren't as high
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000]   a priority.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.160]   I mean, they're a lot of fun.
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:54.800]   Don't get me wrong, but I wasn't dying for a hedgehog.
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:55.800]   Mind-blown is cool.
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:57.280]   Shh is nice.
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:00.280]   I do like that they have a lot more diversity.
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:04.680]   They have a curling stone for the Canadians.
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:05.680]   Yay.
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:06.680]   So--
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:08.520]   I like-- this is me, by the way, or is it Tim Cook?
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:09.520]   I can never tell.
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:10.520]   It's a beefy.
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:11.520]   Fairies.
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:13.520]   By the way, pansexual.
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:14.520]   Fairies.
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:15.520]   No gender.
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:16.520]   I think they have both, actually.
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:18.520]   I think they do have.
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:22.080]   Yeah, but what gender would this be?
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:23.280]   I don't know.
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:24.280]   I don't know.
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:25.280]   Right.
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:26.280]   That's the point.
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:29.880]   We know what gender the mermaid is because she has strategically placed seashells.
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:31.360]   There's a female vampire.
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:32.680]   A very emo vampire.
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:33.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:34.680]   Emo is right.
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:35.680]   I like the--
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:36.680]   You shall not pass.
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:40.360]   He's even got a crystal in his wand.
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:42.680]   So, a little chow mein with chopsticks.
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:45.280]   I don't recognize that, so I'm confused.
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:46.280]   Yeah.
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:47.280]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:48.960]   This is American Chinese food.
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:49.960]   This is takeout.
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:55.800]   What-- I mean, really, when you get takeout in China, does it look like that?
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:57.040]   That's pretty funny.
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.840]   Probably the rest of the world.
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:19:59.840]   It's probably only in China.
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:03.320]   But there's probably some places in Hong Kong where they use it as a world.
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:04.320]   Yeah.
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:05.320]   Broccoli is the same everywhere.
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:06.320]   Yeah.
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:09.640]   And that broccoli reaches out and says, "Eat me."
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:10.640]   Which reaches out to you.
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:11.640]   It's very--
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:12.640]   [GROANING]
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:13.640]   Not a broccoli fan.
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:14.640]   It's an epic hack.
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.640]   It's an epic hack.
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:16.640]   It's not an--
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:17.640]   It's not a vegetable.
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:22.240]   That's an epic hack.
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:24.160]   They, of course, are pushing out a crack-fist.
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:29.960]   And by the way, Mac OS will also get these new emojis because the new version of Mac OS
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:30.960]   comes out to.
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:37.880]   Is that the crack patch for both Mac OS and iOS is-- and the new emojis, those are the
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:38.880]   main things.
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:39.880]   Yes.
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:40.880]   Yeah.
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:43.920]   But you have to wait until iOS 11.2 for your calculator fix.
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:44.920]   But they are.
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:45.920]   It's interesting.
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:49.280]   11.2 B1 fixes the slow calculator app, so they paid attention.
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:50.280]   Yeah.
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.280]   Yeah.
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:54.520]   It's going to be with-- I'm looking forward to 11.1.
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:59.780]   It's going to be interesting to see if they've made any really subtle tweaks to all these
[01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:03.560]   new gestures and all these new interface elements that they sprung on people with iOS
[01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:04.560]   11.
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:10.080]   And it's not even as simple as, oh, look, it's not even something as-- oh, they decided
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:13.200]   to move this element here or they decided to delete this button.
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:18.520]   It could be something as simple as they decided to increase the spacing between buttons so
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:22.560]   minutely that you'd have to do a side-by-side to see it because now they've got so much
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:26.400]   feedback from real people about how this thing is being used.
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:29.400]   There are a lot of people at the inside Cupertino thing.
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:30.400]   OK.
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.800]   You went 10-- I'm paying up 10 bucks.
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:36.360]   I really thought people would not mistake that button for that or the button, but you're
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:37.360]   right.
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:38.360]   I'm wrong.
[01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:39.360]   The numbers don't lie.
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:45.440]   I'm also pleased that they brought back that weird 3D touch gesture that you push and
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:48.720]   you switch the app over.
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:50.880]   And I always-- I use that all the time.
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:54.520]   And it really perturbed me that they took it out of iOS 11.
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:56.760]   Why did they remove it and why did they bring it back?
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:58.760]   Do we know?
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:21:59.760]   It's weird.
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:03.320]   Sometimes they try for consistency and it's not going to be an iPhone 10, so you should
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:05.680]   have-- it won't be an iPhone 8.
[01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:10.360]   But then they move control center and iPhone 10, but they don't move it in iOS 8.
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:11.360]   So you never know.
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:12.360]   I think it's just a judgment call.
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:14.360]   And I think ultimately they decided to put it back.
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:17.080]   You see, you see that a lot when there's big revolutions.
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:18.080]   It'll take something away.
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:24.360]   And if there's a big enough stink, the people who just barely lost that argument in engineering
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:28.160]   bring that up again and say, yeah, we're going to have to put this back.
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:34.120]   Finally, the crack pitch patch will also go out to TVOS and watchOS.
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:44.960]   So the updates are 11.1 for iOS, 10.13.1 for MacOS, TVOS 11.1, watchOS 4.1.
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:53.800]   You'll also see some other changes in watchOS, according to Sam Axon writing on Ars Technica.
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:57.480]   The ability to toggle automatic Wi-Fi connections off and off.
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:59.800]   So it won't be just auto joining.
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:00.800]   Is that the idea?
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:01.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:02.800]   Also, you can just get off.
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:05.000]   Like you don't want to be on that Wi-Fi network.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.320]   And I need to get off of it.
[01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:11.480]   We have a real problem here in Petaluma because of XFINITY.
[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:14.160]   XFINITY Wi-Fi is everywhere.
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:18.000]   Because everybody who has XFINITY in a Wi-Fi router has automatically got a guest network
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.960]   that you can join as an XFINITY customer.
[01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:22.240]   And so you just can't get away from it.
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:23.600]   So I've been walking in New York.
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:25.600]   Like I just, it says, do you want to use AT&T Wi-Fi?
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.920]   And I press no and it goes, proceed without a network connection?
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:28.920]   I don't know what that means.
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:29.920]   Right.
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:30.920]   Does that means you won't get any connections?
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:31.920]   Does that mean I'm back on LTE?
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:32.920]   Stop doing this to me.
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:33.920]   Stop it.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:34.920]   Yeah.
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:36.760]   That's hands down on the most annoying persistent feature.
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:40.640]   Because not only that, but also the operating system says, oh great, here's a Wi-Fi.
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:45.560]   I'll switch over from the expensive LTE into this wonderful free Wi-Fi.
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:49.160]   Only you're stuck at a login screen that you've never really seen before.
[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:52.640]   And now you're wondering why you haven't been getting any email alerts or anything like
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:53.640]   that.
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:57.160]   So you can switch off Wi-Fi just to get back basic functionality.
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:03.680]   So our chat moderator, ScooterX, has announced that he will from here on in be named Scooter
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:04.680]   10.
[01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:06.400]   Just want you to make sure you say it right.
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:08.280]   No, I feel like that's on Apple.
[01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:10.160]   I mean, I did that wrong in my review video too.
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:12.160]   You call it the iPhone X?
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:13.000]   I called it 10.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.560]   I redid sections where I had called it and one of them still got through.
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:21.800]   And I feel like after we lived through OS 10 and people calling it OS X, Apple knew better.
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:23.200]   It feels like this one's on Apple.
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:28.160]   I said this before, when the rumor came out, they were going to name it iPhone 10.
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:30.000]   I said, there's no way.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.760]   Because inevitably people are going to call it an iPhone X or the X.
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:40.200]   Yeah, I'm still spilling Mac OS with an initial uppercase M partly as a protest vote.
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:45.760]   And secondly, that's because this is why British people say aluminium instead of aluminum because
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:48.000]   they say because that's what it's called.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.760]   Yes, that's what it's named.
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:57.960]   So good. So we'll be able to turn off the preference to automatically join Wi-Fi.
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:03.960]   And they have fixed, but they fixed before the issue with joining captive Wi-Fi by accident.
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:04.960]   Yeah.
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:05.960]   Okay.
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:09.240]   But not being notified about it is a nice feature.
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:10.680]   I think that's great.
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:16.680]   I'm still waiting for a 3D touch coming to that panel where I can just deep press on
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:22.720]   the Wi-Fi icon and then select, while there are three different Bluetooth audio sources
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:23.720]   in this room.
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:26.040]   I don't want you to automatically reconnect to the AirPods.
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:27.040]   I was using it when I walked.
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:31.000]   I now want you to connect to the nice $400 speakers I have in the office without having
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.240]   to tap and then go back into the settings and do stuff like that.
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:37.360]   I really think that's a natural fit for 3D touch.
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:38.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:39.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:43.360]   Unfortunately, we're not actually sure if, well, I think we think.
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:51.480]   So one of the iPhone engineers, a guy working on the radios, maybe an innocent mistake.
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:52.480]   I'm not sure.
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:54.800]   Maybe he wanted to get fired.
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:26:04.040]   His adult daughter, so this was after Apple said to employees who had iPhone 10s, "Okay,
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:09.720]   the pre-orders on so you can come out of the closet."
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:14.600]   But he allowed his daughter to make a video in the Apple cafeteria.
[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:22.880]   He's actually in the video and put it up ahead of all the embargoes for all the other journalists
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:26.680]   on YouTube.
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:30.240]   The same woman has now said my dad was fired because of this.
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:32.640]   Not really a surprise.
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:36.800]   It's a horrible, horrible situation that I happen.
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:40.320]   I think I know pretty much what happened at this point.
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:44.000]   And it is an absolutely horrible situation and I don't want to cause any more misery
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000]   for anybody.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:51.520]   But if there is an accident, if you, the guy who left the iPhone in the bar famously was
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:56.080]   not fired, there have been people who have lost all sorts of products or had or accidentally
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:57.080]   someone has tried to.
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:58.080]   It wasn't malicious.
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:26:59.080]   It was an accident.
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:00.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:02.080]   Apple will go out of their way to help you with that.
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:04.240]   They are very good about that.
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:05.280]   This was not that.
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:07.160]   This was so many rules.
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:11.760]   If you watch that video carefully, so many rules broken that anyone who works it out,
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:15.760]   I mean, when it does go into open carry, you get a whole piece of paper that tells you
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:19.480]   what you are and are not allowed doing with it.
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:24.480]   And if you work at Apple, you, I don't want to say it, but you can figure out how that
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:26.320]   video actually got taken.
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:31.880]   And by no means is that something that anyone at Apple would believe is okay to do.
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:33.880]   So yeah, this was not that.
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:38.120]   I'm very sad for him, but I think there was no way he didn't, he didn't had to know this
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:39.120]   was coming.
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:40.120]   Yeah.
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:43.400]   Among other rules, you're not allowed to film in the cafeteria.
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:48.000]   It says that on the I'm act when you sign in, which is the one frame of video missing
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.280]   that that that went live there.
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:28:03.480]   So Brooke Amelia Peterson says her father Ken Bauer was fired after she posted that video.
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:08.360]   Apple has not confirmed that, but I mean, why would I doubt she would lie?
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.720]   And some people think she's a child, like she's a child, she's not.
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:11.720]   She's an adult.
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:12.720]   Corona up.
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:13.720]   She's married.
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:15.480]   She lives in Southern California.
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:16.480]   Yeah.
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:17.480]   Yeah.
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:21.960]   I would feel bad if I were her.
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:26.440]   But this is what that rush to get these stories out can do for you.
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:30.960]   Oh, it's, I mean, it's exciting to have information that no one else has.
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:35.000]   It's exciting, even if you're not monetizing your videos to have a video that's got a couple
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.600]   million views on it.
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:45.000]   And sometimes it, it clouds the minds of otherwise same people.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000]   It's too bad.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.200]   I'm with Renee.
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:54.200]   I'm so it's, it's a sad story known as like, well, thank God that that horrible man got
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:55.200]   brought to justice.
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:59.920]   It's like, no, but yeah, it's, it's, it's.
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:03.720]   She's, I can't say, I can't say whether that was correct or not, but I can't say that
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:10.480]   this was an in a sense that this was a, a, anybody could have flipped to the end of this
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:14.000]   book and saw how the story is on this one.
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:19.200]   She has pulled down, of course, the video, the offending video and put up another video
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:20.960]   explaining what happened.
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:22.640]   That video has 4.8 million views.
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:27.320]   I imagine the other video was equally popular.
[01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:28.320]   So.
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:29.320]   Oh, well.
[01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:31.320]   Hope he's monetizing that one because.
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:32.320]   Yeah.
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:33.320]   Came at a high price.
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:35.320]   Hope the monetization was turned on kids.
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:40.960]   Uh, she, she might not be getting like the full batch.
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:46.240]   So the full box of like handmade fudge from the, from the seaside store for Christmas this
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:48.320]   year, they, she might just be getting a card this year.
[01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:49.320]   It's the card.
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:53.480]   I don't want to be, I would hate to be a fly on the wall during that family conversation.
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:54.480]   Geez Louise.
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:56.480]   Uh, stock market.
[01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:59.280]   Why, why are we having the candidate?
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:01.160]   I said that big spiral cut honey.
[01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:02.880]   We usually have this year.
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:03.880]   Oh man.
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:09.120]   Gloria, you want to explain why we're having the candidate this year?
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:13.520]   Here's some bad news about the forthcoming apple home pod.
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:16.200]   It won't work with Siri and Spotify.
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:21.160]   So Siri, you can Siri, you know, command the home pod and have it do Apple music, of
[01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:26.720]   course, as one would expect, but don't expect to ask for anything on Spotify.
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:33.320]   Uh, Apple says developers can only, uh, make third party apps that do messaging lists and
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:34.320]   notes.
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:39.720]   It's a weird, I mean, there's a weird lack of media functionality in general lately.
[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:44.320]   There is no Siri kit for music for podcasts, nothing like that, but you go back to three
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:46.960]   years, there's still not continuity for media.
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:50.920]   And it seems like one of the most basic common sense features Apple would have rolled out
[01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:54.720]   after announcing continuity is I am listening to this on this device.
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:56.560]   I am getting up and walking away.
[01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:00.360]   It will seamlessly transfer and play on that device and they just, it's been years and
[01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:06.040]   they haven't shipped it and it's, it's confusing to me and Siri kit for podcasts and music
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:11.080]   and audio books feels like a no brainer too, but it, it has not shipped yet.
[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:14.840]   11.2 introduces Siri kit for home pod.
[01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:16.080]   This is Apple.
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:20.280]   The powerful speaker that sounds amazing adapts to whatever it's playing and provides
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:23.920]   instant access to Apple music.
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:29.280]   I guess it's not surprising that Apple would favor its own music, but on the other hand,
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:30.280]   it's going to limit sales of this.
[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:32.000]   Well, they're going to dog food at first.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.160]   I mean, Apple's, Apple's famous first bending a couple of months figuring out an API on
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:39.800]   their own before rolling it out to everybody, but it seems like Siri kit could have rolled
[01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:44.160]   this out before the home pod and then they would have had time to dog food it beforehand.
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:49.560]   Also, this is the exactly sort of product where like the Apple watch, they get the hardware
[01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:53.760]   right for the first release and they can keep adding features via software as they go.
[01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:59.400]   And it seems if this, if this is all true, then it really does seem like Apple's content
[01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:05.600]   or resigned to promoting the home pod as look what an awesome speaker this is.
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:07.080]   Oh, what a great speaker.
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:11.760]   You won't believe the quality of the music from this speaker that we're selling you.
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:16.360]   Whereas Sonos is selling you here is a smart speaker that we have.
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:18.760]   And here is Google's have their new speakers.
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:23.320]   And look at the, our new assistant powered speaker, but Apple seems to be content that
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:27.360]   they can sell enough of them this year just by saying, we've got the technology that will
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:32.440]   make this 3D computational sound if that's the turn that's being thrown around right
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:33.440]   now.
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:36.360]   And if for $350, it's not that expensive.
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:40.120]   And if it really is, if it really does deliver that kind of sound experience, that will be
[01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:44.520]   okay and people will just be thrilled in January or February when it actually does a lot more
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:46.680]   than it does out of the box.
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:51.120]   Well, tidbit in Matthew Panzerino's tech crunch review of the iPhone 10, he says when he went
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:57.760]   to Cupertino last week to pick up the iPhone 10, he got to interview Phil Schiller, senior
[01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:02.520]   vice president of hardware engineering, Dan Ricchio, creative Federighi and VP of user
[01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:06.200]   interface design Alan Dye.
[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:09.920]   And Dan Ricchio said something interesting.
[01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:13.080]   I heard some rumor that we couldn't get touch ID to work through the glass.
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:15.640]   So we had to remove that.
[01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:20.760]   When we hit early line of sight on getting face ID to be as good as it was, we knew if
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:25.680]   we could be successful, we could enable the product that we wanted to go off and do.
[01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:29.960]   And if that's true, it could be something that we could burn bridges and be all in with.
[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:31.320]   That's assuming it was a better solution.
[01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:32.320]   And that's what we did.
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:37.560]   So we spent no time looking at fingerprints on the back or through the glass or on the
[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:41.800]   side because if we did those things, which would be a last minute change, it would be
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:45.880]   distraction relative to enabling the more important thing we were trying to achieve,
[01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:47.840]   which was face ID done in a high quality way.
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:51.680]   In other words, as soon as we knew face ID could do what we wanted it to do, we stopped
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:54.800]   even thinking about fingerprint.
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:59.400]   When Cortez reached the new world, he hunnish men shut fire to his ships.
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:00.400]   Exactly.
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:03.240]   But he won't move to it.
[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:06.600]   Well, I guess they said fire to touch ID.
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:08.240]   We weren't together quite a while.
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:09.240]   That's good.
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:10.240]   I like it.
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:17.480]   that swim back home. It works. It works. It works. I can slide over and again, the famous
[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:24.020]   story is when I fixed that iPod touch and they found the unused camera slot. If somebody
[01:34:24.020 --> 01:34:31.840]   takes it off and they found a giant sensor, you can do a lot of things with bits up until
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:36.580]   you ship them. You cannot do a lot to change atoms. You oughta set that up pretty early.
[01:34:36.580 --> 01:34:43.220]   So remind me, on Saturday, let's get I fixed it on the new screensavers. They'll have done
[01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:48.420]   their tear down by then and we'll find out. He's the rest secret sensor. I like Matthews
[01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:52.980]   that take on this. He was one of the handful who got it a week at a time. So he decided
[01:34:52.980 --> 01:35:00.580]   to bring it to Disneyland for his review. His daughter disclosed. She's fired. She's
[01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:04.380]   fired. She's so cute. She is adorable. And this is a good idea. He said, you know, let's
[01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:13.460]   do a real world test of the iPhone. What if he drops it on a ride and he has a tell security,
[01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:18.300]   I can't allow you to go into the water and get it. I have to get it because you're not
[01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:24.820]   under. That's brave, isn't it? I didn't even think of that. Yeah. That's brave. I have
[01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:30.260]   to admit, Renee, that I was looking at what pictures from the wedding to see if there
[01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:36.060]   was exit information about, Oh, Renee couldn't resist doing taking video of the wedding with
[01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:44.500]   a new phone. Instagram, but Roy is it for everybody? Let's see. There is an alternate
[01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:49.300]   reality where serenity and her husband actually exchanged vows in an emoji. But unfortunately
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:53.500]   that was not the way they plan his wedding a long time ago because that really was poor
[01:35:53.500 --> 01:36:00.780]   timing. Okay. I mean, it was it was it was a hoot and a half from the from the fees that
[01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:06.660]   I've been watching over the weekend, Facebook and Instagram. Very cute. It looked like they
[01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:10.900]   didn't have a they didn't have a first dance. They had a first skate. Yeah, you'll be glad
[01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:16.100]   to know that Apple cares about migratory birds. I didn't even know this was happening.
[01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:21.860]   But apparently the the Chicago Apple store birds birds were flying into the windows seeing
[01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:28.900]   the lights from the store on Michigan Avenue and dying. So they've decided to dim the
[01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:33.980]   lights every night until the fall migration season ends. Actually, this is something all
[01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:39.380]   of Chicago's doing. They're calling it the lights out initiative for high rise buildings.
[01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:42.460]   Do we know those those birds don't just want iPhone 10? They think they're going to get
[01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:49.320]   to the whole one. There is apparently a Chicago bird collision monitors and all volunteer
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:55.240]   conservation project dedicated to the protection of migratory birds. And they work with buildings
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:37:02.680]   to prevent bird collisions. Who knew? Who knew? It's a big problem. I don't know if this
[01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:10.240]   is one of those birds colliding into Tim Cook. Or what? I'm not sure why that picture is
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:19.300]   there, Apple insider. Maybe you can explain it to us. Apple has kind of maybe released
[01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:25.340]   some information about the new Mac, I'm a pro. They showed it at the Final Cut Pro creators
[01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:33.620]   summit over the weekend, giving people who use Final Cut Pro a closer look. It's a it's
[01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:40.700]   pretty. It's black. Looks like a black like dark gray, right? Slate gray. You get it with
[01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:45.760]   the piece of crap keyboard and the piece of crap mouse as well. Yeah, look at that. There
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:53.380]   you go. That's pretty. So you'll know it is it has four Thunderbolt three ports. Space
[01:37:53.380 --> 01:38:03.020]   gray, new thermal design, all flash. No, no more of those fusion drives off. Yeah. And
[01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:08.420]   yes, you get a magic mouse to a magic trackport to and a wireless magic keyboard. A box.
[01:38:08.420 --> 01:38:13.740]   All that stuff. You can just put that aside. Give it to you. Not even good paperweights.
[01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:18.380]   Give it to your daughter. It's not using like as a packing shim to make sure it's even
[01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:23.500]   on styrofoam. Is the mouse like apples like that one that on the Afghan is the one because
[01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:27.180]   they've just never made a good mouse. Is it like the one thing they're destined to never
[01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:35.020]   do to make everything else? Okay. It's almost it's it's you know, watching the evolution
[01:38:35.020 --> 01:38:41.820]   of Apple mouse is it's like watching one of those like skateboarding fail videos where
[01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:45.900]   first you're guy who and then in the middle, it's like entertaining and then it becomes
[01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:51.740]   sad again. No, stop doing. No, it's just just stop. Just you know, random chance they get
[01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:56.140]   one of them right. Don't don't lead with your groin the next time. Just go over the
[01:38:56.140 --> 01:39:01.820]   flat part and then then they come out with another new mouse that it's like. It's almost
[01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:07.220]   as if you have no hands. It's almost if you move the mouse with your mind inside inside
[01:39:07.220 --> 01:39:11.660]   the spaceship campus that that's the reason why because we have the we're stuck with these
[01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:18.140]   things. They're using face ID to mouse around or drop whack on tablets and design. Maybe it's
[01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:21.020]   like maybe it's like soccer. They're not allowed to use their hands. So they have to like use
[01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:26.140]   their noses or something. I don't you I just use a track. I just I can't go can't do it.
[01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:32.700]   Well, I just got you know, I I actually do have like boxes of like cheap mouses. I have one I have
[01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:37.580]   one really good lodge. I'm I'm still a mouse person. So I have one good logic tech mouse, but
[01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:42.140]   every time it's on sale for on Amazon for like eight bucks, I'll buy a couple more
[01:39:42.140 --> 01:39:48.220]   like Microsoft mouses because you plug them in. They always work. And just the simple bar of soap
[01:39:48.220 --> 01:39:54.380]   cheap design is just kicks the butt of every every apple mouse since the
[01:39:54.380 --> 01:39:58.700]   since the one the ship of the Mac I see or the Mac to whatever it was.
[01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:06.860]   Interesting. I don't know. Criminology on on Angela Arendt's. Of course, we've heard rumors
[01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:11.260]   that maybe she was next in line to replace Tim Cook. Here's a big profile. I mean, she's been kind of
[01:40:11.260 --> 01:40:18.060]   you know, hidden for most of her time at Apple. But here's a big profile on Buzzfeed news.
[01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:23.180]   Angela Ascendant. Meet the woman who wants to change the way you buy your iPhone. The mall is
[01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:28.460]   dying. But Apple's retail chief Angela Arendt's is reimagining the company stores. Anyway,
[01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:34.460]   incidentally, article by the same woman, Nicole Nguyen, Nicole Nguyen, who got the iPhone 10
[01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:39.260]   a week ahead of time. No coincidence. Or is it perhaps just a coincidence?
[01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:42.060]   He boy on their Apple beat. Yeah. Well, and
[01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:47.740]   wouldn't be the first time a publication would trade a cover story for access.
[01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:55.020]   Not saying they did. Well, if I'm going to see one of those cork boards with newspaper
[01:40:55.020 --> 01:40:58.380]   clippings and photographs with red. Come on, Andy. This is obvious.
[01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:04.140]   Okay. Come on, Andy. You're not going to continue to deny that there's any
[01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:08.140]   it's really like really likes Buzzfeed with and John Pochowski, I think in particular,
[01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:13.500]   since he went there from recode. A lot of I will also say that a lot of this is relationships.
[01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:17.100]   I'm not saying schmoozing. I'm saying that some people just have a very, very good positive
[01:41:17.100 --> 01:41:20.540]   relationship with Apple. Yeah. Again, it's not a relationship.
[01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:24.140]   Independence cover. I feel that that's a conflict of interest.
[01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:27.580]   Independent from whatever they write positively or negatively. I'm just saying
[01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:33.020]   that they are they have the essentially that Apple knows what they know is the what is what
[01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:37.340]   is the worst disaster that can happen if we let Renee have an iPhone early.
[01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:41.980]   And they know that actually it's pretty much up here. That's that's the worst that can possibly
[01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:45.500]   happen. Hey, Neala, it gets his life phones before me and like his reviews are fantastic,
[01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:49.100]   but Apple knows what they're going to get. Yeah. And Neala is very critical. You're right.
[01:41:49.100 --> 01:41:53.500]   Yeah. Yeah. I don't think it's based on who's going to be kind necessarily,
[01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:58.780]   but it is it. Look, there's Steve Jobs cultivated while Mossberg for years,
[01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:05.580]   even Walt knows that and amidst it. First of all, let's I will tell a story about Walt that now
[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:10.060]   that he's retired, well, it's not it will maybe embarrass him in a positive way.
[01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:14.780]   I was once at an Apple event where an Apple, he was just chatting amicably with an Apple person
[01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:20.860]   as we all do. And that Apple person saw that Walt had his iPad mini with this absolutely
[01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:25.180]   look like someone had given birth on top of this red leather cover. It just looked horrible.
[01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:30.140]   And he immediately he immediately took the red cover off of his own iPad and offered like to
[01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:34.620]   swap it with him and like kind of pressing it into Walt's or Walt that nope, nope, nope, nope,
[01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:43.180]   nope. I cannot accept the free cover. Yeah. But it's I've often wondered like with Steve Jobs
[01:42:43.180 --> 01:42:49.100]   were calling me, you know, God forbid at 2 a.m. or like David David Pogue. It's like, I have to
[01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:53.740]   admit that especially like during the 90s, when I was younger, more starry, I'd like, oh my god,
[01:42:53.740 --> 01:42:59.420]   isn't it nice I'm being woken up and yelled at by Steve Jobs. If only my 12 year old 12 year old
[01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:05.260]   me could forget to know about this. At some point, I would say Steve, this is very inappropriate.
[01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:11.340]   I really if you email me, I know you know how you use email. And again, I am not saying Apple
[01:43:11.340 --> 01:43:15.340]   should know this there they're they're they're completely within their rights and probably right
[01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:20.140]   to do it. If I were a shareholder, I might feel that they're doing exactly what they should do.
[01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:24.860]   I'm just saying people should be aware of this and consider, you know, consider this when they
[01:43:24.860 --> 01:43:28.860]   also what Andy said with audiences like their audiences that they absolutely seem to want to
[01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:33.500]   reach like verge. I don't know because maybe they think Android switchers are paying attention or
[01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:36.700]   something, but their audiences that they seem to find much more attractive. Right.
[01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:44.060]   Angela Aron's remains in the trenches until 3 a.m. floating between the groups, making sure
[01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:49.340]   everyone is fired up. The war rooms server activity chart ticks abruptly from green to red
[01:43:49.340 --> 01:43:53.420]   under a flood of incoming phone owners. This is what's going on, by the way, when you if you
[01:43:53.420 --> 01:43:59.020]   wondered what's going on during the midnight operation when they're when they're ordering all this stuff.
[01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:03.980]   Angela is making sure everyone's fired up like a politician on election night. She smiles and
[01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:11.180]   shakes hands the whole time. Then a cheer erupts transactions per second. Here's the war room.
[01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:16.460]   That must be so fun and so stressful. This is for the iPhone eight orders. One of the things I love
[01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:20.060]   it. There's a quote from Angela Aron saying when they hired her, Johnny I've said,
[01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:23.500]   you could do anything you want to the store, but don't touch the tables. They're sacred.
[01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:28.940]   Apparently the store tables are the same as the tables in the design center at Apple.
[01:44:28.940 --> 01:44:33.980]   And he loves it. The products go from the design center tables to the store tables
[01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:42.140]   and that they're identical. In a different life, Aaron's could have been a pastor. Here she is
[01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:46.620]   preaching at the Chicago River Apple store.
[01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:56.060]   You wonder if there's some grooming going on for Ms. Aron's. There have been rumors which she has
[01:44:56.060 --> 01:45:01.740]   denied that she's in line to take over for Tim Cook. Tim isn't close to retirement age, but
[01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:07.500]   he's got I think seven years before he's 65. But nevertheless, I think he said it well, where he
[01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:10.620]   said he's prepping a bunch of people, which I think is what Steve Jobs did, where you like you
[01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:15.340]   see Jeff Williams is clearly being prepped. Angela Aron is clearly being prepped. And there's
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:19.260]   several other people who probably aren't as well known. But if you wonder if you wonder
[01:45:19.260 --> 01:45:22.940]   was the inside track, it's going to be the person Apple allows to have the most public
[01:45:22.940 --> 01:45:27.900]   presence because it's got a lot of amazing profile.
[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:33.660]   Right. So he disappeared. He had too much of a profile. That was the problem.
[01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:46.140]   Such a delicate tightrope. Yeah. Let's see. iPhone sales in China showing some a real bump. This
[01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:55.500]   was a problem area for Apple. Six consecutive quarters, quarters of decline. But then comes Q3
[01:45:55.500 --> 01:46:07.820]   2016 and boom. 40% growth in iPhone sales. So that's very good news for Apple because that's
[01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:12.540]   the big market. That's where the growth all Apple's growth is going to come from at this point is
[01:46:12.540 --> 01:46:19.420]   markets that are the iPhones new to the brick. Brazil, Russia, India, China.
[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:26.220]   Yep. So very good news for Apple. And this is pre iPhone 10. My guess is iPhone 10 is practically
[01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:32.380]   aimed at the Chinese market that that is this going to be very popular there as expensive as it is.
[01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:38.860]   By the way, this is the this is the interesting you mentioned Scott Forest Hall.
[01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:44.940]   This is the anniversary of the day Scott was forced out of Apple or yesterday, day before
[01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:52.380]   yesterday, October 29th. Oh, look, I can enter to win a new iPhone 8 too bad. I don't want that
[01:46:52.380 --> 01:47:00.140]   anymore. That's the old phone. 2012. Has it been that long five years ago? Wow. Yeah.
[01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:04.780]   We haven't seen green felt on a phone since then. Wow. Mr.
[01:47:04.780 --> 01:47:10.460]   So it's more felt. Did you see the wonderful interview that was the Computer History Museum
[01:47:11.020 --> 01:47:15.900]   did with him? Well, he's like, I've never heard the words, it's more fake. It was photo realistic.
[01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:19.100]   And you're like, just from behind the scenes, that was that was not his jet that had those
[01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:25.820]   stitch leather seats. Like we remember that Scott was an implementer. We should mention that Scott
[01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:29.260]   really hasn't I guess he had enough stock that he probably doesn't have to work. He
[01:47:29.260 --> 01:47:34.540]   he co produced a Broadway play. He's advising Snapchat. He's given a couple of
[01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:40.860]   press appearances, including several interviews to mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone.
[01:47:41.420 --> 01:47:46.140]   But he's as far as we know, he's enjoying life and spending time with his family.
[01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:53.260]   I mean, he had next talk, right? I think he I think he probably doesn't have to go back to work.
[01:47:53.260 --> 01:47:58.700]   He's spending more quality time with his money. Yeah. Ming Chi Quo, it's time to start the rumors
[01:47:58.700 --> 01:48:07.740]   for the next iPhone. Ready? Set. Ming Chi Quo says 2018 iPhones unlikely to have a rear facing
[01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:13.580]   true depth camera system, kind of following along what I was saying, which is they put the fancy
[01:48:13.580 --> 01:48:18.620]   stuff on the wrong side of the phone, at least in terms of augmented reality. He doesn't think
[01:48:18.620 --> 01:48:24.300]   they're going to turn it around. We do not this is by the way, analyst and an analyst note KGI
[01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:30.300]   securities. And this is so that investors can plan their investments based on assumptions.
[01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:38.860]   We do not expect the second half 2018 iPhones to come with rear true depth camera 3D sensing
[01:48:38.860 --> 01:48:46.700]   contrary to market expectations. Apple needs to quickly resolve two issues. If it wants to have
[01:48:46.700 --> 01:48:52.220]   a rear camera, the development of AI and AR kit software and ecosystem, which takes time.
[01:48:52.220 --> 01:48:57.180]   Well, yeah, okay, that's a chicken and egg. You know, people are going to develop it. If you
[01:48:57.180 --> 01:49:01.980]   build it, they will come. And two, and this is probably the real problem achieving stable
[01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:06.860]   shipments and on time shipping, challenging due to the higher spec requirements of a rear
[01:49:06.860 --> 01:49:12.140]   true depth camera. In other words, they've been rumored in Ming Chi Quo is the chief rumor to
[01:49:12.140 --> 01:49:19.340]   have trouble getting this iPhone out because of the Romeo and Juliet face modules. It's really
[01:49:19.340 --> 01:49:22.940]   hard to see a timetable from them wanting to put true depth on the other side of the camera,
[01:49:23.580 --> 01:49:29.500]   because face face ID is classic Apple. It's here is something specific. Here's a feature that we
[01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:35.100]   want to do and having a 3D sensor is how we will do it. And they're not a company that would say
[01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:39.420]   we will have a 3D we will have the ability to have 3D presence or 3D imaging for on the other
[01:49:39.420 --> 01:49:44.780]   side of the camera. We don't know what app needs the what what app will have to take advantage of
[01:49:44.780 --> 01:49:49.740]   that. We don't know who has been clamoring for this, but we we hope that people will find out
[01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:54.380]   something finds something awesome to do with that. No, no, they they they're not going to waste the
[01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:58.140]   engineering. They're not going to waste the space inside the phone for something like that
[01:49:58.140 --> 01:50:02.700]   until they know how they can sell that to people. And by the way, as somebody in the chat quite
[01:50:02.700 --> 01:50:08.780]   correctly points out, Ming Chi Quo deals with fiscal year 2018, not calendar year 2018,
[01:50:08.780 --> 01:50:14.700]   but I'm too I'm too dense to do the math. But so it could happen in our 2018.
[01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:19.100]   Like I mean, you say three months, I say three months.
[01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:27.020]   Apple when a when Reuters inquired how those iPhone 10 sales going said we could see from the
[01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:35.580]   initial response customer demand is off the charts. I think it was reported that within 20 minutes,
[01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:39.740]   if you didn't get in the first 20 minutes, and of course I wasn't able to get in
[01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:47.340]   for about that long, vice says you didn't get it on October or sorry, November 3rd.
[01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:52.940]   They call that sold out. That's not really sold out, but it just means you're not going to get it
[01:50:52.940 --> 01:51:00.380]   on the first day. And that happened very, very quickly. It feels about as fast as any big new
[01:51:00.380 --> 01:51:10.060]   release of an iPhone. Yes. A little bit faster, I think. It's it's I seem to I was checking about
[01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:17.180]   a half hour after three and there was just no way used to if you were if you were in
[01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:21.500]   disposed at three oh one AM, you may not be able to get the color and the capacity you want,
[01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:26.940]   but you could still get it somehow somewhere. So this I would say that certainly sold faster.
[01:51:26.940 --> 01:51:32.540]   It's still a bummer. If you if you forgot that this was the morning, it's still a bummer. If
[01:51:32.540 --> 01:51:38.220]   you got a good night's sleep that night, Google's YouTube TV is one of the best court cutting.
[01:51:38.220 --> 01:51:45.580]   I think one of the best court cutting offerings over the top local channels built in DVR is
[01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:54.860]   started to roll out now on the big screen. Finally, Xbox one, Android TV and according to YouTube
[01:51:54.860 --> 01:52:02.540]   some day soon on an Apple TV near you not yet, but soon soon soon.
[01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:08.300]   It's a wedding on Amazon. How soon is this tough coming in the coming weeks? Apple TV, Roku and
[01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:14.700]   Smart TVs from Samsung, Sony and LG yet Amazon. No, my money. Actually already have my money.
[01:52:14.700 --> 01:52:19.980]   They don't care. I like YouTube TV. I don't think you can get it in in Canada. Probably not yet.
[01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:26.700]   Yeah, but it is of of all of the over the top offerings like sling TV and Sony's PlayStation
[01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:34.860]   view. There's a ton of them. AT&T has one direct TV now.
[01:52:34.860 --> 01:52:40.220]   I do have Amazon Prime and I do AirPlay it to my Apple TV, but I got so frustrated. I just bought
[01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:44.540]   it on iTunes. I would have much rather just watched it when it came out. And now I'm looking to watch
[01:52:44.540 --> 01:52:51.180]   next on Amazon and they just haven't put it out yet. So, yeah. That's one kind of media.
[01:52:51.900 --> 01:52:57.500]   That's one kind of media that still frustrates me where I feel like I have to really choose
[01:52:57.500 --> 01:53:03.580]   one box for every important TV inside in my house because I've got an Apple TV in the
[01:53:03.580 --> 01:53:09.340]   bedroom. I've got an Android TV in the living room and it's just, oh god, that's right. I can't
[01:53:09.340 --> 01:53:16.540]   get Android. I can get Android TV. I can get Amazon TV on this one, but not the other one.
[01:53:16.540 --> 01:53:21.020]   I can get iTunes on this one, but not the other one. I've got iTunes credits that I can apply to
[01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:26.460]   the season. There are TV seats that I would have bought if I could have bought them on iTunes and
[01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:31.580]   played everywhere because I've got like between gifts and stuff like that. I got like $130, $140
[01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:35.340]   in there that's just sitting there doing nothing, but I don't really want to spend real money
[01:53:35.340 --> 01:53:40.860]   for Gold Rush if I can just spend $30 and get it's a mess.
[01:53:40.860 --> 01:53:45.180]   That's why I love that new everything everywhere, whatever service it is, because
[01:53:45.180 --> 01:53:49.580]   there are vertical and horizontal lock-ins and Amazon Prime for Apple TV is a perfect example
[01:53:49.580 --> 01:53:53.900]   of abusing a horizontal lock-in because I bought this movie and I can't watch it where I want to
[01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:58.300]   watch it. Even if it regressive whether you made the device or not, you're not putting your service
[01:53:58.300 --> 01:54:03.500]   where I want it. With that new, I think Disney is the only holdout. You buy something on one platform
[01:54:03.500 --> 01:54:07.740]   and then you can play it on another platform. I think that's getting closer to the solution I
[01:54:07.740 --> 01:54:14.300]   really want. Have you seen this Renee? Some models of the Apple Watch Series 3 have arose.
[01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:17.980]   I don't see it on my small stripes along the side of the watch's display.
[01:54:18.540 --> 01:54:23.820]   No, I saw that the update said it fixed that, but I've never seen nor heard about that happening.
[01:54:23.820 --> 01:54:28.540]   So the update does fix that. Which is nice because there are certain things you can't fix
[01:54:28.540 --> 01:54:32.620]   with software update that would be really bad. But if it's software fixable, then that's good.
[01:54:32.620 --> 01:54:37.180]   In other words, not a screen problem. It's something to do with the rendering of this.
[01:54:37.180 --> 01:54:40.140]   And at Eimor, I think we have like 13 of these watches between us.
[01:54:40.140 --> 01:54:46.140]   Doesn't appear to affect the cellular version of the device.
[01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:50.300]   Okay, maybe that's why. Because of the built-in antenna, apparently.
[01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:55.580]   So there you have it. All right, let's take a break. Your picks, as we wrap this up,
[01:54:55.580 --> 01:55:04.380]   it's the iPhone X is here. The iPhone X is here. iPhone 10 day. And yours comes Friday.
[01:55:04.380 --> 01:55:12.140]   Friday, yes. Lucky dog. Mine comes in a few weeks. But I have to say, I am and I already ordered
[01:55:12.140 --> 01:55:17.740]   a couple of different cases just because, you know, one must have as many cases as one has Apple
[01:55:17.740 --> 01:55:23.580]   watch bands. It's just the way of the world. Our show today brought to you by WordPress.
[01:55:23.580 --> 01:55:34.220]   28% of the world's websites run on WordPress, including mine. I use WordPress for years as a
[01:55:34.220 --> 01:55:40.940]   self-hosted solution and love it. And recently, I moved to WordPress.com. And I'll tell you why
[01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:48.860]   I made that switch. As much as I love running my own server, I didn't save any money. WordPress.com
[01:55:48.860 --> 01:55:54.220]   actually saves me money with the cost of a server. Plus, not to mention the time updating and
[01:55:54.220 --> 01:55:59.580]   patching and all that stuff. And I just have to say WordPress.com just does it right. It's already,
[01:55:59.580 --> 01:56:05.100]   it's all running. It's beautiful. And you know, this is good news. If you have a business and you
[01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:12.540]   don't have a website, don't be that guy depending on Facebook or Twitter to reach out to customers.
[01:56:12.540 --> 01:56:17.660]   Because you don't own those. And people have learned to their horror and dismay that
[01:56:17.660 --> 01:56:22.380]   they're not the best way to put your name out there. Sure, you should have a Facebook
[01:56:22.380 --> 01:56:26.700]   page for your business. You should have a Twitter account. But it should all point back
[01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:32.700]   to your fabulous website at WordPress.com. No, I know you say, I don't want to do it. It's too
[01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:37.180]   much work. I don't want to be a web guru. No, no, you don't need experience. You don't need to
[01:56:37.180 --> 01:56:42.460]   hire someone. WordPress.com guides you through the entire process from start to finish. And it
[01:56:42.460 --> 01:56:47.420]   looks great. They take care of all the technical details. So you get your site up and running a
[01:56:47.420 --> 01:56:52.620]   focus on what you want up there, the pictures, the images, your menus, perhaps your, you know,
[01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:58.380]   your prices, your services, your employees, they have a wonderful, beautiful designs you can
[01:56:58.380 --> 01:57:02.940]   choose from. It's easy enough to change anytime. You get built in search engine optimization and
[01:57:02.940 --> 01:57:07.340]   social sharing. It's no surprise so many sites run on WordPress. In fact, some of the biggest
[01:57:07.340 --> 01:57:13.020]   publications in the world run on WordPress.com. Their business plans let you access hundreds of
[01:57:13.020 --> 01:57:17.740]   plugins and themes. You can even install your own themes and plugins now. And what a great
[01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:21.740]   customer support team. I just love these guys eager to help you get the most from your site.
[01:57:21.740 --> 01:57:25.980]   24 hours a day Monday through Friday and there are their own weekends too. Plan started just
[01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:34.460]   $4 a month. You got to see what WordPress.com has to offer. It is modern. It is easy. It is fast.
[01:57:34.460 --> 01:57:39.260]   It's very affordable. And right now you can make it even more affordable when you go to
[01:57:39.260 --> 01:57:48.300]   WordPress.com/Macbreak. Say 15% of any new plan purchase. WordPress.com/Macbreak. If you don't
[01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:54.140]   have a website for your business, you're missing out. You got to get one. And don't be distracted by
[01:57:54.140 --> 01:57:57.260]   the fact that the guy telling you this is wearing a weird hat and a funny bow tie.
[01:57:57.260 --> 01:58:04.060]   I know I've lost all credibility today. But you got to do it. WordPress.com/Macbreak.
[01:58:04.060 --> 01:58:11.260]   Andy and Ico, you're pick of the week. My one pick this week is Appcamp for Girls latest fundraiser.
[01:58:11.260 --> 01:58:16.460]   They're trying to raise $75,000 to expand their program to three brand new cities.
[01:58:16.460 --> 01:58:21.980]   If you haven't heard about Appcamp for Girls, this is what the name says. It's an Appcamp for
[01:58:21.980 --> 01:58:27.420]   Girls typically in eighth to ninth grade. An entire week in which they learn pretty much
[01:58:27.420 --> 01:58:32.220]   everything you would need to know as an App developer. They're building a Hello World app
[01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:37.180]   on day one. And then they break into teams to develop whatever app they can think of and want.
[01:58:37.180 --> 01:58:43.260]   They do every single piece of it themselves, including the artwork. They also learn how to
[01:58:43.260 --> 01:58:48.060]   market. They learn how to get things on the App Store. They also learn to get away from the nuts.
[01:58:48.780 --> 01:58:53.980]   There's snacks and lunch there, but they learn to leave the computer and eat snacks elsewhere.
[01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:59.900]   They learn to do yoga and stuff so that they don't get back in arm problems.
[01:58:59.900 --> 01:59:04.620]   And it really is such a wonderful, powerful experience. Again, it lasts all week long.
[01:59:04.620 --> 01:59:13.260]   And it's I kind of wish that I could go to an Appcamp for Girls type place for middle-aged
[01:59:13.260 --> 01:59:19.100]   grumpy men. But being middle-aged grumpy men, we'd probably ruin. They would just be complaining
[01:59:19.100 --> 01:59:23.420]   to each other. But it's such a positive thing. They have such a wonderful mission. They've been
[01:59:23.420 --> 01:59:27.900]   in this. They've been doing this for years. And they just continue to go from strength to strength
[01:59:27.900 --> 01:59:34.780]   to strength. They have some really cool rewards. You can go anywhere from getting a wallpaper pack
[01:59:34.780 --> 01:59:43.100]   or a mix tape of music. Of course, the double clicks to posters to notebooks to t-shirts.
[01:59:43.820 --> 01:59:50.220]   Again, I really can't recommend these people enough. I know a lot of the people who are
[01:59:50.220 --> 01:59:57.180]   active volunteers and active students. Like Kelly, and these are all just the finest people
[01:59:57.180 --> 02:00:04.140]   you want to meet. And you just feel that the kids who get to be with these adults, these
[02:00:04.140 --> 02:00:10.940]   wonderful women are just so lucky to get that kind of experience. They're getting kids at
[02:00:10.940 --> 02:00:15.580]   exactly the right time, the time when they might have an interest, but they don't know what they
[02:00:15.580 --> 02:00:19.740]   want to do with that interest. Or they have an interest. And they're at that age where some other
[02:00:19.740 --> 02:00:25.020]   forces could slap that interest down and tell them you shouldn't be writing software or just
[02:00:25.020 --> 02:00:30.060]   giving them a bad experience. This is a sort of experience that will get them to say, "Mom, Dad,
[02:00:30.060 --> 02:00:37.500]   I don't want to go to college. My social platform is about to really catch on fire."
[02:00:38.780 --> 02:00:44.380]   We want to try to write $60,000 of funding for some more AWS services. And we really think we can
[02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:50.380]   go to Series A financing by the end of what would be my sophomore year. I love that.
[02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:56.860]   You're going to scare people off. App can for girls. This is a great, really is a great,
[02:00:56.860 --> 02:01:01.660]   great thing. Gene McDonald founded it. And I just love the idea. And they want to expand
[02:01:01.660 --> 02:01:04.060]   to three new cities. And that's what they're trying to raise money to do.
[02:01:04.060 --> 02:01:08.540]   They haven't chosen the cities yet. They're going to use the money to figure out where the
[02:01:08.540 --> 02:01:12.220]   need is, where the demand is. But they're already all over the country. And they just want to
[02:01:12.220 --> 02:01:16.380]   continue to do their good work elsewhere. This is such a good place for your money. And it's
[02:01:16.380 --> 02:01:19.900]   tax deductible. This is not just buying an album or funding a movie.
[02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:25.820]   Renee Richie, do you have a pick? I know you're a little tired. You've been up all night.
[02:01:25.820 --> 02:01:31.100]   So the only downside is I'm so tired. I might have actually picked this before and just don't
[02:01:31.100 --> 02:01:36.620]   remember. But in the off chance I didn't, there are several capacitive, not inductive charging pads
[02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:41.820]   available. Sadly, none of them are as good as the WebOS one, the Touchstone that I had in my
[02:01:41.820 --> 02:01:48.220]   Utes. But this one I like, I've been testing a lot of them. And some of them are bigger. Some
[02:01:48.220 --> 02:01:51.180]   of them are smaller. Some of them feel a little bit more magnetic. Some of them feel a little bit
[02:01:51.180 --> 02:01:56.620]   less magnetic. Some people have complained that you don't put it down correctly. It won't charge.
[02:01:56.620 --> 02:02:00.700]   If you nudge it off, it won't charge. If you get a lot of notifications, it will eventually buzz
[02:02:00.700 --> 02:02:05.900]   its way right off the charging pad. But the Belkin, sorry, the Belkin, the Mophie one is the one I've
[02:02:05.900 --> 02:02:09.900]   had the most luck. But I can't get in the shot here. There we go. And I realize I'm recommending
[02:02:09.900 --> 02:02:13.740]   two Mophie products in a row. And it's not intentional. That's okay. We often.
[02:02:13.740 --> 02:02:22.140]   Yeah. But you put this on, it does give you that nice magnetic thumb when you do set it up.
[02:02:22.140 --> 02:02:27.500]   And it stays on. And I don't get a lot of notifications. I have 99% of my notifications
[02:02:27.500 --> 02:02:33.340]   turned off because I just, you know, I'm human. But this has stayed put. I haven't been nudging
[02:02:33.340 --> 02:02:37.740]   it off. It's small enough that it doesn't take up a huge amount of space on the side table.
[02:02:37.740 --> 02:02:42.460]   I don't knock it with, you know, the blanket or the comfort or when I'm turning around at night.
[02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:48.140]   And it has not vibrated itself off. Now, if you do continuously get game center alerts,
[02:02:48.140 --> 02:02:53.660]   but it might eventually move itself off or, you know, if the phone is ringing or something,
[02:02:53.660 --> 02:02:57.580]   it might. But I've had very, very good luck with it. And I know some people have been complaining
[02:02:57.580 --> 02:03:02.860]   that they have not had that much luck with their charging pad. So it's, I think it's like 40,
[02:03:02.860 --> 02:03:05.660]   50 dollars. I don't know because I bought it in Canadian funds.
[02:03:05.660 --> 02:03:11.740]   This is a round one. So I see a square one from Mophie. So let me see if I can find the rest.
[02:03:11.740 --> 02:03:18.300]   That's not it, right? No, and this isn't, this is a charging pad too. It's not a,
[02:03:18.300 --> 02:03:22.940]   it's not a battery pack. So, you know, this is a charge force wireless charging.
[02:03:22.940 --> 02:03:27.180]   I have not tried that one. I only tried the little round one.
[02:03:27.180 --> 02:03:30.780]   Okay. So get the round. This is the one Apple sells in their store, right?
[02:03:31.420 --> 02:03:34.460]   Yeah. And it'll work with your, I mean, I've used it with iPhone
[02:03:34.460 --> 02:03:40.140]   eight plus I've used it with iPhone eight. You cannot charge iPhones through each other,
[02:03:40.140 --> 02:03:45.580]   by the way, it is not charging all three of these right now. But, but I've used it with all of these
[02:03:45.580 --> 02:03:51.580]   and it has, it has been fine with all of them. iPhone 10 is nice because it like the, like the
[02:03:51.580 --> 02:03:55.740]   Mophie, Belkin makes the other really well known one, but like the Mophie, it is small.
[02:03:55.740 --> 02:03:59.500]   So you put them both together. It has a very small profile. We,
[02:04:00.940 --> 02:04:07.180]   got it. No spatial skills. Get it from Apple. Although, as I've said before,
[02:04:07.180 --> 02:04:11.980]   I really like the easel ones. I find those are the ones that are easiest to hit and don't,
[02:04:11.980 --> 02:04:16.540]   they don't vibrate out of it. That's what I use every night. And I have for years,
[02:04:16.540 --> 02:04:21.820]   the tilt view, the U and. The touchstone was nice. It was like a 45 degree slow.
[02:04:21.820 --> 02:04:24.860]   It's touchstone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I miss that.
[02:04:24.860 --> 02:04:29.900]   People complain for years about cheat chargers and phones rolling off of them.
[02:04:29.900 --> 02:04:33.500]   My old boss, Peter Bonacic, he stuck them in his car and like he just put his phone on the car
[02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:37.100]   as soon as he came in. Did you use to work at Mobile Nations or used to work for D?
[02:04:37.100 --> 02:04:41.500]   He used to work at you. He was the original editor and chief at Mobile Nations. He hired me.
[02:04:41.500 --> 02:04:46.620]   He is responsible for me, annoying everybody in the world today. Well, he has very good taste.
[02:04:46.620 --> 02:04:53.980]   And that wraps up Mac Break Weekly. I'd like to suck up to Mr. Renee Richie at iMoor.com
[02:04:53.980 --> 02:04:57.980]   because he's got an iPhone 10. Maybe he'll let me touch it someday.
[02:04:57.980 --> 02:05:05.660]   iMoor.com has the full 10,000 word first look review from Renee Richie plus a very useful page on
[02:05:05.660 --> 02:05:13.420]   controls and, you know, how to use it. So when you get your iPhone 10, you got a high theta iMoor.com
[02:05:13.420 --> 02:05:19.180]   even before you get it. If you're interested in anything Apple or others, they've got great
[02:05:19.180 --> 02:05:25.740]   coverage of all kinds of technology. It's iMoor.com and don't forget the iMoor podcast,
[02:05:25.740 --> 02:05:30.540]   which you'll find in the menu there on the side because I think, no, you won't.
[02:05:30.540 --> 02:05:34.140]   No, they keep moving those things around. I'm not an nation. Yeah.
[02:05:34.140 --> 02:05:37.900]   Where is it now? I think it's iMoor.com/podcasts.
[02:05:37.900 --> 02:05:42.780]   You have to know the URL. And I was dressed up in last week's iMoor show.
[02:05:42.780 --> 02:05:47.100]   That's good. Yeah. That's good. It's an audio show, so you could say that.
[02:05:47.100 --> 02:05:52.220]   Yeah. No one will know. No, we did it on video. Oh, you did not video?
[02:05:52.220 --> 02:05:57.500]   I was just as my Pokemon go character. Nice. With the magic car patent, everything.
[02:05:57.500 --> 02:06:00.220]   Oh, when did you start doing these in video or have you always done it?
[02:06:00.220 --> 02:06:03.580]   We did it. We did it just for that once in a while. We do it if we really have to show
[02:06:03.580 --> 02:06:07.820]   something off because you want to show something. Yeah. And my cuz target was Gandalf because you
[02:06:07.820 --> 02:06:12.620]   cannot pass. Yeah. And Laurie Gilligan was Gilligan and at one point, this different walked by.
[02:06:12.620 --> 02:06:19.420]   And we still don't know how she arranged that. Very nice. iMoor show 577,
[02:06:19.420 --> 02:06:25.820]   Treehouse of pre-orders 10. I like it. Andy Enocho writes for the Chicago Sun
[02:06:25.820 --> 02:06:30.780]   Times. Look for his thoughtful think piece all about the iPhone 10 sometime in the future.
[02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:35.900]   And my phone a review will be up shortly. I decided that I wanted to get my hands on the
[02:06:35.900 --> 02:06:41.660]   iPhone 10 before I made final conclusions about the iPhone 8. So that'll be probably next week.
[02:06:41.660 --> 02:06:49.260]   I think I admire your long form as Stephen Levy calls it slow journalism.
[02:06:49.260 --> 02:06:53.900]   It's good. You gotta make a choice between what do you enjoy doing? What do you think you can do
[02:06:53.900 --> 02:06:58.140]   best? I can't do quick news and quick takes very well. Other people can do that very well and
[02:06:58.140 --> 02:07:04.140]   very valuable. I can't. And I don't want to do it. So CWOB.com is the great website. You can also
[02:07:04.140 --> 02:07:11.580]   find Andy's fabulous, fabulous podcasts. There he does several. The material podcast is about
[02:07:11.580 --> 02:07:19.580]   Android. Amazingly enough. Amazingly enough. That's on relay.fm. I so desperately need to
[02:07:19.580 --> 02:07:26.300]   update that. Yeah. 5x5 Studios has the Enocho Almanac. That's on relay to that moved. Oh, that moved.
[02:07:26.300 --> 02:07:30.140]   So that's what you're talking about. Then when you say I desperately need to update that.
[02:07:30.140 --> 02:07:34.620]   Exactly. I'm an ace itself promotion. I update the website about every four years.
[02:07:34.620 --> 02:07:38.940]   Yeah. I know how you feel. I was just looking at doing the ad for WordPress, looking at my website
[02:07:38.940 --> 02:07:44.060]   saying, gosh, I haven't posted since August. Yikes. I gotta get to work. Why am I getting so
[02:07:44.060 --> 02:07:48.300]   many speaking requests? Oh, that's right. Because when you updated the site three years ago, you added
[02:07:48.300 --> 02:07:51.740]   by the way I do speaking. If you want to contact me, here's the email address. Oh,
[02:07:52.940 --> 02:08:00.220]   that appears earlier. Flickr.com/NDI as well. That's his great Flickr feed, always fun there.
[02:08:00.220 --> 02:08:06.300]   And then follow him on Instagram to IHNATKO and Twitter. Thank you everybody. We do Macbreak
