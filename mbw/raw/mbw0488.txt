[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.480]   So we welcome the full panel for our first show of 2016, starting with Alex Lindsay's
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.480]   in town.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.480]   Hello, hello.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.480]   More and more.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.200]   We're glad to have you from the Pixel Core.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.200]   Hello, Alex.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.640]   I'm wet, but here.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.160]   Yeah, it's pouring rain.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.160]   Thank goodness.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.160]   We're finally getting some rain.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.160]   I'm wet, but I'm here.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.400]   Yeah, you shouldn't have the show tell really at the beginning of the show, because then
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.000]   it's too easy to guess.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.280]   That's Andy Inaco chiming in from Boston, where the weather is finally reverted to normal,
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.280]   I think.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.640]   Yes, I've got my main hunting guide cosplay on for the first time in season.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.640]   I saw that picture.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.160]   Well, you know, if you're going to go all the way out there, you're going to want the
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.080]   cabin for a month, you don't know if you're going to get snowed in.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.760]   We got plenty of mocks up there, plenty of drink.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.760]   Yeah, good.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.920]   Can't get that from here.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.080]   And ladies and gentlemen, from Montreal, I don't even know what the weather is, but
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.080]   we'll find out.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.080]   I'm sure Renee Richie of iMore.com.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.080]   Hello, Renee.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.400]   It was zero Fahrenheit yesterday minus 15 Celsius, but luckily some kind souls at Twitch sent
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.400]   me this Jean T. Shep.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.400]   You finally got that.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.400]   It finally came through customs.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.400]   It did.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.400]   What is this actually?
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.400]   All of the Americans.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   No, it's a bad.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.400]   I mean, we watch talk to you here.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.400]   We know what these are.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.400]   Yeah, you know, it's not exactly a phase.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.400]   That's a chef.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.400]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.400]   Slightly different.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.400]   Jean T. Shep.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.680]   Did you all have a lovely new year?
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.760]   And I guess I haven't seen you since Christmas.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.520]   So before Christmas, I think you all celebrate Christmas, right?
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.520]   Yes.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.720]   The children have a lovely...
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.600]   What do you give the most sophisticated young people in the world?
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.280]   Did each of them get a lady camera and...
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.760]   My daughter somehow had a...
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.880]   She's got a thing called American Girl and...
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.880]   I love America.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.920]   She got a wheelchair for American Girl, which I thought was...
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.640]   Yeah, they're all about different cities.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.640]   Yeah, so I didn't...
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.440]   She was very excited about getting a wheelchair.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.360]   And I was like, I did not be with that.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.360]   She's so into American Girl, what you do with that?
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.360]   She's got a wheelchair for her.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.360]   And she got a lot of...
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.360]   What's your doll?
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.360]   Do you know which one she has?
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.360]   It's an African-American doll, but I don't know which one.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.360]   Yes, each one has a history and you get the book.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.360]   Yes, so I didn't...
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.360]   But that was the most surprising one, I think, that I saw.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.360]   And then my son got a lot of Star Wars stuff, Millennium Falcon.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.360]   Yeah, of course.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.360]   He's got an X-Wing that...
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.360]   I didn't even get it for him.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.640]   But I am working on the dirt wash for the Millennium Falcon, because it came in a little
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.640]   too clean.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.640]   So...
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.640]   But the...
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.640]   We're gonna paint it over briefly.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.640]   We took the model that came and now we're gonna...
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.360]   We're going to the hobby shop and getting some good dinner and some good, trying to pick
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.080]   the right color and then we're gonna brush it all through and everything else.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.640]   She probably has the Addy doll, probably.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.640]   Probably, probably.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.920]   Yeah, and so anyway, but outside of that, a lot of physical...
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.920]   We don't...
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.920]   You know what's funny is they have...
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.520]   We don't ever think of getting them electronics because they have the iPads.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.520]   They don't need them.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.520]   Right.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.000]   And so the funniest thing yesterday was a day off for them, I guess, that's in school,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.560]   in service for those teachers or whatever.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.240]   The answer was my son was watching Minecraft TV.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.680]   It's on YouTube or something.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.920]   And across the thing was my daughter was...
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.200]   She had all the little bits out.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.920]   So my son is watching TV and my daughter is sitting there.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.040]   My six-year-old daughter is sitting there building...
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.040]   I could make a TV.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.040]   With a little bit.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.040]   Okay.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.120]   If you're gonna insist on watching that stupid show, I'm gonna make my own TV.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.960]   And if I make noise, and he would...
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.400]   And I make clear that she has priority.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.400]   She's building something useful.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.400]   You're just watching TV.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.080]   So she makes noise with a little speaker.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.600]   Let me see if I can electrocute my brother.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.600]   This is interesting.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.280]   They not only have wheelchairs, they also have arm crutches.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.680]   Yeah, it's very interesting.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.680]   I really...
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.680]   She picked it out.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.680]   I was like, how about that?
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.960]   No, I kind of like this because they celebrate diversity with these dolls.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.960]   I think it's a really good idea.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:21.960]   It's really great.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.880]   That has nothing to do with Apple, however.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.880]   We got...
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.880]   Oh, we got bits box for a little guy, children.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.760]   And basically every week you get this little programming kit and it walks you through making
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.760]   JavaScript programs.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.920]   And one is seven and one is ten.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.880]   And within like a week or two, they could actually modify it.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.960]   I mean, they modified it to make the main character blow up as often as possible, of course.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.040]   But they learned how to go in and change which sprite was put there and how the animation
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.880]   worked and how many there were.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.200]   I was really surprised because it just looked like a bunch of junkie JavaScript to me, but
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.200]   they really got into it.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.200]   It wasn't impressive.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.000]   Kids, you learned in junkie JavaScript.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Well, I mean, it's sad that kids have to learn JavaScript.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   They should learn this.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   They need a real language.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.600]   We have the basic kids to this.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.600]   Swift would be good.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.760]   They really took to it.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.520]   I was really happy and now they love programming.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.520]   They're sitting there.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.600]   They get a certain amount of time every day.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.160]   You can barcode, scan it onto your iPads.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.360]   You can try it out on there as well.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.360]   And it worked really, really well.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.360]   Wait a minute.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.360]   They don't have to type it in like we used that.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.360]   No, they do.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.360]   They type it in on the computer.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.720]   But if you want to transfer it from the computer to your iPad to make it easy for a kid, you
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.520]   just hold up the camera and it automatically transfers it for you.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.520]   It's B-I-T-S-B-O-X.com.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.520]   And do you know how you do it?
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.520]   And did you get it just for one subscription for both of them?
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.960]   No, we got them one each because they're kind of possessive.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.840]   Well, I think that's a good idea.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.000]   But do they get the same thing each month or do they get it?
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.240]   And like this month with the theme of superheroes and it came with a little cape in the box.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.680]   So it was really cool.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.240]   This is a really cool idea.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.480]   The clicking you hear right now is me ordering.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.480]   I like this idea a lot.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.480]   Bits box.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.160]   I think you're zoomed in a little bit, Jason.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.360]   Jason Cleanthesis here.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.200]   He is our new producer by the way.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.880]   Jason Howell has moved along to host, he's our been long time host of all about Android
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.880]   and Android, Apparina.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:10.040]   But he's now moved along to host TNT as well as those other shows with Megan Moroni.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.720]   And TNT, our new daily news show, has moved to 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern because we
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.320]   realized you do it in the morning.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.960]   Nothing's happened yet.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.880]   So if we do it at the end of the day and that way it also makes sure that we do it in the
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.120]   timely enough fashion so that most people around the world can have it for their morning
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.120]   commute.
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.120]   Mm-hmm.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.000]   4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.920]   We're about midnight UTC for tech news today, Jason Howell there.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.240]   But we're thrilled to have Jason Cleant on the board.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.160]   He came from the, you know he came from the chat room.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.160]   Right Jason?
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.160]   You were effing done.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.160]   Is that where you grew up?
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.160]   I was at night.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.160]   I grew up in the chat room.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.680]   I sharpened my teeth in the chat room.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.680]   I love it.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.840]   When we get people who are regular and you were very regular in the chat room and try
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.480]   to get a job with us for how long, a year, two years?
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.480]   Couple years.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.040]   Couple years.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.040]   And you passed the test.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.040]   When the housing market was much better.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.040]   You passed the test.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.040]   Sorry.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.920]   That's like the temple where someone just sits outside for years.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.920]   John did that.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.080]   Jim R.B. did that.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.280]   Jim R.B. also we got to know him in the chat room.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.240]   He moved here and bought a house next door or rents a house next door.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.040]   I didn't have a job for him.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.160]   Finally, I felt bad.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.880]   I said, "Well, we can find something for you."
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.840]   So and he's been, and he's now one of our most valued employees as are you, Jason.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.560]   So I like doing that because it means that we can kind of incorporate people who are
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.000]   regular fans into the show as opposed to some.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.800]   And some of them great employees never heard of to it, but it's nice if you know what we're
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.800]   doing.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.720]   No, I mean, Kara is fabulous.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.000]   I don't think she'd ever heard of.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Or Kevin.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Or Kevin.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   I don't know who Kevin is.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Who's Kevin?
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   I'm just kidding.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   I think he's an editor.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   I think he's going to edit this show, so I'm sorry, Kevin.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.840]   No one will ever hear that.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:59.400]   Is there anything to, well, Apple shares closed the year with the worst performance since
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.400]   2008.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:07.400]   Stock market, apparently, is not as bullish or maybe they were just selling it off.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.760]   No connection between stock markets and reality, Leo.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.760]   Yeah, I know.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.560]   It's not even a news story, but it is sort of.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:17.240]   It's a good opportunity for Apple to do more buyback, which is my guess is what they'll
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.240]   come down on.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.240]   Shares down, finished the year down 4%.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.120]   That's the first down year for Apple.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.560]   This is 2008, seven years.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.320]   So that's maybe that's significant.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.880]   They've said they're too successful.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.880]   There's no room to grow.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.720]   I mean, if they were a horribly performing company, they'd be optimism for the future.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.040]   So some of it's so off, but I think that that's mostly that's exactly what people are saying
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.000]   is, you know, how where are they going to go now?
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.320]   What can the next big thing be?
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.280]   They can't possibly, they're going to be, they're going to get a company that's not
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.640]   going to have that kind of massive growth going forward.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.640]   They could have the attitude.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.240]   They've even warned people that that's the case, right?
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.640]   You'd previously buy Coke or Gillette or something and just hold it for decades, and that would
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.640]   be what you retired on.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.340]   But now people want to turn it over quickly.
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.320]   You know, if you just buy Apple and hold it, your returns are incredible.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.680]   But if you want to sell it every day, it's not what the market wants.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.520]   They want to stock like Amazon where, oh, no profits now.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:09.640]   But one day, Apple shed a duPont.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:14.280]   That means they, okay, so they lost $57 billion in market cap in 2015.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.920]   That's about what duPont's worth.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.240]   So they shed a duPont.
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.640]   Right now worth a mere $590 billion.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.840]   Well, and I still think that they are, I mean, we should remember that they really, I mean,
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.640]   people have talked about it, but they are not an introductory to buy themselves out at
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.640]   some point.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.400]   I mean, you know, I think that's actually good.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.240]   By 2022, 2024, they could be not a public anymore.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.160]   You know, and I think that every time we see this, the stock drop will see, if my theory
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.840]   is correct, see the stock drop, you'll see them buy a bunch, you know, billions of stock,
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.320]   you know, and there's a whole math to that because they're paying, you know, they're
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.920]   borrowing money to buy the stock, right, to, you know, it's very complicated.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.640]   But I think that we'll see it kind of work them.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:59.360]   Could they still afford to like get top flight executives to abandon careers at other companies
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.360]   if there isn't the carrot that we will give you, we allow you to buy shares of stock at
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.760]   this price?
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.080]   That's the trick, isn't it?
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:11.040]   In Silicon Valley, a part of this growth is fueled by the need to have stock options
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.880]   that are worth a lot.
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.440]   And they're only worth a lot if you buy at a low price and then the stock grows and now
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.600]   you can sell at a high price.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.600]   That's where you really...
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.320]   And a lot of that growth comes from...
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.840]   They certainly don't simply buy a business and then stamp the apple logo on it, but it's
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:29.080]   like they'll find someone who's just a soup, they'll find a superstar who absolutely knows
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.720]   what they're doing and simply say, do you want to work for an uncool company?
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.720]   Or would you like to work for one of the coolest companies ever and maybe instead of having
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:42.280]   a piddly $80 million have more hands than $190 to $200 million.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.040]   And there's a lot of places that Apple can still disrupt.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:50.400]   I mean, the thing is that right now they've been drafting off of the iPhone for a long
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:54.680]   time, but if they're able to do something with cars, there's a lot of growth opportunity
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.680]   there.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.680]   They're also...
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.920]   I mean, if you look at the fact that they've stepped in between banks and consumers, there
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.920]   is a...
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.320]   How many people would...
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.160]   If Apple opened a bank that said, we're not going to do hedge fund, we're not going
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.600]   to do crazy things, you can put money into it, how many iPhone users would put their money
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.280]   into an Apple bank, probably most of them.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.400]   A large percentage of people would move pretty quickly.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:21.680]   I know if I knew that Apple was doing that, I mean, because now returns, putting your
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.280]   money in a bank is low anyway, what really makes the difference is service and being
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.120]   tied into your everything else.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:32.000]   I could definitely see people moving down that path and when Apple pay, they're basically
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.520]   putting themselves where they're having that relationship and cutting that relationship
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.080]   off in the same thing with the phones.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:41.000]   I mean, if you look at where Apple's going with Wi-Fi and everything else, I mean, Apple
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.680]   is slowly moving towards a position where they could, you know, over some point in time,
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.240]   you know, disconnect the phone companies from the consumer.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:55.000]   Apple successfully patented a way to send money via iMessage in December, which is odd
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.360]   because I don't know how they got this patent and maybe it's very specific because people
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.000]   have been sending money via texts forever.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.240]   I remember like two years ago, there was a patent for Apple on a trip where you could
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.920]   book a cruise and give feedback on your...
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.680]   I mean, there's just a patent for everything.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:10.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:11.680]   Well, and you should patent it.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.680]   Yep.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:17.280]   Unfortunately, the USPTO's philosophy seems to be, will grant any patent and then let the
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.680]   courts, you know, sort it out, which is really not a good way to do this.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.120]   Alex has pointed previously, if you just look at this last year with the Apple Watch, I've
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.040]   had nice watches for a decade and all of them when I wanted to change the link bracelet,
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:33.640]   required me to go to a jeweler or get fancy jewelers tools and now I can just pop out
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.360]   of a link and close it and I hope everyone adopts that.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.560]   I had Wacom, tablets and sentiques for years and there was always an air gap and there
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.800]   was always parallax and now the Apple pencil gets rid of that and I hope the Apple has
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.320]   a way whether you like their products or not of coming into an industry and at least
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:52.040]   giving it a fresh set of eyes and that forces the entire industry to evolve.
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.680]   It's been this way since 2001.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.520]   It's more about refinement than it is about complete invention, about innovation in the
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.480]   sense that you, hey, we're going to create something nobody's ever seen before.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.920]   There were so many terrible headlines this year, Apple didn't do anything, Apple's in
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.080]   beta, none of Apple's ideas were original.
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:11.560]   That's been true since the iMac, the computer, the phone, the tablet, the watch, everyone
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.240]   of these things existed before.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:17.480]   Yes, their advantage, their skill, what they offer is the mainstream of technologies.
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:22.360]   They make it accessible to a far wider group of people than it was ever accessible to before
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.080]   and that's been their key to success continuously for decades.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.080]   Kind of.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:34.200]   They're still, if there's something they haven't really proven really strongly yet, it's the
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.720]   ability to be the bread basket for the entire world.
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.360]   They can make a phone for people who can afford to buy an expensive phone.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.320]   They can't make a phone for people who can't afford a really expensive phone.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.320]   Isn't that my choice though, Andy?
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.320]   They don't want it.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.560]   Well, they also set the map.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.760]   That's absolutely by choice.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:58.520]   It's just that when you, when it's interesting to think of what they would do if they had
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:03.320]   to, if they were going to open a bank and if they were to do any sort of product or service
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:09.240]   where they don't really have the luxury and it is kind of a luxury to be able to cherry
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:12.560]   pick the very, very best, most attractive customers.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:18.240]   When you open a bank as good or as bad as, you know, Citibank as Bank of America as
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.640]   all these other banks are.
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:25.760]   You have to serve the people who have a $750,000 401(k) and you also have to serve the people
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.960]   who are basically opening their first bank account and trying to establish credit.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.720]   And I'm not saying that Apple would fail at that.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.920]   I'm saying that it would be not the sort of thing that I would say, "Oh, of course they'll
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.280]   do a great job at that."
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:44.200]   And it's, I'm glad that the industry is so much richer, obviously, with Apple's voice
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.200]   in there.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.040]   It's a really wonderful and very rich chorus of voices of different attitudes, different
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.600]   approaches about technologies and the way people interact with them.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.400]   Apple Pencil, for instance, is brilliant for people like me.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:01.680]   I won't speak for anybody else, people who just need something that's quick and accessible
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.560]   that feels as much like a natural tool as possible.
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:11.040]   When I speak to professional artists, they say that they love it for a sketchbook sort
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:15.160]   of stuff but it falls short of what they need for actual production work.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.320]   And that's not a failure point.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.640]   That's not a failure point for Apple.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.920]   It's just simply saying that they chose the tool that they wanted to make.
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.760]   So it's best to put in the feedback I've gotten from somebody.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.440]   My mom, who is an artist, loves her.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.640]   Of course, she's telling me because I gave it to her for Christmas.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.440]   I'm just lying.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.640]   And she's not a professional in the sense she sells her art but she loves her iPad and
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.400]   Pencil and really has been using that with Procreate and is blown away.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.400]   It's like, broke.
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.120]   Well, and I've just, the concept artists that I've talked to that have been playing with
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.680]   that have said that they think it's really great, it's just still not quite.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.720]   It doesn't integrate with that flow or something yet.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.200]   But I think it's fair to think about it.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.200]   But that's one.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:56.280]   I mean, it's gotten 99% there or 95% to there in one try.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:00.360]   So, you know, and again, I think the other thing when we talk about the banks is that
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.720]   Apple doesn't have to provide a full service.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.720]   Absolutely not.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:08.680]   They can say, hey, we'll take your money and give you a small return back on it.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:13.560]   And then the only thing Apple needs to do from that point on is provide loans to people
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.160]   buying Apple products.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.160]   And that is it.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.160]   Like they don't have to do your house loan.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.160]   They don't do your 401k.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.160]   They don't have to do whatever.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.600]   Like the iPhone buyers program.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.600]   I mean, you just do, you know, if you, if you just look at financing that with other
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.480]   people, money, it's just, did they outsource?
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.480]   They outsourced though.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.480]   Yes.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.720]   They didn't do that themselves.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.120]   They outsourced the lending for the.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.120]   Right.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.120]   And the U.S.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.120]   Coach is why it was small distribution at first.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.120]   But they could.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.120]   I mean, the thing is is they could say we're going to open a thing where you can put your
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.120]   money in all.
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.120]   You're not going to do anything else.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.280]   They could do a lot of things.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.280]   They could open a zoo.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.280]   Right.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.280]   The Apple zoo.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.680]   I think it's really important.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.320]   It's important discipline for Apple.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.880]   And Steve Jobs, you know, was very clear about this.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.040]   And say, yeah, there's many things you could do.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.520]   And Apple so far has been very good about not doing a lot of that, even though we say
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.320]   they should buy the music industry.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.320]   Why not?
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:03.120]   No, I don't think that's, but I think that they're putting themselves, whether they
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.280]   decide to do it or not, they're putting themselves in that position.
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:09.000]   And I think when you look at where they've gone as far as low-cost phones versus high-cost
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.080]   phones, when 49% of the activations in the, when they said over Christmas, Apple, what
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:19.920]   you're seeing is there's a handful of people that are geeks that are buying, you know,
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.280]   Android because it gives them a lot more freedom.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.560]   I mean, I own Android and I use it for certain things that I need.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.880]   And then there's a whole lot of people that buy them because they're a smartphone that
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.960]   they never add an app to.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.640]   Like my parents never add apps to their phones.
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.720]   They don't know anything about it.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.040]   So, but what I think what we're seeing
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.800]   is when people graduate from that base phone
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.040]   that they bought really cheaply,
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.220]   that just as a phone with a screen,
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.520]   a lot of them are moving to an iPhone,
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.520]   as it becomes available.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.720]   And I think when they have the money,
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.900]   when their the means to do that,
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.800]   and they're not moving to the hiring of Android.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.680]   And I think that's a real--
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.720]   - It's a really conscious decision of Apple's part.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.060]   Where can we make the most money?
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.580]   - But you know, Impinds are old where the veins are.
[00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.900]   You don't, you know, can you take a whole amount of--
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:18:59.740]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:03.400]   - But I think that it's misleading
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.880]   when we say that, you know, Android has,
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.920]   I mean, it is, I mean, Android has this huge market share,
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.600]   but which is incredible for Apple,
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.440]   because what it does, what the huge market share
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.880]   of that Android has does is it keeps Apple
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.440]   from having to have monopoly conversations.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.680]   You know, and so, you know, it's the same reason
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.120]   why Apple was kept partially,
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.800]   why Microsoft kept Apple alive was they thought
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.080]   that that was gonna keep them out of hot water.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.360]   And so Apple being a minority share,
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.440]   but what we're seeing though is the,
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.760]   of the people who are actually spending money,
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.360]   they are the majority, the vast majority.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.720]   - Right.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.440]   Well, I would hate for the,
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.720]   I would hate for the new slogan for Apple to be Apple.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.520]   Go be poor someplace else.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.360]   - No, I don't--
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.200]   - I think I've never seen that.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.160]   - I don't necessarily think that's where they're heading.
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.320]   I'm saying that there are things that,
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.080]   so many different companies do well.
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.640]   And what Microsoft, for instance, does well is
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.000]   appreciating that there are people who have to buy
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.040]   40 computers and they have only amount of dollars to do it.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.560]   What's the best way to provide the best computing services
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.880]   to the people who are in that sort of market?
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:09.240]   And it's, Apple just has not, as yet shown,
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.360]   they've, I'm not saying they don't have the ability,
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.480]   but they haven't shown the ability to do that.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.320]   One of the great freedoms that they have is,
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.120]   because they have so much, they're so financially successful,
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.040]   they have one of the greatest things a company can have,
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.840]   the ability to pursue their own destiny.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.000]   They're not driven by market needs.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.160]   They're trying to make products that are successful, yes,
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.320]   but they don't feel as though any place
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.400]   that there's money on the table.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.200]   They don't feel as though they have to go get that money.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.040]   They're really are driven by what they want to do.
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:38.200]   >> I would say, the one thing I just wanted to say,
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.000]   in case I don't get a chance to say it later on,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.920]   is that I really think that if we're talking about
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.680]   untapped products that Apple hasn't really exploited yet,
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.920]   it really is their philosophy, their style,
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.640]   the way they have of educating management.
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:55.320]   And the more interesting to me than Apple creating a bank
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.280]   is Apple creating a business school.
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.840]   Like if they had a way of simply saying,
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.680]   we will train your executives or we will train your management,
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.280]   we will consult on the creation of your company.
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:05.360]   >> What about Apple universe?
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:09.440]   >> And show you exactly, making instead of an in-house sort of thing.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:13.400]   If it's a method of saying, if we like your company
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.840]   and we actually want to buy you,
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:19.320]   or we want to stick our thumb in that particular blueberry pie
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.920]   to get a little bit a taste of it,
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.080]   part of what we will do if you're getting handover
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.120]   15% of your company to us is that we will give you access
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.120]   to Apple University.
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.360]   And we will basically be your,
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.000]   we will be your advisors and your cons,
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.520]   and your consuls on that.
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:36.160]   Because you just, you can't deny that the way that Apple
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.600]   runs its company is perfect for Apple.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:42.560]   And it's kind of intriguing to think about what were,
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:45.160]   what are the broader lessons that you can maybe apply
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.160]   towards any company or any process that might benefit
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.840]   pretty much anybody.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.280]   >> There would be, I think it would make a difference.
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.840]   I'm not sure if it would be, you know, cost-fect for Apple.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.440]   I mean, I think that the, when you look at the,
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.000]   the general revenue and the advantage that they have
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.640]   by running the company the way they do it,
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:03.320]   I think that, I think it's hard also when you think about
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.880]   the low cost and everything else is,
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.960]   is how do you, getting returns out of low cost is really hard.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.720]   We look at parts of the business, like for instance,
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.320]   the business that I'm in, which is live streaming,
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.240]   almost all of our companies are Fortune 100,
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.320]   a handful of them are Fortune 500.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.640]   We look at low cost solutions.
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.800]   Like we really want that because we know that at a certain rate,
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.280]   if I charge a certain amount for live streaming,
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.840]   there is so much work that is just like,
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.440]   it's infinite.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.680]   You know, like, you know, right now with the demand,
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.560]   except I can't figure out how to do that reliably
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.000]   over time at that price.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.160]   And I'm just trying, you know, no one can,
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.720]   that's why it's infinite, available.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.760]   >> I think, I think.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.600]   >> And so we, you know, but it's really hard to do it well.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.680]   And I think Apple does, you know, really focuses
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.080]   on these little details and it'd be very hard to do that
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.440]   if they focused on anything lower cost.
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.360]   They make a lot of profit on it,
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.120]   but it also gives them a lot of room to play
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.040]   and figure out that process.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.960]   >> I think there's also a really good symbiotic relationship
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.360]   where Apple comes up with a lot of ideas that do help mainstream
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.440]   the technology in terms of making technology
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.480]   that everybody can use.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.560]   Maybe they can't afford it, but they can at least use it.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:04.320]   And then other vendors come along and fill the gaps below Apple.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.800]   And ideas turn out from there that go back up in Apple
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.000]   and incorporate them into their products.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.920]   So you get sort of both ends in the market.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.000]   And Apple doesn't have, when they say we don't know
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.680]   how to make a cheap laptop, they really mean that.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.520]   They sincerely don't know how to make a laptop
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.920]   that to them exemplifies what they feel
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.280]   should be an Apple product.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.840]   But at the same token, the ideas in the Apple version
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.240]   will show up in the HP version, the Dell version,
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.280]   the Lenovo version.
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.840]   And really good ideas in Android phones and Windows phones
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.640]   will show up in iOS in that way, both in some market benefit.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.800]   >> Do you guys feel like this is a different Apple
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.360]   from the Apple that said the computer for the rest of us?
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.400]   I feel like in the early days of Apple, there was a sense,
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.640]   it certainly was had this sense of,
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.800]   let's make the Apple to be a democratize.
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.080]   We had to leave Felsenstein on yesterday.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:46.960]   >> It was so expensive.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.240]   >> It was a great computer designers.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.680]   It always was expensive, but it was always the idea was,
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.280]   it was a lot cheaper than a mainframe.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:57.280]   >> The idea was, I think it was your first personal computer,
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.840]   computer for the rest of us, the idea was to democratize
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:00.800]   computing power.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:01.760]   >> I don't know, man.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:02.400]   >> That's how they went.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.800]   >> One thing in democracy, one thing in democracy.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.320]   >> I think that's absolutely true,
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.360]   because I was looking at a while ago, as a matter of fact,
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:13.120]   I was looking at the original plans for the first Mac
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.440]   where to create something that was less than $1,000.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.040]   >> Yeah, Jeff Raskin's ideas.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.080]   >> Yeah, me basically.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.240]   And of course, the first Apple was $666, of course,
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.120]   get to add things like, I don't know, a case, a keyboard.
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:25.760]   I don't know.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.840]   The little little little little feature comforts
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.360]   that people seem to like if they want to do more
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.640]   than just run power through something.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.680]   And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.920]   it's the iPad that really is the current,
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.840]   current articulation of that.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.880]   Because here you have a computer that costs way under $500.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.600]   It's more, it's so personal that, I mean, you are,
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:48.720]   you are overwhelming it, you're engulfing it, so to speak,
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.520]   as you're using it.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.440]   And although I will always wish that Apple finds a way
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.720]   to create a really good $600 or $700 laptop,
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.680]   I can't deny that they've created a wonderful, powerful device
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.200]   that a lot more people are able to afford at a price point
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.360]   that is not in any means ridiculous.
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:10.480]   I mean, it's a luxury, the iPad Mini is a luxury built device,
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.920]   but it's not at a luxury price.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.560]   It's just a little bit more expensive than an Android tablet.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.080]   You can get for the same time.
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.200]   >> Well, one of the things I think is interesting
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.080]   is the longevity.
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.840]   You know, my iPad won, like the original iPad or whatever,
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.880]   died a couple weeks ago, like the top half of the screen
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.600]   stopped working.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.840]   But that was some hard, that was a hard life.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.520]   >> I said long time later too.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.080]   >> And my kids, my kids, it was like her flu smokey,
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.280]   like just integrated.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.680]   So I've taken you as far as I can go well.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.280]   >> And, you know, because I buy, you know,
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.800]   it's hell on the iPad.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:38.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:42.000]   >> But it was, you know, it had two kids that,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.240]   and when my daughter started playing with it,
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.680]   she was less than two years old.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.000]   So, you know, it was two of that age using it,
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   dropping it, pounding it, whatever.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.160]   And I think that's part of Apple's problem with the iPad,
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.800]   is that because they're not people, you know, aren't utilized.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.200]   It's so, it lasts like all the,
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.800]   I have all the generations laying around the house,
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.080]   because I, you know, I buy them for the show,
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.440]   and I look at them and everything else,
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.720]   and then my kids just take them over.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.360]   Like, they, I'm too old for an iPad,
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.080]   I kind of feel like, you know, like I still need my laptop.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.960]   But I do find myself using my laptop less and less.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.240]   And, but my, my kids, I mean, that's just their,
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.000]   kind of the water that they're in.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.520]   >> iPad 2 is still the most popular, I think.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.080]   >> Is it?
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:18.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.480]   >> Well, I've sold them in August.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.440]   >> That's part of it, right.
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.480]   >> That's also because of both purchases.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.080]   That's the, that's the blister pack iPad,
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:24.960]   pools and racks.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:24.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.240]   >> I mean, I, I, when they say computer for the rest of us,
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.600]   I don't think that means a cheap computer by any means.
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.120]   Although, you compare that with the cost of computing power
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.480]   at that time, it wasn't, it wasn't vastly out of the range
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.840]   of other computers.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.400]   But it wasn't about money, it was just about democratizing it.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.000]   >> Well, but I think when you look at the age range.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.280]   >> It's not a democratic company anymore.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.120]   >> But when you look at the age range of an iPad,
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:51.760]   from two years old, more or less, to, you know, at any range,
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.200]   I mean, I just know, I just see people in the airport
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.400]   at the time with these.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.200]   >> Yeah, what you're paying for.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.160]   >> You know, and the thing is, you just see people
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.600]   just comfortably using it as an agent.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.800]   >> Do you get what you're paying for with Apple Gear?
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:05.280]   I mean, the $1,000 iPhone 6, in terms of quality,
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.280]   I'm not talking about, you know, the kind of ineffable,
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:08.560]   yeah, I have an iPhone.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.200]   But in terms of quality and durability, I'm real live.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.720]   >> Look at how many old iPhones you still like.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.280]   >> I was walking through, I forget where it was,
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.600]   it was a giant conference center a couple of weeks ago,
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.000]   and I saw tons of iPhone 4, 4S's,
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.080]   and that people were still busily using, you know,
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.360]   as their main phone.
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.480]   >> Well, that's a testament.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.040]   >> That's a testament to the lack of low-cost iPhones,
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:27.760]   more than anything else.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:28.880]   >> Oh, but also the durability,
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.400]   'cause those phones broke after a year or two.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:30.880]   >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.880]   Well, but maybe they bought it last year for--
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.000]   >> I think the biggest thing is the battery,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.280]   and I think it depends on how you charge it,
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.400]   and everything else, but I think--
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.280]   >> That is what dies.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.720]   >> What kills us, we're about to replace all of our iPhone 5s,
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.240]   I think, that are in the office,
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.640]   specifically because the batteries are all large.
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.120]   >> They can't charge it.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.800]   >> They're not holding charge anymore, so that's the--
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.360]   >> That's the issue.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.960]   >> But no, Renee's absolutely right.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:54.000]   I mean, you can imagine how many phones I get through my office,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   and not all of them are requested back,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.360]   'cause they make 80 million of them,
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.840]   and they'd rather not, even just the money
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.280]   they would spend on tracking them,
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.400]   and making sure they get back.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.040]   >> That's how it works.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.040]   >> Sometimes not work right, and so I'm just amazed
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.640]   by the amount of times that I will fire,
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:10.400]   so I keep some of these in my library for reference later on,
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.720]   and I'm amazed at how many times I'll fire up
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.720]   like a two-year-old or three-year-old Android phone
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:20.320]   that may have had less than 100 hours of uptime,
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:23.520]   and it's just dead either because of a battery issue,
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.880]   or because of something like that.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.800]   I don't think that the builds are bad by any means,
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:33.680]   but I compare that to all my own personal old iPhones,
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.000]   where if I wanted to do a photo test
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.560]   comparing the original version one iPhone,
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.480]   my personal one that I carried around everywhere
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.120]   for a year or two, to the latest one,
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:46.480]   I have absolutely no fear whatsoever
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.120]   that as soon as I can find a 30-pin dock connector
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.840]   in my pile of cables, it will fire up,
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.360]   it will launch right away.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.000]   >> Well, you saw me a couple of weeks ago,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.520]   we had the original iPod.
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.640]   >> Right. >> You can charge it up.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.560]   >> Okay, well, that one played to me.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.040]   >> For mine, it's a hard drive issue,
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.280]   I'm sure that if I wanted to get the stock.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.960]   >> It's been right, that's 2,000-wide iPod,
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.640]   I mean, that's the thing.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:12.880]   >> But to that point, the only comment I would say,
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.280]   just to put another dimension to it,
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.600]   is that I do, to answer your question,
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:22.320]   I do think that Apple builds things beautifully
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.800]   and handsomely, and I can complain about,
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.120]   maybe the keyboard on this is flatter than I would like,
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.200]   but I can't complain that it's a poorly made keyboard,
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.160]   it's just beautifully made for the ages.
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.720]   The difficulty with the way that Apple does things
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.600]   is just that if you want to,
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.160]   they make $70,000 outies,
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.680]   and if you really just need a $21,000 Toyota,
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.680]   that's certainly not built as well,
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.680]   and it doesn't have the same sort of performance
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.360]   and engineering, and it's not as forward looking,
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:54.000]   that's too bad because they only make $70,000 outies.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.280]   And there are a lot of people that are,
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:58.240]   they just need a really well-made $600 laptop,
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.720]   of which there are a great many in Windows space.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.280]   >> Here's a little tip, by the way, Alex,
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.040]   you might want to watch Malachi closely,
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:11.840]   a UK store owner named Muhammad Shuga,
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.720]   has a very smart seven-year-old son.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.160]   >> Who watched?
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.120]   >> I have that problem too.
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:17.600]   >> Who watched?
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:21.680]   His father entered the Apple ID and password in the iPad,
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.800]   and he decided to give himself an early Christmas present,
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.960]   he bought some Dino bucks, Dino bucks,
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.240]   from the game Jurassic Park,
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:33.040]   turns out he spent $5,000 between December 13th and 18th.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.840]   >> On Dino bucks for Jurassic Park.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.160]   >> They did give them the money back.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:38.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:39.840]   >> After some work, but--
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:42.560]   >> 65 transactions, $2,000 in well-known hour.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:46.800]   >> It's actually one of the biggest features
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.280]   that I really enjoy about my phone or my iPad
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.200]   is actually the biometric,
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.000]   because specifically because my son and my daughter
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.160]   will sit there and try to watch me put my coat in,
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.160]   because that's like the magic kingdom for them.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.240]   >> It's like this game, like if I order a new movie,
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.680]   they all have to leave the room,
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:02.720]   and I type this thing in.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.440]   Now I just open up my remote when they updated it.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.720]   I just open up my remote on my phone,
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.480]   and I can just type it in and they can't see it,
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.320]   but I still have to turn it away from that.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:10.960]   >> It's probably smart.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:11.520]   >> Make sure they don't see it,
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.720]   because it is like a, you know, they definitely want
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.400]   that password, because they know that then they give me
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.080]   like buying stuff and doing things.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.160]   >> Mom had found out about it when his credit card
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:21.680]   was trying to buy some stuff for the store's credit card
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.360]   was declined, he called up, he said,
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.840]   "Did you know that you have 60 plus transactions
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.840]   totaling 3, 911 pounds?"
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:31.280]   And he says, "I was so mad, I'm 32 years old.
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.520]   Why would Apple think I'd be spending thousands of pounds
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.240]   on buying dinosaurs and upgrading the game?"
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.400]   >> You're surprised, you know, there's people with problems.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.480]   >> Apple's support team said there's no guarantee
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.680]   you get a refund, but they did eventually refund all his money.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:48.080]   And he says from now on, he hopes Apple does something
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.320]   to ensure no other appearance and have the same--
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.520]   >> I got a say. >> They got sued over this.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:52.400]   That's a wetware problem.
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:53.280]   >> They changed how that worked.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.520]   It's a wetware problem, it's not Apple's problem.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.360]   >> But do you think you're the company
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.640]   that didn't decline the charges either?
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.480]   >> Well, that's true.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.400]   >> My bank's app has lots of wonderful features
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.720]   where I can, there are like eight different settings
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.080]   in my mobile app that say,
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:10.560]   "Please send me a text alert whenever someone charges
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.800]   more than X dollars, please send me a text alert
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.400]   whenever a charge comes from overseas."
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.720]   And it's just wonderful.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.760]   Do you think that it's maybe time for Apple to have those--
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.440]   at least make the option of saying any time
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.720]   that there is more than X dollars
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.880]   where the purchase is made, one 24-hour period.
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.480]   Just send me to--
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.320]   >> I--
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.600]   >> If someone sends the password, let it go through,
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.560]   but let me know what that happened.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:31.760]   >> We have a corporate-- our corporate cards
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.520]   are with Bank of America this morning.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:37.120]   I spent $10 on Steam, and I hear Lisa go,
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.280]   "Did you just buy something on Steam?
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:42.160]   Bank of America has canceled your credit card."
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:45.440]   And we-- this has been a continuing problem.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.360]   I guess Steam might be a sort-- Steam is the game engine
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.880]   from Valve.
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.680]   I guess-- because we had called Steam and said,
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:56.320]   "No, no, we buy stuff with this credit card on Steam,
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.920]   you know, we called Bank of America," and they said,
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.920]   "Okay," and then immediately, $10.
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:04.560]   They canceled-- they didn't--
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.640]   >> They didn't-- this is the sort of problem that--
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:09.440]   I'm sure that we're not--
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.840]   Apple's not serious about thinking about opening a bank,
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.120]   but this is-- but when you talk about--
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.240]   >> That's why you don't open a bank.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.600]   >> Well, this is-- well, no, this is like--
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.120]   when you go into a new market,
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.920]   even a poorly run bank has been in business for decades.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.880]   And I had a great experience with my bank
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.440]   where I made a-- at the New York--
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.240]   New York Comic Con, first-- my first stop off the train
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.800]   was at the ATM across the street.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.200]   I took out the cash that I thought I would be spending
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.960]   on like prints and posters and everything.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.440]   And then the ATM said, "No way.
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.560]   No, no, no, Evan Way."
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.560]   And by the time-- I'm like, "Ah, damn it."
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.680]   They probably-- "Okay."
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.000]   By the time I turned around, I got on the alert on my phone
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.600]   saying, "Hi, someone tried to take an absurd amount of money
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.800]   off an ATM in New York.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.760]   Is that okay?"
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.440]   And then as soon as I did, I got another--
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.800]   "Okay, that's fine. Just wanted to check.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:53.920]   We have now unlocked your card."
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.880]   >> I like it when they do that.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:55.680]   That's not what they--
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.680]   >> That's not an inconvenience.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.280]   That's like, you are doing your job.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:33:59.840]   >> That's right.
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:00.720]   No, I'm not from--
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:03.360]   >> And that happened after a lot of complaints
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.480]   and a lot of pain.
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.920]   >> Of course, I used an American Express card
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.920]   in the Bahamas to buy $100 worth of pictures of me
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:08.560]   with dolphins.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:09.440]   Nobody said anything.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.680]   So, I'm-- you know, maybe they-- no,
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:13.680]   and then I-- no, that's what bad guys don't do
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:15.520]   is buy pictures of themselves with dolphins.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.720]   But hey, let's take a break.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:19.760]   When we come back, I want to talk about Alex Gibney's--
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.040]   Steve Jobs' biography.
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.560]   He aired for the first time on CNN.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.600]   I don't know if you all watched it or not.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.040]   If you didn't, there'd be nothing to say.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:30.560]   So, quickly watch it while I'm talking about legal Zoom.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:31.360]   You have two hours.
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.960]   [ Laughter ]
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.640]   I watched it on the plane back,
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.880]   because, you know, we're on Virgin America
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.400]   and they have direct TV.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:38.880]   >> Right.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:39.520]   >> And I'm watching it.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.400]   It was awesome.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.920]   Our show today brought to you by Legal Zoom.
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.160]   Get your life organized today.
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.600]   You're estate planning.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.600]   I have estate planning advice for you.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.080]   Whether you need a will or a trust,
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.120]   Legal Zoom can help you do what you need it to do.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.200]   If you have a family, even if you don't,
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:00.400]   if you just have assets, you don't want the government,
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.720]   the courts to determine what happens to those assets,
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:03.680]   if something happens to you.
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.400]   You don't want the courts to decide what happens to your
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.800]   children, if something happens to you, or your pets.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:13.040]   Legal Zoom's estate plan bundles make this easy.
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.240]   They eliminate the guesswork.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.440]   You don't have to figure out on your own,
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.600]   whether a will or a living trust would be the best.
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.800]   You can actually talk to an independent attorney.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:24.560]   Legal Zoom's pre-negotiated low prices with attorneys
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.440]   in almost every state.
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.520]   They'll walk you through their options,
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:31.040]   recommend an estate plan that offers the best solutions to fit you.
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:31.680]   And it's easy.
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:32.480]   They're not a law firm.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.000]   Legal Zoom's not a law firm.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:34.800]   So it's efficient.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.160]   It's the high value.
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.240]   And you can talk to a lawyer.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.760]   So it's like the best of everything on your schedule, on your terms.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.440]   And you will know upfront what it's going to cost.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.000]   You don't have to worry about hourly rates or getting a bill next month.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.440]   I love this.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.400]   That's how Legal Zoom has become the leader in helping small business owners,
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.960]   families, people like us with their legal needs.

[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.760]   Lisa just did hers.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.520]   It's nicely sent her a pack, a whole kit.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.320]   It was really great.
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.280]   I was very impressed.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.280]   I'm going to test it this year.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:20.080]   My will is really old and I'm really old.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:21.280]   So that's a bad.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.880]   The will and then also I've always wanted to write a patent.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.640]   And so I was going to do that.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:27.680]   I got a whole bunch of patents.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.440]   I thought I'm going to do.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:29.920]   You know what you want to do?
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:30.640]   I got a lot of them.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:31.440]   Tell us.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.560]   No, I'm not going to tell you.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.840]   That immediately it tried.
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.200]   That immediately invalidates.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.320]   It takes all the fun out of it.
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.600]   LegalZoom.com.
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.040]   Don't forget the offer code MBW.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:42.000]   You will save 10 bucks on checkout.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:42.880]   You can do it on your patent.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.800]   It doesn't have to be on family planning.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.560]   So did any of you see the Steve Jobs?
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.640]   Nobody did.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:48.960]   I should have.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.320]   I should have less than a couple of times.
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:50.400]   It was good.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.800]   I, you know, so a couple of people tweeted me saying,
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:53.920]   oh yeah, it was a hit piece.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:57.520]   Of all of the things I've seen on Steve,
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:58.960]   video things I've seen on Steve Jobs,
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:02.160]   it was the most complete, most thorough and fairly balanced.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.200]   It doesn't compete with Walter Isaacson's book
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.480]   or becoming Steve Jobs, a Rick Tetsley book,
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.080]   which I think is excellent.
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.800]   But it's many of those same stories
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.480]   where people I think got a little upset with it.
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.600]   Towards the end, they focus on the options dating scandal.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.600]   They focus on-
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:20.640]   Anyone really cares about?
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.880]   Well, it cares.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.600]   Government care.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.320]   And Fred Anderson, who took the fall,
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.240]   this Apple CFO, who took the fall care.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:28.880]   It's unfortunate.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.400]   Two and a half million dollar fine to him.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.360]   But they talk about all the kind of,
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.840]   at the last minute negative things that happened,
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:38.560]   the antitrust action because of Apple's agreements
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.800]   with their companies, not the poach employees.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.200]   And so it kind of felt like a little bit of a hit piece.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:43.920]   But on the other hand,
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.880]   I think it was very balanced about Lisa, his daughter.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.200]   Although here's an interesting tidbit I'd never heard before.
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:55.280]   They interviewed Chris Ann, who was Steve's girlfriend.
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.240]   He had a baby with her.
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.160]   As they were breaking up, she got pregnant.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.240]   For a long time denied it,
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:05.200]   eventually a paternity test proved he was the father.
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.200]   This right at the same time as Apple went public
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.960]   and he was worth several hundred million dollars.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.280]   And he had agreed to give her $500 a month.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.080]   But one of the things that Chris Ann tells the story,
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:17.600]   she said, when I found out I was pregnant,
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:21.120]   we talked about what to name the baby, Steve and I.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:24.000]   She said, "This is not somebody who is denying paternity,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.040]   except he didn't court.
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:27.280]   But in person with me,
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.160]   we were talking about, and he said,
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:28.960]   "I want to name her Claire."
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:32.240]   And Chris Ann said, "No, I don't like that.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.600]   For some reason, I don't want that name."
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.360]   And they decided Lisa.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.080]   But she said, I figured out later
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.960]   that he had actually had a computer he wanted to call the Claire.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.360]   And that's why he wanted to name Lisa.
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.800]   And so, they were Claire.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:45.520]   And then when they changed,
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:49.360]   Lisa, he had to rethink the retronym for Lisa.
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:50.400]   I don't know if that's true or not.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:53.760]   That's the only thing out of that whole two-hour documentary
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.280]   that I had never heard before.
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:58.640]   Everything else is the stories you know and you've heard before.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:38:59.760]   But I thought that was interesting,
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.200]   that he wanted to call it the Claire.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.280]   I'm glad he came up with Lisa.
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.080]   Lisa sounds better.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:06.880]   So neither of you have seen this.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:07.760]   I haven't.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.880]   I would see it.
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:09.600]   It's worth seeing.
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.720]   We know the stories.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:11.440]   I don't get to be an end.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:15.840]   The funny thing about the Apple TV is all the stupid
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:19.120]   registration stuff, because I don't have TV.
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:23.920]   I have a really fast internet connection from Comcast.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.760]   And every time you want to,
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:30.800]   so now I'm buying, I pay for HBO and I pay for Showtime.
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.240]   I don't think there's any way to pay for CNN.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.920]   They want you to go and show that you're
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.640]   a TV subscriber.
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.360]   I feel like you can see it somewhere else.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.760]   See it and pay to everybody to produce it.
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.040]   I want you to know.
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.160]   It's on Sling?
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.120]   Oh, CNN, you mean?
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.480]   I think that you can get the DVD.
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.800]   I feel like the movie played in theaters a little bit.
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.560]   Yeah, it was released.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.760]   Yeah, it was sound fine.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.120]   I think it had a qualifying run.
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:58.640]   And this was one of the movies that Tim Cook was complaining about
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.320]   that he felt like was exploitative.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:03.440]   It was interesting because it starts with Steve's death.
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:07.760]   And they show the tributes at the Apple Store.
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:10.400]   They show Al Gore talking about Steve at the funeral day.
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.840]   And Gibney, who narrates the film,
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:18.960]   said, "I wanted to figure out why we all felt so bad when Steve passed.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.160]   What was it?"
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.480]   And then he goes back and kind of follows the story.
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.320]   It doesn't spend a lot of time with Steve's hippie years.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.680]   It does interview Woz.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:26.640]   There's some Woz in it.
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.800]   A lot of old footage I'd not seen, which was fun.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.960]   Kind of random found footage.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.800]   And you know what?
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.160]   It's part of your collection.
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:41.600]   He did the documentary on Scientology Going Clear,
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:42.480]   which was quite good.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.400]   Gibney.
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.080]   He gets a free pass for coverage
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.240]   on his next three projects for having done that.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:49.520]   I thought that was so good.
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.040]   It was a really good documentary.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.800]   And he must have been doing this at the same time
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.040]   as he was doing the Steve Jobs documentary,
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.120]   because they came out very close together
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.160]   within a year of each other.
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:04.080]   Anyway, I think of all the things I've seen about Steve
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:05.680]   certainly all the movies I've seen about Steve
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.160]   is the most complete portrait of him.
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.200]   It shows the good and the bad.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:13.520]   The interview Bob Belleville, who was kind of responsible
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:15.040]   for manufacturing the Macintosh,
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.160]   was there for about four years.
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:20.800]   He was crying about Steve passing,
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.880]   but he says it was also the worst four years of my life.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.680]   Every day was a nightmare.
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.880]   And he went to Japan with Steve many times.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:31.840]   So it was, I think for those interviews, it was interesting.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:33.040]   Anyway, nothing more to say,
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:33.760]   because you didn't see it.
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.760]   That's always interesting.
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.440]   There are a lot of projects like that,
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:41.440]   where people will say that's the work that most proudest of
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.640]   happened during this period.
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.960]   I would never, ever, ever go back and do it again.
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:50.240]   To me, I always think about the deluxe laser disc edition
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.400]   of The Abyss by James Cameron,
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.400]   where they got interviews with the entire cast
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.440]   like 10 years later.
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:42:00.400]   That was the movie where it was set in an undersea drilling platform.
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.480]   And he actually built an underwater set
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:05.440]   and all the cast had to spend like 12 hours a day
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.200]   for months scuba diving.
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.040]   And all of them said the exact same thing like that.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:11.840]   I will never, I hated it.
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:12.640]   It was terrible.
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.600]   I will never do it again.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.680]   It was one of the greatest movies I've ever made
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.480]   my entire life.
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.760]   Because I never thought,
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.080]   he got me to do things I never thought were possible.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.760]   And so that's, for that alone, that's a hell of a leader.
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:26.080]   Delville said, you know, I lost my wife,
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.360]   because we got divorced in that time.
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:28.320]   I lost my family.
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.320]   I lost my health.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:30.880]   There he is.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:35.760]   And, but at the same time, he's crying when Steve,
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:36.640]   that Steve's gone.
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.120]   And he reads his eulogy for Steve.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.960]   And it's very, it's that same thing as this kind of
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:41.760]   these mixed feelings about it.
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:42.960]   It's the greatest work I'd ever done.
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.640]   He made the Macintosh.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.720]   He did the manufacture for the Macintosh.
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:50.560]   It's fascinating when you have someone in their 40s or 50s or 60s.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:55.360]   And they are evaluating this person that is not them
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.800]   in their 20s and 30s.
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:57.040]   Right.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:00.640]   And with an extra 20, basically, if you're to present me with,
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:02.640]   here is Andy Nocko of age 23.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.440]   And here's the stuff that he was doing at that time.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:08.480]   I could see this as if I was evaluating just someone I was reading about.
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:08.960]   It's true.
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:09.840]   It's in the third party.
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:14.000]   And it gives you an extra set of clarity where, I mean, there's a,
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.840]   I have a, there was a, there was a time where I had to see every single interview
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:20.320]   with every single Apollo astronaut ever done.
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:20.400]   Right.
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:25.040]   And there are times where you have these, you have like Al Shepherd and Gene Churna.
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.920]   And then you see these people who are now like in their 60s and 70s.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:33.600]   And you see in their voice, the stories that they probably told 100,000 times about how,
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:38.640]   then, you know, they suddenly said, well, what if we were to send Apollo wait around the moon
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:39.040]   instead?
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:42.640]   I know that the command module has never been that far away before.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:47.280]   And whereas when in their 40s, they might have told the story with a certain amount of daring to,
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.720]   yes, of course, let's do that.
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:52.320]   You can really see in their voices, like someone who's 30 years older,
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:58.880]   was like, what a fool that person, what idiot he would never have seen his grandchildren.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.880]   He would never see his children grow up.
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.880]   He took that incredible risk.
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.720]   And why the hell did he do that?
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:09.840]   One of the things I realized watching it is I don't care, you know, whether it's biased or not.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:14.640]   I don't care if it's wrong, you know, I, I, and this, I think is a manifestation of what a
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.080]   different Steve made in our lives.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:17.920]   I want to see everything.
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.280]   I want to, I want to read it all.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:23.680]   I want to see it all. And I just, it's, it's a pleasure to see him
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:29.520]   at work. And they show a video from his last appearance, which was to introduce iCloud.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:35.360]   They show, I mean, it's whatever you're feeling about the slant of the documentarian.
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:36.720]   And I don't think it was particularly slanted.
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:39.760]   It's just great to see Steve again.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:44.000]   By the way, the other place to go, yeah, Magnolia and CNN produced it.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.080]   The other place to go is folklore.org, which is Andy Hertzfield.
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:51.680]   We've mentioned this many times, his Andy Hertzfield site where he puts together
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.160]   anecdotes from many of the original Macintosh teams.
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:57.440]   And you can read the real story as well.
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:59.520]   Well, and he would move very fast.
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:02.880]   I mean, I think that one of the things is with anyone like this to make decisions,
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.320]   you know, make decisions very quickly.
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:10.480]   In the, when the Mac came out along, you know, when the new iMac, the iMac came out,
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:14.960]   you know, I sent him an email, I sent Steve an email and I said, what do you think of this?
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:19.840]   And I got this quick email back like three minutes later saying, tell me more.
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:25.360]   So then I wrote this long thing about let's have all this and I mean, within like three days,
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:26.960]   I had, I was in meetings with Apple.
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.240]   That's pretty impressive.
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:31.600]   It was like, you know, I hit some vein that he was interested in.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.720]   Didn't turn out, but it was, but it was one of those things that you could tell that,
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:37.760]   you know, he, he's making decisions very quickly and then passing them off.
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.160]   And it was a really good lesson in, you know, that process.
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:40.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:45.920]   Well, there's also some great stories about the early Mac team and how Steve kind of
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:51.040]   reigned by chaos, you know, and he said, I think this was Belleville again, and he said, you know,
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:54.800]   at any moment, you know, Steve could throw a grenade into everything and, you know,
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.320]   I mean, it was just chaotic.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:59.440]   And that was one of the things that was so, he said, I have PTSD still.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:03.760]   Anyway, great.
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:04.640]   I think worth watching.
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:07.920]   I recommend it if you get a chance to see it and I'll be interested to hear what,
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.280]   what you, you all think of it.
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:13.680]   What are we going to think about what Apple has to release in 2016?
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:16.400]   We know that there will undoubtedly be a new iPhone.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.920]   They've been very consistent yearly since 2007.
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:27.600]   There are rumors coming around about the iPhone seven things, things like, for instance, 256
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:29.680]   gigabyte memory option.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:35.520]   256 and a larger battery and I'd be immediately, I usually go every year.
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:38.880]   I don't really go every year, but those are the two things like you give me a more storage
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.640]   and more battery time and I would immediately.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:41.920]   Yeah, larger batteries are tough.
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:45.760]   A lot of people ask for them, but whenever I talk to engineers, the first thing they say is that
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:49.840]   people do not understand battery geometry and that the more you put in, it's not a linear curve.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.480]   You don't, for the amount of battery you add, you don't get that much battery.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:54.480]   So there's an optimal kind of size of the battery?
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.400]   Yeah, it's like balancing out a sensor and a camera.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:59.920]   You want to make sure everything works because batteries, they keep in heat.
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:03.440]   So the bigger the battery, the more you have to ramp down the processor, for example,
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:04.720]   they're not radio transparent.
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:06.320]   So we can interfere with the signal.
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:07.120]   Also, they're heavy.
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:11.120]   And Apple believes, they truly believe that the lighter the phone or the tablet is,
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:12.080]   the easier it is to use.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:15.680]   You can hold it up longer for web browsing or watching video or reading.
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:19.440]   And if phones get heavy and I've got a bunch of heavy Android and Nokia phones here,
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:24.320]   you just, and even the iPhone 6 Plus and 6S Plus for me, it's uncomfortable to hold
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.920]   reading for long periods of time.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.000]   So there goes to make those as light as possible.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.320]   And they figure that by making a light phone, you can add a battery case, you can add a rugged
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:33.840]   case, you can add all these things.
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:37.040]   But if they build those in by default, you can't tear them off if you don't need them.
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:41.360]   So you're always stuck with that extra stuff, even if it's not necessary to your use case.
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:48.400]   So some people use an iPhone, my best friend has an iPhone 6S and he has 40% battery life left
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.360]   every day.
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.120]   So he would never need a bigger battery.
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:51.760]   I might.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.160]   So I either get the 6S Plus or I get the battery case.
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:58.000]   So that's one of those problems that from an engineering standpoint, I understand the feeling,
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.120]   but from an engineering standpoint, it's a challenge to balance all those needs.
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:03.840]   I have to say I brought only one phone with me.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:05.040]   It was a 6S Plus.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.000]   And it did a great job.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.960]   There was the Disney, the day we went to Disney World where we left early and we stayed late,
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:14.320]   it got down to 10%.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.480]   I turned on battery saver, got me all the way home.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:20.640]   That phone is an amazing beast.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:21.840]   They're doing everything they can't with it.
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:23.520]   Probably just the way I use it or whatever I use.
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.680]   Because my phone has to do with radios.
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:31.040]   So if you're in a with signal area, you can they can hunt and it can really kill your battery.
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:33.520]   Because I just know that I'm charging mine all the time.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:34.800]   It feels like I'm charging all the time.
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:35.360]   Anything that was?
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:36.240]   Yeah, it's a plus.
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:36.880]   No, no, I have.
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:37.840]   I move back to the 6S.
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:38.400]   Oh, well, that's why.
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:38.880]   6S.
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:39.440]   Yeah, no, I agree.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:41.200]   This 6, the smaller one is less.
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.560]   As much less.
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:43.840]   I didn't like the size.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:44.640]   I like that right.
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:45.680]   It's cost power.
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.680]   Give me the size so I can better battery life.
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:48.880]   So my hand is quite big enough.
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:49.920]   I can't do it all one hand.
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:53.760]   There will be, I don't know if the size of the phone will change,
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:58.640]   but there will be a 256 gig storage option and a larger battery.
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:01.360]   They did shrink the batteries very slightly for the S.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.760]   They had to fit the top-deck engine in.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:04.080]   Right.
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:04.720]   It's a generation.
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:07.840]   But they'll get that back with the headphone, right?
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:11.360]   Yeah, I keep fantasizing that there'll be a day where I cannot,
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.880]   I can skip a year and I always end up having to get the new one.
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:17.920]   Because it's just that they did it to me this year with the 3D touch.
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:19.920]   I skipped it.
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:20.960]   I skipped the 5S.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.600]   I went from the 5 to the 6.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.600]   I have yet to have been able to skip.
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.920]   And I did poo poo 256 gigabytes.
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:29.600]   I thought, oh, nobody will ever need that.
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:32.400]   Then I looked at my phone, 128 gigabyte phone.
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:33.360]   I got four gigs left.
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.600]   I thought, oh, maybe I do need that.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.360]   Yeah, again, it's strange use cases.
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:43.760]   Like my mom, she has a 64 gigabyte phone and she's used eight gigabytes on that for the last two years.
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.680]   It doesn't have any photos, video, or yes.
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:46.960]   Virgil and I are never messing and crushing questions.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:50.880]   What if they went to lighter materials instead of metal they used carbon fiber, for instance?
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.560]   They could.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.000]   So a lot of this, again, is balanced.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.360]   Like, for example, the reason they went to 7000 series aluminum in the current iPhones
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:00.720]   and the stronger screens is partially to offset everyone now pressing on their screen.
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:01.200]   Right.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.840]   And you don't want to fall and it's going to start collapsing.
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:06.480]   It's the nitwits on YouTube who bend the damn thing.
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:09.520]   Well, they started the 7000 series way before the people started bending the line.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:10.000]   All right.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.920]   And they had this feature planned out for three years.
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:13.360]   Curse you, YouTube benders.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:15.120]   That was a nice side effect.
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:19.920]   They did add weight and structural, you know,
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:24.160]   they're willing to add weight when they believe the feature set is more important than the
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:24.800]   weight that they're adding.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:27.200]   It's like when they went to retina, that added weight.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:30.000]   They're not going to try to make it thinner again, are they?
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.320]   The thinness is a side effect of reducing weight.
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:35.120]   So if they can pull material out of it and make it lighter by definition,
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:37.600]   because they don't say the little lightness on we've ever made.
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:38.960]   They always say, lightness doesn't sell.
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:40.640]   Like you talk to people what they want to understand.
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:42.080]   And Apple is not the thinnest phone.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.480]   There is tons of their phones that nobody complains about.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:44.640]   Right.
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:47.360]   I don't care about thinnness.
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:50.400]   I don't care about the thick and thicker and give me a bigger battery.
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:50.880]   Thank you.
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:53.040]   This is like, I'm not going to fall now.
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:54.560]   Just Renee just rested on something.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:55.920]   You don't have to hold it to read.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:01.040]   One hand is used to put it in something like this, then.
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:05.200]   And then there goes your, I think the only value of thinnness is that by the time you put
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:07.600]   the case on it that you want to put on, now it's not as important.
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:10.080]   Instead of it being this thick, it's just this thick.
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:14.000]   But I think I have no problem with thinnness until you find out that,
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.720]   okay, Apple, you're going to sit down.
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:19.280]   I know that I've got, we've scheduled 30 minutes for this briefing,
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:20.800]   but we're going to spend 28 of it.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:26.480]   You convincing me that the only, that the reason why the iPhone 7 does not
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:31.440]   have a headphone jack is not because you just wanted to make it thinner and begin.
[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:35.360]   Well, you can look because the jack is not the thinnest part of that phone.
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:36.400]   I think the lightning is not that.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:36.480]   Right.
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:41.680]   I'm saying it's like when you start deleting things because you could have made the thinnness.
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:42.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:44.240]   It's 3.5 as volume.
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:47.440]   It takes that jack is long and it goes significantly into the phone.
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:48.480]   So it takes up a lot of volume.
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:53.520]   As long as we're talking about rumors, let's talk about the March rumor, the March announcement rumor.
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:52:03.120]   I'm still credible that they would announce the Apple Watch 2 and a new 4-inch iPhone in March.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:07.200]   According to the interview on 60 Minutes, they've got 2 and 3.
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.000]   They're already working on them.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.600]   Remember that was one of those.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:10.160]   Did they say that?
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.360]   It's been cook said.
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:12.080]   Well, of course.
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:14.320]   The question is when they're going to, yeah, when they're going to, yeah.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.280]   That seems like the right thing.
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:15.280]   Right.
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:16.960]   I think the March events are back.
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.080]   I did wear, okay.
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:22.160]   And I, you know, as much as I've poo-pooed the Apple Watch, I also wore this the whole time.
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:25.280]   And a couple of valuable things.
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:29.680]   Watching my steps was great because I know one day in the Disney World, they had
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:31.760]   18,000 steps.
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:32.960]   I walked nine miles.
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:33.280]   Right.
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:33.760]   Wow.
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:34.480]   And that's nice.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.240]   You know, that's a nice thing to know.
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:42.080]   I used a lot for the calendar because I was trying to keep track of where we had to be
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:43.360]   when and all that stuff.
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:43.920]   That was used.
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:44.480]   That was handy.
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:46.880]   It's great for two-factor alerts when you reset everything.
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:47.120]   Yeah.
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:49.440]   Well, all right.
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.480]   Maybe a new Apple Watch.
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:54.880]   I feel like it's too soon, but if they can make a massive improvement, some significant improvement.
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:55.840]   It's not for us, Leo.
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:57.520]   It's not for people who bought the first Apple Watch.
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:59.840]   It's for people they haven't yet convinced to buy an Apple Watch.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:01.040]   It's the same as like the iPad 2.
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:02.160]   But what about us?
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:03.280]   Aren't we going to feel bad?
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.480]   You can skip generations.
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:05.840]   Like we're not normal people.
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:09.120]   Like the average person who bought an Apple Watch is happy with it for a couple of years.
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:10.960]   Otherwise people are like, it's missing this or that.
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:11.680]   I'm going to wait.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:14.400]   And then they said the Apple Watch should think, okay, this is the one I'm going to buy.
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.480]   Well, and this is specifically why I didn't buy.
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:17.280]   I bought the sport.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:21.120]   You know, it was because I was like, I know I'm going to want to keep on buying these with it,
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:23.200]   you know, because we're going to cover it in the show and I'm going to want to have it.
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:23.760]   And I'm not going to.
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:28.960]   And there was no feature difference other than I put a cover on it and I put stuff around it
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:30.080]   to keep it protected.
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:32.640]   And would you say you wanted a smaller phone?
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:33.920]   Would you go to a four inch iPhone?
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:34.880]   I might.
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:36.320]   I think it might be too small.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:38.480]   I think I'm getting too old for smaller than the what I have.
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:47.680]   But I think that this comes from a allegedly leaked roadmap from China.
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:50.960]   Mobile that mobile has no road.
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:54:00.160]   A colorful, smaller, possibly less expensive for the Asian market, maybe.
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:02.880]   Yeah, the challenges that we've associated.
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:06.240]   Like the iPhone six plus is a hundred dollars more expensive.
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:09.360]   So people assume the iPhone six minus will be a hundred dollars cheaper.
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:14.000]   And then how do you make a phone that has really modern internals and sell it for a hundred
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:14.560]   dollars cheaper?
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:15.200]   New Mac books.
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:15.600]   New Mac.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:16.640]   I would love to see a new Mac.
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:17.920]   I love my Mac book.
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:20.400]   It needs Skylake so badly that brought a chip is not.
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.080]   It would be nice to have it be faster.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:25.200]   Is it for battery life or speed that you want the new chip?
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:26.480]   Just power.
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:30.000]   Yeah, general power over efficiency because I get great battery life already.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.920]   But it's just not the core why is not powerful.
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.440]   And he's a little more.
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:36.000]   It sees my iPad pro walk buying a cries Leo.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:36.640]   Just cries.
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:41.600]   I guess you see you see a computer with a modern CPU and like this modern design.
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:46.560]   When I got my new Mac book this year, it's like I had forgotten that
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:48.880]   this model has about a 12 hour battery in it.
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:49.280]   I know.
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:52.880]   And the first when you get it when you get locked into like a mindset where
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:56.960]   I finally if I leave the house with a bag full of charged devices, I will not even have to
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.720]   care about finding a power outlet.
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:02.960]   It is it was a little bit disturbing using the original Mac book.
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:03.520]   Excuse me.
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:07.360]   The 20 I still don't know name give things names.
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:07.920]   Please.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:12.560]   If you just call it the Mac book, I have to call it the 2015 Mac book.
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:17.440]   Also, they call it the late spring 2015 Mac book.
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:22.320]   Again, I'm going to be able to speak of it or find it.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:27.120]   But when I was using that and realize that it's not that six hours is a puny amount of time,
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:29.520]   but you are used to with my iPad.
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:34.960]   I'm just used to having having infinite almost 10 hours is virtually infinite.
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:40.960]   I think when I really like is I don't know I can almost use a Chromebook for it, which I have,
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:44.640]   but I still like my some of my Mac apps and stuff like that.
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:49.920]   But for my the little Mac book that I have, I don't have anything personal on it.
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.440]   So I don't mail doesn't run.
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:52.480]   There's nothing else on it.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:56.160]   And so that becomes my real travel one like I put it in a little satchel and I don't want to,
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:59.040]   you know, I can just have it with me if I want to do something like that.
[00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:01.680]   But I don't have to because my iPad actually has enough personal stuff on it.
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:02.880]   I'm a little more sensitive to it.
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:05.520]   This one is literally like my little shuttle.
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:08.000]   If I'm going to go out and work on a coffee shop and someone steals it,
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:08.800]   you know, I'll be bummed.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:11.120]   I mean, I'm going to be upset about the thing, but I won't.
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:14.560]   What I'm mostly interested is the information on my computer.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:17.680]   You know, and the fact that it syncs up with everything else makes it really nice.
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:21.680]   I'm using Google Docs and you know, everything else, but I stay in the cloud and don't leave
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:22.640]   anything on the computer.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:24.480]   And it just makes it easier.
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:25.440]   I'm kind of a fan of the Chromebook.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:26.800]   I like the Chromebook too.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:33.360]   I don't again, for me, it's Mac apps that that I use a lot that aren't on the Chromebook,
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:34.880]   which keeps me from using the Pro.
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:36.480]   That's why I'm an amateur.
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:41.040]   I just think the Chromebooks are absolutely brilliant because it gets sued.
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:47.520]   I think if you're trying to make a PC, an actual laptop for less than $300, even less than $250,
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:51.920]   you really have to say, no, it can't be powerful enough to run Windows because that's just too
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:52.800]   much of a load for it.
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:55.600]   And so it's just such a great solution to a bunch of problems.
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:57:01.040]   Windows 10 notebooks are pretty good, but I mean, just the speed of a machine that
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:06.720]   basically has to do nothing more than, well, I was about to say then just play web pages
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:07.360]   really.
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:12.000]   But when you talk about the amount of JavaScript that web ads load,
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.560]   okay, so we're still talking about eight cores minimum, but.
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:20.800]   All right, Renee, you must have in the back of your head something amazing that Apple's
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:22.560]   going to release this year.
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:23.040]   Anything?
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:27.760]   Well, I mean, they released two new products and two new app stores last year.
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:30.400]   So I think it's not going to be new amazing stuff this year.
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:32.800]   It's going to be the year where they try to make everything they released last year.
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:33.440]   For validation.
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:34.560]   It'll be a consolidation year.
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:38.720]   Like again, like the iPhone was, well, I pod, I'm sorry, I pod was what?
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:40.640]   2001 iPhone was 2007.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:46.240]   I'm gonna predict 2010 new amazing designer watch bands.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:48.560]   Or new materials.
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:50.400]   I mean, there's titanium, there's there's platinum.
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:53.920]   There's all sorts of things that they can do once they're in the watch base and design it.
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:57.280]   Like Tommy Hill figure or Michael Kors.
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:59.280]   There's a lot of potential there.
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:04.720]   I think a Tommy Hill figure Apple watch is in your future.
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:07.440]   You say Laurent.
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:08.720]   They got the e-seller on team.
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:10.240]   Yeah, you have to figure out.
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:13.840]   We can charge more money just by sticking another logo on it.
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:14.640]   Well, they did.
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:14.640]   They did.
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:15.680]   There's no new seats.
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:17.280]   It's what they did with the tele hoyder.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:17.760]   It's funny.
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:21.920]   Well, I laughed about the the Hermes watch and then I went to Hermes,
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:24.560]   Hermes's website to your soccer.
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:25.200]   Check it.
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:28.720]   Well, no, so like the Hermes double tour, the one that Apple sells is around a thousand
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:32.320]   dollars. The Hermes double tour without an Apple watch is like 3000.
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:33.040]   What?
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:34.000]   Well, what?
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.200]   So I will talk to them.
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:36.160]   Yeah.
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:41.280]   I mean, if you want to hear somebody who puts a basically you thought it was pretty
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:44.320]   uncalled for that Apple is kicking you in the nuts until you went to the store.
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:47.040]   Actually, Hermes will kick you in the nuts three times.
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:49.440]   So that's a saving for two kicks in the nuts.
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:50.160]   It's a designer.
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:55.440]   How about how about how about at least leave such a wonderful logo in the bruise.
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:59:00.240]   I think it's time for Apple to update the MacBook Air with some influence of the MacBook.
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:01.440]   So I'd love to see type C.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:03.040]   By the way, two type C's Apple.
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:06.880]   The Air of the Pro, you know, because the Air might go away in favor of the Air will go away.
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:12.160]   And they'll eventually they'll professionalize or upgrade the MacBook to be the thin and light.
[00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:14.800]   It does seem like they don't really replace the original MacBook.
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:16.560]   This old place there.
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:20.080]   And the MacBook Pro, I think is still the 13 inch MacBook Pro, as you're saying,
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:22.400]   and he is still like fantastic machine.
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:25.760]   I mean, when you're talking about again, we get back to the difference between
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:31.680]   making devices for a subset of the people out there and having to make a device for everybody.
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:36.400]   And the 13 inch notebook that has a real keyboard that has an assortment of ports that has a big
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:41.200]   battery and has at least the possibility that you can do more stuff with it a year from now
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:42.400]   than it comes out of the box.
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:44.080]   That's still the meat and potatoes of the industry.
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:50.560]   I mean, Apple still Apple still has the old CD DVD drive MacBook with a retina screen on the
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:53.920]   priceless because people still need to have those things.
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:56.800]   And so if they're if they weren't selling them, if they weren't meeting a need,
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:58.480]   Apple would not make them anymore.
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:04.720]   So yeah, I mean, if I think that's going to take maybe another year or two for Intel to ship the
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:11.200]   right chips and the right quantities, but I think that there's a there's a red laser dot like on
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:16.480]   the swimming on the forehead of the MacBook Air that the target is in sight.
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.240]   They've just awaiting orders to pull the trigger.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:21.920]   Whizzer. I think they got to get the price down because the MacBook Air starts at 900 now and
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.760]   they need something that's at that category.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.200]   Whizzer the Mac mini.
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.840]   No, I don't think so.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:28.640]   It'll get a bump.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.600]   It'll get whatever it's said.
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:30.640]   We use a lot of Mac minis.
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:31.040]   Oh my god.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.000]   You're the only one.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:32.960]   I don't think so.
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:36.800]   So anything that you want to rack out, anything that you want to rack mouth that uses a Mac
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:41.120]   unless you really want to turn those, we have a couple of them that we unless you really want
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:45.440]   to turn the garbage cans on their side and turn it, you know, you can put I think two or three of them
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:45.760]   across.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.600]   The Mac minis are the same.
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.360]   They're selling any more garbage cans at all.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.000]   I don't know.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:50.560]   We don't use them.
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.240]   That's the sales right in the garbage.
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.920]   I don't think I think they're not good.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.320]   No, I mean, they need the new processors and they need the new they need the 5k.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:01.840]   I literally have one is it is literally now a door stop.
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:05.840]   Yeah, I don't, which is embarrassing, but I don't know what else to do with it.
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:08.640]   I'm like, don't call me and write me and say because I had it to me, Leah.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.560]   We actually had issues with performance with them.
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:11.200]   I did too.
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:16.080]   So it's like, they weren't they weren't replaced it with a 5k iMac and I couldn't be happier.
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.120]   And we replace it.
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:21.200]   We still find for online stuff like Hangouts and Skyboever, we found that the retinas were
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.200]   working better than the trash can.
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:27.680]   And so we stopped, you know, so the trash cans are used for editing, but that's that's
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:28.960]   what they're mostly used for.
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.240]   15 inch MacBook Air?
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:30.720]   No.
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:35.440]   Do you think 15 inch MacBook 14 inch MacBook 14 inch?
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:35.840]   Why not?
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:41.840]   I'm just like, just the idea of like a like make a MacBook Air super thin, but we'll also make it
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:46.800]   15 inch MacBook Air.
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:47.920]   Actually, that's what this is.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:48.320]   Isn't it?
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.080]   It almost feels like I did an air.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:53.760]   I did a screen share with my with my TV at home.
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:59.600]   And and and my daughter said, is that is that a giant iPad?
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.200]   She's just like her six year old daughter.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.240]   There's like staring at it.
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:05.440]   She's like, no, no, no, that's just my iPad on the screen.
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:06.320]   She goes, she looks at me.
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.160]   She goes, but wouldn't that be great?
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.200]   Wow.
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.400]   Wow.
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:10.960]   Wow.
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.400]   You really really watched this.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.600]   You could just go up and touch the screen.
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:13.920]   Wow.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:15.360]   They stopped.
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:17.920]   This is the first TV that they have but fingerprints all over it because they didn't
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:18.160]   understand.
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:22.000]   You know, like when they were little, I had a team they'd always hit the TV.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:22.240]   Right.
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.760]   And trying to figure out why it wasn't.
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:24.000]   That's it.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.280]   You know, daddy, why doesn't the TV do pinch and zoom?
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.640]   The touch screen is broken.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.240]   I still zoom and we just did it now.
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:30.720]   I was trying to.
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:35.920]   I was trying to zoom in on my YouTube video and Jason Klyanthus is
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.560]   pinch it.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:37.840]   No, it's YouTube.
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:39.680]   Pinch it.
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:40.000]   Zoom it.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:40.560]   You can track that.
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:46.560]   I have so many fingerprints on like the left and right sides of my MacBook right now.
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:49.040]   All because of the amount of time I spend working on my iPad.
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:53.760]   So I'm at the robot bar on this cruise ship on the anthem of the season.
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:57.280]   They have a robotic bar that mixes your drinks and you're supposed to touch.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.160]   You have a RF bracelet that the cruise gives you.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:04.800]   They call it the wow band and you're supposed to touch that to the tablet,
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:07.600]   which is, I'm sad to say not an iPad, but some cheap Android tablet.
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:10.480]   And I keep touching it with the Apple Watch thinking, why isn't this work?
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:11.680]   Why isn't this work?
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.040]   I was supposed to do it.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:13.840]   Darn it, Apple.
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:14.560]   Darn it, Apple.
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:15.360]   Well, and here's the question.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.400]   So you have an Apple Watch.
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.600]   I have an Apple Watch Andy.
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.640]   What are you using mostly?
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.960]   A Moto 360.
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:21.760]   Moto 360.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.680]   I have what I just don't wear.
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.200]   It depends on the phone you carry, right?
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:27.520]   If you carry an Android phone, you use the Moto 360.
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.160]   I'm the same way.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:30.640]   And I wear an Apple Watch when I have an Apple Watch.
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.080]   You have an Apple Watch.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:32.400]   Yes.
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.520]   Here's the big thing is that.
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:37.040]   And I, because it was a big choice for me, I had a really nice
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:40.320]   analog watch that I gave up or semi-animal.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:41.680]   I have some very nice ones.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.680]   You cost a lot of money, more than my Apple Watch.
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.200]   And I gave it up.
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.240]   And the question is, would you,
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.960]   regardless of the good and bad and everything else,
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:51.760]   would you ever go back to a regular watch from having a...
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.280]   Can't live without notifications now.
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:53.760]   I know.
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:55.440]   They've become central to my world.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.800]   It would seem so limited.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.880]   And I don't think it's telling me the time and date.
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:03:59.840]   What good is that?
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.760]   I'd brief frequent important interactions.
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:04.080]   Well, it changes the time.
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:05.520]   For me, I change a lot of time zones.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.720]   It changes the time, you know,
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:07.680]   as soon as the...
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.760]   You know, it changes that plane.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.600]   I have no expectations by the way.
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:12.480]   I forgot about that.
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.760]   That used to be a pain in the butt.
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.360]   You get off the plane and you have to go...
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.440]   Now I just notice.
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:20.880]   But there's something that I really noticed now that I've been...
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.760]   I've now had like pretty much every single device
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.640]   that will throw notifications on your wrist on my wrist.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:30.960]   And I gotta say that the simple fact that a device
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.200]   puts a notification on your wrist,
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:35.840]   that's 85% of the feature.
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:38.720]   That I appreciate that, for instance, Apple Watch,
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:41.120]   the notifications, they're cleaner, they're prettier,
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:43.520]   they have a little bit of animation about them.
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:47.760]   But that kind of appreciation for me goes away
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.760]   like after a few weeks.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:52.640]   And it's the way that the Android Wear Watch works
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:55.760]   that I appreciate more than the Apple.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:58.640]   And not only that, but if I couldn't afford to have
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:03.760]   a real smart watch, just the Garmin Vivo Smart,
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:05.920]   which you can get for $110, $111,
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.200]   which is more like a...
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:12.240]   It is even less prominent than the Microsoft band.
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:15.440]   It really does look like just a standard slim little black
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:15.920]   fitness band.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:19.600]   It just has an OLED screen that lights up very, very, very subtly.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:24.960]   Even that would be at least 65% to 70% of the...
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:29.200]   Of to me as useful as the core features of the Apple Watch.
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:33.120]   So it's not as easy as simply
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.960]   producing a device that's built 10 times better
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:38.800]   and works 10 times better.
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:40.640]   Again, you get back to the analogy,
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.640]   I keep using all the time, which is for a lot of people,
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.000]   it's a Toyota Corolla.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.520]   I put the key in, it starts,
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.440]   and once it starts and the car starts moving,
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.200]   I stop thinking about how good this car is.
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.200]   It's just there to get me to go in place to another.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.000]   And when you get people started on notifications,
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.440]   they may not really care about the digital stem.
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:01.680]   And they may not care about how it takes your pulse rates
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:04.240]   along as it takes your pulse rate and all this other sort of stuff.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:04.640]   I agree.
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.400]   I can use any...
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:07.520]   I'm just to wrap it up.
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:09.040]   I mean, I can use anything,
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:12.000]   but it really was a factor in switching back to Android
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.520]   that I actually would rather use an Android Wear Watch than Apple Watch.
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:16.160]   Yeah, not with you.
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:17.040]   That's why I have to switch back.
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:17.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:20.400]   Are you going to look at the new...
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.480]   The Moto 360 Sport comes out Wednesday.
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:24.480]   I'm going to look at it...
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.440]   Of course, there's the...
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:31.040]   There's so many things I've really admired about the Apple Watch.
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:35.040]   And one of them is that I can't believe that I really want to say...
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:37.440]   Half of what I would say about how good the Apple Watch is,
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:40.000]   is just the brilliance of that strap design.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.680]   Just the ability to...
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:42.880]   I've got the...
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.160]   Here's the beautiful leather...
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:47.520]   Legitimately beautiful leather band that came with my watch
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.600]   that didn't cost me an extra 150 bucks.
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:51.680]   But I mean, I would love to be able on a day
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:54.720]   where I know I'm going to be taking like a five or six mile walk,
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.320]   even just for that walk,
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:58.480]   just to simply swap it out with the plastic one.
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:01.520]   So I don't get this all coated with stinky andy salt.
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:04.080]   But Andy, you and I are big guys.
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:08.000]   And I think that that's one advantage the Apple Watch has at least,
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.240]   is that for smaller people and women, particularly...
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:14.080]   I can't see a lot of women wearing Moto 360 watches.
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:15.200]   They're just too clunky.
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:17.280]   Well, there is that.
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:20.800]   This is another down to what the size of a large Apple Watch.
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.000]   I've seen this on...
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.360]   No, I get the 46 millimeter.
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:24.080]   I like bigs.
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:24.800]   I'm a big guy.
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:25.280]   So...
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:25.840]   Yeah.
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:26.720]   I...
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:29.200]   This is one of the reasons why I went out and bought this,
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.080]   because I just...
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.920]   This to me is like the perfect size.
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:32.960]   It was a bit of a...
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:35.920]   I got used to the larger size of the original Moto 360,
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:39.120]   but this now just feels like a regular watch on my list.
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:42.880]   I believe it feels even more like a regular watch
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:46.160]   than the Apple Watch does, because it's just...
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.120]   Oh, it's brown?
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:48.720]   It's got more...
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:50.320]   The faces have more style.
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.600]   I'm in a similar situation now.
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:52.400]   I really...
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:54.400]   In fact, I'm looking forward to this sport version,
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.080]   because it has built-in GPS.
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:58.880]   But now because of battery life on the iPhone, I don't want to...
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:00.400]   So now I'm like, "Oh, man."
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.240]   For me, it's integration.
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:03.680]   It's with an iPhone, but it's not the same.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:05.200]   What a great problem to have.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.240]   So much choice.
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:08.080]   And so many devices that work great
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:09.360]   that you like different things about.
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:10.320]   Yeah, Dr. Mom says...
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:11.360]   I like the integration, because...
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:12.160]   Go ahead.
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.280]   I was going to say, I like the integration,
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:15.040]   because the activity on my watch,
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.640]   that I can check it on my phone as well.
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.080]   Apple Pay just shows up.
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.640]   Anything I have in wallet just shows up when I want to use it.
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:22.880]   It's not just notifications,
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:25.360]   but it's all the apps that use those notifications.
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.680]   So it just really takes my iPhone,
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:29.200]   and a little Imperial shuttle
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:31.040]   puts it on my wrist for what I need most.
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:31.680]   That's really what it is.
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:33.600]   Like the destroyer and then the shuttlecraft.
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.600]   Dr. Mom says, "As a woman,
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:38.720]   she wears the ASUS Zen watch, too,
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:42.320]   which is thin and less clunky."
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:45.360]   I like the fact that I can just...
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:46.160]   That my watch is there,
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.200]   I'm watching TV in my phone,
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:47.920]   somewhere in the house,
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:49.600]   and it rings, and I can decide whether I'm gonna...
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:51.120]   That's kind of fine, my phone or not.
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.160]   Like I can hear the phone ringing,
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:53.440]   and I'm like, no.
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:55.600]   Any smart watch is gonna do something like that, right?
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:57.360]   You can't answer,
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:00.960]   Andy, you can't answer the call on your Android Wear watch
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.000]   only on the Android Wear watch.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.040]   You can't...
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:07.200]   Android Wear does support that if it has a microphone and a speaker.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.440]   You can answer it on the phone.
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:10.720]   You can answer it on the watch.
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:12.160]   You can't use this model.
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.480]   You can't talk, have a conversation,
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:17.200]   but you can basically answer it and then...
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.560]   I can't hear you.
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:19.520]   I can't hear you.
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:21.360]   I'm talking to my watch,
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:22.400]   but I can't hear you.
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:24.560]   If you got the WeWay watch, for instance,
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:25.760]   which is also 42 more than you...
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:26.800]   That has my camera.
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:27.600]   Okay.
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:28.560]   That has a speaker and a mic,
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:29.680]   so you can do the whole thing.
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:32.560]   I think that's one advantage that Android Wear has over Apple
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.240]   is the diversity of the ecosystem.
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:38.160]   In fact, Huawei has just announced a women's version of its watch.
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.040]   That Huawei Jew...
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:41.440]   This is at CES, the Huawei Jewel and Elegant.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:42.960]   Wow.
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.880]   So...
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:45.760]   I never won a one.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:46.640]   Answer the phone on it.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:47.280]   The new...
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:49.520]   The new pink is...
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.320]   It used to be that...
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:53.600]   Oh, and we made a ladies version of this toolbox, too,
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:55.520]   and you just spray paint and paint jewels.
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:57.520]   I think the new versions, you just glue a whole bunch of fake...
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:57.920]   [chuckles]
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:58.480]   ... fake to me.
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.880]   It's a new Fitbit Blaze announced today, too,
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:02.400]   that looks like a hexagon shape.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.360]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:03.520]   Interesting.
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:05.200]   They promised, I think, a couple of days of battery life.
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:07.600]   See, a couple of days doesn't...
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:09.120]   If it's not a week...
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:09.600]   I don't...
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:10.080]   You know...
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:10.800]   Yep.
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:13.360]   Last year, LG started shipping in quantity,
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:18.320]   actual batteries that are shaped kind of like a home plate base.
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:22.960]   So now, to satisfy the market of watchmakers who don't want to make square watches.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.080]   So they do...
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:27.760]   This Blaze does look like an Apple Watch, I have to do it.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:30.800]   And the CEO, I think, was trash-locking Apple when he introduced it.
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:33.760]   Yeah, that doesn't work.
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:36.000]   It was always a mistake.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:42.080]   It is $200, which is certainly an aggressive price point.
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:45.520]   Fitbit has been as successful in the band market, at least.
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:46.240]   Yeah.
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:46.640]   Have they?
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.080]   They have a variety of bands.
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:49.760]   Well, they've been selling the Fitbit bands pretty well.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:50.720]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:51.440]   Yeah, the fitness bands.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:54.080]   Yeah, they're the number one fitness product out there.
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.800]   Not only that, but they'll probably get a lot of people who are stepping up from their...
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:01.280]   They'll move their Fitbit from their right wrist to their left wrist.
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.080]   Right.
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:04.640]   I just like doing this competition because it makes everybody better.
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.760]   Is this Android Wear?
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:06.240]   Do we know?
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:07.120]   Or is it...
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:08.320]   I think it's Fitbit.
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:08.960]   It's just Fitbit.
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:09.840]   It's Fitbit OS.
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:11.200]   Huh.
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:15.840]   Connected GPS, color touchscreen, on-screen workouts.
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:17.040]   Multi-SQ.
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.040]   GPS I'd like in the next Apple Watch because I think we do...
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:19.840]   That would be a lot of...
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:21.920]   Stand-alone GPS would be nice, yeah.
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:22.160]   Yeah.
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:27.360]   Although I suspect that that's a battery killer and probably doesn't really get used all that much.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:31.200]   Well, could be like the heart rate monitor where it's only ramped up if you specifically
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.320]   need it for some sort of...
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:32.480]   Right.
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:35.200]   Like the way the iPhone 3G sort of tries to manage it is which is a good...
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.480]   Well, this integrates with FitStar.
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:37.440]   That's interesting.
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:40.480]   A lot of people have just so many different needs that they really don't...
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.960]   As great and ambitious as the Apple Watch is,
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:47.520]   if they don't use those features or if they...
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:49.200]   It just doesn't speak to them.
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.320]   I mean, I was a little bit surprised.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:54.400]   Obama was on the Comedies and Cars getting coffee last week.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:57.840]   And well, the point of view, the perspective of inside the car,
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.920]   you could see him prominently wearing a Fitbit surge...
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:00.880]   Oh, really?
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.160]   ...on his wrist.
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:02.960]   Oh, really?
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:04.400]   And I would think that...
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.560]   I've seen some really fancy analog watches.
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:09.600]   I imagine this is what he wears around the White House because they don't let him...
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:12.320]   I'm sure they don't let him wear it like off the crowns.
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:16.720]   How many steps do I take between the residential quarters in the Oval Office?
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:17.520]   Yeah.
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:18.720]   Or what's my heart?
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:20.560]   Pacing my heart rate while talking to...
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:21.520]   Puting?
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:22.560]   Puting.
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:22.880]   Yeah.
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.560]   Mr. President.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:25.120]   Order the house.
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:25.680]   Take a breath.
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:28.560]   Now this blaze is very interesting.
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:29.520]   I think I might...
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:31.280]   When did they say when it would be available?
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:36.880]   Comes in black, blue, or purple, but that's just the band.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:42.480]   Yeah, this looks good.
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:46.720]   Ships in March, it says, $199.
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:51.040]   And I presume it works with an iPhone or an Android device.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.080]   I would guess.
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.520]   And it says it does notifications.
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:56.640]   Smart notifications.
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:59.440]   See, call and text notifications and calendar alerts on display.
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:02.960]   Auto sleep tracking, sound alarms, five-day battery life.
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:03.920]   Hmm.
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:05.200]   So it's the best thing to track.
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:06.880]   I think this is the greatest thing in the world.
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:07.280]   Absolutely.
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:07.520]   You know?
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:10.560]   Now I think Apple will do a watch too.
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:15.040]   Well, I think this is an area I think that they have to iterate quickly.
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:16.560]   You know, they're going to do something,
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:17.920]   they're going to learn, they're going to do another one.
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:20.640]   I wouldn't be surprised if we saw one every spring and fall for a while
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:21.920]   while they make sure that,
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:23.200]   because I think that otherwise they fall behind.
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:23.520]   This is...
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:25.040]   Good special industry is moving quickly.
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:25.360]   It's for Chinese New Year.
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:27.920]   Well, the quasi announced that today,
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:29.680]   it's going to have special rose gold.
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:34.000]   Sorry, special gold in red Apple watches for Hong Kong, Singapore, China.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.920]   Google announced a new Nexus 6P in gold.
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:39.440]   And I guess we've got to...
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:40.480]   The markets are changing,
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:42.720]   but it's interesting because the Apple watches such a different product.
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:43.920]   The iPhone and iPad,
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:47.280]   famously they were tablets and phones for 10 years before they made those.
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:50.560]   And this Apple didn't watch the experimentation phase, they entered it.
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:54.160]   And it's unusual to see Apple sort of experimenting along with everybody else.
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:14:02.080]   If it is doing bands of leather and link bands and so forth,
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:03.680]   as an additional cost,
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:04.960]   this is a pretty...
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:07.120]   This is the market leader in fitness.
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:09.920]   And it makes sense that they would do something.
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:11.280]   Now I'm going to be challenged.
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.160]   I don't know what to get.
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.800]   You have to do a lot of energy with the phone.
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:15.600]   I got two wrists.
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:18.720]   You can have three watches per wrist, that's six watches easy.
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:21.920]   Okay, let's take a break.
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:24.880]   While I buy stuff,
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:28.560]   our show today brought to you by Squarespace.
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:29.440]   Love Squarespace.
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:30.720]   In fact, I just set up...
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.960]   I used the new cover page feature relatively new.
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:34.080]   It's been out probably for a year.
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:38.800]   New to me to make my leoville.com site.
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.720]   Really be kind of a great place.
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:43.120]   You know, have a great welcoming portal.
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:44.640]   You can just do the cover page.
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:45.520]   There it is.
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:46.560]   It's a slide show.
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:49.280]   It's a wedding picture, pictures of me with various hosts and stuff.
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:53.360]   And so you can do just the cover page.
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:56.640]   But then it also links into my blog and my photos and my calendar.
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:59.040]   I haven't really gotten done too much with that yet.
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:01.120]   But I really feel like this is a great...
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:02.240]   There's me and Catherine Hall.
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:07.360]   It's a lovely way to create a presence for yourself on the web.
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:09.440]   And I have to underscore this and I'm a big believer.
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:12.480]   You can have a presence on social media.
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:16.000]   You can have your LinkedIn profile and your Facebook and your Twitter profile.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.800]   You have to have your own website as an individual,
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.400]   but especially as a business.
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.400]   Because that's what you own.
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:22.960]   That's yours.
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:24.640]   That's something no one can take away from you.
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:27.280]   And the Squarespace is the best place to go to make that website.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:28.480]   Very affordable.
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:30.960]   You also get a free domain name of your choice.
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:33.280]   So you can have your businesses, name.com or whatever.
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:37.360]   Squarespace also, by the way, will give you a 10% discount.
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.360]   I'll tell you how to do that when you use our offer code MACBRAKE.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:42.560]   But the best way to do this is to go to squarespace.com
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:44.400]   and press that Start Now button.
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:44.960]   That'll give you...
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:46.480]   Without you, you don't need to give them a credit card,
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:47.520]   any personal information at all.
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:49.280]   Just give you two weeks to just try it.
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:53.760]   And pick a template, customize it, make it feel like your site.
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:56.000]   These are despite the fact they start with templates.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.440]   I almost hate to say that because...
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:02.320]   I think people think of the old way of doing it.
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:05.040]   These other sites where you had this generator site generator.
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.880]   Every site looked the same, not with Squarespace.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.400]   Every site is unique.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.120]   Well, look at mine.
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:11.840]   It was all done pretty much out of the box.
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:15.600]   And the reason is, Squarespace kind of honors your aesthetic.
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.680]   And it makes it very easy for you.
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:19.120]   Now, of course, if you really want to get geeky,
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:22.560]   there are hundreds of settings, fonts, colors, page configurations.
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.480]   They do online typefaces.
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:26.320]   So you can choose beautiful typefaces.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.960]   And every site will look unique very quickly.
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:30.960]   If you're a developer, they have a developer platform
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:33.520]   that lets you modify the CSS and the JavaScript and everything.
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:38.240]   But you're starting with a template that is literally state of the art.
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:40.880]   As good as it gets professional designers,
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:43.440]   professional engineers making it as good as it gets.
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:45.840]   It's responsive, so it looks great on all screens.
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:50.640]   It's got e-commerce built into each and every site.
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:52.400]   They've got great 24/7 support.
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.480]   They have advanced plans for growing businesses.
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:56.160]   They have basic plans for somebody like me.
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:56.960]   Just wants a blog.
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:01.520]   Whether you're a musician, a restaurant, if you're getting married,
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:05.360]   if you're having a baby, get started at squarespace.com.
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:06.000]   Cost you nothing.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.160]   You don't even need to give them a credit card to try it for you for two weeks.
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:12.160]   You can even import data from your existing site to really feel like what this is,
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:14.240]   what my new site's going to look like.
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:14.880]   And here's the deal.
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:18.480]   If you decide to buy, you'll get 10% off whatever you buy
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:20.240]   if you use the off-code Mac break.
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:21.520]   So get a year or two.
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:24.720]   Get everything, you know, pump stock up and you'll get 10% off.
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:26.080]   Squarespace.
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.680]   I love them.
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:32.480]   Build it beautiful squarespace.com.
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:36.960]   Alex Lindsey from the Picsacore is in studio.
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.240]   Always nice to see you.
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:43.120]   Also with us Renee Ritchie and Montreal from iMourg.com.
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:49.920]   Andi Anaco in New England from Chicago Sun Times.
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:51.120]   We're talking about Apple.
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:53.360]   Apple Tech.
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:58.320]   I guess I could go over these court cases fast.
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:17:59.200]   There's a bunch of them.
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:00.880]   Complete victory for Apple.
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:02.640]   There was a class action lawsuit.
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:09.360]   Somebody sued saying iMessage was rigged, not to deliver texts to Android phones.
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:12.400]   And any of us who have been using Android phones, who have used an iPhone
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:15.680]   or moved to Android from iPhone, have experienced this problem.
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:21.760]   Apple actually had to create a page, a site, so that you could delink in all of that.
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:28.880]   However, the lawsuit claimed the company wire taps Android users by intercepting then
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:34.560]   stalling texts sent from iPhones to Android phones.
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:38.400]   The judge just summarily dismissed the case.
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.240]   There's two piles on Tim Cook's desk.
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:41.920]   The message comes in, he just leaves it in the pile.
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:42.960]   He doesn't move to that second pile.
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:44.800]   Let me see if I can find the...
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:50.320]   The judge said, "Please stop smoking what you were smoking and then we will move on."
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:55.840]   Also, the plaintiff would have had a hell of a time trying to prove the case that,
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:58.720]   "No, it's not because iMessage is fundamentally borked."
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:01.920]   I'm saying specifically there's a reason why messages weren't getting through.
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:06.800]   One sentence decision from the judge.
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.080]   Part of the problem was that...
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.880]   The judge reached over the giant clown hammer, just blocked the lawyer in the head with the...
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:16.720]   The problem came from the fact that two of the three plaintiffs had actually
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:20.640]   got rid of their iPhones only after they sued Apple.
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:24.800]   Then one of them asked to be dismissed as a name plaintiff.
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:26.560]   He didn't have her mind.
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:30.720]   Because he realized how stupid it was, and he didn't want her name connected to it.
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:35.360]   Originally, she claimed her husband traded in her old iPhone and buying her a new Android.
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:39.200]   Then they went back and fat out, "No, that's not the case and that's just the whole thing was a mess."
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:44.320]   It was buggy. Apple did create a page to solve this problem.
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:50.960]   I still get calls from people saying, "I've switched to Android and I...
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:53.600]   Messages and working messages doesn't work well with Android."
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:55.360]   But I think that one of the most important things,
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:20:00.080]   well, one of the more important facts of this issue is that iMessage is kind of borked.
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.040]   It is.
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:01.920]   The thing is that...
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:03.040]   There's so merit to this.
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:06.560]   There's a handful of people that I text because they haven't responded to something else.
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:09.200]   But I used to use iMessages all the time.
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:11.760]   In fact, when I had someone with an Android, when it came up green, you're like,
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:16.640]   "I think the problem is as Apple is almost encouraging people to use
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.880]   Facebook Messenger or some other solution."
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:22.800]   Because I use a mixture of Hangouts and Messenger and Telegram and Slack.
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:27.040]   Those are for different people and different social worlds.
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.440]   Those are most of my communications.
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:32.000]   And then with my mom, I use iMessages with my wife.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:32.880]   I use iMessages.
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:33.600]   That's about it.
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:36.560]   Would Apple ever really make iMessage a cross-platform solution?
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:38.880]   Hangouts works on both iPhones and Android.
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:40.000]   It's not in their best interest.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.920]   It locks people into Apple's platform.
[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:42.960]   It's kind of.
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.720]   But what it does is it's killing the product.
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:47.200]   I mean, because of the side effect.
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.440]   I get the thought process, but it's not working.
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:53.120]   If you just use iMessages, if you don't have a lot of people who use Android or other phones,
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:54.080]   then it works fine.
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:56.880]   The biggest problem with iMessage is that the security model,
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:58.560]   I don't know if it wasn't well thought out or not,
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:02.320]   but when you start switching between people using their Apple ID,
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.560]   for example, from an iPad, which is just an email address,
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:07.120]   their phone number, and maybe another phone number,
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:09.920]   the system they use to try to prove authentication
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:12.480]   and maintain privacy gets all messed up because
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:15.040]   it doesn't want to tell me it's Leo until it gets to my device,
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:17.120]   checks my address book, makes sure it's Leo,
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:20.240]   puts it on there, but then we're in group conversations in Leo switching
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:23.200]   to his Android phone, his iPhone, and his iPad,
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:26.400]   and it's trying to figure out so then it spawns alternate conversations.
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:29.200]   And that I think is a side effect of trying to be too clever
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.200]   for your own good sometimes.
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:32.800]   Apple is just not great at this.
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:37.680]   The problem with iMessage has always been that just, as Renee says,
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:41.360]   it tries to be clever and say, "Oh, let me figure out where you are
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:43.040]   and make sure it gets routed appropriately."
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:46.160]   When if you're just stupid and say, "Here are the...
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:50.400]   my owner has said there are four devices that he or she has,
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:52.240]   I'm just going to ping all of them,
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:54.400]   and if they don't want to get messages on the iPad,
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:56.720]   then they're free to simply turn that off on the iPad."
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:59.760]   Well, and one of the interesting things that I think is interesting about WhatsApp
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:05.680]   is that, is which I use in Africa mostly, or is my complaint with it,
[01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:09.200]   of course, is that it's not attached to a specific operating system,
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:10.880]   but it is attached to a specific phone,
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:14.320]   which is why I don't use it very often, except when I'm there.
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:18.720]   But it, from my understanding, as you're typing,
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:21.040]   it sends all that data over to their phone,
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:24.320]   and then it unlocks it when you say go, or deletes it when you say stop.
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:26.160]   So it's already out as you're typing,
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:30.080]   and it makes it feel much more responsive than almost all the other ones,
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:33.840]   because it's not sitting there like you hit the send and you don't know if it actually sent.
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:35.840]   As soon as you finish typing, it's just...
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:36.400]   Sorry?
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:40.400]   It was trying to simulate a Blackberry experience cross-platform,
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:43.280]   and they had, so they made it work very much like a Blackberry,
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:45.600]   and you used to see people typing, and the message would just appear.
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:48.560]   But it doesn't, it's not appearing for them until you hit go,
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:50.720]   but it's, so the message isn't appearing as you're typing,
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:53.520]   but it is getting it over to the phone,
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:56.080]   so as soon as you hit go, it immediately appears.
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:57.520]   What I loved was the WebOS model,
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:59.360]   where it basically, I forget the name for it,
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:00.800]   but they basically applied filters.
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:02.400]   They would just take all your stuff in,
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:05.040]   they would know exactly where you were on every service,
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:06.880]   and then they would provide a filter for you,
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:07.920]   so you'd see all that stuff.
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:09.120]   It was all handled in the background,
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:11.600]   so the end user didn't have to care what device you were using.
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:14.240]   That was almost like a layer before the presentation layer,
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:16.800]   and I'm hoping my message can move to something like that,
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.320]   where it just picks the stuff up,
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:19.760]   handles it, and then shows it to you,
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:22.080]   and you don't have to worry about what device you're on or where it's going.
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:25.680]   Is there any recommended setting for our messages that'll make it work better?
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:27.920]   Like, should I turn on send as SMS?
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:30.880]   Is that the backup?
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:31.440]   Yep.
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:34.000]   You don't want to have it always send as SMS, because then number one is...
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:34.880]   Well, it says when I'm...
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:36.400]   The setting is says...
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:39.120]   Sent as SMS when iMessage is unavailable.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:40.800]   Yeah, and I always have that on.
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:42.480]   I would leave it as sent as SMS, right?
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:43.040]   Yeah.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:44.400]   I'm Apple Watch ahead of...
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:46.480]   I'm Apple Watch.
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.720]   After the first major fail, I just said,
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:51.920]   "Do not use iMessage, send everything as an SMS."
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:53.840]   And then...
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:57.920]   The problem you get into is all the limitations of SMS over...
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:01.440]   When you use iMessage, you're used to a lot of things that you can send.
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:06.080]   Like, yeah, I don't care about being able to send a voice message through...
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:08.640]   I want the message to actually arrive.
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:11.120]   Well, when I'm running...
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:15.600]   It's just as simple as when someone is waiting for me for a breakfast meeting,
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:18.720]   and I've hit construction traffic, I'm going to be 15 minutes late,
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:22.880]   I don't want the message to go to their Mac back in their office 25 miles away.
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:26.000]   I'm hoping that it'll go to the phone that's on the table,
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000]   where they're waiting for me and wondering why I'm late.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.440]   That's the other big problem is because it will show you read,
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:36.480]   or receive, sorry, delivered, if any device attached to that account registers the message.
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:37.520]   Well, I didn't know that.
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:40.800]   If your iPad at home says, "Okay, we got this," it just shows us delivered,
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:44.080]   and you're like, "Oh, they got it," and it may not necessarily mean it to the phone.
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:48.640]   And there's all these little things that, again, the model that they're using becomes...
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:53.440]   And also, because they believe in privacy, they don't want to keep it on their servers,
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:56.160]   it'll try to deliver for, I think, it's 10 to 14 days.
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:57.600]   And then the message just goes away.
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:00.880]   And you've turned on the phone, that message doesn't exist anymore, so you won't get it.
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:04.000]   See, I'm more and more using Facebook Messenger.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.920]   I almost don't even want to admit it, but most of the people, almost everybody...
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:11.520]   I mean, I would say, I don't know if friends have Android or iPhone,
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:13.200]   but I know who's on Facebook and who's not.
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:17.040]   Most everybody I want to talk to is on Facebook.
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:19.280]   I find that I don't really want to expose my phone number or my email.
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:19.680]   Yeah.
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:22.320]   So my whole thing is that the iMessage becomes less interesting.
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:25.200]   Plus, I could send animated GIFs, and I really love that.
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:26.720]   And stickers.
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:30.960]   Stickers were big, but with Telegram.
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:34.080]   But now that I've discovered the fact that I can type in the...
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:40.560]   I can select GIF, and then type in a word, and we'll find an animated GIF that matches.
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:43.440]   And then send that animated GIF.
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:45.360]   That is awesome.
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:49.200]   One of the biggest problems with all this, too, is unlike email, it's not a standard system.
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:52.000]   So if someone in one of your Asian friends is using line,
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.520]   someone in China is using WeChat, someone else is using WhatsApp,
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:56.320]   someone else is using Facebook.
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:57.440]   None of you can talk to each other.
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:01.600]   You all have to have this sort of communal agreement that will stick on this service.
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:04.320]   So everyone ends up having five or six services they have to use.
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:07.040]   That's almost my whole front page services.
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:08.160]   Yeah, who I'm talking to.
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:08.160]   Me too.
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:10.000]   I have a message as messaging folder.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.040]   Yeah.
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:11.600]   Yeah.
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:15.520]   And if there's one feature that I count on for my watch,
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:18.960]   it's not just notifications, it's just the one place I can look to see
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:21.280]   where everybody who has tried to send me a private message...
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:23.120]   You have to have it done.
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:23.600]   Yes.
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:26.480]   Between Twitter and Hangouts and text messages.
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:28.240]   And now Slack.
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:31.280]   Now I'm working with two people who want to use Slack for everything.
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:32.240]   I'm like, "Yeah."
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:32.240]   Yeah.
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:35.520]   That's the word that's in email.
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:39.040]   This is how it used to be with instant messaging.
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:43.200]   Remember, was AM or was MSN or was ICQ and then they federated?
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:44.320]   It used to be this way with email.
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:48.080]   You guys are too young, maybe, to remember that when you had MCI mail,
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:50.960]   you couldn't mail somebody who was on genie.
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:52.000]   What cop you served?
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:52.400]   Yeah.
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:53.840]   They had to be on the same service.
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:55.200]   This is...
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:55.760]   We're in...
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:58.560]   We just repeat it over and over and over.
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:26:59.680]   Primitive Stone Age.
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:00.400]   I mean, messaging.
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.240]   I mean, Facebook's almost becoming AOL again.
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:05.280]   That's why, by the way, Facebook's going to win because that's the most...
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:08.560]   That's the lingua franca, the lowest common denominator.
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:09.760]   And I think it's going to win on this.
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:10.240]   It's just going to be...
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:11.520]   And they own WhatsApp too.
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:13.680]   And they own WhatsApp and then they haven't federated the two,
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:15.840]   which is strange, but I'm sure they will at some point.
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:17.520]   Well, their whole thing is attention.
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:18.560]   They want you to have...
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:21.120]   It's almost like when you can't have that best buy in future shop,
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:23.200]   we're built across each other even though it's the same owner,
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:24.320]   because you get upset with best buy,
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:26.000]   you go to future shop, they still win.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:26.800]   Monopoly.
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:28.000]   And you don't even know it.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:28.320]   No.
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:28.800]   Yeah.
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:30.160]   You don't even know it.
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:32.000]   I just wish I weren't still so...
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.920]   I'm skeaved up by Facebook enough that I don't want to use them for...
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:37.840]   I want to use them as little as possible.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:40.000]   And I actually had recently think,
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:46.400]   "Okay, are you really that skeaved up by Facebook that you're willing to alienate
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:49.440]   all of your friends and family that only use Facebook
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:51.760]   to post pictures and make announcements?"
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:54.400]   And I decided that in the end, after a lot of thought,
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:58.960]   I don't really want to alienate myself from all of my friends and family members.
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:27:59.600]   Quite that bad.
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:02.800]   But then you see those articles about how they try to see if they can experiment on you
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:04.400]   and make your timeline sadder.
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:06.800]   And they just wander all over again with their use words.
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:10.000]   And they experimented with outages to see how...
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.360]   If they pulled the plug on your Facebook, would you come back?
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:13.520]   Like...
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:16.800]   It's just the...
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:17.680]   Again, it's...
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:20.720]   As someone who's a fan of Google, I know it sounds stupid, but it's like...
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:24.240]   I just don't like the data suck.
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:27.680]   And every time it keeps my profile, it keeps telling me,
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:30.240]   "But your profile is only 38% finished.
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:31.840]   Won't you tell us where you went to college here?
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:34.480]   We made four guesses, but where you went to college?"
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:37.040]   Just point to the one that is where you went to college.
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:40.800]   Every time they guess wrong, all four guesses, I'm like,
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:44.800]   "Today, I go out and get waffles because today was a wonderful day."
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:47.680]   That's what it was called. It was called Synergy in WebOS.
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:50.080]   It would just take all your accounts and show you a unified view of them.
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:52.000]   And I would just love someone to take that idea.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.040]   Black-eyed is that too. They have that.
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:54.080]   They have the hub now, yeah.
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:55.520]   Which I really hate.
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:59.200]   Because it's a mishmash of stuff.
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:00.640]   It's not done yet.
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:02.640]   So that's not the answer either. It's tough.
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:06.320]   I think the answer is that one company has a total at utter monopoly.
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:09.840]   The Google book.
[01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:11.120]   The Google. The Google book.
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:14.720]   Apple has to pay 318 million euros.
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:17.760]   After an Italian tax fraud investigation.
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:19.360]   I don't even want to read this story.
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:21.200]   Okay, fine.
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:25.520]   Apple faces $5 million lawsuit over and get this.
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:30.080]   Allegedly slowing down the iPhone 4s with iOS 9.
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:31.120]   Nonsense.
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:33.520]   You put out iOS 9 and now I have-
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:34.480]   The coolest things.
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:35.280]   I think this is why.
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:38.560]   One of the coolest things Apple did a couple of years ago is they made their performance
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:40.880]   team members carry around the oldest version of the iPhone.
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:42.480]   So that they would be forced to-
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:45.120]   They already cared about it because their moms had those phones.
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:46.240]   Their dads had those phones.
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:49.520]   But now they have those phones and they're not going to live with slow phones.
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:55.360]   Well, and I will say that my 6s is much faster than my 6 Plus.
[01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:59.600]   I notice it's much more responsive.
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:03.120]   So definitely it's asking for more than the new hardware is built for it.
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:04.080]   But there's less.
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:05.920]   I don't know why the two phones are so much different.
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:07.040]   But the other thing is-
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:09.040]   One of the big things that the stories-
[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:12.560]   One of these stories that was that people search for the word iPhone slow.
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:14.480]   Almost every year when the new iPhone comes out.
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:15.920]   And that doesn't happen with Android.
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:18.560]   But they don't say that Android phones come out all different times during the year.
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:21.920]   There's not one time a year when every new Android phone comes out or you know,
[01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:23.280]   Android operating system comes out.
[01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:25.120]   It's the same volume as there.
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:26.560]   It's just spread out over every month.
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:28.400]   I'm truly frustrated that the more you shake it,
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:29.760]   it doesn't seem to go any faster.
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:30.560]   I do this.
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:31.200]   Put it under your eyes.
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:32.320]   Did you get out and push Alex?
[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:36.240]   Yeah, I go and I shake it and I shake it and I hit it again and it doesn't work.
[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:37.040]   Watch this video.
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:39.920]   Tell me what is happening in this video.
[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:41.920]   That is a parrot bebop throne.
[01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:43.120]   Apparently he's using the force.
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:44.400]   He's using the force to-
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:48.880]   steer the bebop drone.
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:54.000]   This is a company that has made an Apple Watch app
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:59.840]   that uses the accelerometer in the Apple Watch to sense your arm movements and steer your drone.
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:04.320]   There was a story today about this Firo BB-8 having a Firo BB-8 watch that would use
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:06.320]   four gestures to control the robot.
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:06.720]   Of this.
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:11.520]   I can't wait till I can do Tai Chi and the drone will follow me.
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:13.920]   It is cool.
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:15.680]   It makes you feel like you have the force.
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:19.840]   Yeah, I'll still crash it because you should have named it something that sounds like better.
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:22.720]   How the consent of your sister's hair.
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:27.680]   And they've apparently clapped on clap off.
[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:28.880]   So that's nice.
[01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:31.600]   He's changing the color with the skin.
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:34.960]   He's scrolling out the letter R to turn it to red.
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:35.760]   He's spelling it.
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:36.880]   That's interesting.
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:37.680]   That's interesting.
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:38.800]   So these are Chinese.
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:39.920]   It's like a large range.
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:43.520]   By the Horry host of Horry host.
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:47.040]   The question is, will that ever become second nature to the wearer?
[01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:48.960]   As opposed to taking out a-
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:51.280]   as opposed to simply saying H-Lomo.
[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:53.120]   gestures are challenging.
[01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:55.920]   Abstract gestures are hard to remember.
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:32:00.000]   Basic gestures like up down left right and there's very, very few of those are really easy to remember.
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.720]   When you start getting into it, again, it's like incantations with sorcery.
[01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:06.720]   You've got to carefully memorize the right one to affect the world around you.
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:08.240]   You love moving my hand around.
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:10.240]   We're all going to have to go to wizard schools.
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:15.520]   You know, the thing is, is that it depends on as this progresses, you know, there was this
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:19.440]   thing that we that actually almost ended my career in visual effects.
[01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:22.320]   Called marking menus in Maya.
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:25.840]   And you would just, you know, you'd flick your wrist and you just constantly be
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:28.080]   being able to do and you learn how to do that very quickly.
[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:29.760]   Like you don't even have to look look down.
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:32.640]   I think that as these get better and more responsive and they don't,
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:34.240]   you aren't spending so much time trying to figure it out.
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:36.480]   I think people will use them a lot in both professional and
[01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:41.360]   more in professional settings than recreational because you're doing the same thing over and
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:42.560]   over again and you need it to work.
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:47.600]   They're applying for a patent for this poorly named software.
[01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:48.400]   It's called DONG.
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:54.240]   But they do point out that there are issues, for instance, it kills the battery life of the
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:55.280]   watch about 20 minutes.
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:33:00.080]   Your watch will actually run out of juice faster than your drone does.
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:03.200]   But I think it's, you know, it's a technology demo.
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:04.000]   It's not yet a pro.
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:04.640]   Another watch.
[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:05.280]   Another watch.
[01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:06.160]   I need to.
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:08.800]   You need your, I need my drone watch and I need my regular.
[01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:09.440]   They watch.
[01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:10.000]   They watch.
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:18.560]   We mentioned the iPhone 7 when I have a headphone jack that rumor can persist
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:20.400]   and now the supply chain is confirming it.
[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:22.800]   So starting to believe, I'm starting to believe.
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:23.360]   It's only a matter of time.
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:24.480]   Yeah, starting to believe.
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:27.760]   Okay.
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:28.800]   Everybody agrees now.
[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:34.960]   I think that as wonderful as the new Apple TV is, there is a fundamental flaw,
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:42.160]   which is that the, it says, I can't watch a movie without rewinding it four times by accident.
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:44.080]   Not only that, there's no snap back.
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:46.240]   Like it doesn't really snap back to where you were.
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:46.480]   Yeah.
[01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:48.080]   Like it's an accident that'll snap back.
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:48.880]   What?
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:50.160]   Press the menu button.
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:50.400]   It'll snap back.
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:52.880]   The remote is way too sensitive.
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:58.960]   I actually have to now take it and put it somewhere away from me because I've stopped the
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:00.480]   motion. I've rewound it.
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:03.040]   And you don't, at first, the first time, a few times it happens, you go, what the hell?
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:03.280]   What?
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:03.600]   What?
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:04.160]   What?
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:05.440]   And you're sitting on the remote.
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:07.840]   So now you have to very carefully put the remote.
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:08.800]   Yeah.
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:10.400]   You get used to it.
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:14.320]   I'm not as annoyed as I was the first weekend, but it's still a month or two later.
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:15.280]   It's still in annoyance.
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:16.880]   And if you have cats, you're screwed.
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:19.840]   It also does something kind of weird.
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:20.160]   Okay.
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:22.640]   It loses the, I have a temporarily,
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:24.160]   a paired with a Bluetooth speaker.
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:30.560]   And when it loses the, it drops the connection to the Bluetooth speaker periodically,
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:33.920]   which is annoying.
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:37.520]   I'm trying to figure out whether this is Apple's fault or the design of the speaker's fault.
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:40.160]   I don't know whether this, whether the speaker is going into Rest Mode.
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:45.040]   This probably what it is, but I'll just for a humorous sake, I will simply explain that
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:52.080]   I will fall asleep watching a movie on Apple TV and then wake up like once, if I'm in a deep
[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:57.120]   sleep, it'll wake me up like once every 10 minutes because the connection will get restarted.
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:01.120]   And my speaker has this really lovely like professional announcer's voice.
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:06.320]   It says, soulmate is connected and loud and lots of face.
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:10.880]   They wake up, they go fall back to sleep because I'm not enough.
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:14.000]   Then pick me so it's so, so, so, it's connected.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.040]   It's trying to tell you something, Andrew.
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:21.040]   You're so many is out there waiting somewhere.
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:24.640]   I think I should probably, it's working well enough now that you're probably upgraded to an
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:27.280]   actual like set up with real speakers and stuff.
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:28.400]   I do like it a lot.
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:33.840]   I mean, I got the, I had a tweet about this the other day because like,
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:39.280]   I've set it up for the default, so it downloads new screen savers only once a month.
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:41.840]   And when there's a new screen saver, you're like, oh boy, new screen saver.
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:44.800]   Let's, I was going to watch something on Hulu, but let's just watch this.
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:48.240]   Oh, look, we're flying over Tokyo now.
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:48.640]   Hey.
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:52.960]   Well, yeah, I, I just need more apps for it.
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:55.440]   That's all, no matter how bad it is, you know, the old, I've, you know,
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:57.840]   of course, the old remote will work with the new Apple TV.
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:03.280]   And if you, I know in the article, he said that it got worse.
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:04.080]   It's, it did not.
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:07.200]   If you actually take the old one and try to use it, it makes me crazy now.
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:10.960]   Like it is much slower to use the old remote with the new Apple TV.
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:13.840]   So it's, but the remote app is really the way to go.
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:15.760]   My biggest pain point is still apps.
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:17.440]   Like if you were Andy, tell me a great app.
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:20.800]   I just have no way of getting it without going to the search and trying to type in the name and
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:21.440]   looking for it.
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:25.600]   I really hope if Apple does one thing this year, it's to make purchasing apps cross
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:26.880]   platform and cross device.
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:29.360]   So no matter what device is, I can go there, I can see the app.
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:30.320]   I can say buy it.
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:33.040]   The next time on that device, just pop up something and say, do you want to confirm this
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:33.920]   previous purchase?
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:35.920]   I'll say yes, and I'll have my app.
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:38.800]   That way, if I'm out on my iPhone and see a great Mac app, I can buy it.
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:41.120]   If I'm on my iPhone and I see an Apple TV app, I can buy it.
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:42.640]   It just would make my life so much easier.
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:45.840]   Well, and I, I am surprised at how many things on a big screen,
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:50.880]   you just, your brain changes mode, some kind of beta mode, and you start doing things like I,
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:52.800]   I've downloaded just to see what Zillow looked like.
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:57.280]   And before I knew it, I had spent like 45 minutes like wandering through houses.
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:58.000]   I know it's amazing.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.760]   I was like, well, Carly, what's it going to house?
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:03.360]   And so I was like, it's great.
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:03.920]   It's great.
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:04.640]   The shopping stuff.
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:05.680]   Realture.com.
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:06.720]   Dot com is more today.
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:07.520]   Do they have an app though?
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:08.160]   Yeah.
[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:09.680]   They have an app on the Apple TV.
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:10.080]   Yeah.
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:10.480]   Okay.
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:11.520]   Oh, on the Apple TV.
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:12.880]   That's what I was with.
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:14.880]   No, I was in on the Apple TV.
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:17.760]   Like, oh, look at the nice browsing experience.
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:18.160]   Yeah.
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:21.840]   You, you, the biggest thing you realize on any of these on your Apple,
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:26.160]   whether it's an Apple TV or iPhone, is that you cannot get anything actually useful for
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:28.400]   less than a million dollars in, in the same, in the same, in the same, in the same,
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:30.640]   I mean, you know, it's just like, you're just like, whoa.
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:33.120]   So it's the perfect app for app for any Apple consumer.
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:33.520]   Exactly.
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:34.080]   It's impressive.
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:34.640]   It's impressive.
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:36.800]   They just don't show anything less than a million dollars.
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:38.160]   I'm just looking for something.
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:42.480]   I don't, I don't want to put my, my little trial files and,
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:44.720]   and a, a, a, a college dorm.
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:47.680]   Well, just buy him a little crap hole that you can live in.
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:49.280]   Period.
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:50.480]   We're not getting any kind of a million dollars.
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:52.320]   How many people do that, by the way?
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:57.040]   I just want to point out, I was shocked to learn when my son went to see you bolder,
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:59.120]   that that's one of the things parents did.
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:37:59.360]   What?
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:00.400]   They buy houses.
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:02.560]   Oh, I had a, so I had a friend who bought one in Berkeley.
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:04.640]   Um, her dad bought one in Berkeley.
[01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:05.520]   You make money.
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:07.360]   Resister, or she had two sisters.
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:09.840]   By the time they got through it, paid sort of the house,
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:13.920]   they paid for all the education and gave them some money to start their company.
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:14.880]   Those days were gone.
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:16.960]   It was like, yeah, it was, well, it was right at the right time.
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:18.000]   It just turned by accident.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:18.800]   It turned by the right time.
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:21.440]   Hey, here's what I want, but it's, you're going to have to go to GitHub and
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:22.960]   sideload it for your Apple TV.
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:28.640]   This is a article Andrew Cunningham wrote, uh, uh, on ARS Technica.
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:30.640]   How to put a game emulator?
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:31.120]   Yep.
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:34.000]   Uh, you can't obviously, Apple's not putting this in the store,
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:39.200]   but there's one called provenance, uh, which emulates the NES, the Super NES,
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:42.560]   Sega, Sega Genesis, Sega CD, Game Boy and Game Boy Advance.
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:43.520]   Wouldn't that be awesome?
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:46.000]   We all are using our own ROMs.
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:46.320]   Of course.
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:47.200]   So it's perfectly fine.
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:47.680]   Yes.
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:49.600]   Oh, only use your own ROMs.
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:50.960]   Yes.
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:53.920]   But yeah, no, it's a terrific piece of saying.
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:55.520]   It's saying in the article that it's saying the article that some of the
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:57.600]   main stuff was actually already available.
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:00.960]   Uh, there is a main emulator.
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:04.000]   He says it's, Andrew says it's not being up to kept up to date.
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:04.640]   Here's the main.
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:07.040]   I just need to play star, I mean, uh, space invaders.
[01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:09.600]   Oh, somebody's playing that Donkey Kong, look at that.
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:10.240]   That's on me.
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:11.680]   That's nice.
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:12.880]   And that's on an Apple TV.
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:13.600]   Yeah.
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:15.200]   So you have to sideload these apps?
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:15.840]   Is that the way you get them?
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:20.000]   Yeah, you download the GitHub repository and then you just open up X code and you sign it
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.680]   and you load it on.
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:23.040]   So it's not that hard.
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:25.680]   No, I mean, you just need a little bit of technical skill, but not much.
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:27.760]   And the graphics are going to be a huge for my son.
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:30.240]   The graphics are going to be a huge step up from Minecraft.
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:32.080]   Isn't that funny?
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:35.280]   Or at least they'll look familiar when he's playing JavaScript.
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:36.000]   Oh, look, yeah.
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:36.800]   Oh, I know.
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:37.680]   I'm a big bit.
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:38.640]   I love that resolution.
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:39.040]   It's cool.
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:39.520]   That's cool.
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:41.440]   That's 16 bit.
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:43.920]   Okay, I'm going to do this.
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:45.040]   This sounds worthwhile.
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:45.840]   I'm not that hard.
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:46.400]   I'm doing it.
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:48.080]   I just saw the article in the notes.
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:49.280]   So I didn't have time to do it before.
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:49.680]   Yeah.
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:51.120]   But I'm definitely doing this week.
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:52.880]   This would be a good maybe a little how to.
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:54.640]   I could film, uh, film us doing this.
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:55.520]   So it's not that hard.
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:56.640]   Have you done it, Renee?
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:00.640]   No, I played around with it when the Apple TV first came out because they had it hooked up to
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:04.880]   X code anyway to do all the screenshots and the one that Andrew says he recommends
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:06.080]   is called Providence.
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:06.640]   Yes.
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:07.680]   It's free.
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:09.280]   James Addie-Man.
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:13.440]   .com and the instructions are you're right.
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:16.320]   They're fairly straightforward and the trick is getting ROMs.
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:17.760]   He even describes, you know.
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:22.880]   I'm just really bummed up because I once spent like a bunch of years ago,
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:27.840]   a lot of time laboriously pulling the ROMs out of my collection of classic arcade cabinets
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:30.160]   and dumping doing a ROM dump.
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:31.120]   Thank goodness you did that.
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:32.480]   It was very forward thinking.
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:36.080]   And unfortunately, I don't know where I must have like not transferred it to.
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:37.280]   Did you actually do that?
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:40.800]   If we're recording this being broadcast, yes.
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:41.120]   Yes.
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:42.160]   I got like 40 arcade.
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:44.000]   Yes, me too.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.760]   Put him in a foot of an e-prom flash.
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:46.800]   We all did that.
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:49.440]   And I don't know where I don't know where it is.
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:54.880]   And now I'm not sure I know how to where to go to where I stored all of those original arcade
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:57.120]   games so I could go reflash those ROMs again.
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:40:57.440]   Yes.
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:59.120]   And that's why I haven't been able to use main for it.
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:02.240]   You know, it's okay if you play these games as long as you give you just take a
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:05.360]   quarter every time and you put it right on the table.
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:06.160]   Put it on the table.
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:09.200]   So long as you feel bad about it, I think.
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:11.040]   I really all that Namco can expect.
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:14.880]   I would be really happy if I get my Apple TV to go.
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:18.480]   I would just love them to make a service like Netflix.
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:21.440]   They have just a catalog of old games that the companies are not getting very much
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:22.560]   for anymore either.
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:23.520]   Well, there's a lot.
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:25.760]   There's good old games.
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:28.240]   They need a good old games for arcade machines, basically.
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:28.560]   Yes.
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:31.760]   And archive.org has some like the JavaScript emulators that are.
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:32.160]   Yeah.
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:33.920]   Keeping really great old games alive.
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:40.080]   But there's something there's something about the original version of like a Tapper or
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:40.720]   Dig Dug.
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:41.120]   I agree.
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:43.040]   It hasn't been changed for PC at all.
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:46.880]   It is exactly what it was like in that Kindle Pen bowling alley in suburban Boston.
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:47.600]   Yeah.
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:53.360]   There's a market there somewhere a building like rebuilding just the controller for each game.
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:56.640]   So you could like pull a different controller over and it would be like the real one that's
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:58.000]   really hard to emulate is Tempest.
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:02.240]   Because it was a big ball.
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:03.520]   You know, there's.
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:05.040]   Tell me my childhood back to me.
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:06.560]   Please take my money.
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:08.240]   There's celebration.
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:11.360]   There's like three or four of them that if they made them like $40 each,
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:12.880]   I'd probably buy a couple of them.
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:13.120]   Yeah.
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:19.360]   And Bluetooth connected to my Apple TV and I can play asteroids with the actual whatever or you know.
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:20.720]   Some companies have done that with Xbox.
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:26.160]   Unfortunately, the one company has done it with Xbox one, but it's all European console game or
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:27.600]   which I never played.
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:28.720]   You're thinking that.
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:31.040]   But apparently very popular.
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:31.520]   Right.
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:34.160]   And it's like, you know, pay 20 bucks and you get 40 games.
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:35.120]   Right.
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:36.800]   But I don't want to generalize one.
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:38.560]   I want I want me.
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:39.040]   I want you.
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:39.840]   Well, I want to buy.
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:43.680]   But the thing is I want to buy a can for that feels like the.
[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:44.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:45.280]   You know, we have those.
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:45.920]   We have those.
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:47.840]   We built some, you know, that's just.
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:49.040]   In fact, we're going to have the new screen.
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:54.400]   Say, Jason Howells building a main cabinet and we're going to do that on the next couple
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:58.000]   episodes. I think Jason's going to be showing us his main cabinet.
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:02.000]   One of my favorite guy English articles was the desire for Nintendo to make made for
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:05.040]   iPhone controllers. And that way, Nintendo is still making hardware when you're holding
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:07.600]   your hand, it's still Nintendo and they come with bundled apps.
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:10.000]   They like once you buy the controller, you can download the apps for them.
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:10.320]   Right.
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:13.840]   And that way they have the reach of Apple's platform, but they're still making physical
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:15.280]   hardware that feels like Nintendo.
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:18.320]   There is celebration tonight in Cupertino.
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:22.400]   Marques Brownlee has switched back to Final Cut Pro 10.
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:24.480]   Or switch for the.
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:24.880]   I'm shocked.
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:25.840]   I'm shocked.
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:29.360]   It's like the, it's like the special edition update to the end of Return the Jedi.
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:31.280]   We're celebrations and chorus.
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:32.000]   That's everywhere else.
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:32.480]   Exactly.
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:34.400]   They'll be dancing tonight among the Ewoks.
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:35.200]   What do you plan on?
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:38.400]   MKBHD used to use Adobe Premiere Pro.
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:40.480]   He never used Final Cut.
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:41.280]   He's not switching back.
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:42.080]   He's switching to.
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:43.040]   I don't know.
[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:45.840]   It sounded like the tweets made it sound like he was switching to, but I might be wrong.
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:51.520]   So he tweets, I switched to Final Cut Pro 10 and I like it.
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:55.760]   I don't think anyone can tell which video was the first to FCPX edit.
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:57.760]   He will.
[01:43:57.760 --> 01:43:58.560]   For the kind of stuff.
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:43:59.120]   Fast.
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:03.760]   I mean, the bottom line is, I mean, we can talk a lot about whether Avid or Premiere or other
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:07.520]   things are better or worse because they all have their advantages and disadvantages.
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:10.160]   We're actually using Premiere for a handful of things.
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:13.920]   And then we use Final Cut for 90% of what we do because mostly what we want to do is turn
[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:15.360]   around, turn things around quickly.
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:20.320]   And there isn't, you really can't have that conversation about whether they're even or not.
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:25.120]   The speed at which you can edit once you understand how to use Final Cut and the speed of the export
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:30.800]   is twice as fast as that's what he says is that the export and it means you can also use Final Cut
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:34.080]   on a lower end, like a MacBook.
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:36.000]   I mean, it exports on my retina.
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.840]   Like, like it's almost like magic.
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:39.520]   But like I'm not even sure like I'm not.
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:41.600]   Did it really export that whole one hour?
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.200]   I mean, it just it's crazy.
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:45.280]   And it says rendering real time rendering.
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:46.960]   It was real time rendering 4K.
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:48.320]   You know, it'll handle the pro.
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:49.760]   You know, it'll do all of those things.
[01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:54.480]   And again, it's just it's and you just say send to I used to be very superstitious and not do it.
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:58.480]   But now you just send a compressor and then compressor has your thing and it and compressor
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:44:59.680]   is so fast.
[01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:02.560]   I mean, is it as easy now to use as iMovie?
[01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:03.920]   I mean, is it similar to that?
[01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:05.680]   It's harder than iMovie.
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:09.520]   But if you if you start an iMovie, then it's the it's just the perfect upgrade.
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:09.520]   Right.
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:14.640]   You know, that's what that's what we really aimed at was the the biggest video app in the world is
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:16.560]   iMovie because that's right ships on every computer.
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:19.440]   And then and how do you make that that integration easier?
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:23.520]   It's a lot easier for someone to go from iMovie to Final Cut 10 than it was to, you know,
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:24.880]   to go to Final Cut 7.
[01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:26.640]   Oh, here's good news.
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:27.520]   Apparently I own it.
[01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:29.440]   There you go.
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:29.680]   It was funny.
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:30.160]   Last C.
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:30.480]   Yes.
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:34.800]   We did a three camera shoot for an interview with Callie Lewis and they just gave it to me at the end.
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:36.320]   And a friend of mine was there Martin Reich.
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:39.040]   In five minutes, he showed me how to do a three camera edit.
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:39.280]   Wow.
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:39.760]   Final Cut.
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:43.600]   And I did it and we rendered it and about 45 minutes later, we had the completed video.
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:47.360]   That was always one of the nice features you could switch in post so you could have three
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:50.560]   ISO cameras and then and do this and do the switching later.
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:51.360]   And I'd never done that.
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:51.760]   I had no idea.
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:52.240]   That's nice.
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:53.600]   Yeah, that's a nice feature.
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:55.440]   We're telling Leo when we did that first video.
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:58.720]   Oh yeah, you just do multi-cam in Final Cut 7 and I had never done it.
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:45:59.440]   And then you tried it.
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:00.240]   Well, I spent all night.
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:00.960]   I got it done.
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:01.680]   You got done.
[01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:03.440]   You got it done.
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:07.280]   This just automatically aligned everything based on the sound and yeah, it was terrific.
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:08.560]   No, it's screaming fast.
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:11.760]   I mean, that's the big thing is that it's just it's super optimized for Mac.
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:12.720]   Yeah, it's really nice.
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:16.960]   Don't keep saying this because we switched from Final Cut to Premiere and all our editors
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:20.400]   are now using Premiere on Dell PCs and they're going to go get mad at me.
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:22.880]   Final Cut 7 to Premiere is a big upgrade.
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:26.720]   Final Cut but Final Cut, I mean, if you're doing it fast, sorry guys.
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:28.000]   It's only 300 bucks too.
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:32.880]   Apparently at some point in my history, I bought it because it just says install.
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:36.800]   It's not only 300 bucks, they have never charged for an upgrade.
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:38.480]   Yeah, so that's nice.
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:39.920]   So I can just install this.
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:40.560]   Maybe I will.
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:42.000]   Put on my MacBook and see what it's like.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.720]   It's just across the board.
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:49.520]   I was surprised that I cut a couple of videos on the iPad Pro when I movie
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:51.520]   just to as part of my workout for it.
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:54.800]   But now I actually prefer to cut videos on iPad Pro.
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:56.640]   It's just the tactile nature of it.
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:58.000]   That big screen makes it work.
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.560]   I haven't done it and I should play with it.
[01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:01.360]   And what do you do?
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:02.400]   It's sandy.
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:03.280]   Just eye movie.
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:04.160]   Eye movie.
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:07.200]   Just the ability that I'm not using.
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:10.720]   I'm not going like this and keeping my eye out someplace else.
[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:13.360]   But I'm just saying, okay, I want that to be cut there.
[01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:15.280]   And I want this clip to go in there.
[01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:17.120]   And now I want this to be more of a pause.
[01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:23.840]   And it's like, it gets me into an editing fugue quicker and more deeply than
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:28.320]   than on Final Cut as much as I love and I love Final Cut.
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:30.000]   Alright.
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:33.840]   Srenity has been using that and she's been using Pinnacle, which is either used to be
[01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:36.160]   a avid studio for both of them.
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:37.280]   She said it just fantastic.
[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:37.680]   Thanks.
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:40.160]   I kind of stopped editing video.
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:41.280]   Maybe I should start again.
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:44.000]   Nope.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:44.720]   Not going to do it.
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:47.360]   Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to take a break.
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:49.120]   We're going to come back with your picks of the week.
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:51.840]   So you better enter them in because Jason Clanthus is waiting.
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:52.320]   Oh no.
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:54.720]   I entered mine and I was a good boy.
[01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:58.880]   I'll tell you, I got to pick for you right now, Audible.com.
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:00.320]   Are you yet an Audible listener?
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:01.360]   I love Audible.
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:02.400]   I've been listening.
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:07.840]   I had, I put this aside for a while and I've been listening to the new Neil Stevenson 7 Eves.
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:10.640]   And it has some of the appeal that Martian did.
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:13.520]   If you like the Martian, the idea of, you know, here's the problem.
[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:18.480]   How do we solve this using science and you like space science?
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:22.320]   I think you really like seven Eves, Stevenson's newest.
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:28.160]   I don't think it's a spoiler to say that the problem is that the earth is about to be destroyed.
[01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:29.200]   You got two years.
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:32.160]   You got some people in space and they're going to try to save as many people as they can.
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:33.280]   How do they use science to do it?
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:36.000]   I love Neil Stevenson.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.360]   He's one of my favorite novelists.
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:41.200]   He's, I wasn't crazy about Reem D, but I think he's back on a form with seven Eves.
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:44.000]   And it's good hard science science fiction.
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.160]   What are you, what are you been listening to Andy lately?
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:48.800]   Actually, this is, this is inspired.
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:54.320]   There's a book that I read in paper like five years ago and then it was on sale on,
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:56.800]   on Kindle and that I, that's when I realized that, oh,
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:00.080]   longitude is available on Audible, which is one of my favorite science.
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:01.040]   Oh, I read it too.
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:01.440]   Love it.
[01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:03.760]   It's this was without spoiling it for anybody.
[01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:05.120]   There's a nonfiction book.
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:11.120]   It's about a, what you can only refer to as a moonshot project and science in the 1700s,
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:15.760]   which was to figure out a way that a ship at sea could calculate longitude.
[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:19.600]   And everybody figured, and the people who were working on this for centuries,
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:21.600]   because otherwise you can't navigate.
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:26.080]   And so everyone was trying to figure out, well, if we just have better ways of measuring
[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:28.480]   the stars, we can calculate it from there.
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:31.840]   And the solution came that this guy came up with was, well, what if,
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:35.680]   this would be easy if we could, if there was some damn way to make a clock work
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:37.840]   and be, keep accurate time on a ship.
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:41.360]   And so he solved the problem of how do we make a clock that will keep,
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:45.520]   if we set it correctly, when it leaves the port, will maintain that correct time
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:48.480]   at sea and it absolutely changed everything.
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:52.080]   And the story of how this was developed and there is the, the, the fact that governments
[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:56.160]   were really, we had set up these, these X prizes for solving the problem.
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:50:02.080]   And also like what, what the, the formality of doing science and doing engineering in the 1700s
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:06.880]   start to finish. It's just one of those wonderful stories that, as an afterthought,
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:09.200]   you're like, Oh, I forgot. This wasn't, this isn't a novel.
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:10.640]   All of this just actually happened.
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:12.000]   Oh, even better.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:15.040]   And apparently Neil Armstrong.
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:19.600]   Yep. I didn't, that's, that's what got me, that's what got me to spend one of my credits on this one.
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:25.680]   I did not know that Neil Armstrong himself actually like recorded, wrote and recorded the forward to
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:31.040]   this. And he tells this, and he tells this wonderful story about how he's Neil freaking
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:36.080]   Armstrong. And if he's, if, if like you're, you're the curator of a museum and like,
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:41.920]   hi, well, you're the first, you're the first person to ever walk on, on, on, on a planet.
[01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:46.880]   And he's refined. Oh my God. You're the curator who gets to actually touch the very first clock
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:53.040]   that was made for longitude. You're all so nice. Isn't that neat? It's, it was a, it was a tough,
[01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:56.320]   it was a tough problem to solve because they could calculate latitude by shooting the sun.
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:51:02.880]   Right. So they knew where they were, uh, latitude wise, horizontally, but they had no idea where
[01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:09.120]   they were vertically. And so they just had to do by dead reckoning until, until an accurate
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:12.640]   clock was made. It was just a, it's a wonderful book. I agree with you. It's not very long.
[01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:17.680]   Four hours and 20 minutes is they have on the sample is Neil Armstrong on the sample.
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:24.400]   Clocks seem to be slightly smaller and had similar, but somewhat different mechanisms.
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:29.760]   The final Harrison clock and reputedly the best performance. Okay. No spoilers, Neil.
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:37.040]   You know, Neil, uh, great choice. So here's, why are we talking about this? Because, uh, first of
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:41.920]   all, we want to audible. Uh, and secondly, uh, because we've got to free book for you. And so
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:47.360]   I'll give you one more, uh, that I just started reading Marie Kondo. Do you know who she is?
[01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:56.640]   She is now changing the world. One clutter at a time. She has written a book called the life
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:52:02.320]   changing magic of tidying up the Japanese art of decluttering and organizing and mock this,
[01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:09.040]   though you may. Oh no, I love it. It's awesome. I love, I love the idea of make it like a form
[01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:15.520]   of formalized. It is. It is like Zen. It's Zen. And, uh, she's, this book was written about a year
[01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:18.880]   ago and is now taking the world by storm and I almost bought it and then I thought, Oh, wait a
[01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:22.080]   minute, I can get it on audible. And that's one of the great things about audible. When you see a
[01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:25.520]   book that's in the, in the bestseller list or whatever, you almost always can listen on audible.
[01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:29.040]   And here's things. Wow, you're cleaning and decluttering. You can be listening to it.
[01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:34.640]   You can be doing the con marine system. No, no, I almost said that when we were talking about the
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:39.920]   length of the longitude book at four hours and something, for me, that's the perfect book length
[01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:44.560]   for getting a cleaning project done from start to finish as in perfect pulling the furnace because
[01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:49.280]   because you want, you don't want to stop listening to the story. And so that will get well, okay,
[01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:53.280]   I did clean all the countertops, but you know what, I didn't scrub down. I didn't take all the
[01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:57.920]   appliances out and scrub down. And then by the time you get to the end of like a Neil Gaiman's,
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:01.920]   like a young adults book, you're like, what if I were to pull the furniture to the center of the
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:05.600]   room, scrub down the baseboards? Because I've never scrubbed the baseboards in a couple of years.
[01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:09.280]   This is where an Amazon Echo is great because the Echo will read you your book.
[01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:13.280]   Yeah. I like that a lot. What I can't believe is they actually have cliff notes for books.
[01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:17.600]   Oh yeah. Like they have the book or get the cliff notes. You can basically get, that takes
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:22.800]   all the fun out of it. Well, 15 minutes summary and analysis of life changing magic. You know,
[01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:26.880]   you could do that or you could read the book, but you could do them both that audible. Get the first
[01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:33.600]   book free when you go to audible.com/macbreak. We're big fans, obviously 180,000 titles,
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:38.080]   all kinds of literature science fiction. They're really good, but also nonfiction. I
[01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:43.040]   listen to a lot of history and even college lectures, they've got the great courses as well.
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:47.200]   And I'm learning French or relearning it or polishing it up a little bit. They've got the
[01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:53.840]   Pimsler series and others. I'm doing the Collins series and it's all in audible. Try it today.
[01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:58.320]   audible.com/macbreak. Your first book is free.
[01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:05.840]   Let's get our picks of the week. Andy and I go. Let's start with you.
[01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:12.960]   I've been trying to solve a problem since I got the iPad Pro, which is we've talked about the
[01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:18.720]   goodness and the badness of this design. And amongst the badness is I, it's 100 bucks and I
[01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:22.160]   know it's really hard. I have two of them now, but I'm terrified of like breaking one and then
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:27.200]   trying to figure out how to replace it. And so I just don't have a good solution for carrying it
[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:31.040]   from one place to another. It is exactly my problem with it. My number one, because
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:35.920]   if you have a clip, it doesn't have a clip. And also you're worried about like, so I've got like,
[01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:40.640]   you know, pencil slots in my laptop case. But I'm worried about like the tips getting bruised
[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:49.360]   stuff like that. Okay, so let me let me show you what this is. Bobo. This is a box.
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:57.040]   No, this is a case for little for little kids. And so you take the chopstick out.
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:08.400]   The size of this chopstick is exactly the length coincidence. I think not. And so now you put this
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:13.520]   inside the chopstick. It's so much studying. We decided the perfect and it is completely
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:19.520]   protected after much. So late. And so now this goes into your laptop bag.
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:23.440]   It won't get broken. It won't get bent. The only the only improvement I'm going to make it
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:27.760]   rattles around a little bit. So the only improvement I'm going to make is that I have some I have
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:34.240]   some Sugru that sort of like polymer rubber that air cures. So when that arrives, I'm going to
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:39.120]   basically line the bottom of this with Sugru and mold it to this and then take it out and let it
[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:42.960]   cure. And then it will be like, well, no, but the thing is, Andy, if you send me the link of that
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:47.360]   one, I'll buy that one and then I'll print an insert and send it to you. That's the other thing
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:50.640]   I was going to do. I did put the put the link in the in the notes.
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:56.400]   But and yeah, so that's going to be that's going to be version number two. I only thought of I only
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:02.480]   started solving this problem like like last week. And a friend of mine, Trish, who's a professional
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:08.400]   artist, she's a colorist who works at works for works, things for DC Comics was the person who
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:11.920]   introduced me to the concept of what if you get a chopstick case because she has to carry
[01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:16.640]   art tools everywhere too. So I have to I have to credit Trish. I have another idea that I'm
[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:21.360]   working on. I ordered the components for, but I did decide that if this I have I have a better I
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:25.280]   ordered like three or four of them. This was just like the first one to arrive. I did decide this
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:31.520]   this works so well that I decided that the one that I like most and I do have a Bots maru one coming.
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:38.160]   I would make I would I would 3d print an insert for it to make it perfect, but it's like or I buy
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:44.000]   a second apple pencil and you'll never want for chopsticks again. Two Z's. That's that's a good
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.640]   point actually. But but for God's sakes, were you gonna find a second apple pencil? That's a good
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:53.120]   question. And if you do have two, it's like it's like the president and the vice president on the
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:58.240]   same airplane. You don't want to risk losing both of them. What by the way is the story with the
[01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:03.440]   apple pencil? The last rumor I heard is that they changed the material and the tip very light very
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:08.480]   late in the production run to something that was sturdier but also less scratch prone. And
[01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:12.960]   that material has proven very hard to manufacture. Oh great. I heard I heard that we had something
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:18.480]   to do with yields where they can make a lot of them but not not as many of them. It is anytime that
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:23.360]   Apple every time Apple from every now and then Apple does something that's brand new and it's not
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:27.680]   just making a new version of the old thing. It's like they have to invent a brand new process for
[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:32.240]   doing the thing they want to do. And for that first release, they're gonna have to toss out a whole
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:37.520]   bunch that aren't gonna actually work out. I credit your rumor though because they were gonna send
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:43.200]   sell kits of five tips, five different style tips which they never have yet. So that makes sense
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:47.440]   that the tips might be the difficult thing for them to do. And you do of course when you buy a
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:51.920]   pencil get two tips. Yeah, it's a material apparently though. Like Andy said, the yield is not great on
[01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:56.080]   it. What is the material? Is it silicone? It's some space age Apple something or something.
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:58:00.480]   Yeah, we decided not to use the obvious. I'm hoping that's the first that one that's the first
[01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:05.280]   upgrade if they have a replaceable tip that maybe trades off a little bit of accuracy to make it
[01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:10.320]   softer so that you can take notes during a meeting and you're not always going tap tap tap tap tap.
[01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:14.080]   I'd also like to have just a little bit more bite. You know, just well, that's one of the
[01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:18.080]   things that pencil the tip kit will do right is they have different right yeah because I just
[01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:22.400]   want a little more bite than it has. It would feel really like a pencil. Yeah, it was a similar
[01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:25.920]   with the Apple Watch when it first shipped it's a rumor has it one of the suppliers for
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:30.320]   taptic engines couldn't make enough and the or some of them were bad and they had to get rid of a lot
[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:34.320]   and the bands also some of the leather they sourced was hard to get. So it's whenever they try new
[01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:39.440]   materials is always a high cost for it. But this is a good solution for now and it only costs this
[01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:43.360]   one this one I got on Amazon it costs like eight bucks. Yeah, we showed the link. That's right.
[01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:50.480]   And you do get and you do get free set of pokey sticks with it. So if you have if you have like a
[01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:59.280]   younger sister or an older sister. Hello. You don't have to leave my favorite my favorite seat in the
[01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:05.600]   living room. If you don't mind poking you. Mr. Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:13.200]   I have two one is more of a generalized pick and that is one password. I use one password if you
[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:17.440]   use last pass that's fine. But I always like to take the new year to go through and do a security
[01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:21.920]   audit and the apps make it easier than ever. They'll show you weak passwords duplicate passwords
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:26.720]   passwords you haven't changed in a long time. They'll let you know if a password if a service that
[01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:32.080]   you're using is had a compromise in recent in the recent past. So you can go in and change your
[01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:37.280]   password. If you haven't set up to that to factor a lot of them now support two factors so you can
[01:59:37.280 --> 01:59:42.800]   do it more easily. So just generally going through and using one of these apps and whether it's one
[01:59:42.800 --> 01:59:47.680]   password or last password ever you prefer and making sure you're you're as secure as possible
[01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:52.240]   going into the new year because it's only going to get you know more difficult out there.
[01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:57.600]   And the second one is something really cool that Griffin technology announced today at CES.
[01:59:57.600 --> 02:00:01.200]   And that's sort of for people who really miss the MagSafe adapter. I'm getting this.
[02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:06.320]   On the on the on the Macbook because the Macbook has USB-C. Yeah Griffin makes this great little
[02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:11.680]   two-part clip where it's I mean it's not exactly the same because it's not internal to the device
[02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:16.000]   but you basically have the USB-C part that goes into the computer then there's a MagSafe at the
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:21.440]   other end of the cable and it'll break off you know I think about a centimeter off from the
[02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:25.280]   outside of the computer and that way if someone snags the line or hits the line
[02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:29.360]   while you're using it while charging it it'll just come up the cable will basically split into
[02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:35.280]   and your computer won't get traversed across the scenery. That's tipping sometime in the near future.
[02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:39.360]   Griffin is just such a font of clever ideas. I like them a lot.
[02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:42.080]   They had so many press releases today so many. It was amazing.
[02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:47.840]   All the way to old stuff. Were there lots of press releases Renee? I wouldn't know because I set
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:52.000]   my computer on fire before CE. I don't check email during CE this week.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:57.120]   Mine was supposed to go. We have a team of people who were doing just CES this year and the
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:01:02.560]   press releases still all came to me. So I have support sent ice. Yeah Alex Lindsay. Go ahead.
[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:08.000]   I was just I was just going to say that at least in the old days when they sent printed press releases
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:11.440]   you know it was 10 it was eight degrees last night. I would least have fueled I could burn
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:16.320]   these emails and the ones I don't need are actually useless. I didn't have to go this year it feels
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:21.680]   strange. It's in here. It feels great doesn't it? But it's the first time you realize that
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:27.680]   so much of humanity suffering is self-inflicted and you can just choose to not self-inflict the
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:33.200]   suffering. It's like it's like what are these wings behind did I always have these was I always
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:38.480]   able to fly and the first year I didn't go to CES it's like everything turned out great.
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:43.120]   Yeah. I was healthy. This is I have sleep. I think the first time five years I haven't gone
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:47.360]   and I was really yeah it was just too much. I got a big event next week and I just was like.
[02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:51.840]   I don't this is the one of the one of the one of the years and they happened from time to
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:56.160]   where I don't feel like I'm gonna miss anything. I'm important. I just I don't there I can't imagine
[02:01:56.160 --> 02:01:59.680]   any big announcements at CES. I like playing with all the little things and thinking about where
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:03.040]   it's gonna go and everything else. I will admit I missed that but it was just it was kind of
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:09.280]   crazy. There was one announcement Ford announced that they are the 26 17. Is that right? Yeah
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:15.600]   27. You're in the 2017 next year's car model year from Ford will support CarPlay as well as
[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:20.080]   Android. I feel like only kind of though because they have their own four days of its own. They
[02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:23.360]   have their own and you'll be able to talk to it with the Amazon Echo. It's not Microsoft and
[02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:26.400]   better anymore right? That's the big thing. That's right. They went to Q and X I think like
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:30.960]   everybody else. I'm so scared for Q and X because you know by very still not doing that well and Q
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:36.160]   and X is so important to some of the industries. Well it could be their business but I do I'm kind
[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:40.160]   of in the market. I'm trying to figure out what I buy a new car. Me too. My lease runs that in
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:45.920]   September. I'm thinking about it and I realized that my two things that I have to have is CarPlay
[02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:51.360]   has to be there because I'm not close. It has to be well developed part of it everything else
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:55.280]   and the second thing is that I have to be able to plug it in. I mean I don't want to be totally
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:58.560]   like I'm with you. I'm plugging but those are the two things. That's what we got solar panels
[02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:02.400]   and everything else is all you know I'll figure everything else. We got solar panels so I could
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:06.800]   buy an electric car. I really want a sticker. Why does Alex Lindsay support CarPlay?
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:12.720]   What? Why doesn't Tesla support CarPlay? He doesn't like Apple does he? I think he doesn't. He says
[02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:18.320]   the people the Tesla engineers who went to Apple were all the losers. I told you would say after
[02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:23.840]   they all left. Alex Lindsay you're pick of the week. So I follow a six year cycle. Okay. Since I
[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:28.960]   was 16. Okay. That I'm trying to kill the cycle but I haven't killed it yet but this I'm just
[02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:35.280]   going to go back into the cycle. Since we're 17. 16 years old. Wow. That I gain weight and then I go
[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:41.520]   okay. I've seen you do that. That was the last cycle. So now I'm at that six year. I go again
[02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:46.000]   and I'm like okay enough. And you saw what I did last time. It was amazing. So mind boggling.
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:51.920]   So I'm really what hit me was traveling and not being and not being able to get to a gym because
[02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:57.520]   I'm so gym driven since I was 16. I would go to the gym and work out and I'm very.
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:00.640]   All that. Yeah. I did some pity and I mean but what I'm really good at is you give me a bunch
[02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:04.240]   of free weights and I just know what to do with him. I earned it. He'll throw it over. And so I
[02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:09.600]   decided that had to be broken because I travel too much. Like that's why I'm not good at like a
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:14.880]   very slow metabolism. I could last a long time. You know if you didn't give me food. But I'm not
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:18.880]   so I'm not good at just not eating enough food. I don't eat a ton. I just don't I just gain weight
[02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:23.840]   easily. Anyway so I need so I decided I'm gonna do something that's a workout and I found an app.
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:27.920]   Of course it has to have an app because there's an app for that had to be an app for that. And so
[02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:31.600]   so the app that I'm gonna try and we'll see how effective is I'm either gonna be a great
[02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:39.360]   ad or I'm gonna be a Kirstie Allie and I don't know you know with but the the app that I got that
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:48.080]   I'm actually pretty excited about now is called results results by runtastic and so yeah fantastic
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:53.040]   though the good thing about them they work with everything they really have I that sounds good to
[02:04:53.040 --> 02:05:01.360]   me. Yeah so so anyway and so anyway so it's it's all body weight stuff and I will warn you that
[02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:05.520]   that if you decide to do it so I paid and I just paid the year head what what's really cool about
[02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:10.560]   this is that they have great videos so for every piece of your workout it plays a little it shows
[02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:13.280]   you a little video that shows you exactly how you're supposed to be doing this from your
[02:05:13.280 --> 02:05:19.840]   different angles and work and and so the and so it and it's cool and it's got you know it works really
[02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:25.760]   well the the test I will say took me a week to recover from so you know I I play hard I play
[02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:30.320]   by tend to play hard like literally I couldn't walk I couldn't walk right for like a week so be
[02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:35.120]   careful of the test don't be discouraged once you take the test because the workout is not nearly as
[02:05:35.120 --> 02:05:39.840]   hard as the test but the test is a test but what's really fun is my so my son is you know is following
[02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:43.680]   my footsteps as far as getting a little overweight and so the two of us are now doing it together in
[02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:47.680]   the morning cute so the two of us put up a little iPhone and the two of us do our workout together
[02:05:47.680 --> 02:05:52.960]   and and because I don't know as the workout 10 well it's just started but it's 10 minutes right
[02:05:52.960 --> 02:05:57.920]   so high intensity yeah and I'm sweating up a storm when I'm done and I you know it's like 15
[02:05:57.920 --> 02:06:03.360]   minutes with this with they have like a warm up and then they do the workout and it's I'm sure it's
[02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:13.120]   short and easy because I you know because the way I tested so um so the oh yeah but um but it's uh
[02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:19.680]   but I really like it I mean I think that uh um it's uh it's it's again what I like is being able
[02:06:19.680 --> 02:06:23.760]   to watch it and you know there's gonna be the next generation of this will be like in 3D and
[02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:28.560]   you can spin it around on your TV and I can't wait for an Apple TV version of this um but because
[02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:34.560]   I happen to work out near the TV but um really easy to be you know kind of pushing through it and
[02:06:34.560 --> 02:06:40.160]   so on so forth it'll take me all year to make a dent but um but in addition to you know doing
[02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:45.840]   better about eating I'm gonna start doing this and so um any other one to look at is Fit Start
[02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:50.480]   Tony Gonzales's Fit Start having that was bought by Fitbit and that's why it works right
[02:06:50.480 --> 02:06:56.640]   Fitbit Watch uh that's a really nice iPad app similar idea very same yeah very same idea yeah so
[02:06:56.640 --> 02:07:00.960]   uh this looks good well and I did we did a whole bunch for another company that will remain on
[02:07:00.960 --> 02:07:06.240]   that we did 400 you know like motion capture things sort of this kind of thing and I felt like this
[02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:12.400]   this app is a better even if it's just video it's still a better solution runtastic's results on
[02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:17.440]   Android as well as iOS and what is the year subscription because it's free app but then there's
[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:23.120]   a I think I paid I think I paid 50 bucks for the year cheaper than a gym it is and I'm I know that
[02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:31.600]   yeah I'm shit yeah huh huh no comment huh so I am uh I am charging my laptop right now
[02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:37.280]   with my pick of the week I just got it in the mail I don't know why I think Zolt they said here
[02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:43.600]   take this this is the world's smallest lap chop charger this is big this is powerful enough to
[02:07:43.600 --> 02:07:49.840]   charge my MacBook it comes with a variety of tips you have to get a MacBook tip to work with it
[02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:54.080]   but it comes with tips for all the laptops more of these days when you have to have specialty these
[02:07:54.080 --> 02:07:58.800]   are all gonna be gone soon it's all gonna be type C someday I hope but it's nice about this is it's
[02:07:58.800 --> 02:08:04.720]   very small folds up you can wrap the cable around it and it even has two additional USB chargers
[02:08:04.720 --> 02:08:11.600]   so when you for your travel adapter you plug this in and you can charge your laptop to other
[02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:16.160]   things on this be great for the MacBook would presumably work with the MacBook you just using
[02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:22.320]   a type C USB connector but the uh but the tips are these special proprietary tips so you have to
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:27.600]   how do they get around the whole apple thing with the uh that's a good question because it is uh
[02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:32.320]   if you look at it is a magsafe adapter I guess they licensed it I don't know
[02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:43.520]   99 99 at uh go Z-O-L-T gozolt.com it's time what's nice is tiny now this is made of aluminum
[02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:48.560]   and it's warm so part of the reason you Chris these adapters are big is they got to dissipate some
[02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:54.720]   some heat but this is a lot smaller than your average brick and uh I think now I'm gonna carry
[02:08:54.720 --> 02:09:01.200]   this around this is uh I was impressed by this so wait so then you can change the I presume you
[02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:06.880]   can change this changes uh and well what do you mean what how do you change the tip how did you get
[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:11.040]   one that's uh there's another there's another cable there's another cable I don't didn't bring
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:15.040]   it with me but there's another cable and they say free you know as all these guys do free tips for
[02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:20.880]   live blah blah blah so it's not three is it three USB ports and one of them is special or is they
[02:09:20.880 --> 02:09:24.960]   yeah one of them I don't know how special it's probably high wattage or something but it has a
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:30.320]   little funny little connector to lock it in maybe strong enough for a PC maybe that's it I don't
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:36.320]   know yeah they say up to a hundred watts uh which is pretty hefty because some people plug the
[02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:39.360]   MacBook into a regular battery charger for an iPhone and then get surprised that it just
[02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:44.160]   trickles charges yeah no this is this has been it's not as fast probably as a native charger
[02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:47.680]   but I've been using it all through the show and it's been charging in a reasonable relatively
[02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:55.200]   reasonable rate oh it also uh rotates so um you can you can uh you can have it point in the
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:10:01.680]   in a direction that's convenient to the plug comes with a six foot pc charging cord and APC tips
[02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:08.480]   but uh they sent me a Mac tip so I don't I presume that they they sell a Mac tip and whether they
[02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:12.960]   sell it or they give it to you for free I don't know because they do say I'm just free tips for
[02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:18.960]   life San us placing kit yeah I'm just looking at that pile of different tips and those days
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:25.440]   assume god I that you that just used to be like every single trip ever and I can't think of the
[02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:31.920]   last time I took anything like that yeah that's them that's just what's the price I don't know how
[02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:36.000]   effect I don't know if it's just the show or not but I just want to point out that a second ago I
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:40.560]   went up and I was about to order my soul it's now sold out and and I went back because I went to
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:44.240]   make sure I got the right mags tape I came back and it's now estimated to ship in six to eight weeks
[02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:49.600]   oh I'm sorry I don't know if this show did that but it was it was totally fine a second ago then
[02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:54.880]   Mac pack is optional it works with the 45 watt and 60 watt Mac book what MacBook MacBook Pro and
[02:10:54.880 --> 02:11:00.160]   MacBook Air laptops there's somebody watching the cycling what just happened we just we sold out in
[02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:06.000]   like two seconds it's got a lot of that has a lot of different yeah god if only you know if
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:10.720]   if only people could like buy their way into getting mentioned on the show yeah
[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:16.000]   my sentence like I don't think like buy like 30 seconds of time when which a prepared
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:21.520]   pre-prepared ad could be read so whoever sent that to you get definitely got their ROI oh look
[02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:26.080]   they have the L cable as well the the Mac cables are additional 20 dollars they are not free
[02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:31.520]   um but so you can get the they sent me the regular one they have the L one for the Mac books
[02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:38.720]   this is their MacBook black MacBook Airs I guess huh well it's working it worked for me and uh it
[02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:43.120]   get a little warm but that's that's probably why it's got a aluminum body comes in three colors
[02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:48.160]   I gotta say I love the tubular shape like those those square bricks or sometimes it's
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:53.600]   sometimes hard to find a pouch in your laptop bag that will definitely fit it right it's made
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:12:01.040]   to wrap the primary cable around not the oh so that that's another nice you can and if you plug
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:08.240]   it in you can turn into an electromagnet I'm broadcasting right now from my Zluks Capacita
[02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:13.520]   it'll fit perfectly into the side pouch of a rush 24 it's a little clip on it so you can
[02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:17.760]   clip the cable in there that's that is a pretty compact but don't do that to your cable
[02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:21.920]   I know I know I know it hurts me and I'm probably stressing it right here you know it really hurts
[02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:25.360]   me just to look at that I should put a little bit of a cable means stress reliever and the
[02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:29.360]   OJ to get just to get just the definitely definitely definitely pull it out you can wrap it around
[02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:34.240]   there but definitely pull it out definitely pull it out look at me too how many toothpicks are
[02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:37.600]   on the floor of the floor Alex definitely definitely pull it okay I can't look at that
[02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:42.720]   I can't play it as a gentleman this concludes this edition of act break weekly Alex Lindsey so
[02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:52.240]   nice to see you could be here um anything we want to promote um just follow them on twitter @AlexLindsay
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:56.720]   we're planning a bunch of cool stuff soon good so um so that's all I would say so following
[02:12:56.720 --> 02:13:00.960]   me on twitter is probably the easiest way to go yeah because you tweet if there's there's need by
[02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:08.080]   the way twitter according to the Wall Street Journal next month actually in march we'll extend
[02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:14.160]   the total number of characters in your tweet from 140 to 10 000 because the best thing about
[02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:18.240]   twitter was 140 characters that's the end of it like this could be this could be like the fatal
[02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:25.760]   like thing that kills twitter is on posts they should have just gone slowly up like giving us
[02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:30.240]   one more a day or something like that you know like oh my god i got another character i'm not
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:34.400]   negative one yeah basically if our twitter is that the expectations was easy to manage so if you
[02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:38.480]   had a bunch of people asking you things they could only ever expect a short answer but on facebook
[02:13:38.480 --> 02:13:43.200]   or google plus a game mail angry if you don't know it's one minute when i'm surprised how well i am
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:47.280]   how how good i am at thinking in 140 characters like i'll take of something i'll go oh wait that
[02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:51.440]   wouldn't fit and then it's why type it and i go oh that fits perfectly you know i honestly think
[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:56.000]   that using twitter for so many years has made me a better writer because it learns like is there
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:00.480]   a more efficient way of saying that to make it fit in less and you find out the wow there are three
[02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:05.120]   of those words i was able to get rid of and it didn't affect that either the style or the content
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:08.080]   one bit is that okay if i put a little strain relief on it like not really
[02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:14.720]   no you don't want to leave that thing think of Alex that is not that is not good it's better
[02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:18.160]   it's an option around if i don't do that well think of some way that like what you need like a
[02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:22.320]   little thing that hooks onto the thing which are oh actually it has a staple gun at leo it has a
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:26.640]   little gun at leo it's not using maybe if i's okay okay you solve that because it has the little
[02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:30.640]   hoojor thing you can expand like that to the end that's what you're supposed to do that's what you're
[02:14:30.640 --> 02:14:36.160]   supposed to do Alex can i ask you this does this and i'm not beat your god no no no no no you're hurting
[02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:43.040]   him here's how i usually put away a cable does that no no that's not it's not actually that bad
[02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:46.560]   but what you want to do is make sure that when you do it strain relief you want to
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:53.040]   all about strain relief over under over under over oh yeah the over undertrick i know that
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:56.960]   no wonder on your on all your cables Alex are you planning on throwing a six foot caveman interview
[02:14:56.960 --> 02:15:04.800]   you by the way if i ever interview for you for a a job in production and i see you like do over
[02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:08.800]   under then i immediately know like on your headphones jack and like i like i don't even
[02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:12.880]   understand what you're talking about you don't know about over under oh my god okay okay wait
[02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:19.520]   let's have a class in over under okay no no no watch watch it's very it's easy once you learn it
[02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:24.240]   do you do your job so that's the normal way you're doing it that and then the next one you twist so
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:29.120]   it's under like it so it's under so it's on the top that's the normal way the next one is under
[02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:33.440]   if you don't already know there's every cable i'm sure we do this here right every cable should be
[02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:41.520]   wrapped that way this yeah over under that sort of yeah that's that's that's that's that's like a
[02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:46.000]   i think that's like the rope trip the reason is it doesn't in the same you know that right of course
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:51.040]   like maryam would have taught you that day one like when you do this it teaches you that in college
[02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:55.120]   and and if you do it correctly you should be able to take the role you should be able to hang on to
[02:15:55.120 --> 02:15:59.200]   so if you do it it never tangles never so you know so you mean so you mean so you wind up with
[02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:08.480]   this piece of metal no no don't do that okay oh he's tying it nuts ladies so the way the way
[02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:13.600]   the way that what that's created from is if you pull it if you pull it through itself that's exactly
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:17.360]   what you get it will create a knot every at every cycle that means you've done it right but you've
[02:16:17.360 --> 02:16:20.960]   done the last part wrong so but if you do it correctly you should be able to just take your rope even
[02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:27.040]   if it's 15 feet yeah go like this and it just works it's all like you know over under everybody
[02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:31.280]   should know that that has been the most valuable tip that's the reason why you listen to all two
