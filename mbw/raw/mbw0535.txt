[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. We're gonna have some fun today.
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.200]   I'm gonna play with a new computer. It's not a Mac.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.400]   It's the new Windows Surface Studio.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.400]   We'll talk about why Apple might want to think about touch for the Mac.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.000]   Futures for the iPad. It's very interesting futures.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.200]   And an iPhone 8. Lots of good stuff coming up, including holiday buys.

[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.200]   We've got a lot of Mac stuff.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.200]   iOS, iPad, iPhone, Watch TV.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.200]   Joining us from Montreal, he's about to fly out, come down here for our holiday show, Renee Richie.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.200]   Hello, Renee Richie.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.200]   I got to escape the freezing rain.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.200]   I went outside this morning and everything was covered in a layer of ice,
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.200]   and that was everything that I've done.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.200]   That's the weirdest thing that happens in winter, as far as I'm concerned.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.200]   It's most destructive, too, because it brings down power lines, it stops airplanes for taking it.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.200]   It's the worst.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.200]   Bad.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.200]   I was de-iced once.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.200]   I don't want to do it again.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.200]   That blue stuff gets everywhere.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.200]   Andy Enoco also here.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.200]   He's from the East Coast as well from the Chicago Sun Times, but he makes his home in England.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.200]   Great to see you.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.200]   There you go.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.200]   Celestial Waste of Ban with CWOB.com.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.200]   And, yay, Alex Lindsey into house from the New York.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   Hello, great.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   Always good to have you, Alex.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.200]   Welcome.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.200]   Thank you.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.200]   Good to be here.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.200]   On Sunday, he was doing the talk show with John Gruber.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:58.200]   When John Gruber let's slip, little mice have told him that Johnny Ive is just as involved
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.840]   as ever in Apple.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.200]   Just as connected to product design as ever.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.680]   I think we talked a little bit about, was it last week about the installation he did for
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.800]   the hotel and London for Clerages?
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.680]   I've said, it feels like he's unsybatical.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.440]   But Gruber said that recently he heard Ive has been checked out or not as directly involved
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.080]   with product design and instead focused on architecture projects for its campus and retail
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.640]   locations.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.040]   But rumors like this have been going on for a while.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:43.200]   And yesterday Gruber in a daring fireball posted his rebuttal where he said, "This is
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.000]   what I dislike most about podcasting."
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.920]   With everything I write here, that they are in fireball aim for painstaking precision.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.000]   Of course, welcome to the club, John Gruber.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.520]   A podcast that's not possible.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.640]   So he says, "There's been speculation about this, but the company line just means that
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.760]   I've could spend less time on management, more time on design.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.360]   And so he's got more time.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.560]   He can do more things.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.880]   But nobody has ever said to him, "Johnnie Ive has checked out a day-to-day product design.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.320]   What I've heard from people who've said, 'I think Johnnie Ive has checked out.'
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.000]   What I have heard is from people who've said, 'I think Johnnie Ive has checked out like
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.560]   me.'
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.880]   He says, 'This isn't the case.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.480]   I've also heard from well-placed sources within Apple.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.960]   There's nothing to this while I was devoting much of his time and attention to architecture
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.520]   recently.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.200]   Every aspect of new product remains as much under his watchful eye as ever.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.680]   So take it for what you will.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.800]   I don't feel that that's actually the case.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.280]   I think there's significant evidence in my mind when I look at some of the most recent
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.480]   Apple designs that Johnnie is not fully present.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.920]   And maybe that's what he likes.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.920]   Maybe that's his design.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.240]   I don't think anybody outside of Apple is capable of making that call.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.240]   We don't know.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.560]   I'll admit that.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.200]   I think I had to talk to him very briefly at the last event.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.200]   He came by.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.200]   Nice.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.840]   There was a group of us.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.160]   The thing I love about him is that everyone at Apple, all the executives, they actually
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.240]   talk in real life the way they talk on stage.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.240]   There's very little...
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.200]   Unless they're masters at Artifice, there's very little Artifice.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.880]   And he was just saying that...
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.600]   I think it was Craig Farikki said, 'Great product, great release.'
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.120]   And Johnnie looked very serious and said, 'Is it really?
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.880]   Because I never know until users get it in their hands, until we see what they do with
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.880]   them, it's always unfinished.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.640]   They're the ones who have to ultimately make that decision.'
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.880]   And he spoke for about a minute about how a design is completely dependent on the usability
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.880]   at the end of the road.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.880]   It's really cool.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.880]   It's thrilled to hear that.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.880]   I'm not sure that's true.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.880]   I'll point to a couple of things.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:53.220]   The ports on the MacBook Pro that look like their speakers but in fact are not.
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.920]   Now after having used the touch bar for a couple of weeks, I just don't use it.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.960]   In fact, all it ever does is get in my way.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.840]   In fact, I had to turn off the Siri button and I had to re-jigger it because I keep hitting
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.280]   it right below the backspace.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.680]   And do you find you're using it, Renee?
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.480]   I am because I had this revelation.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.480]   It was sort of like the revelation I had with 3D Touch when I learned like a 3D Touch and
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.400]   then goes directly to battery saver.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.640]   Is that there's certain things that I just did that took a lot of time.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.560]   When I forgot what a keyboard shortcut is and I had to let go and go to the trackpad
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.120]   and go up to the menu and go across and then not find it and then go to help and type it
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.120]   in.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.120]   And then go to the next time.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.600]   That's just been there on the touch bar.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.600]   And the same with Safari.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.920]   I would have to go to a window, click on each tab to see what they are.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.560]   And now I just touch the little tab button and swipe my finger across and I quickly see
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.880]   every tab and I just stop on the one that I want.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.480]   So there's various ways my workflow was already broken that it speeds up me unbreaking it.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.200]   And that was sort of the revelation.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.560]   Yeah, it breaks it more for me.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.760]   So for instance, now instead of the function keys to turn volume up and down, I have the
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.520]   volume button and I hold it and then I have a slider.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.400]   Now it's just because of muscle memory that I have to relearn that but I don't, you know,
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.320]   it was much easier for me to go, "Bub, bub, bub, bub."
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.400]   I'll tell you where the New MacBook Pro is.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.400]   It's fantastic.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.760]   I think Touch ID is a massive improvement.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:17.640]   And it's more than just to log in because a lot of computers have, let's face it, fingerprint
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.640]   readers.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.440]   But I like that I can use it for purchases for, you know, it's just like Touch ID on the
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.440]   iPhone.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.440]   For one password is great.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.640]   It's password boxes that you would have in the past had to type your, you know, root
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.520]   password, administrator password so you can install software.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.680]   Now you just do the fingerprint.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.960]   I do like that.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.880]   So that part of the Touch Bar is a massive improvement.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.880]   The screen is great.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.320]   As you've said, many times it's really, it's the best screen apples made right up.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.440]   And it says you're so ludicrously fast.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.120]   And it feels really fast all around.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.640]   I got the top of the line one so I can't speak for the lower end ones, the i5s.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:08:00.520]   But the one, if you spend enough money, and God knows we did, it's very fast.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.040]   The keyboard is suboptimal but not unusable.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.600]   That's the best I can say about it.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.560]   Yeah, it's divisive.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.240]   It's a nice design.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.680]   Battery life is the same, right?
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.480]   Are you noticing massively improved battery life?
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.480]   No, it's just...
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.480]   I had a couple times where...
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.960]   There have been some people who've said it's much worse to them.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.520]   I had a couple days when it was much worse and I tracked it down to photos agent and spotlight
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.520]   index.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.320]   And they were just busy tugging away in the background.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.480]   But when they stopped, it's been totally fine for me.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.760]   I've used it on the show.
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:35.920]   I used it last week on the show and it got exactly two hours, which ain't great.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.360]   But that's full bright using it.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.200]   I'm using it on the show.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.280]   But that's about what the other one was.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.520]   I get eight to nine hours, which is about an hour less than what Apple promised.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.200]   But again, they're testing it half brightness.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.120]   I'm a full brightness and there's a bunch of other things.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.200]   Battery life is impossible to give you a number and say, "This is what you're going
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.200]   to get."
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.200]   It's very...
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.200]   Well, it changes.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.200]   That little predictor bar is a huge liar.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.040]   It said I had 12 hours and I had seven hours because it's already dynamically changing,
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.480]   depending on what I'm doing.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.760]   I'm not convinced it's better.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.760]   Let's put it that way.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.280]   It feels like it's about the same.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.040]   My camera has a really great feature that I love, which is it lets you...
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.440]   It obviously doesn't tell you what the percentage of the battery is left, but it gives you
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.680]   obviously green, yellow, red indicators.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:25.320]   But in the deep end menu settings, you get to decide how conservative it's going to be.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.520]   So I've got it set at maximum conservative office...
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.920]   Conservative office.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.880]   So that if it's giving me a red light, that doesn't mean...
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.320]   When it came out of the box, that would mean that you can take maybe 10 more pictures.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.880]   Now I've got it set so that it will give me that red light when I got maybe 50 left.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.840]   So I know that, "Okay, I'm going to definitely not be taking 12 shot bursts anymore because
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.840]   I'm low on battery."
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:51.720]   I would love it if computers could do the same thing where it would fudge, kind of like
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.720]   my old car would.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:58.480]   I know that when the needle is on empty, I still have about 42 miles worth of gas left.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:04.080]   And then when I get into a rental car, empty means empty, then I'm screwed.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:11.600]   So roughly, to answer this question, Johnny, I see his fingerprints on this because he's
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.080]   the guy who likes to put holes where nothing happens.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.560]   Yeah, I was going to say classic Johnny.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.560]   It's classic Johnny.
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.240]   I have the same thing on the iPhone 7 where it's got the...
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.240]   Yeah, symmetry.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.240]   Symmetry.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.240]   It's magical, yes.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:27.240]   And the iPhone 7, as many pointed out, isn't much change from the iPhone 6s, but it's enough
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.640]   and it feels different enough.
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:34.800]   And I certainly love the jet black that this feels like a Johnny Ive kind of refinement
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.800]   as opposed to redesign.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.800]   I guess when the iPhone 8 comes out, that's what we'll say.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.800]   And that team is so small.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.760]   I mean, that team is like a dozen or so people and they've been working together for decades.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.240]   And there's such a symbiosis among them that it would be really hard to see.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.400]   Like in that documentary, I think it was 60 minutes where they came up and they had these
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.480]   ideas and he said, "It's hard to tell where one begins and one ends, except for that rust
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.880]   color orange, bad on you for making a rust color dorm room carpet orange."
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.120]   And then they got back to the business of figuring out what iPhone size to make.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.400]   And I think that he is busy with the stores.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.480]   The last time he made a public appearance was at the store opening at Union Square and
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.040]   he was hugely involved with that.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.040]   But also, I believe live photos was a huge passion of his and he was deeply involved
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.040]   in that.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.560]   And I think a lot of the new camera stuff he's deeply involved with.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.560]   That's interesting.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.560]   So his mandate goes beyond hardware to software.
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.560]   It's all design.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.560]   Yeah.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.560]   It's all design.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.560]   Yeah.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.560]   Yeah.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.800]   And I think the minimalism, I think his minimalism is something that we were seeing in a symmetry
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:35.560]   and minimalism in the new MacBook Pro as well as the removal of the headphone jack.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.680]   I think those are the kind of things that probably come from him as far as making decisions.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.520]   Oh, again, like Renee said, it's such a small team.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.920]   And also, it's not as though there's like a turnover of every couple of years, you get
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:53.240]   some firebrand who suddenly wants to put brown trim on something.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.640]   It means that they're very, very tightly knit team.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.840]   They know how each other think.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:04.200]   So if there, even if there were evidence that Johnny Ives not coming into the office quite
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:09.400]   as often or that his attention was being split between not just the hardware stuff, but also
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.640]   the software stuff and also the architecture.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.160]   And he also has some time for outside projects.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.360]   That doesn't mean that his influence isn't there.
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.320]   It means that his team's influence is still there.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:26.160]   And that's always been the residue of everything that Apple believes in terms of design.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:30.720]   And it's very possible that Johnny's working on products that are not yet released.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.720]   I think that thing where everyone says Steve Jobs would never do this.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.720]   And then a month later, you find out that Steve Jobs was intimately involved for three
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.360]   months of the creation of that product.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.720]   Oh, Steve Jobs never do the book.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.720]   Oh, it started.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.720]   The book started eight years ago.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.720]   Steve Jobs would never do this.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.720]   No, that started eight years ago.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.720]   Right.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.560]   The Touch Bar is a 10 year old project at Apple.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.560]   Well, they're a lot.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.040]   Well, let's see that the.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.840]   Is it really is 10 years old that that?
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.800]   Yeah, Victor, Victor Webb was tweeting again, like a word dream was tweeting it.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.000]   He said like he started working on that.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.440]   I think it was eight to 10 years ago.
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.040]   So it was five to three years before Steve Jobs passed away.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.840]   And before touch was even really in a twinkle.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.640]   When they were doing the iPhone stuff.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.320]   That's interesting.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.600]   You remember seeing that multi touch demo on a screen much like this?
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.040]   By the way, if people are wondering, this is the Surface Microsoft Surface Studio.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.040]   I'm using.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.040]   I thought that was the.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.120]   Was not the 30 inch iPad?
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.120]   It's very much, you know what?
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.120]   It could be.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.480]   It's very much like a 30 inch iPad.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.480]   If a 30 inch iPad ran Windows 10.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.480]   Not the 30.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.480]   Not the 30 inch iPad.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:30.520]   But we also saw that Carnegie Mellon demo of multi touch.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.840]   That was the first time we'd seen multi touch and that was the first time I saw a pinch
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.240]   and zoom and all the multi touch gestures.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.240]   And that was about.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.240]   The report made real.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.240]   And that was about that 10 years ago.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.440]   It was before the iPhone came out.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.040]   So that makes sense.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.800]   And yet I still having used this now a little bit and this is a touch screen computer that
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.240]   is really much like a tablet having used this now.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:58.160]   I really see the value at least in this form factor where it's at 20 degrees.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.560]   It's like a drafting table of touch on a operating system and on a screen is really
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.560]   great.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.320]   And I know it's not so much.
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.760]   But but notice though, it's not even so much the use of it as like an artist tablet.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.280]   It's just a simple thing that your brain has now been wired up to just to scroll by flicking
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.800]   up and flicking down to zoom in by doing that.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.200]   But remember, I'm not reaching out.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.640]   It's not arms like the fact when I do have to reach out to close, you know, the controls
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:26.560]   for non touch enabled device software are up at the top of the screen where they're
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.560]   least reachable.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.560]   It's interesting.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.400]   You can kind of tell Microsoft's been thinking about this because everything including in
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.800]   Microsoft's Edge browser is at the bottom of the screen.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.960]   And I kind of locked edge because anyway, I used to have stuff up at the top and edge
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.960]   can't stuff at the bottom.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.160]   And now I'm just going to use a rib in there.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.560]   They don't have a ribbon here.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.840]   Or do you see the program you were on before?
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.400]   Could you can you tap all that stuff?
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.600]   But the and you mean that was Chrome I was using before.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.720]   So yeah, but you have to reach for it.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:59.480]   But it's easy because it's this is a 28 inch screen.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.280]   And I can even change the DPI if I want.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.800]   So it's easy enough for the yeah, it's easy enough to hit the touch targets.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.360]   But also keep in mind that Microsoft is not saying that this is going to be you're only
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.720]   going to be using this with touch.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.840]   You've got keyboard, you've got a mouse, you've got you've got more you've got more tactile
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:17.320]   interfaces there than on any other machine that you can possibly buy, which is a little
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.680]   against the Apple way.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:22.600]   Remember the Apple way was one way to do everything so you don't get confused.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.720]   But Microsoft always was possible.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.280]   And if you and you look at the markup stuff that you were showing, I think we were talking
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.280]   about a little earlier.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.280]   Yeah, I could show.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:36.440]   I mean, this is I do that the wrong way every time I've got a program to double touch turns
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.560]   it into a now by the way, this is not no longer scrollable or editable.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:45.440]   It's not a live browser, but I can I can annotate it, right?
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.480]   If that Mac book wants to cut off the other Mac book and stop it from scoring.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.320]   Well, and again, I think that we want to we want to think about that not not from an
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:57.440]   artist perspective, but from a teacher's perspective, a CEO's perspective from an ad
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:03.160]   writer's perspective of all these folks that want to be able to, you know, circle stuff
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.920]   and say, no, take this out or this this is spelled wrong or whatever.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:12.360]   And creating that I think is is what is missing from for Apple.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:17.360]   Particularly when it's not right, particularly when you when you when you hook this up to
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.840]   speech controls, when you basically say, as you're talking, you take this and move it
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:28.320]   down to here or take turn this text both face as you're without having to say, take paragraph
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.120]   three of document window one, right?
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:40.680]   I do think that one of the things Apple and Johnny are probably working on is augmented
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:41.680]   reality.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.320]   I have to let me see if I can find this.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.800]   This is from oddly enough from Windows.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:45.800]   Everybody's working on that.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.760]   But but we mentioned this before that it really seems pretty clear that this is so
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:56.680]   something that Tim Cook keeps saying over and over again, they want to do.
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:02.320]   And it's so I'm just making in the context of where with her Johnny, I've that's exactly
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.000]   the kind of thing Johnny would be putting a lot of cycles into because you have to figure
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.560]   out what the UI looks like.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:12.640]   You know, Microsoft's done so far as make a floating start menu, right?
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.600]   So there's a lot of thinking that would go into that.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.840]   This is redesigning the user interface completely.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:20.640]   There was some concern that, you know, that he was spending all the time on the car project
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.720]   for that Apple's executives were, you know, totally distracted by the car project.
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.200]   My understanding is very few executives were actually involved in that.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.520]   And that was more of a project.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.840]   You know, that wasn't really that.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.880]   I mean, it had drained some talent, but it wasn't really an organizational level.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.880]   Right.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.880]   Right.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:40.440]   But AI seems like, sorry, no, no AI too, but augmented reality seems like something
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:44.680]   that's going to span like the same way LCD or L or panels span across all our technology
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.720]   now is just going to be embedded in everything.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.120]   And I'll be really blessed to get a bit of.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.600]   I'll be interested to see how it integrates with things like CarPlay.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.000]   I mean, you know, the idea that you'll be able to, you know, your directions and everything
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.080]   else are going to end up, you know, on the screen in front of you rather than you looking
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.080]   down.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:03.000]   I spent a lot of time in the last week looking at my directions because I have no idea how
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.960]   to drive through Chicago.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.600]   And, you know, I just kept on, it was almost dangerous to be looking down.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.120]   There was so much going on.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:15.560]   And I could definitely see how you'd have, you know, heads up displays, you know, in
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.560]   front of you.
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.560]   And then that kind of stuff is going to be happening along with glasses and everything
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.560]   else.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:26.800]   But that's a good example of how multiple technologies combined to create a perfect solution.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:34.280]   It's not about putting having an Ironman sort of a HUD where it's just a flurry of circles
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.880]   and knobs and faces and numbers.
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.120]   It's also deciding that at this moment, the only thing I need to put into the HUD for this
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:51.280]   driver is a big arrow that flashes and a 3D arrow or a 3D set of custom highway signs
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:55.320]   that only this user can see that says your turn is coming up in two minutes.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.080]   And here is, here is, I'm going to thread this arrow right between these two buildings
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.240]   is where you want to go as opposed to here's your latest email.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.560]   Here's what Beyonce is tweeting right now.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.560]   Here is one actually.
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.800]   I think how people use computers really.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:14.600]   I mean, millions, possibly billions of dollars have been spent on what to do with some of
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:19.840]   these heads up displays because of course we use them in the military, or people use
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:23.200]   them in the military, where it's life or death if you have too much information, you know,
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.400]   up there or not enough.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.400]   Yes.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:29.400]   And so if you look at the heads up displays that are used in Apache helicopters and so
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.320]   on and so forth, I mean, there's a lot of information there, but it's just what you
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.840]   need when you need it because if you get distracted, you die and you don't get the information,
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:37.840]   you die.
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.320]   They've been, you know, they've been really work, you know, this is not a new technology
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:45.680]   as much as newly applied to something that is more widely used.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.680]   Yeah.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.400]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:55.020]   We're going to come back some opposing opinions on the MacBook Pro, including in Renee
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:20:00.160]   Richie, you wrote it up, MacBook Pro's the most techy and expandable laptop Apple has
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.520]   ever made.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.240]   You link to the Adam Gightney's medium post.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:10.280]   And when you really find out what the post is about, well, I have a thought about this.
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.480]   We'll talk about it in a moment.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:13.480]   First let's talk about Corning.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.480]   How about that?
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.480]   Optical cables by Corning.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.880]   I'm not talking about Tupperware here.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.360]   I'm talking about Corningware.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.360]   Remember Corningware?
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:24.840]   I'm talking about optical cables by Corning, which is something I use now everywhere.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.240]   We use in the studio everywhere and we're not alone.
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:30.880]   A lot of studios, you know, the problem you have, I'll give you an example, universal
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:37.520]   audio, they make Thunderbolt audio interfaces, really good Thunderbolt audio faces, interfaces.
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.520]   And they're testing it.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.680]   They have recording studios.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.960]   They're not going to want the hard drives, the noisy stuff in the studio.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:48.400]   So what they'd like to do is get all of the Thunderbolt arrays and stuff out of the studio.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.500]   For that, they use optical cables by Corning to give them acoustic isolation where they
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.640]   test the new equipment like they're audio interfaces.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:03.000]   And the reason they do, because optical cables have exceptional cable runs, the Thunderbolt
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:11.720]   cable goes 200 feet without attenuation, the USB 3 cable 165 feet without attenuation.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.320]   And so, and they're thinner too.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.600]   And lighter, look how thin they are.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.960]   And they're bendable and they're not as fragile as the old days.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.160]   In fact, I've been bending them, tying them in knots, crimping them, no problem.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:28.240]   Maybe the cool thing about the optical cables by Corning is, I'm going to do the tellestrator
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.240]   here.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:35.440]   This is my opportunity to tell us to tell us straight here so you can see the cool thing.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:39.160]   Let me show you what's really cool about these cables.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:44.680]   Let's get a good image of these cables up here so I can show you.
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:49.760]   What they've done that's brilliant, frankly, is, you know, the issue of course is a lot
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:53.760]   of the cables that you use, all the cables, all the interfaces are copper.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:22:00.080]   In fact, Thunderbolt was supposed to be optical originally, but it was felt nobody was ready
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.200]   for copper yet.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:08.000]   So they made these, you know, copper cables.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.960]   Well, why not make them optical?
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.960]   But here's the trick.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:11.960]   It's this thing.
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.920]   It's the dongle at either end of it.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.320]   It's just all, it's not even a dongle.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:19.120]   It's just all, it looks like a very nice cable attachment.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:25.840]   So there's a standard Thunderbolt, but inside here is all of this electronics that's converting
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.440]   the copper output.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:31.560]   There's a picture of the inside into light and receiving the light and converting it
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.040]   back to copper.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:38.280]   So you get 10 gigabits per second bi-directional dual channel with regular Thunderbolt.
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.720]   Go to Thunderbolt 2, you get 20.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.440]   Go to Thunderbolt 3.30.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.280]   No degradation.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:50.200]   It is awesome and these cables are very, very robust.
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:56.040]   Corning clear-curve VSDN optical fiber, which is a class one laser product.
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:00.320]   I don't know what that means, but if you do, it's important, right?
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.320]   You can bend it.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.320]   One of the things is really interesting.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.800]   We have a bunch of these.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:09.760]   I think the 30 meter ones that we've used for a variety of projects and what's incredible
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.240]   is how much you can pinch them.
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.240]   I know.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.240]   You can crimp them.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:17.240]   Because one of our big problems with, we have a lot of fiber, a thousand foot rolls and
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.240]   all kinds of other stuff to do other things.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.240]   The challenge is-
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.240]   You can't step on that stuff.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:27.200]   You can step on it and it won't break, but if it gets between a door and gets kinked
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.480]   or whatever, we use them to get out of like arenas and stuff.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.040]   You suddenly lose signal.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:36.520]   So with these ones, you can get them really wrapped tightly and they work great.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.160]   This is their magic.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.440]   There's a little chip in this.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.520]   Here's actually the best picture.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.640]   That's the connector, but there's this little chip in there that does the conversion.
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.640]   That's so cool.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.080]   It's got a little photo die out here.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.560]   Anyway, these are great cables.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.840]   They're thinner, lighter, stronger and they go farther than any cable you've ever used
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:57.840]   before.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.240]   I use them now in my office.
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:04.160]   I have a nice big Drobo array, but I don't want it on my desk because it's got a lot
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.160]   of drives in it.
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.160]   So I just-
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.000]   It's off in the distance.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.440]   60 feet away.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:14.480]   Coming away and with full speed because there were optical cables by Corning available at
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:20.520]   all major electronics and professional AV retailers, including Apple stores, Amazon, B&H, optical
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:23.000]   cables by Corning, longer, thinner, lighter and stronger.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.880]   Go to opticalcablesbycorning.com if you want to learn more.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.520]   We thank Corning for their support of MacBreak Weekly and for providing both me and Alex with
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.280]   the cables we need to get the job done.
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:38.520]   I don't have your mission critical situation, but I do really like these.
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:46.040]   We are talking about Apple with Renee Ritchie of iMour.com who is- Alex Lindsay's disappeared.
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.600]   There's just a dark hole where Alex Lindsay was sitting.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.600]   He mentioned the cables.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:56.840]   He went to get cables, I think, and Alex Lindsay from the Pixel Core and Andy Inako from the
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.440]   Chicago Sun Times.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:03.080]   So I agree with this, by the way, this article.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.600]   The new MacBless Pro is kind of a big for hackers.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:11.320]   But if you just read the headline, you go, "Oh, interesting."
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.960]   That's why I said, "Oh, I'm going to click on that."
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.920]   What he's saying is that, "Oh, thank goodness they use Type-C connectors."
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:21.000]   Yes, they used an open standard for power and data.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.360]   That is great if you have a- and it has this guy does, a lot of Type-C stuff.
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:30.600]   And as he points out, which I think is really important, you don't- unlike, you know, so
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:37.960]   I have a Type-C powered HP laptop and I have to use HP's adapter.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.680]   Apple, thank you, Apple.
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.680]   I can use anything.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:44.120]   I can trickle charge it for my Pixel phone adapter.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.600]   I can plug it into anything and it gets some juice.
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.920]   It'll say, you know, no, but that's- so I agree with him.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:50.920]   That's huge.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:54.640]   The fact that it's using Type-C and it's very unapply thing to do, by the way, is to use
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.360]   a non-proprietary adapter for its power.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.160]   I know Apple gets a lot of heat because now you have to buy a lot of dongles.
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:06.680]   They did reduce the price by half, which is nice.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.760]   And I've said this before.
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:12.560]   Many of us already- Andy, you're in this boat too, have Type-C adapters.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.080]   So it's not a big deal because it's a standard.
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:20.560]   No, like I keep saying, I mean, I do wish that it had more standard ports, so they're
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:24.880]   fewer dongles, but I like the idea that they've got four ports and you make them whatever
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.520]   you want them to make.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.520]   It's exactly the way.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.080]   There's the computer of the future in that respect.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:36.600]   This computer, this Surface has standard USB adapters and an SD card reader.
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.720]   It's more of the past.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:42.160]   And I mean, it doesn't have any Type-C's and at this point I want everything I use to
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.960]   have Type-C, right?
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:48.320]   But it is a desktop and it's already getting three-
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.320]   Sorry.
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:54.200]   So they've got enough rooms so they can actually give you an ethernet port and they can give
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:27:00.440]   you basically a dozen USB Type-C ports without the added expense.
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.440]   But I see your point.
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:07.120]   It really does seem like every device that doesn't have some sort of a USB-C acknowledgement
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.200]   is going to be a little bit behind the times.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:14.920]   It's not quite ubiquitous yet, but now it's just going to get more and more popular.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.760]   It is a universal standard.
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:22.120]   It can handle traffic for just about anything that you want to put into or out of a computer.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:27.440]   I think in five years' time it's going to be really, really, I'll put it this way.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.840]   Five years' time it's going to look, a lightning connector is going to look like a major pain
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.160]   in the butt.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:38.600]   And I think that for me the big thing is as someone who travels a lot with their laptop
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.520]   is still the MagSafe.
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.080]   It's not, you know, and I get it.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.640]   You can get that belt, that Griffin or that.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.400]   I know, but the problem is that sticks out.
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.040]   So what's going to happen is that will get bent.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:53.280]   You know, like, I mean, it's something that you can't just leave it in there from my perspective.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:58.040]   And so the problem is because it's not flush, it is going to be something that gets bent
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:05.480]   because I got about after the last show I was on, I got like 200 tweets that recommended
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.480]   the Belkin.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.240]   So I do know it's there.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.400]   The problem really is that little nub sticking out.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:16.680]   I've had like little USB sticks that I leave in my computer for whatever reason, and they
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.680]   get bent.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:21.680]   Well, you know, that I guess maybe I travel harder than everybody else.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.200]   But, but that's the concern that that I really have with it.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.120]   That and just not having, you know, I just felt like on a major upgrade, not having a
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.800]   touchscreen, I get that the interface isn't designed.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:35.800]   But if you look at with the with the window, you know, with our surface studio, I don't
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.800]   feel like I need to have everything be touchy.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.440]   I just want to be able to draw on things.
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:46.880]   And so, so my point is I agree with Adam that for the type C, apples should get lots
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.520]   of praise, but it doesn't make the MacBook Pro kind of great for hackers.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.600]   It just it's it's a nice feature.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.680]   Just like the touch ID is a nice feature.
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.040]   Yeah, the definition of hacker in that article is hacker.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:04.240]   It means for him, apparently somebody has a lot of, you know, type C phones and things,
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.240]   which I do.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.680]   I'm in that group and I like it.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:10.840]   But notice, by the way, and I hope Corning does this, those Thunderbolt cables are not
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:11.840]   type C.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:14.840]   They're this traditional Thunderbolt connectors.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.600]   So I have to get put in an adapter on that.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.600]   And that bugs me.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:22.080]   I have a lot of Thunderbolt hard drive Thunderbolt devices.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:25.280]   And I can't use them directly on my new MacBook Pro.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.560]   I had to buy go out and buy a new compact flash reader.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.560]   I didn't have to.
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.160]   I could have used an adapter, but you know what?
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:35.720]   If you do go out and get one with a type C connector, man, that's fast.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:36.720]   Right.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.360]   So I think that I think the part of it is I mean, I just would have been much happier
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:44.760]   with my what I have right now on my on my left and on my right put two two type C connect
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.760]   connectors.
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:52.160]   You know, like, you know, like, you know, replace my HDMI and my USB on my on my right with
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.680]   two USB C and like let everybody get kind of get used to it.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:58.640]   And I get that it's going to force the market forward by just making it only available.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.840]   But it really is, you know, the market's not ready for what they did.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:06.600]   So you buy this now and you've got, you know, an incredible little and it's not me and I
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:11.800]   admit it, like for me, as someone who produces live events, it's it's a mission critical.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:17.480]   It's not the that's the issue is that it's not a, you know, every dongle is something
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:21.200]   else that can get popped out, you know, during while I'm working.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.440]   And for me, it's a big deal.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.440]   So it's so we'll see.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:29.760]   I mean, I just, yeah, for bad guy hackers, type C will also be a boon.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.680]   I think it's DMA access, right to the bus.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.480]   There's going to be juice jacking.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:38.200]   There's going to be people who plug it in and get control of your like there was an
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:42.720]   exploit where if you left a browser open, people could plug in a USB dongle and get
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.040]   at I mean, that kind of stuff is when someone has physical access to your computer and there
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.440]   is a bus like that, it's going to be problematic.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.880]   I think the tradeoff is worthwhile, but it's good thing to remember.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.800]   Keep people away from your system.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.200]   And I will say I have to talk to you about it.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:00.520]   And also, if you if you're if you're on the subway and you find like a USB key, some
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:05.400]   plate somewhere, it doesn't matter if it's 128 gigabytes and it's a genuine sand desk.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.640]   Do not put it in your computer.
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:10.880]   Especially if you work for the Defense Department, if you're in the Army, anything
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.000]   government related, everybody has help for security.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.400]   If you find unattended USB dongles, please report.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.960]   Well, and I will admit, if I get one, the number one reason I'll get one is because of the
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:24.000]   touch ID because I really feel like, I mean, the more you get used to using touch ID with
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.680]   the phone, the more insecure, like I don't almost ever log into Bank of America anymore,
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.160]   you know, with on my computer.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.160]   I agree.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.560]   I feel like that's an insecure connection.
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:34.800]   I'd rather use my phone.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:35.800]   Yeah, because it's more secure.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.400]   Yeah, I agree with that.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.320]   Do do we talk about this?
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.320]   I can't remember.
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:42.320]   Maybe I talked about it on a twit.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:49.200]   Do you use my recommendation for a lot of people is just get the the no touch MacBook
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.200]   Pro.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:55.040]   If you need a new MacBook Pro, Renee, would you disagree with that?
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:59.080]   If you were if you always wanted a retina MacBook Air, I think that's a really good
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.080]   upgrade.
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:03.760]   But if you you're giving up two ports, it only has two of the USB C ports, not four of
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:07.080]   them, and it has a lowest end processor, you can't expand.
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.080]   No GPU.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:13.240]   Yeah, only the 15 inch has discrete GPU, but that's that's become I mean, the Intel embedded
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.520]   Iris Pro is pretty good now.
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:16.600]   So that's become more of a niche need.
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.840]   That's not even on the 13 inch maxed out version, but it really is those lack of ports
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.880]   and the the lower spec.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:26.720]   So again, if you want to travel, if you want a light machine to take with you, it's it's
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.200]   a good choice, but it's not it's not a MacBook Pro.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.600]   If you need a new MacBook Pro, but I do think the touch ID is nice.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.600]   I can live with the touch bar not being particularly useful.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.600]   I haven't used this.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.920]   There's a new couple of new apps, touch switcher and rocket.
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.920]   Have you tried these Renee that let you put app?
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:46.120]   I don't this seems like a bad idea, but put app icons on your.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:49.200]   Yeah, I mean, this to me is like super interesting.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:53.560]   It's like when the notification center widgets came out and there was like launch center
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.680]   pro and there and things.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:59.040]   It's like this is the worst that this touch bar will ever be because the apps haven't
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.040]   really figured it out.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:03.880]   Apple has some really good implementations and some really not great ones and developers
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:06.200]   didn't even really see it before they started launching their apps.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:10.400]   I think like peak elk is terrific on this and some other some other apps are really just
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.000]   recapitulations of what their on screen menus do.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.680]   But you know, three months from now, six months from now, a year from now, they're going to
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:21.840]   figure at least a lot more of this stuff out and it won't just be like doom or like I'd
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:26.120]   like to see some passive information put on there, something with a footer.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:30.560]   The people who write those little utilities that pop up, you know, what's your CPU?
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:31.560]   I stat menu.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:32.560]   I stat menu.
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:36.800]   That's the one I can't believe that I stat menu isn't and it's pretty easy to do, right?
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:40.360]   It seems like the it's if you could put doom on it, it must be fairly easy to do.
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:43.640]   Like we can all yell in the general direction of Australia and Mark Edwards and ask him
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.640]   on Mark.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:49.880]   You know, and then I wouldn't you know, I know you can turn it into function key mode,
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:54.000]   by the way, there's a switch which is puts function keys up.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.600]   But I don't need function keys that much.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:01.160]   I would probably run I stat menu instead or something like that and be perfectly happy.
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.160]   I just wish it weren't so expensive.
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:05.880]   I feel like I'm paying for the for the touch bar that I don't really use.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:09.440]   You are you're basically buying an Apple watch that's embedded inside your MacBook.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:13.040]   That's it's almost literally what it is.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.040]   Wow.
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.040]   All right.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.040]   Well, so this is so this is some interesting uses.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.040]   I guess I should try this.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:24.360]   Rocket, which lets you launch apps puts the apps right up on the control bar there.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.360]   It's cool.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.200]   And it's the same thing as sort of like, you know, we were joking when the Apple watch
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:29.760]   first came out as do you really need it?
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.320]   And it was it saved you a reach for your phone in some situations.
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:37.200]   And this saves me a few menu clicks here, a few searches there, a few keyboard shortcuts
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.200]   there.
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.800]   And if that adds up to a beneficial thing for you, then that's great.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.880]   If you're so programmed, it's already using your Mac, then it's just going to be in your
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:44.880]   way.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:45.880]   Right.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.640]   I do really like having a 28 inch iPad though.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:51.520]   I think this is that Apple should definitely consider this.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.520]   I'm loving it.
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:57.360]   And everyone made fun of that when people said, oh, Apple is going to have a 28 inch,
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.320]   but but it turns out that it's quite nice.
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:02.520]   Yeah, I'm a little more sold on this.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.760]   Jason Snow on six colors.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:08.680]   I'm actually right this right says for a Mac world says, this is opinion piece, but why
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:12.360]   Apple probably won't go to arm.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.240]   I thought this one might be one direction.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:18.560]   It would take the Mac to make it more like iOS and put it on arm.
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:24.720]   And I'm sure Intel, you know, in their and their nightmares at night worries about this.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:30.240]   Do you agree though that arm is, you know, there's good reasons why arm should do it.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:36.600]   Jason says the transition from Intel would be too painful.
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:40.440]   Now that Apple hasn't done a similar transition before.
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.760]   I don't think it's a I don't think it's enough of a priority for Apple.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:43.760]   I think I agree with what he said.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:48.280]   There's not enough there's not enough upside for Apple to make the change and force everybody
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:52.360]   to make the change when it's such a small part of their market at this point.
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.000]   Yeah, it's interesting which way you look at it though.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   And there's a lot of nuance here.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.400]   It's the same way when they say like the Mac and iOS will never converge.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:02.240]   You know, this is this is all depends on how you think about it.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:06.800]   So would they take like an I Mac and run that on arm Mac pro and run that on arm?
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.640]   But is there a case to be made that they would take a device that looks very much like a
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:14.280]   Mac book air, but is running arm and is running iOS and you know, and has versions of the
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:18.400]   apps that are designed for that architecture that's a new thing that has elements of both.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.000]   And that that was those I believe already in prototype.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.240]   And it depends, you know, if they decide ever to pull that trigger, but the iPad is getting
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:28.480]   more pro and some people do really like clamshell form factors and they don't they don't want
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:31.840]   to make touch screen Mac OS, but they already have touch screen iOS.
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:36.920]   So there's there's a lot of things that could exist in between what we consider an arm Mac.
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:39.600]   And you know, what literally well and I think that for me, I mean, I when the Mac
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:43.560]   book the iPad pro is almost there, you know, with the I get that I have that I think the
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.680]   lot longer year, whatever, you know, it's already a clamshell.
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.560]   It's already bigger than my my air.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.680]   But it is and the touch screen works great.
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:56.920]   The only problem is, you know, a really good file system and the ability to import video
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:57.920]   well.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.520]   Yeah, you know, like those are the problems.
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.360]   Yeah, there there are a lot of hang ups.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:04.520]   It also needs a way that you can interact with the screen without taking your hands off
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.520]   the keyboard.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.880]   It's better than keyboard shortcuts.
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.080]   So I did read that article when it came out.
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:16.440]   It's the thing is I feel like I'm I'm of two different polar thoughts about it.
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:22.440]   One is that Apple won't go to Apple will definitely go to arm because it allows them
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.320]   to reclaim some of their own destiny.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:29.040]   They're it's they're doing more and more stuff where they can't put as the the the the
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.960]   pixie dust that they sprinkle over all their devices.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.960]   The pixie dust has to extend into the CPU.
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:40.920]   And that's not something that they can do with with the Intel chips and that clearly they're
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:47.320]   moving away from the making machines that are going to be attractive to people who need
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:51.920]   really, really super powerful machines are making machines that are more attractive to
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:57.080]   people who need something for more casual use things that are lighter, thinner, have longer
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.520]   battery life and that all points to arm.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:05.160]   The only but the hang up is that I do think that we're in a period where we can no longer
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:11.320]   just assume that Apple is committed to continuing to to support the Mac.
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:14.880]   I don't mean that I think that they're planning to ditch it, but I'm saying that what can a
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:19.080]   year ago, I would say, of course, I don't see any signs that they have any they have any
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.560]   reason not to not to keep doing Max.
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:31.440]   Now, after the past year, seeing both a letting major product lines in the Mac, let lie completely
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:37.560]   fallow, creating a MacBook Pro that is a really severe break from how they used to define
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:41.040]   the high end of their of their line.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:46.480]   Nate, I do think I do have to even as a consumer consider the possibility that Apple already
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:50.280]   knows that look, we're not going to be making these after 2022.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:55.640]   We do why put why put ourselves to the pain of doing a really huge platform rearchitecturing
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:58.960]   when we know we're not going to we're not interested in doing in continuing this any
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:38:59.960]   further.
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:04.840]   But by the same by the same coin, it could be that we know that we're going to continue
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:10.680]   to do the Mac Mac OS, but we're going to make such a radical change to it that small changes
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:16.920]   in 2016 or 2017 or 2015 are going to be wasted when it's all thrown away in 2018 when we
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:21.920]   finally unveil the new version of Mac OS 12 or Mac OS 13.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:25.280]   So I don't I wouldn't rule it out.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.040]   I wouldn't rule it out at all.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.880]   The one thing that too, to Andy's point, it is incredibly frustrating and like again,
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.760]   people are going to say that I'm making apologies here, but it's incredibly frustrating if you
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:38.520]   look at it from Apple's perspective where they control everything in iOS device and
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:42.240]   you look at the A10 chipset and you look at what they even do with the A9 chipset compared
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:47.520]   to Intel's core M line and it's it's night and day, Apple's producing some of the best
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:51.160]   silicon right now in the business and they have no control over Intel and Intel had a
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:56.440]   very painful process going into 14 nanometer with Skylake and features kept getting pushed
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.600]   out and features are still being pushed out a lot of the stuff that they want like the
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:02.720]   LD DDR4 and the DisplayPort 1.4.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:06.880]   That stuff is just being pushed out to Kaby Lake to coffee Lake to Cannon Lake and there's
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:10.680]   no clear end in sight and you look at what what is upsetting a lot of people about these
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:13.760]   Macs and it's yes, some of it is choices Apple made.
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:17.120]   They could use desktop components or they could use different architectures, but to make
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:20.800]   the kind of machines they want to make, they just don't have the parts available and these
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:24.640]   machines were supposed to ship early in the year and it just literally Intel and AMD could
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:28.760]   not get their acts together and at a certain point, the frustration level to that I think
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:33.560]   is going to be so severe that Apple is starts looking at at homegrown internals and whether
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:39.280]   it is like an x86 license or whether it is an ARM based computer, it's just going to to
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.120]   make the devices that they want to make.
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:45.640]   I don't think they're going to be able to rely on other companies shipping on time because
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:50.400]   clearly for the last two years and yeah, the Mac Pro is completely embarrassing, but if
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:54.920]   you look at the other devices, there's almost nothing in there that could not be fixed by
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.960]   those companies having shipped the silicon.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.440]   They said that they would ship in the time frame.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:03.720]   They said that they would ship it and I don't know how much longer Apple put up with that.
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:09.640]   One of Jason Stel's points too is that yeah, Apple has the manpower to create a custom
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:18.240]   chip for macOS, but sad to say it would be probably a mistake to take any energy and
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.240]   put it into the Mac at this point.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:24.480]   I think a lot of us think that there's an unlimited, I mean, Apple has all the money
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:29.240]   in the world, they could hire as many people as they need, but really there is a limited
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:32.520]   supply of great engineers.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:36.680]   They're great, not not good ones, not average ones, but great engineers that are required
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.560]   to work at the level that they're working at.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:44.520]   There is and everyone that can do that well is gainfully employed and it's very competitive
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:49.200]   and Apple has to set priorities on what they're going to spend engineering resources on and
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:53.280]   it doesn't, I don't think it makes sense for them to necessarily do that on a more niche
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.280]   market.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:58.400]   Andy spoke to earlier, I'm trying to figure out what happens here.
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:02.720]   I think that when we think about, when we look down the path and we're not sure whether
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:07.600]   Apple's going to continue to really invest in the professional market, that has all kinds
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:08.600]   of ripples.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.040]   It has, should I be using Final Cut Pro?
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:12.520]   Should I be using Omni Grafels?
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:18.920]   Should I be using all those things start to become these Mac-only solutions start to think
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:23.840]   about whether that makes sense when you're looking at a two, three, four year trajectory.
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.360]   If you don't feel like Apple's really going to move down that path, so it affects more
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:30.600]   than just Apple, it affects all of these support systems that are around them.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.160]   Yeah, I mean, that's the point.
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:39.040]   They do have a limited personnel to attack any problem, but they can do anything they
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:43.600]   want to do if they think it's important, if that's something that they want to do.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:49.160]   I think that it really remains, no matter what Apple might say when they're asked this question,
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:54.000]   it remains to be seen if they are committed to the Mac at this point.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   We're looking now at this point, we're really sifting through the numbers, looking for signs
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.720]   that the Mac is part of Apple's future.
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:09.840]   I'm embarrassed to admit it, and I've only had this for a day, but at this point, I'm
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:13.640]   really close to thinking I should get one of these to replace the iMac at home.
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:16.920]   I'm talking about the Surface Studio.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:20.960]   I think that that's the real risk at this point for Apple is that they are going to be
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:22.800]   out-innovated if they're not careful.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.400]   Well, and also it comes in ecosystem.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:28.360]   This is really what an app, this should have been, maybe they will, who knows.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:34.200]   In fact, next break, we're going to talk about what Apple might be doing in the new year.
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:42.400]   Yeah, I would love to see Apple do this, but I think they won't because of the touch.
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.440]   Well, and I think that this is my next computer.
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.440]   This is what I want.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:48.080]   And I think that there's this chain reaction that occurs.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:52.760]   If Apple falls behind on this, I think it's more important than just it's more of a problem.
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:56.000]   Than just 15% of their market.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   If you start right now at an airport or most of your devices.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.840]   Well, it's not going to make me run out and buy a Windows phone.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.000]   No, no, no, I wouldn't say that.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   I don't know the HP Elite, Leo.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.480]   Actually, maybe.
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:11.880]   But there's a certain lock-in that starts to break up when you...
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:15.640]   I don't think there's a Windows phone necessarily, but there's all these other things that you
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.440]   start moving away from.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:24.200]   Once all my Apple stuff works together and my whole life makes sense with all these things
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.840]   connected, starts to get broken up.
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:28.480]   It starts to weaken the entire platform.
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:32.480]   And we have to remember that a lot of people who are making decisions are making them using
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.480]   a Mac.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:37.040]   They stopped doing that, then they started going back to making them using Windows or
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.240]   something else.
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:44.880]   I remember talking about this years ago, but when we were talking about Flash and I was
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:47.400]   talking to a guy in an airport and he said, "Oh, I have to rewrite our whole website."
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:50.560]   Because the CEO got an iPhone and he can't get to the website.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.520]   Now I have to change everything.
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:55.560]   It just not one guy having an iPhone.
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:59.320]   It affected enormous impact.
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:05.240]   So I think that it's risky for Apple not to pay attention to this market, but I'm not
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:06.240]   sure they will.
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.960]   I guess I would say I'm not sure they are.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:13.520]   I think that the aggressive move we saw with connections to the MacBook Pro, you make those
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:19.920]   kind of bold statements when there's less risk involved, in my opinion.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:23.800]   Well, it's also, I mean, you could be really rich and you could just have a couple of people
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.360]   at your house and you're like, "Oh, we can't cut the grass and blow the snow."
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:29.360]   And as much as we really want to cut the grass, we're going to have to blow the snow this
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:30.360]   year.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:33.400]   And it's just the kind of tough choices that any small group of people make.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:36.200]   And then you can get an argument whether that should be a big group of people and you
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.400]   should change to a different kind of organizational structure.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:44.440]   But that's not something most companies survive.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:45.440]   Let's take a break.
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.120]   When we come back, we're going to talk positives.
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:48.280]   Let's talk futures.
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:50.080]   What is Apple up to for next year?
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.520]   We should be getting new iPads.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.800]   We can even do a little bit of talking about the iPhone.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:59.720]   I've talked to a lot of people now who deferred on the iPhone 7, even though they were due.
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:02.720]   It was their two-year anniversary.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.400]   And iPhone 6 has talked to somebody yesterday.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:11.400]   They said, "It's not enough of a change.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.400]   I think I'm going to wait for eight."
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:14.400]   So angry, Apple took away their bezels and they're charging wirelessly.
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:15.400]   Well, I'm curious.
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:16.400]   I don't get it.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:17.400]   Let's see.
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:20.040]   We'll talk a little bit about -- I want to lift this up a little bit because it is kind
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:23.680]   of gloomy to start talking about horrors.
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:27.960]   Microsoft doing a better desktop than Apple.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:30.800]   I should point out this is Microsoft's first desktop computer.
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:35.800]   We've done laptops.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:43.080]   To come out of the box with a desktop computer that's as compelling as this is pretty impressive.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:44.080]   Let's take a break.
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.560]   Talk about rocket mortgage.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:52.160]   Talk about impressive rocket mortgage is bringing the mortgage process into the 21st
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:53.160]   century.
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.200]   Fast, powerful.
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:47:00.000]   Most importantly, I think to you and to me, completely online.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.760]   On the days when you want to go into the mortgage office and apply for a loan and bring back
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:09.520]   boxes of paper or even go through the paperwork upstairs in the attic or in your filing cabinet
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.280]   trying to find bank statements and pay stubs, not with rocket mortgage.
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:15.880]   You can do it all online, including file bank statements and pay stubs with the touch
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:16.880]   of a button.
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:17.880]   You don't even have to get up from the couch.
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.320]   You can do it on your phone or your tablet.
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:21.640]   And it's fast.
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:26.160]   It's easy, but you'll also get loan approval within minutes and it'll be a custom loan
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:28.840]   tailored for your specific needs.
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:29.840]   That's the beauty of this.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:34.920]   Rocket mortgage comes to you from quick and loans, the premier absolute premier mortgage
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:39.320]   loan company in the United States, the number one mortgage lender in the US.
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:44.440]   And they've made a product that is designed for us geeks online, quick and easy.
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:46.760]   You can manage it from the convenience of your couch.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:52.040]   If you're ready to refi or maybe you want to buy a new house, maybe it's a few months
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:53.040]   from now.
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.040]   Who knows?
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:56.640]   Maybe you'll be at an open house on Sunday and say, remember that?
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.600]   What was that Leo was talking about?
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:47:59.600]   Rocket mortgage?
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:00.600]   Where is that?
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:01.600]   Quickandlones.com/macbreak.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.760]   That's what you need to remember.
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:09.000]   Quickandlones.com/macbreak.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.400]   They call it rocket mortgage, but it's at quickandlones.com/macbreak.
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:18.840]   Equal housing, lender, licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access.org number 30,
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:24.880]   30 we thank Rocket Mortgage from Quick and Loans by giving us the wherewithal to do Mac
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:27.600]   Break Weekly Renee Richie from imore.com.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:31.120]   Alex Lindsay from Pixelcore.com.
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.960]   And of course Andy is on.
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.480]   It's gone again.
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:38.600]   You feel like he's secretly tending to something extremely important.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:40.640]   I think he's coming for your cake.
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:41.640]   Maybe.
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:42.640]   Maybe.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:43.640]   I want to eat that cake.
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:44.640]   Did you see that?
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:46.520]   We didn't talk about it yet.
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:47.520]   It's my birthday today.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:48.520]   Happy birthday, Leo.
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:49.520]   It's a big birthday.
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.960]   It's my 60th birthday today.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:58.360]   It's also next month the anniversary, not even next month, like in two weeks, the 40th anniversary
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:05.880]   of getting my FCC third class license and beginning my career in broadcasting 40 years.
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:10.520]   I remember back then looking at job listings that said you have to have three to five years
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:12.880]   experience and I thought, oh, that's forever.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:19.560]   I don't see many job listings saying you need to have 40 years of experience unfortunately.
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.920]   Maybe that's, I'm on the other side, aren't I?
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:24.640]   But Lisa went out and got me a cake that they took.
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:30.880]   She brought them, I guess, the bobblehead and they have crafted with fondant a cake that
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:37.160]   says happy birthday, Leo, and has me on it, the bobblehead of me on it.
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:41.440]   It is a terrifying likeness, but it's probably, it's really wild.
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:43.720]   I don't even know what's inside.
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:44.720]   It could just be cardboard.
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:48.520]   But I have a feeling it's a really good cake.
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:50.320]   Anyway, thank you.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.320]   Thank you.
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:55.120]   Can you just hold it next to the monitor and Andy and I will try to take a bite?
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:56.520]   It smells really good.
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:57.520]   I could smell it.
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:00.160]   I was going to say you want terrifying weight until like someone you know is biting into
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.160]   your head.
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:04.000]   Yeah, we should actually, we will save that.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   That's going to be your screen saver.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.960]   Yeah, we'll save that.
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:09.720]   Maybe a rat will bite into it if I save it too long.
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:10.720]   So happy news.
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:12.680]   Let's talk about happy news.
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:20.240]   Apple, well, you saw 91% of all the smartphone profits in the world go into Apple's pocket.
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:24.880]   That's enough to make Apple look at stuff when people say, how that MacBook Pro, it ain't
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:28.120]   all it should be and go, well, yeah, who cares?
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:29.360]   Who cares?
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:36.640]   This is for Q3 2016, not even Q4, which will be mostly the new iPhone sales.
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:40.720]   91% of profits worldwide.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:42.720]   So sell all the phones you want, Samsung.
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:43.720]   Doesn't matter.
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:46.120]   They have a jet black one coming out, Leo.
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:47.440]   You just wait.
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.760]   I would buy a jet.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:50.720]   You know, I would buy a jet black iPad.
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:52.800]   You think they'll do jet black iPads?
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:58.360]   I wonder how resilient the process is at scale because it's already chips and scratches.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:02.760]   Well, also wonder how many rejects they get in the manufacturing process just for that
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:03.760]   small area.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:06.360]   I love it so much that I just didn't.
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:07.680]   You know, I really couldn't.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:08.680]   It's really that much better.
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:10.920]   It's really come off and feel it.
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:11.920]   I agree with you.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:17.320]   I was I'm not someone who gets all starry eyed about like, Oh, look, look at the design
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:20.880]   of the color of the outside of it before I put my case on it.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:22.320]   But I was like, that's it.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:23.480]   That's a really nice.
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.680]   That's a really nice piece of it.
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:29.000]   It looks like an enamel cigarette case from the 1920s of somebody who would style and
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   money.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.080]   Yes, it's very stylish.
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:35.480]   And I have the micro abrasions.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:38.920]   I'm fairly careful, but I still put it in my pocket and stuff.
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:43.640]   And on the corner, particularly where you kind of slide it into things, there are very
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:44.640]   fine abrasions.
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:47.400]   You can barely see unless you angle it just so.
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:50.560]   And I find that just a nice patina of where I can live with that.
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:53.280]   Good, good, honest where, as they say on Antiques Roadshow.
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.760]   That's how you know it's not a fake.
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:56.800]   It's not that bad.
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.600]   That was a box of bolts.
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:02.080]   It's not a hunk of junk, but it's a facetious side of the gallon.
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:05.000]   Don't forget Alex Lindsey designed the Princess Emma.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.600]   Alex Starstein did not paint it.
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:08.600]   Whatever.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:09.600]   I created it.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:10.600]   I put some texture on it.
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:11.600]   That thing was scratch proof.
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:15.040]   That thing was shiny new out of the factory.
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:16.520]   You know, I realized they got a scratch on it.
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:18.680]   They trashed it and he bottled it.
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:23.920]   That's a sort of design you can commit to when you have an unlimited supply of unpaid
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:24.920]   slave robot labor.
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:25.920]   That's right.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:26.920]   Don't fall out in scratches.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:27.920]   Gungan.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:34.160]   Well, I went to, it was in Chicago over the weekend and I went to the bean and I realized
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:37.440]   that all of my, the scale and all my grit was off on the queen show.
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:40.800]   Because I was sitting there looking at it going, it was actually much finer.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:45.240]   It's got to be inspired by Princess Elma and a M idola's starship.
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:49.040]   I don't know, but it was, I wish it had existed when I was working on the textures because
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:54.080]   it was, it was the perfect scale, you know, test for, for Chrome.
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:58.440]   So it was pretty much can guarantee that nobody saw who saw episode one was saying to themselves,
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:01.960]   you know, the grit is just the scale of the grit is off.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.520]   Why do you mean scale correct?
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:06.640]   The reality is, is it would just look so smooth.
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:10.080]   You know, the whole thing was trying to give it some scale, you know, so you had to figure
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:13.480]   out how to give it enough grit that it just, it had a scale.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:17.800]   The hardest part is actually the sun coming across because the, when something comes across
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:22.480]   a really smooth surface, the dust on the, on the surface actually lights up before the
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:24.720]   surface does, you know, because the dust is just a little off.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:28.200]   If you watch your desk, when the sun comes across, you'll see all, it goes across all
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:31.600]   your dust and then it hits the desk anyway.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:34.520]   So those were, that's, that was my life for like a year and a half.
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:37.440]   It's a J type 327 newbie and royal starship.
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:42.240]   I have to apologize for not using the proper terminology.
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:44.480]   But boy, was that a pretty beast.
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:46.600]   What's a new, hello, a ride.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:49.680]   It's a, it's a very shiny 50s version of an S R, S R 71.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:51.680]   It is, isn't it?
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:54.360]   Was it, was it, was it modeled on the blackbird?
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:55.360]   Oh, yes.
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:57.360]   It is.
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:58.360]   It's like the X, it's like the X, man, but classy.
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:53:59.360]   Inspired by.
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:00.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:02.800]   It looks like an industrial word for aerospace.
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:03.800]   Sorry.
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:09.000]   It looks like an industry award in the aerospace engineering sector.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.440]   It's pretty gorgeous.
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:16.360]   So according to Wookieepedia, it is, it is the Naboo Royal Starship is a modified J type
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:19.480]   327 newbie and starship queen.
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:22.000]   I said princess, but she was queen, Amidala.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   Yes.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   Elected queen.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   Elected queen.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.520]   That's what we need.
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:29.520]   We all need that.
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.520]   We all need electric.
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:32.680]   By the way, I'm, I'm, I'm going through my pockets.
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:35.240]   I realize this is, I carry this in my pockets all the time.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:38.360]   This is a type C to USB adapter.
[00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:40.280]   This is like, I carry this in my pockets.
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:41.640]   Like what we've reduced you to.
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:43.680]   It's like, it's like a worry bead.
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:46.120]   I just have this because you never know.
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:49.280]   You know, Sandis has, well, I'll save that for later.
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:50.440]   Oh, save it.
[00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:51.440]   Something good?
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:52.440]   Yeah.
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:53.440]   Well, I know what you found.
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:54.840]   I know because Father Roberts showed me one.
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:56.560]   And we'll talk about in a little bit.
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:57.560]   Okay.
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:00.160]   New micro bezel.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:04.680]   iPad micro bezel.
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:06.880]   Micro bezel all the things to leave them in a bezel.
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:08.880]   Not a tiny bezel, but a micro bezel.
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:13.880]   It's a 10.9 inch iPad with a footprint the same as a 9.7 inch iPad.
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:18.760]   But thicker, this is coming from Ben Lovejoy at 9 to 5 Mac.
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:23.600]   Actually originally came from Mako Takara, which is a Japanese site, but it's in Japanese.
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:25.600]   So we can't really understand what they're saying.
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:27.080]   Do they have English at the bottom?
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:28.080]   Do they?
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:29.080]   Oh, here it is.
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:30.080]   Okay.
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:36.160]   So, according to an informed Cersei and Taehuan, the bezel list 10.9 inch iPad model is the
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:41.480]   same size as the 9.7, but it's a little thicker, seven and a half millimeters.
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:42.680]   That's the same as the iPad Air.
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:43.680]   I'm doomed.
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:45.280]   How will they survive?
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:46.480]   It's not bezel list, by the way.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.440]   In fact, it's not even really a micro bezel.
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:50.920]   Is it the bezel?
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:53.000]   You have to have enough to handle the product.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   It turns out.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   Right.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   And a camera.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:02.400]   So this might be telegraphing a big change coming to Apple that has been rumored for
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:06.720]   the iPhone 8, the removal of the physical home button.
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:07.720]   That's been in the works.
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:11.240]   I started writing about that three years ago, that that was a project that they were looking
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:12.240]   to...
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:16.720]   Because it's hard to make devices that have bigger screens, but are still comfortable
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:17.880]   for the hand.
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:22.040]   And that was one of the projects was to see if they could maximize the ratio of screen
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:23.560]   to surface on the front of devices.
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:27.760]   To do that, Apple's a victim of their own forward thinking sometimes.
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:31.760]   So they put touch ID in the home button and that makes it harder to remove.
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:34.280]   If they hadn't put touch ID there, then you just throw away the home button.
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:35.280]   It's fine.
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:37.560]   But then you had to figure out some other place to put touch ID now.
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:39.440]   And it's the same to some extent with lightning.
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:40.440]   If you didn't do...
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:43.640]   Lightning let them get to a better connector three years earlier, but now everyone's going
[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:44.640]   to USB-C.
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:47.160]   And can you change people?
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:49.720]   How many years have you had to wait before you change people again?
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:51.480]   So this is one of those things where...
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:52.480]   Sorry.
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:57.280]   I'm just going to say, I don't know if Apple wouldn't put USB-C on the phone because it
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:58.280]   gives up all the control they have.
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:56:59.600]   It's been ready back then.
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:04.920]   So the control is super nice, but my understanding is the same team worked on lightning in USB-C
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:09.880]   and it was 10 years after the dock connector and it just USB-C wasn't happening.
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:11.920]   And they tend not to be a very patient company.
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:14.800]   Sometimes they're incredibly patient, like with radio technologies, but they just needed
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:19.200]   to move forward and there was no guarantee when USB-C would be available.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:24.600]   I think they got to market in 2012 with lightning, which gave them four years, that they would
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:27.200]   have still been on a dock connector otherwise.
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:30.360]   And that's four years is a long time in technology, especially when they wanted to reduce the
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:35.120]   size for iPhone 5 and for iPad Air 2 and all those other devices.
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:36.760]   So a lot of the stuff is...
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:40.560]   It's like shooting bullets that are already in the air, a lot of the timing on these things.
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:41.560]   And I think the...
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:44.920]   It took them many years to get to the bezels design and maybe they wanted to get it out
[00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:45.920]   this year.
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:49.160]   But I think next year for sure we'll start seeing those brand new designs.
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:52.320]   So what do they do for a home button?
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:53.320]   It's the...
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:54.320]   Right now the haptics...
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:56.200]   Right now it's a virtual home button already.
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:57.200]   It's entirely virtualized.
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:58.200]   It just has a separate area.
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:00.240]   So is it on the screen?
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:01.640]   I mean, I believe that was one of them.
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:05.680]   I don't know if that's going to be end up shipping, but at least some of them were...
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:08.520]   There was an area of the screen basically that would be a virtual home button.
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:09.520]   Right.
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:15.480]   It would be super, super difficult to pull that off without some sort of tactile landing
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:18.880]   pad you could get by feel.
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:22.320]   I'm sure they wouldn't do that unless they were very, very confident that there was a
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:26.880]   way that it would not interfere with people who don't have the gift of sight, don't have
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:29.040]   the ability to see a limited target.
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:30.040]   Oh yeah, because there's no...
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:32.880]   Well there are back of the device options like Android has.
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:36.080]   There's also side button options that I think have been tested as well.
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:39.000]   I mean, I guess it depends on which one works best when they have to be done.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:43.200]   And of course the hard part is if you have something like this, it becomes more complicated
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.160]   to have something on the back.
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:50.840]   And the other thing is it has to be really, really good at unwanted tap rejection because
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:54.040]   a bezel is actually really important.
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:59:00.000]   You've got to have a place to hold that thing without tip tapping on an ad on a webpage.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   One of the things I like about the newest kindles is that it just has this really thick margin
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.880]   on the side of it so that doesn't matter how you hold it, you can hold it safely without
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:10.680]   accidentally triggering anything.
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:11.680]   So I hope they...
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:14.600]   I'm sure they thought about this, but it's going to be...
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:19.160]   It's a non-trivial thing on so many different levels to reduce the size of the bezel.
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:22.160]   It is like the proverbial wanting to pet a porcupine.
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:23.160]   You can do it.
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.840]   You got to really want to do it though.
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:28.680]   It's one of those things where when Apple doesn't do it, they're not innovating their
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:29.680]   doom.
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:30.680]   Do I get hardware designed up?
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:31.680]   You know, Samsung can do it.
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:33.920]   And then when they do do it, I was like, "Why the hell did they do this?
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:35.920]   It's the worst."
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:37.720]   Well, all right.
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:39.040]   I do like the idea...
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:42.240]   Look, I'm convinced now that the iPad Pro is the future for the iPad.
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:44.560]   Are they going to eliminate non-Pro iPads?
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:48.000]   Are these going to be the new iPads will all be pros?
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.040]   Everything is pro than nothing is.
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:52.040]   That's sort of the incredible line.
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:54.240]   I'm just going to add those features.
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:56.920]   They'll add pencil support and they'll add smart connector support.
[00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:59.400]   And eventually all the iPads will just have those features.
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.880]   And then they'll figure out how to brand it, the new iPad.
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:02.880]   Okay.
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:03.880]   Okay.
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:05.880]   That makes sense.
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:06.880]   Is it...
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:09.160]   I've been really resisting talking about the iPhone 8.
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:10.160]   Is it time?
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:11.160]   We can.
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:15.720]   I mean, I think the wireless charging, if they can do what I think they're going to do with
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:16.720]   it.
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:17.720]   It just doesn't...
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:21.160]   You do that, but you can't do that with a metal device.
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.160]   So what do you...
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.320]   So, rumor is it's going to go back to...
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.320]   You can.
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.920]   I mean, Qualcomm filed a patent two years ago that was inductive charging through metal.
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:30.840]   But I don't know of anyone who's actually deployed it in real life yet.
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.720]   But I think Apple has been working on...
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.720]   And this was...
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:36.480]   I don't think it's a secret anymore because it's been talked about for a couple of years.
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.800]   Distance charging, where you don't need to go put on a little pad.
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:41.400]   You put it next to your iMac or you put it...
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.480]   You come in a room that has a device which is...
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.320]   What makes those router rumors really weird?
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.560]   What device would that be?
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.600]   And it has some sort of station.
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:51.840]   And if you're within range of that station, it just charges.
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:52.840]   Which is sort of kind of...
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:54.840]   I don't want to use a word magical, but that is sort of magical.
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:55.840]   It's like air charging.
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:56.840]   How do you forget to...
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:57.840]   Yeah.
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:58.840]   How many times do you forget to actually plug in?
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:00:59.840]   Yeah.
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:00.840]   Wow.
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:01.840]   Where this would just be like...
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:04.000]   It was great when they made the time capsule and it would just back up.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.800]   So if you walk into a room and it just charges, that would be fantastic.
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:08.800]   Okay.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:14.800]   Anything else to say?
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:18.520]   When do you think this will be spring, March that will announce the new iPads?
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:19.840]   So far, yeah.
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:20.840]   I believe, yeah.
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.680]   Spring and then again fall for the iPhones.
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:23.680]   Right.
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:27.680]   And probably the other Macs, like the desktop e-Macs in the spring as well.
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.480]   Oh, let's talk about that.
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:30.480]   That's...
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:31.480]   I knew I had something.
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:32.480]   So what are we...
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:35.520]   Whether the Macs, we're going to see iMacs, we're going to see Mac Pros, we're going to
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:36.520]   see Mac Minis.
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:37.520]   What are we going to see?
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:38.520]   It's the same thing.
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:41.960]   I mean, Apple uses doesn't use big desktop components for most of their computers, so
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:46.440]   they suffer the same constraints that they have on the MacBook Pros with things like the...
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:47.440]   Until...
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:52.360]   As of last year, Intel wasn't making chips anymore for the 21.5-inch iMac, so Apple kept
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:55.000]   the old chip and just used faster versions of it.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   So what do you do this year?
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.080]   I mean, there's just no Skylake version of it.
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:01.600]   And you know, KB Lake, I don't think, was ready, at least not in the quad-core version
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:06.440]   or the ones with the Iris Pro graphics that they also use in addition to the discrete graphics
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:07.440]   for power saving.
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.040]   They'll have power saving at the top, it's kind of silly.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:12.600]   But all this stuff is embedded in there.
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.880]   And just, you know, you're again, you're on Intel and AMD's timeline, and you could just
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:20.880]   rev the iMac and stick USB-C ports along the back, but that's not a proper rev.
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.440]   And then, you know, again, they're not innovating.
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:26.080]   So I think those are just constrained by timeline, and we'll see those in the spring.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:30.920]   And they'll just be souped up versions of what we have now with USB-C Tunt Thunderbolt
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:31.920]   3.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:32.920]   I think that...
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:36.400]   I do think that there's getting to a point for Apple in the same way that I think
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:40.120]   iTunes got to a point where it critically had to have a subscription service.
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:44.320]   I think that they critically have to have touch screen in the next iMacs, or they're
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:47.320]   going to start seeing a lot of...
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:48.320]   No, that's...
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:49.320]   Really?
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:52.400]   I thought that was just a foregone conclusion that that's never going to happen.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.400]   That's never going to happen.
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:54.400]   You think that's going to happen?
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:55.400]   You think that's going to happen?
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.960]   You have to rig right back OS.
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:00.680]   The thing is, I guess I would argue that you don't.
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:04.920]   You know, like, I've definitely, you know, worked with touch screens that have been converted
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:06.640]   iMacs that have been converted for touch.
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:07.640]   Those are okay.
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:08.640]   It's just fine.
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:09.640]   Like, this whole thing is just...
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:10.640]   It's just...
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:11.640]   You don't need to...
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:16.640]   I can still use a mouse and a keyboard, and then when I want to draw on something, I can
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.640]   draw on it.
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.640]   You know, like, I don't need it.
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.560]   I don't need you to change every little button.
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:23.640]   You know, you can do that over time if you want, but just let me draw when I want to
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:25.400]   draw and work when I want to work.
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:29.960]   And, you know, I think that Microsoft is way ahead of them, and it's going to become
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:33.320]   problematic for them if they don't sort it out soon.
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:37.280]   You know, in the same way that they lost, I mean, they never needed to see the music
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:38.760]   industry just botifying.
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:43.120]   You know, it was, you know, hanging on to ownership for three or four years longer than
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:46.480]   they had to, you know, was cost them a lot.
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:49.840]   Well, now I might have to hold off because I was really thinking of getting a Surface
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:52.640]   Studio in my home to replace.
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:55.320]   Well, it may not ship until next spring anyway, Leo.
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:58.480]   So you probably by the time you get one, you'll be able to at least see the other.
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.480]   Here's the problem.
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:00.480]   Okay.
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:03.280]   This one that we have in front of me, I ordered right away is the...
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:08.280]   base unit, which is $3,000.
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.600]   And it's only an I-5.
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.000]   It's only eight gigs of RAM.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.840]   It's kind of underpowered.
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:19.160]   So the one that I would probably want if I'm going to replace a very nice 5K iMac was
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:22.200]   is $4,000.
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:25.400]   That's a lot of money for something I'm only using for four months.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:26.400]   Yeah.
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.400]   Finally, it's only for four months.
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:29.400]   I think it's three.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:30.400]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.400]   But, well, but okay.
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:32.400]   So, okay.
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:33.400]   I don't...
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:36.840]   First of all, I don't buy that they ever do a touchscreen period.
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:39.960]   But if they did, would I then feel like, "Oh crap, I should have bought a touchscreen
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:40.960]   iMac."
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:41.960]   I doubt it.
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:45.680]   I don't see them ever doing that.
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:51.840]   The only way that they would do that is if, like I said before, if they plan to pull
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:56.360]   the damnedest rabbit out of the hat they've ever pulled and they're hiding...
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:05:01.680]   In secret developing the true next generation version of the Mac.
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:02.680]   If they...
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:08.200]   Because if they were to do that, then they would have to severely inconvenience everybody
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.560]   at every level whatsoever.
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.560]   And so they could...
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:13.880]   They've got no problems with doing that.
[01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:17.000]   But they would want to have a big upshot, which is to say, "Hey, look, we've actually
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.600]   got something that it's...
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.080]   We've taken everything we've learned from...
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:25.560]   We've spoken before about how we've taken what we've learned about the Macintosh and
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:30.240]   used it to improve iOS and taken everything we've learned about iOS and used it to improve
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.240]   Mac OS.
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:36.600]   And now we've taken everything we've learned about everything to create a brand new version
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:37.680]   of the Mac.
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.200]   We'd like to show it to you right now.
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:40.200]   I'm amazing.
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.200]   Yeah.
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.200]   It's amazing.
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:45.360]   I mean, you can never say never because things like Swift, there were so few people
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:48.760]   in you about Swift that Craig had to send out an email to his entire organization at
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:52.280]   WWDC to say, "Hey, we've got this new thing called Swift and they're just all smacked
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:53.920]   their heads collectively."
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:56.520]   And the new MacBook Pro, most of the people involved in that...
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:00.120]   Sorry, the new Mac Pro, most people involved in that keynote had never even heard of it.
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:01.120]   So there are...
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:03.560]   Apple's one of those companies that really could pull a rabbit out of their hat, but
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:07.360]   the amount of work that it would take to make a good touchscreen iMac, I think, is
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:10.960]   hard to contain.
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:15.680]   I kind of abandoned the iPhone rumors prematurely according to 9-5 Mac.
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:20.760]   Again, Ben Lovejoy, Apple is working with LG on a 3D camera.
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:23.640]   This comes actually from the Korea Economic Daily.
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:27.680]   A dual camera module, which supports 3D photography.
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:33.960]   Now we've seen this before HTC did a dual lens camera that did 3D, two very little
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:35.520]   interest.
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:36.520]   Nobody wanted it.
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.680]   In fact, people didn't like it.
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:39.520]   Remember that CES, everything was 3D.
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.520]   Everything was 3D.
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:44.440]   Power-stringer and Seth Rogen in 3D glasses, and then every camera was 3D.
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:45.440]   I think a dual...
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:52.200]   I really like what they've done with the dual sensors on the new iPhone 7S and the 7S.
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.200]   Not 7S.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:56.120]   I just made that up on the new 7 Plus.
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:58.280]   I use it all the time.
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:06:59.840]   It's nice to have that zoom.
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:02.520]   They're super serious about cameras because they know it's one of the things that makes
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:03.520]   people upgrade.
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:08.280]   They put a lot of wood behind the arrows on the camera and the photos' teams.
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:10.600]   How about this curved screen stuff?
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:11.600]   OLED.
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:15.120]   Here, we're conflicting stories on OLED that there aren't enough OLEDs in the world for
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:17.080]   Apple to make an OLED screen.
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:21.120]   This is the latest, though, from Wall Street Journal yesterday.
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:26.000]   An iPhone with curved screen could be on store shelves as soon as next year.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.920]   Apple's suppliers say they've been asked to increase the output of thinner OLED displays.
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:35.680]   Apparently, according to 9-5 Mac, there's many as nine prototypes being passed around
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:37.960]   at Apple right now.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:42.600]   They also want to do higher resolution than the current Samsung OLEDs, which would be very
[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:43.600]   interesting.
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:46.640]   Apple has never been a leader in the resolution race.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.640]   I'm sorry, 10 prototypes.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:52.680]   When they first did retina, they leapt ahead in terms of resolution.
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:54.080]   Then they were quite happy with that.
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:55.600]   They'll probably do the same sort of.
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:58.320]   They'll be one next jump and they'll be happy with that for a few years.
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.320]   I stand corrected.
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:00.320]   You're right.
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:03.600]   The first retina iPhone was the first to really do a high-res display, and then everybody
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:06.440]   did even higher res.
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:09.280]   I haven't used any phones with curved surfaces.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:12.880]   What do we really think is the key advantage of a curved surface?
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.400]   I don't get that at all.
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:15.400]   It's cosmetic.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:20.000]   In fact, I was thinking about the Galaxy S8, which I would presumably be announced in the
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.480]   spring at Mobile World Congress.
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:25.920]   The rumor is there's going to be a curved and a non-curved edition.
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:27.120]   I had the curved note.
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:29.520]   I had the curved S6, the S7.
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.360]   I'm thinking, I just want a flat screen.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:32.360]   That's not...
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:34.200]   The edge is curved as the edge or...
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:36.720]   It goes around a little bit.
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:40.600]   The idea for the curve originally, when they made the iPhone 6 version, was because people
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:41.600]   were using...
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:42.960]   They built edge gestures into iOS.
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:46.200]   That would be more comfortable for you to do things like pulling from the left or right
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:49.440]   side if you didn't have a sharp edge under your finger.
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:51.600]   It's a little annoying.
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:55.840]   I actually would love to have a feature where I could turn off all the sideswipe stuff.
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:59.360]   I think I get all that sideswipe stuff way more often than I want to.
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:02.520]   I feel like if I wanted that, I would go to Android.
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:06.520]   That was their early answer to a no back button.
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:14.240]   Usually, the exit, the flip board article that I was reading prematurely, that's the side.
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:15.240]   Exactly.
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:16.240]   Stop it.
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:19.720]   I'm like, "Ah, I don't want it."
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:21.680]   I was on page 8, now I'm on page 1 again.
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:22.880]   I hate it when that happens.
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.400]   That is one negative of touch.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:27.880]   Touch has to be smart.
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.960]   For instance, a palm rejection has to be good on a screen this big.
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:34.200]   If I'm drawing, I don't want my palm to leave a smudge.
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.760]   I forget if his blogger are one of the sites.
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:39.280]   If you scroll even a slightly off-perfect vertical, it goes to a different article.
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:45.840]   I guess you're going to scroll an article.
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:49.920]   Battery replacements for some small number of iPhone 6s.
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:53.760]   I went on that one.
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:10:00.960]   They were shutting down prematurely reporting that they'd run out of juice.
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:01.960]   40%.
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:09.840]   Anytime my iPhone 6 gets below 40%, it could go at any minute.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:13.520]   I was trying to get time to take it into the Apple Store and have someone look at it.
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:17.440]   I confirmed with that article that I have QC or whatever.
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:19.440]   It's Qs.
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:22.960]   In the past, I've had a serial number checker on the Apple site.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:25.080]   Maybe they still do, but here's how you could check.
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:29.600]   In the fourth and fifth position of your iPhone serial number, if you have Q3 through
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:33.880]   Q9 or QCDFGHJ.
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:34.960]   I have QC.
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:36.880]   You have QC.
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:38.960]   Basically, you're working away.
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:42.600]   Yesterday, I got all the way down to two, but all over the weekend, I'd be working away
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:43.640]   and I'd get to 40%.
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.480]   Then it just turned off.
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:46.480]   It's literally just...
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:49.800]   I quit all my apps trying to...
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:54.040]   Is it just something like Skype suddenly hitting it and it just suddenly decides it has less
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:55.200]   than it had?
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:59.320]   I don't really know what the deal is, but it doesn't do it every single time.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:05.440]   But generally, it has made me very good at charging it because I'm terrified of getting
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:07.440]   below 50% in action.
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:09.240]   Now, I have a second.
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:14.440]   Normally, you would assume that it was just software, the software that figured out was
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:19.520]   happening is it's not using very much data and suddenly I'm using something like a video
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:22.040]   or something, but it wasn't really happening that way.
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:24.200]   Let me talk it on the phone and suddenly just turn off.
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:29.040]   Apparently, it's the battery because according to this 905 Mac article, Apple Store staff
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.040]   will replace...
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:31.040]   If you...
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.040]   When you bring it in, they do this for free.
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:35.640]   Will replace the battery where spare parts went available, but otherwise will send out
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:39.760]   for battery replacement stock or sometimes replace the entire device.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.920]   I would love if they replace the entire device.
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:44.760]   Click a little nick on one side of it that would be great.
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:47.360]   With that device.
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:51.760]   One Apple store we spoke with says 905 Mac had as many as 60 battery parts ordered for
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:53.920]   customers waiting for repairs.
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:54.920]   This is a...
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:58.320]   Renee, do you know how many phones this is that are in these serial numbers?
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.320]   Is that a lot?
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:00.640]   No, I haven't seen any estimates.
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:03.480]   I mean, it always says it affects a tiny percentage of users, but when you're dealing
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.480]   with 100 million devices...
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:05.480]   Could be a million.
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:07.280]   You know, there'll be tens of millions.
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:08.280]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:09.920]   And this is a two-year-old...
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:11.160]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.920]   This is the one-year-old iPhone 6S.
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:15.640]   What I can say is that at least they're not catching on fire.
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:16.640]   The 6S is the touch disease and...
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:21.120]   Yeah, touch disease they've acknowledged, but they said it's your fault.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:25.760]   You must have dropped it, but we'll fix it for half the cost it's going to cost us.
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:28.820]   Yeah, no, I just wanted to because some people are getting confused as to which device has
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:29.820]   which problem.
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:33.960]   So it's a 6 Plus that has a touch disease and the 6S that has the battery disease.
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:35.680]   And the best part is I have both.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:37.080]   Oh, aren't you, Lex?
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:38.080]   I have.
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:43.360]   And I have dropped my 6 Plus once.
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.520]   And so I guess I fit into that.
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:48.240]   But yeah, it just suddenly goes and does funky things.
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.240]   And then my other one dies.
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:52.720]   So I'm kind of in, you know, Apple hell at the moment.
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:54.640]   So hopefully I'll get out of it soon.
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:57.200]   When you make that many phones, it's inevitable.
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:00.080]   There'll be some with some issues, I think.
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:01.080]   It's really...
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:02.080]   Especially when you redesign them.
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:05.640]   Like, again, they don't look like redesigns, but they're often a lot of the stuff is completely
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:06.640]   redesigned.
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:08.280]   So you're dealing with Rev A over and over and over again.
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:11.560]   Well, and to be fair, it doesn't blow up or anything could be worse.
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:12.560]   It's not catching fire.
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.560]   They're not...
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:17.360]   I mean, every flight that I'm on is like, if you have it, you cannot have a Samsung, you
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.720]   know, you know, on your person, you know, like...
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:20.720]   I know.
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:21.720]   I know.
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:22.720]   Like it is like...
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:23.720]   I know.
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:27.360]   Marshall will search all of you as you enter the plane and...
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:28.360]   I know.
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.360]   It's like...
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:30.360]   It's like...
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:31.360]   How many of the Jones and his awkward?
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:32.360]   Yeah.
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:34.360]   Having the notes, having like TV or something at this point.
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:38.160]   Somebody on Twitter said I should have 60 note sevens for my candles on my cake.
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:40.160]   I didn't want that.
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:42.160]   That would have been fun.
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:44.160]   I didn't want that.
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:46.680]   Although you could probably get them real cheap right now.
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:48.600]   Don't buy them.
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:49.600]   Don't buy them.
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:50.600]   Don't buy them.
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:51.600]   Don't buy them.
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:52.600]   Don't hoard them.
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:53.600]   Take them back.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:54.800]   You want to talk about...
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:55.800]   You guys got any...
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:00.400]   Before we take a break and get your picks of the week, any recommendations for black...
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.280]   Well, I guess this is Cyber Monday.
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:03.280]   No, this is...
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:04.280]   This is nothing.
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:05.280]   This is...
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:06.280]   No, this is over.
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:09.200]   Give things to people Tuesday or donate to people Tuesday.
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:10.200]   Call my Tuesday.
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:11.200]   Call my Tuesday.
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:12.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.200]   And shopping call my Tuesday.
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:17.200]   Or your leftover turkey is going to go bad if you don't find a way to finish it Tuesday.
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.200]   But oh, I'm making...
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:23.040]   In fact, it's on the stove right now as we talk simmering a hand bone with a bunch of
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:24.040]   beans.
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.440]   I make red beans and rice, baby.
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:26.440]   We had a hand bone for Thanksgiving.
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:27.440]   I know you are.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:29.640]   Can I do a quick cheat plug on all those lines?
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:30.640]   Yes.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.640]   So we launched something new.
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:32.640]   It's still in testing.
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:33.640]   It's called thrifter.com.
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:35.640]   And it just takes all the black Friday deals.
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:39.440]   You know, we have a team of people updating it all the time.
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:42.280]   I'm going to take to my keyboard something I haven't done the whole show.
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:44.080]   Smarter deals every day.
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.080]   Care thrifter.
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:46.480]   I like the name.
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:47.480]   You can just call it down.
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:49.920]   This is a great idea.
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:50.920]   This is a great idea.
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:51.920]   So you can sign up for this later.
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:52.920]   Yeah.
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:55.800]   He wanted to try to figure out how to get millennials to actually buy technology again.
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:58.800]   So he figured this was a way to do it.
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:14:59.800]   Yeah.
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:00.800]   Yeah.
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:01.800]   Well, this is good.
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:08.720]   So I will say that Amazon has the...
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:12.680]   We won't turn this to another episode of the Suvide podcast.
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:20.080]   But my favorite cooker, the ANOVA, is down from 149 to 129 on Amazon.
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.200]   Over the weekend, it was down to 99 bucks.
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:27.320]   And you should buy like seven of them so you can Suvide in the bathtub for that price.
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:31.320]   But yeah, that's definitely one of those change your life sort of devices.
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:32.320]   You don't already...
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:33.320]   And you really want...
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:34.320]   If you give one so one or three.
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.840]   I thought the email saying mine was being delayed till after the new year.
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:37.840]   I still haven't received it.
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:41.520]   I ordered that dopey thing you told me to get, Andy, a year ago.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:43.480]   Was it called the misfit?
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:44.480]   The Misfit?
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:45.480]   The mellow.
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:46.480]   Yeah.
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:47.480]   I got the email more too.
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:50.000]   I said it seemed interesting.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000]   I didn't say that.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000]   It does.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.080]   Well, you got to be careful with me.
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:58.960]   They must have found out that like, oh, there is absolutely no way we can keep food chilled
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:03.800]   in a reliable way so that it doesn't mind up getting people eating spoiled pork.
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:05.400]   Oh, so they have they canceled it now?
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.400]   I don't know.
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.400]   I'm saying I don't know.
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:08.400]   I'm saying I don't know.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.400]   Where did you get?
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:10.400]   You got the email, Renee.
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:11.400]   What did I say?
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:12.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.400]   Let me look, just pull it up.
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:17.920]   I'd say that we really wish we could ship it before Christmas, but we won't be able to
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:18.920]   do it until it be here.
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:21.040]   Now says shipping early 2017 on the website.
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:22.040]   Mellow update.
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:23.040]   Yeah.
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:26.080]   We're sad to say your mellow won't ship in time for the holidays, but it is for a good
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.080]   reason.
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:28.440]   Check out the video below for a word from our CEO.
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:31.000]   We didn't want you to die from pork.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:37.600]   Well, you know, I already trouble with Lisa because I not only heard that, but I ordered
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:42.640]   that crazy $1,500 June oven.
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:44.640]   He doesn't want any of this stuff in the house.
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:45.640]   So I'm already in trouble.
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:46.640]   I should probably just.
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:51.920]   But the validity of the of the ANOVA sous vide, I'm trying.
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:56.360]   I'm trying something brand new even as we speak, 24 hour bacon.
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:58.280]   Oh, very immediately.
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.280]   Yes.
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:00.280]   You say no more.
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:01.280]   Say no more.
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:08.400]   You take bacon because it's still it's still heat sealed in the package when you buy it.
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:13.320]   So you take the cardboard wrapper off of it, put it right in the in the water from 12
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:16.280]   to 24 hours, just like just like a brisket.
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:18.920]   And then you simply sear it quickly on one side.
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:22.800]   Basically the idea is that the bacon is completely cooked.
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:25.760]   And now you get to decide how crispy you want it to be.
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:28.440]   And so if you want it just to be like a brisket, you can have that.
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:31.080]   If you want to sear off all the fat, you can do that too.
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:33.240]   So I'm going for the full 24 hours.
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:36.720]   So at 9 p.m, I'm going to have a pound of bacon on my hands.
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:42.840]   So is this the one that now this is the the Bluetooth precision 800 watt version, 129
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:43.840]   bucks.
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:45.240]   And the reason is they have a new one.
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:48.240]   It's Wi-Fi plus Bluetooth and 900 watts.
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:49.240]   And that's the original 149.
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:54.400]   I don't know if that's the reason, but I also I also don't think you're I don't think
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:56.720]   you're missing out on anything by not getting the Wi-Fi.
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:59.400]   You know, I have to admit that I never use the Wi-Fi one.
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:00.600]   I never use Wi-Fi for it.
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:04.160]   I literally just dial in the temperature and call it a day.
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.840]   Why would you connect it to your phone?
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:07.760]   You don't need to know that, right?
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:10.520]   Well, it's the Bluetooth.
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:15.160]   The Bluetooth is good only in the sense that the new versions of the app that controls
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:16.160]   it.
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:20.280]   Rassai for this for the bacon, I had to actually look it up like what's the temperature and
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:23.880]   what's the time with the new versions of the app and with certain third party apps.
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:25.960]   You can just simply say, what are you cooking?
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:27.680]   I'm cooking a pork roast.
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:31.600]   How about how big is it about as big as a dog's head?
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.360]   What kind of a dog?
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:36.160]   A big old, okay.
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:43.240]   Now Amazon is selling this with a Rubbermaid container.
[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:45.400]   But you could just use a pot for that, right?
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:47.040]   If you had a big enough pot.
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:51.680]   You can use a pot as long as you can get the the as long as you get four inches of water
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:54.920]   and into it with the with the immersion.
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:55.920]   It's perfectly fine.
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:56.920]   I used a pot.
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:18:59.560]   I didn't buy nothing for it for the first like three months.
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:00.560]   I used this.
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:03.160]   They just use the deep pot that you usually cook sauce in.
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:07.000]   You didn't buy the sous vide kit with the hand pump?
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.000]   No.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000]   It's not my bag.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:15.400]   It's not my it's not my sous vide hand pump.
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:16.400]   Garling.
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:18.400]   No, it's a bacon sous vide.
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:20.480]   It's for all day bacon.
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:22.240]   It's a little how's your father?
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:24.240]   A little company.
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:26.160]   You and me.
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:27.520]   It's nice to have a vacuum sealer.
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:30.320]   You don't need it though.
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:32.520]   You can use you can use a Ziploc bag.
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:33.680]   That's good for good for you.
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:35.080]   You push the air out.
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:37.160]   You don't really have to have it be a vacuum, right?
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:40.840]   It's called the immersion technique where you you seal it.
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:42.360]   It's like dropping it in.
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:43.360]   Yeah.
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:44.840]   Well, yeah, because you leave one corner of it open.
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:48.280]   You let like a like giving a kiddies immortality.
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:49.280]   Wow.
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:50.280]   That's a reference.
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:51.280]   There you go.
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:52.280]   Deep catalog.
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:56.560]   You dip it in until the opening.
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:59.280]   The water forces out all the air through the bit that's open.
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:02.440]   You seal that last bit and then it's as good as your kiddies.
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:06.200]   You've got this little heel where there's a little bit of air.
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:07.200]   There you go.
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:08.800]   Which watch out for missiles.
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:15.240]   I have a sealer, but I just use Andy's technique of just dropping it in.
[01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:19.240]   The thing to think about when these are on sale is that you do want two or three of them
[01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:21.640]   because you have like really big party.
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:22.640]   You've got chicken.
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:23.640]   You've got meat.
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:26.240]   You've got vegetables and they all have to be different temperatures.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:29.400]   I did my entire Thanksgiving dinner.
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:31.320]   Suvete and I have a couple of them.
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:36.840]   So one of them was cooking the turkey at had to be something like 140 something for two
[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:37.840]   or three hours.
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:43.800]   And then I was using a second one to reheat the beans, the potatoes, the sides that I'd
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:46.640]   already cooked the day before and reheating those to 165.
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:49.640]   Like a good really, really super, super hot eating temperature.
[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:52.640]   So yeah, you can have two or three things going at the same time.
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:54.840]   Until you have to keep the deal, man.
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:57.840]   You've been cooking cookies that have been lately seared on the bottom.
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:58.840]   We just haven't lived.
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:04.760]   And I was talking to somebody that works at a large hotel chain.
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:07.760]   And the thing we have to remember is that they were like, oh well, like everything you
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:13.560]   eat at there is a souvete because that's how they maintain everything being the same.
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:16.840]   If you're going to order a steak, he said, and like everything's already all the steaks
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:20.880]   that we calculate you're going to need that day are already in the souvee cooked for whatever
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:21.880]   we pull them out.
[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:24.760]   Otherwise it would take forever to serve people.
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:26.680]   So this is a very much a part of production.
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:29.880]   It just happens to be something that we now as civilians get to play with.
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:36.240]   Don't spend all your money on the, you know, because there's $25 and under stocking stuffers
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:37.840]   on the iMOR site.
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:40.000]   There's thrifter.com.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.760]   There's a lot of places.
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:45.920]   And Black Friday and Cyber Monday really are a month long events these days.
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:49.280]   We've got to notify by one of the retailers that they're starting Black Friday.
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:51.200]   It was going to be a two week event for them.
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:54.000]   Yeah, yeah, Black Fortnite.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000]   Yes.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.480]   Oh, beautiful Black Fortnite.
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:57.480]   Black Fortnite.
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:58.480]   That sounds horrible.
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:21:59.480]   VFN.
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:00.480]   Yeah.
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:03.040]   Do you want to see the latest drone video of Apple's campus?
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:04.040]   We're getting close.
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:13.280]   I finally thought we were talking about the Apple list, the ban list on Sunday because
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:16.200]   Ian Thompson says the register has been on it.
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:19.040]   Larry Maggid said he was on it for a while.
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:22.400]   And I said, you know, that's all, that's all conspiracy theory.
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.080]   Apple doesn't have a list.
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:27.400]   And I can't, I think it was Larry who said, no, no, we saw it.
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:28.920]   Or no, it was, it was Ian.
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:32.040]   My colleague saw it.
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:33.800]   And he said, well, can I go?
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:36.440]   And he said, no, now that you work at the registry, oh, that's right.
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:39.880]   It was somebody who wasn't at the register, came to the register and no longer received
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:40.880]   invites.
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:41.880]   And he said, well, where's my invite?
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:42.880]   And they said, well, no, you're on our list.
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:44.680]   The register is on our list that you can't be invited.
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:45.680]   But it's that right.
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:46.680]   Because I might like just this.
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:47.680]   I didn't think it was real.
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:51.320]   And he gets invited now, Christina Warren left Mashable and went to Gizmodo.
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:53.320]   And now Gizmodo gets invited because she's there.
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:58.800]   So well, all I know is I don't get invited, but, but the minute that they have, they announce
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:03.920]   an event at the new campus, I'm calling and saying I would very much like to go.
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:04.920]   Here it is.
[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:08.080]   It's a little premature, but it sure looks good on this 20.
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:13.120]   Now this is really going to kill Apple on this 28 inch Windows Surface Studio.
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:14.120]   Playing in.
[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:15.760]   You look for Google products.
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:18.600]   Playing on a Google product in 4K.
[01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:20.400]   I feel like I'm there.
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:22.160]   The campus is really getting so soon.
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:27.680]   I mean, there's the entrance to the underground auditorium still porta potty.
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:29.160]   So it's not done yet.
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:32.480]   But there are little lessons for press.
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:33.480]   That's for the press.
[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:36.560]   Yeah, we'll be using we'll be using porta pottys, won't we?
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:37.560]   You'll be really ugly.
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:40.360]   Is that could be an Apple logo on the top there?
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:41.880]   Oh, that'd be so great.
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:43.120]   I bet it is.
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:44.120]   That's for touch ID.
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:45.120]   Oh, for when the aliens.
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:46.120]   It's for the drones.
[01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:47.120]   It's for the drones.
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:48.480]   Look at all the air conditionings in.
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:52.440]   This is the R&D building, which of course is a separate building so that Johnny I've
[01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:56.240]   doesn't have to be bothered by Johnny Saruji Johnny Saruji.
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:58.280]   Johnny Saruji different Johnny.
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:23:59.960]   Oh, R&D is Saruji.
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:04.240]   They've got high they've got high availability Johnny's.
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:08.800]   The other R&D building is rising over on 10, 10 Avenue.
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:12.120]   That's 10, but I like to think of this.
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:13.920]   And completed maintenance shed.
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:14.920]   Nice.
[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:15.920]   The shed's finished.
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:18.280]   It's kind of dwarfed by this.
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:19.280]   Look at the solar panels.
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:26.120]   These are the main parking structures, massive solar panels, hundreds and hundreds, 20,000
[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:28.720]   cars, but somebody's got to do the math on these.
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:31.360]   I mean, it is that is that is a lot of capacity.
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.320]   It's many, many thousands of cars.
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:34.800]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:36.320]   That'll keep your sous vide going.
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:38.000]   Here's the tunnel that you go in.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.920]   So you go into the underground garage.
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:41.920]   No traffic.
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.880]   He's done it.
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:47.040]   These are all 4K drone shots now.
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.480]   And there's really doing a great job.
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:49.800]   There's two guys who do this.
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:51.520]   I'm not sure which one this is.
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:53.400]   They haven't shot down the drones yet.
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:58.200]   No, I think it's clear Apple welcomes this kind of they don't want to do it themselves,
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:24:59.760]   but they're okay with them doing this.
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:03.160]   Or they asked if you can't have anti aircraft weapons.
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:04.160]   Maybe.
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:05.160]   Maybe.
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:06.560]   What is this black foam here?
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:07.560]   That's just for the image.
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:08.560]   And we empty pulse.
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:10.520]   I think that's a way to structure it so it doesn't.
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:13.720]   Security that's what you drive through when you go in there.
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:17.320]   100,000 square foot fitness center.
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:18.320]   Wow.
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:20.760]   Employees only.
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:23.120]   There's the mound of dirt slowly sinking.
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:25.760]   This is really starting to look like it's a building.
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:28.760]   Roof of the main ring is now fully covered with solar panels.
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:30.280]   And Donnie has been building it by himself.
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:31.520]   So would you please cut them out?
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:32.520]   Yes.
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:33.520]   He's busy.
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:37.280]   That entire building has to be milled out of a single block of aluminum.
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:38.280]   It takes time.
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:39.640]   Christmas lights it takes you all day.
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:41.080]   He's got to build this whole thing.
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:43.720]   Putting in the irrigation pipes to the landscaping.
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:45.800]   So that means they're getting very close now.
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:46.800]   Wow.
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:51.040]   This is going to be gorgeous.
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:52.040]   What do you think?
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:53.480]   This is the iPad.
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:56.320]   And iPad announcement in the spring, you think?
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:58.160]   Or it'll be iPhone 8 for sure.
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:25:59.160]   They're ready.
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:00.160]   Yeah.
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:02.840]   Well, they look like they're really getting close now.
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:03.840]   Main atrium.
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:05.320]   I mean, you have to do the, you know, the insides.
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:09.000]   I think Andy said, you know, it's always possible they could get the press area ready
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.040]   before the rest of it is.
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:15.720]   I would imagine that as soon as this is close, they would want to have an event there to
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:19.120]   show it to the press, right?
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:20.560]   That's going to be a fountain.
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:25.040]   Look at that giant fountain.
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:26.600]   Outdoor cafes.
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:28.040]   Or is press fountain.
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:30.040]   It's the press fountain.
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:31.040]   Wow.
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:33.480]   Oh, man.
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:39.760]   So early for December, Rome update for the Apple campus.
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:40.760]   All right.
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:43.800]   Let's take anything else we want to say before we take a break and get your picks of the
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:44.800]   weekend here.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:48.840]   I think we covered everything.
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:49.840]   More betas.
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:50.840]   But there's always more betas.
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:54.920]   Good deal on the ultra fine 5G display 5K display from LG.
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:58.560]   I, you know, I don't know if you can find that it was briefly for sale.
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:26:59.560]   Oh, is that what happened?
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:01.560]   It's not quite December yet.
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:04.840]   I'm pretty happy with this.
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:07.960]   This is a very missing a K.
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:08.960]   It doesn't.
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:13.920]   Yeah, they don't say four or five K, but it's what was the rest of the three.
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:16.280]   I mean, I don't know if it's P three.
[01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:18.320]   Your eyes take non P three anymore.
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:20.560]   Take S R G B size of that owl.
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:24.800]   And that is a beautiful owl here.
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:32.240]   Play settings.
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:35.520]   It is a 4500 by 3000.
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:38.040]   How many mega pixels is that?
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:39.040]   All of them.
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:40.040]   It's a party.
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:41.040]   4500 by 3000.
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:42.040]   It's three by two, which is kind of cool.
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.040]   Aboriginal iPhone.
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:44.040]   Yeah.
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:45.040]   Yeah.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:46.040]   That's a way to make me feel better.
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:47.040]   All right.
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:48.040]   Let's take a break.
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:53.360]   When we come back, your picks of the week, gentlemen, so start your engines.
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:54.360]   Compare your picks of the week.
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:57.120]   But meanwhile, I want to talk about Drobo.
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:58.600]   As I mentioned, I have been very happy.
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:00.280]   I have a Drobo for my photography.
[01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:01.840]   I keep all my photos on there.
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:07.240]   Actually, I use it with my iMac because it's Thunderbolt plus I put the little, you could
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:12.960]   put a little card in there that really speeds it up with small file rights.
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:18.000]   So that's my actually my user account is separate from the iMac on the Drobo.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.400]   And I have six terabytes, I think, which is pretty nice.
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:25.360]   And then I have the Drobo 5 and the network Drobo.
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:26.360]   That thing's massive.
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:28.080]   And I put on cloud on that one.
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:32.040]   So I'm using that for my backup and syncing everywhere, BitTorrent sync as well, because
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:35.280]   Drobo apps, there's all sorts of stuff you can do with it.
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:41.040]   It's a family of strobo is a family safe, expandable, but easy to use storage arrays.
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:47.000]   If you know, or someone you know, has more data than you can fit on a single hard drive,
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.320]   you got to go to the Drobo store.
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:51.200]   And this would be a great holiday gift.
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:56.080]   Any geek, any geek would be thrilled to get a Drobo of some kind.
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:00.220]   The beauty of the Drobo is it's a storage system designed to keep your data safe forever
[01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:06.480]   using its beyond rate technology that allows you to put multiple drives in.
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:12.360]   They offer five even and five eight and even 12 Bay hard drives.
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:18.560]   You can connect via USB three USB C Thunderbolt one Thunderbolt two or as I do gigabit ethernet.
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:20.640]   That's how my five N connects.
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:26.320]   Total could be up to 64 terabyte volumes, 64 terabyte volumes.
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:30.000]   So great for backup, great for media.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:34.660]   I use it as my primary data drive on my iMac and I use the five and as I said with own
[01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:38.160]   cloud for my storage all over.
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:42.560]   That was the nicest thing about setting up this new computer is I just put the own cloud
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:47.080]   software on there and I say, get all my data and it copies it off of my five and at home
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:49.240]   and I'm ready to go.
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:51.240]   The six NPCs can share it simultaneously.
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:53.840]   Now here's the deal through the end of the year.
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:57.640]   Drobo is offering Twit listeners their very best deal of the year.
[01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:03.280]   Twenty percent or more up to eight hundred dollars off the purchase of a five N. That's
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:05.200]   their network attached system that I've been using.
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:10.960]   That's this one right here or the Drobo five D or five DT there are thunderbolts and USB
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:17.720]   three drive or any of the eight Bay or 12 Bay unit network systems.
[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:22.280]   The funny thing happens when you have a Drobo you get a thirst for storage.
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:25.480]   I keep putting bigger and bigger drives in there.
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:26.760]   I love it.
[01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:29.520]   And for speed the thing is really fast.
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:34.920]   Take advantage of this deal go to DroboStore.com and when you check out pick what you want.
[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:40.520]   When you get what you want use the offer go Twit 20 at checkout to save twenty percent
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:44.920]   or more off select systems.
[01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:50.640]   DroboStore.com use the code Twit 20 but it's only through December 31st.
[01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:51.640]   I love it.
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:52.640]   I love the Drobo.
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:57.440]   And if I ever run shorter from which I haven't I can just take out the smallest drive put
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:59.920]   in a new drive of a larger size.
[01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:02.560]   It rebuilds itself on the fly.
[01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:07.000]   I have it set up with the five N for using two of the five drives.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.760]   It's kind of so up to two drives could die at the same time and I still don't lose any
[01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:13.320]   data because that's my big backup device.
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:17.040]   And I still have six or what is it I think it's eight terabytes on that thing because
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:20.640]   I have anyway you don't need to hear this.
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:22.280]   It's a lot.
[01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:28.080]   DroboStore.com the offer code is Twit 20 time for our picks of the week.
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:31.880]   I got to start with Alex Lindsey you haven't been here in ages I'm sure you have pent up
[01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:33.680]   picks galore.
[01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:36.720]   Oh your mic is off though.
[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:38.240]   There you go turn it back on.
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:39.240]   Is it on?
[01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:40.240]   Yeah.
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:41.240]   That is.
[01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:42.240]   It's on.
[01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:43.240]   Yep.
[01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:48.360]   So so I this is a little one but this gets into when we're talking about having the USB
[01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:56.160]   C and that I picked up when I first got the little the new little Mac Mac air and this
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:32:03.080]   is the sand disk and it's a 32 gigabyte type C flash drive that also has your kind of
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:05.080]   standard USB on the other side.
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:06.760]   That is so cool.
[01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:08.600]   It is super useful.
[01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:13.560]   So you know like if you have something like your you know like the current you know if
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:16.280]   all you have there and you want to hand the client something or you want to pass it on
[01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:19.600]   to somebody else and he has that the sand is for a different one.
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:20.600]   That's a different one.
[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:22.360]   That's the one Father Robert had.
[01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:23.360]   Yeah.
[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:24.360]   These these are great.
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:25.360]   I've had this for a long time.
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:27.200]   Ever since I got my Nexus 5x.
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:28.200]   Yeah.
[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:29.360]   So kind of key to the operation.
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:33.320]   So if you if you want to be able to you know get something off your computer and be able
[01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:37.000]   to hand it to someone quickly and let them run off with it or put it on one of your older
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.480]   speakers.
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:39.480]   That works great.
[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:40.680]   So either one I'm sure works great.
[01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:47.240]   I have the sand disk one and but but I think they're they're both probably equally equally
[01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:48.240]   good.
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:52.600]   Again, I got it when I first got the laptop that was only one type C connector and I
[01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:56.680]   had to be able to find some way to quickly get stuff off of there easily and that was
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:58.840]   my choice and it's worked well.
[01:32:58.840 --> 01:32:59.840]   Nice.
[01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:03.760]   Andy, who makes the one you have?
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:04.920]   Trev's it's.
[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:08.200]   Father Robert had the two was another it was a well known another well known name.
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:11.040]   I can't remember who I think it's Kingston.
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:13.600]   Yeah, I think it was Kingston too.
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:14.600]   Wow.
[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:16.400]   That's like a tenth of an Alex.
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:19.960]   Well, you know, don't worry.
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:20.960]   Don't worry.
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:21.960]   Next time I'll you come up with something better.
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:23.720]   I'll swing I'll swing for the stands.
[01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:26.280]   Alex is recommending you by a thousand of them.
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:27.280]   Yes, exactly.
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:31.280]   And you're pick of the week here.
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:35.800]   I got I got sort of an odd one, but it's a good one.
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:37.560]   Friend of mine passed away a couple weeks.
[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:38.640]   Sam Williams.
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:39.640]   Sorry.
[01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:45.880]   And see a lot of people would know him better as member of the flying caromatzo brothers
[01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:49.040]   who was one of the founding members, Marit Kova.
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:52.840]   He was just amazing guy.
[01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:58.000]   Just the he was exactly the character that he portrayed like in the caromatzo of the
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:02.400]   stage performances just sweet and kind and just so cool.
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:05.800]   So I'm recommending one of his favorite performances of the caromatzo of his.
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:11.240]   Here's a scene in the comedy of errors that they portrayed in 1983.
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:16.720]   He's doing this was a a live from Lincoln Center production in PBS.
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:22.800]   And that's that's Sam in the green doing it doing doing the death scene.
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:27.200]   That's awesome.
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:32.600]   And this is one of those occasions in which I'm willing to look the other way.
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:37.080]   I don't think this this video has passed into the public domain quite yet because it
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:39.120]   aired in 1983, 84.
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:43.320]   But it's one of those things where it airs on PBS like for one week and one week only.
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:45.720]   And then they can never air that again.
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:47.440]   And it's such a special production.
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:49.960]   It's a production of Shakespeare's the comedy of errors.
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:50.960]   It's not a parody.
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:57.120]   They do the entire text of the comedy of errors, but they they it's performed by the caromatzo
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:01.400]   of so this juggling all kinds of new new vaudeville performers.
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:05.560]   So they've got they've got baton twirlers.
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:06.560]   They've got acrobats.
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:07.560]   They've got aerialists.
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:08.560]   They've got clowns.
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:09.920]   It is hysterically funny.
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:12.680]   High energy start to finish.
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:16.760]   And believe me, anything that I can quote from the comedy of errors comes from this.
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:20.480]   It's available in a couple of sources on YouTube.
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:24.440]   The best sources for what I've linked to part one and part two.
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:30.920]   I got I think I think we're doing a service by keeping this alive by keeping the tape
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:31.920]   circulating.
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:37.320]   I got a copy of the DVD, not from Sam, but from a number another member of the cast who
[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:39.800]   had like a master tape of it.
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:43.720]   And that was one of the most precious DVDs I had in my collection before I was able to
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:45.000]   turn into video.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.040]   But search for anything on the flying caromatzo of brothers.
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:52.520]   He was a he had retired from the group about 10 or 15 years ago, but he was still a very
[01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:57.080]   active performer in Seattle alongside his day job.
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:36:02.520]   But he was he could be seen in lots of different street festivals and city festivals.
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:06.280]   And like I said, the more he's the more you see about Sam, that's I've spent I spent a
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:08.760]   lot of time hanging out with him.
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:14.800]   And the character you see there, that's that's Sam, just this guy that big teddy bear of a
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:20.480]   guy where you just can't imagine him being anything but the nicest person in the room
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:22.640]   no matter how dark the room could possibly be.
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:25.120]   And he would put light into the room just by entering it.
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:27.040]   So very, very sad to hear about that.
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:32.080]   And I hope that by sharing this link, you'll have an appreciation for just what an immense
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:34.000]   guy and immense talent that he was.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:39.040]   They were jugglers, acrobats, aerialists, new circuses, a good way to describe them.
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:40.040]   Yeah.
[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:43.160]   And I don't know if they started in San Francisco, but we saw them a lot in San Francisco.
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:45.440]   I I thought they were wonderful.
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:46.440]   Yeah.
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:47.440]   They're still touring.
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:50.800]   The Paul Maggot is the only original member of the group that's still in the group.
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:53.000]   And the other's just a young man's job.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.120]   I mean, you're that's as you saw in the video, they're very active.
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:57.120]   Yeah.
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:58.680]   And that was Carmats up in their prime.
[01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:00.680]   That was just great stuff.
[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:01.680]   Wow.
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:02.680]   All right.
[01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:04.680]   Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:05.680]   All right.
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:08.800]   So this is not my pick, but I figured I'd just show how big this is because it arrived this
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:09.800]   week.
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:11.760]   This is the large version of the Apple book.
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:13.720]   I can't even get it in frame.
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:14.920]   Oh, ginormous.
[01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:17.920]   Oh, you got the $300 book.
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:20.600]   So I already picked up the smaller one.
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:23.560]   She had a great set of photos and videos that we'll be putting up, but I got the bigger
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:26.480]   one just because I was silly and wow, is it big?
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:27.480]   Yeah.
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:28.480]   And huge.
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:31.640]   A good gift for somebody who really likes Apple stuff.
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:36.080]   A reading from the book of jobs, chapter three.
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:39.080]   Now it's two iPhone five.
[01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:41.000]   Well, well.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:48.360]   And the headphone jack did offend the and so did the Johnny pluck it out.
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:49.360]   Yeah.
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:55.280]   So I mean, that is just it is absolutely enormous and I'll have something up on that next week.
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:56.840]   My pick this week is something I didn't think I was going to pick, but I didn't think I
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:38:00.360]   was going to pick, but it's already called about a review of the Apple Watch series one
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:02.840]   last week and it made me give it a second look.
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:07.040]   And then I heard tell from retail that they were actually doing really good business with
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:08.040]   these.
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:10.960]   A lot of people were super interested in them because it's $100 less than this series.
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:11.960]   Two.
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:15.200]   And although I tend towards the latest and greatest, there seems to be a lot of people
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:17.000]   who just they don't need swim proofing.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.200]   They don't need GPS.
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:21.600]   They don't really care about the brighter screen, but they really want an Apple Watch
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:25.560]   and this is a hundred dollars lower cost of entry.
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:28.920]   And it seems to just be breaking through the barrier where previously it was just a little
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:33.000]   bit too expensive to two 69, you know, and that's for the 38 millimeter.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000]   It's a little bit more.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:38.840]   I think it's two 99 for the 42 millimeter where yeah, we saw a ton of interest in it.
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:42.720]   I've heard from retailers that it was a real surprise sort of a sleeper hit over the black
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:49.160]   Friday weekend that a lot of people are picking up Apple watches and a surprising number are
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:51.000]   really considering the series one.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.720]   So if you have an iPhone and you've heard about the fitness features or the notification
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:59.440]   features or you want to just control you Siri and control home kit on your watch, you
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:03.320]   can do it now with it's got the same processor does not have the GPS, but it's the same dual
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:04.320]   core processor.
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:08.080]   So it's much faster than the original and it's a hundred bucks cheaper.
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:11.560]   And sometimes you can even find them on sales or with gift cards bundled in or with other
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:12.920]   promo features.
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:17.360]   So it's great holiday gift really again, talking about the people who have everything.
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:21.960]   If you want that shuttle craft for the starship that is your iPhone, then the Apple Watch
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:24.520]   one is a really good gift.
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:26.520]   I really am very happy with the series too.
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:30.080]   I have to say me to better battery life features.
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:31.080]   Oh, nice.
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:33.080]   It took forever, but I finally got it.
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:34.880]   I got the Hermes and the Hermes band.
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:39.880]   This one's really cool.
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:42.080]   It's the Diploille.
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:45.440]   Yeah, well, it's a nice part with a but it doesn't look like that.
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:46.680]   It looks like a buckle strap.
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:50.760]   It looks like a regular single single buckle and people I say deployment because as they
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:53.680]   actual English term, but then snooty French people get really mad at me.
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:57.760]   So yeah, I'm a diploille on my Hermes deployment.
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:58.760]   Come on.
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:39:59.960]   How dare you?
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:02.680]   You feel the mongrel.
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:08.280]   I'm going to recommend a GitHub repository, but actually you don't have anything to do
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:09.920]   with programming or GitHub.
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:12.880]   Dr. Duh, I don't know who he is, has made a Mac OS.
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:14.560]   It's been around for a couple of years now.
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:18.480]   Mac OS security and privacy guide, but what's nice, he keeps it up to date.
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:23.600]   In fact, the last commit to this was four days ago and it's really just it's a text
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:32.840]   description of all of the things one might do to secure a Macintosh computer.
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:34.680]   Now you may not want to do all of these.
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:39.600]   I certainly didn't, but it's good to know all the things you can do, like a firmware
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:44.320]   password to keep a bad guy who's stolen your Mac from getting into it.
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:48.480]   Some of this is pretty high end geekery using the command line.
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:55.840]   Some of it's very simple, but it's really nice to have it all in one spot.
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:41:01.720]   I'm not a security guru, but I know a little bit about this kind of stuff.
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:06.840]   This is all useful things to at least think up about.
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:12.680]   If you really want to have a secure system, he talks about all the benefits.
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:17.760]   Everybody will say, "Well, encrypt your disk with file vault, but this is more, this is
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:24.480]   talking a lot more about how to, for instance, manually seed file vault with a really good
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:27.880]   random number and things like that.
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:29.280]   How to use the firewall.
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:32.800]   Apple comes with a wonderful firewall, but how to use it.
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:35.200]   What third party firewalls are good for?
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:39.160]   Little snitch and hands off and radio silence.
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:41.320]   This is really nice.
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:47.400]   It's a GitHub page, so the URL is not something I would want to tell you.
[01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:55.240]   Let me just go back to the home and tell you, if you search for Dr.Duh, DRDUH and the macOS
[01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:58.960]   Security and Privacy Guide, I'm pretty sure you'd be able to find it.
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:04.280]   It is, there's a lot here with new stuff added all the time.
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:12.280]   They just added information for the late 2016 Touch Bar Max, so it's that up today.
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:19.920]   All sorts of really interesting stuff in here, including programs to do all sorts of things,
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:21.920]   like Little Flocker.
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:27.640]   Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come to say goodbye to all our family.
[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:32.360]   Andy Inako, Chicago SunTimes, great to have you.
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:36.160]   Great beer, happy, happy birthday and many, many more Leo.
[01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:43.040]   They should read Andy's stuff and follow him on the Flickr IHNATKO.
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:44.280]   Andy I on Flickr.
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:47.600]   Andy I on Flickr, that's right, and not go on Instagram and Twitter.
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:50.080]   That's how old my Flickr account is.
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:53.080]   That's when I was still hung up, I got to be Andy I in every single service I could
[01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:54.080]   get.
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:56.440]   That would be like.
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:58.800]   ReneeRitchie, imore.com.
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:02.720]   Find his great work there and of course all the iMore podcasts, including AppleTalk, the
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:03.720]   latest.
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:04.720]   You must listen.
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:05.720]   Thank you.
[01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:06.720]   Happy birthday, Leo.
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:07.960]   And I know you're flying down to see us.
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:08.960]   I can't wait.
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:09.960]   Yes, absolutely.
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:10.960]   Can't wait.
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:11.960]   We'll have some fun.
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:16.200]   Thursday, we're doing a special taping of our Twit year-end special.
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:19.560]   What we wanted to do, and you guys, I don't want to leave you out, you'll be part of these
[01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:24.280]   in years to come, but we want to bring three or four hosts from our different, who never
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:28.480]   our cross show in to be part of.
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:32.880]   So we've got Denise Howell, Steve Gibson and ReneeRitchie, and we're going to do a special
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:35.640]   year-end Twit where you look at the big stories of 2016.
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:36.920]   And that should be a lot of fun.
[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:39.840]   I believe there will be booze will flow.
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:41.680]   And it'll be secure.
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:42.680]   And it will be secure.
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:44.080]   No, no, no, it'll be successful.
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:46.160]   Don't, don't, don't, taint it by saying we're, and we're going to be booing.
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:49.040]   Come on, there'll be no booze.
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:50.040]   Thank you.

[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:01.880]   Hi, birthday, Leo.
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:04.480]   He tweets almost as much as the president elect.
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:06.760]   Oh, but somewhat coherently.
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:07.760]   Yes.
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:09.760]   No comment.
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:14.120]   I said it before I'm glad there's a Twitter.
[01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:17.280]   It's the it's I didn't like Twitter until then.
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:20.120]   Now I'm just glad to know what's going on in the White House.
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:22.680]   Look at pictures of Justin Trudeau hugging pandas again.
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:23.680]   Yes.
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:24.680]   Yes.
[01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:26.440]   Thank you everybody for joining us.

[01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:00.440]   every episode every single week.
[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:01.440]   Thanks for being here.
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:05.080]   But now I'm sad to say it's time to get back to work because break time is over.
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:06.080]   Bye.
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:08.740]   (upbeat music)
