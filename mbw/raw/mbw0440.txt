[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.520]   Snowbound hello you're not going to that curtain
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.720]   Because I haven't really I've been so lazy. I haven't like reset my office the way it was before and now
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.760]   It is that kind of really awful weather where it is super super bright. It's oh my god. Yeah snow is out
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.360]   It's yeah, it's the worst cut the worst weather the worst driving weather isn't necessarily when it's snowing because you know
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.000]   You know enough not to go out when it's snowing. It's weather like this where it's not a cloud in the sky
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.440]   Right and the snow is melting and turning the entire road into a reflective surface and it seems like everywhere you go
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.200]   You have to drive to do West yeah. Yeah, no, that's true
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.840]   Well stay warm
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.160]   I don't know why we're we're talking about snow in Boston when we got Renee Richie from Montreal where it's probably look
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.960]   He's even wearing a tuk we have no snow, but it was - 30 this morning - 30 last night and it's getting warmer
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.800]   But that's including windshield, but it's still not humanly pleasant
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.000]   So I turned off the heat so the fan noise wouldn't be loud and then I got really cold
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.920]   - 30
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:54.040]   Celsius is what it's it gets close to the same thing in the - - when it gets to four - 40. It's the same. Yeah, so it's bloody cold
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.040]   It's what it is. Yeah, we cow
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.440]   Well, all right. Well stay inside
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.120]   Yeah, we're doing that we have again like this though like Andy said everything is clear, but it looks like the entire city has been encased in carbonite
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.680]   That's just a very it's a very strange feeling
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.200]   Of course Renee's with imore.com does the great debug podcast and so many other things great to have you both Andy and
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.720]   Renee will be joined in a bit I think by Alex Lindsey who is
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.680]   rushing back from the Vatican as we speak
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:29.960]   He's like a Swiss guard escort. He's like the linebacker that brings in the play from the offensive coordinator to the quarterback
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.760]   He's got a message for us. He's got a sheaf of diagrams and numbers
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.560]   And the next that now he's on he's on his way to St. Paul's after this with pickaxe and Francis is doing the play calling
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.560]   He's cracked the code. Yeah, what it means?
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.880]   Wow, we we were off the air before Apple announced its earnings last week
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.720]   Which is probably a good thing because we would have had to parse them on the fly now
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.760]   We've had enough time to break out the calculator and find out
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.240]   How much per second is 18 billion dollars profit in three months?
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.960]   I wonder if there's a Google search for that eight the most
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.240]   Money any company has ever made in the history of the world
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:19.520]   And again, you can't drive your car with these you can't eat your house with these you can't eat these yeah
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:26.400]   Yeah, that's normally the competition is all the the natural gas and oil companies. Yeah
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.680]   18 billion dollars in profit
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.720]   But as we thought it might happen the iPad sales continue to decline. I got a point out they sold 21.4 million in
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.720]   Q1 their fit their fiscal quarter one is our holiday buying season that would be the outbreak star of any other
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.000]   Companies lineup it ain't bad
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.080]   But it is a decline on the other hand iPhone sales
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.400]   74.5 million in three months
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.640]   My favorite line was Ben Thompson when he said that he calculated that Apple lost more on currency fluctuations
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.240]   And Google made that quarter
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.360]   Yeah, it was something like 4% because of currency fluctuations like Tim Cook kind of bemoaned the fact that they couldn't
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.640]   These damn countries can't get their currencies straight. That was all the analysts. What are you hedging?
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.120]   How are you hedging changing your hedges? How often you're changing your hedges?
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.760]   Although it cracks me up that here's a company that made more money and than any company is it in history
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.160]   And well, I don't know if you just for inflation maybe, you know, Julia Caesar made more something
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.280]   and then and then in cash has a hundred forty two billion dollars in cash
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:38.720]   But they this is what I this is definition to me of Hutsba. They decided to go to the bond market to borrow 30 billion
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.040]   Please, huh?
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:47.160]   Because all that money is overseas. It's not in the it's in Ireland or somewhere. Yeah, and they bring it back. They pay 35%
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:53.160]   Yeah, it really is like the like Tony Montana where he's he's made all this money
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.040]   But he can't spend all of it because that it comes becomes traceable and he doesn't want that
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.920]   Where what country is it in?
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.320]   It's a lot of us in Ireland
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.440]   It's basically everywhere outside the US anything that Apple makes and one of their subsidiary is that you know it counts from money outside the US and like
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:17.040]   Google and other companies I mean a lot of companies do this if you have enough money and you have a structure that you can arrange to have
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.400]   intellectual property
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.880]   Rights reside in Ireland where the corporate tax rate is very low
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.040]   You do that you transfer it over to the Irish subsidiary
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.320]   Could be a guy at a desk in Dublin
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.960]   It's interesting though
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.040]   I mean for all these companies because if if I'm in Canada if I buy a computer as a US government get a share of that
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.200]   If someone in London buys an Apple computer because Apple's headquartered America should the US government get a cut of that no
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.960]   You were moving faster like the internet. We're moving faster than a lot of well, but this is a manipulation
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:55.280]   This is this is this is saying it's not these are this is not a hundred forty two billion dollars in cash earned in Ireland
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.760]   These are payments that come from the US subsidiaries to the Irish
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.520]   Rights holders and things like that. It's come on. Well, it's still a show
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.280]   I don't know if it comes out of the US, but it's structured not to put anything into the US
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.800]   It doesn't absolutely have to go there and of course China was huge
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:17.960]   Apple ship more smartphones than any other company in China last quarter
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:25.600]   And so that money for instance probably flows to Ireland and so much for the theory that Apple has to go cheap to gain the Chinese market
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.600]   Yes, and that interesting
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:34.040]   iPhones accounted for half of all US smartphone activations in the quarter so they have a 50%
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:41.600]   They had a 50% market share in queue our calendar fourth quarter holiday buying season their first quarter
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:49.080]   But interesting I think I still think even though 21 million iPads sold I still think
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:54.760]   It is interesting it dropped so much 21% is is the iPad over I
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:08:01.400]   Don't know it's I think it has to do with the fact that you're looking at one phone that had the most
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:09.240]   Dramatic update in years and years and years. I mean there's it's really it's folks like us try hard to explain
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.880]   Well, here's why the a7 processor is a big big upgrade over the a6
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.580]   Here's why you want this this mobility processor and here's why the more application
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:22.040]   I'm gonna do something but nothing is gonna have that sort of impact as here is it's a much bigger screen
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:27.300]   You know how you've been your your wife or your husband your kids have an Android phone with a big screen
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.160]   You've always wanted great
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:34.640]   We now have it for you as opposed to the iPad Air 2 which all they can say is it looks exactly like last year's model
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:40.320]   Except for now we've added touch ID and we've made it faster in a way that maybe you are not gonna be able to appreciate
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:45.200]   So I don't know if I'd go so far as to say that the 9.7 inch iPad Air is
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:51.440]   Stagnet at this point, but if this continues if Apple does another upgrade
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.720]   Apple upgrades the iPad in the same way that they upgraded the iPhone 6 and it still is
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.360]   Oh, well, there's more people buying that but not really dramatic that will be a really significant data point
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:06.280]   One thing that's interesting to me is that you it's a very multi-it's a multifaceted question
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:11.400]   And the tablet market in general was down in last quarter nobody sold for nobody was at a growth industry really
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.160]   So the question is with the bigger screen phones that put pressure
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:20.000]   That puts pressure on the tablets from below with laptops that are lighter and longer lasting batteries that puts pressure on tablets from above
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.160]   And we're at there was a fascinating post
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:29.000]   I think Neil cyber from above Avonlea Avalon did it where he was looking at the job that Steve Jobs originally outlined for the iPad
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.560]   Where's better at email? It's better at web. It's better at music
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.720]   It's better at all these things and how many of those things are now really well served by large screen phones
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:44.200]   And how many are really well served by ultra light long-lasting laptops and that job that that sweet spot is sort of diminished
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:50.280]   And we've also gotten to a point where the iPad Air 2 is ridiculous the Apple a X a 8x processor is ridiculous
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.480]   It's close to a current desktop level processor
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.120]   But we don't really take advantage of that this the operating system the apps
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:01.240]   They don't really let us take all of that power the hardware now is surpassed the software and you can look at
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.160]   Microsoft doing the windows 10 thing you can look at what Google's doing with tablets
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:10.840]   But at some point Apple might also have to whether it's with an iPad 12 inch or an iPad Pro or with a new version of iOS
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:18.240]   That's a specifically tailored to tablets as watch OS is targeted to watches might have to do something to better take advantage of that hardware
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:25.960]   to make it also cost and it's also possible that the reason why the 9.7 inch iPad was such a big hit was because there was nothing like it and
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.600]   Consumers never had the ability it took two or three years for consumers to have the ability to actually vote for what kind of size
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.960]   They want and now that they're in the position where consumer can say instead of this big device right here
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:43.000]   We can we can instead give you a phone that is just simply big enough that you're more comfortable reading books on it
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.680]   Or if you really do want to tablet will give you something that you could actually stick in your back pocket a lot of people are saying
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.560]   Well, I never actually really wanted a 9.7 inch tablet to begin with and maybe it's possible
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.440]   It's also possible that this larger size is gonna be orphaned
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:11:01.360]   Which is why I'm really keen to follow up on rumors about the mythical iPad Pro if Apple were to simply say
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:06.840]   Okay, instead of making this a smaller something will make this a big or something not just in size
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:11.740]   But and we are anticipating that maybe you would buy this instead of even an iPad Macbook air
[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.080]   Hey, Alex Lindsey joins us
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.960]   Vatican City no no you're back home
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:23.480]   No, I'm in that I'm I'm not in the Vatican now. I was shortly are you in for all but I'm in Rome
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.840]   I'm in I'm up in a hill above Rome
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:33.880]   Right now so wonderful great to have you good to be here. Thanks for joining us. We're talking we just started we're talking apples
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.440]   quarterly results
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:42.000]   From their first quarter. I should point out the real problem was is that I think that Apple just really has to figure out
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Where they're gonna have to cut staff and
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.280]   The licensing question yet again
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.480]   I think apples should sell clones or somebody's a hilarious thing was the
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:01.000]   First but someone put up an article about the surface sales and the surface sales were in the millions and wow surface is booming
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.880]   And then the iPad sales were only in the like the 27 million whatever it was. Oh iPhone is busting, you know
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:11.440]   Even though it's significantly every other tablet that's that's still a significant data point if Apple is
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.600]   There's there's a phrase that I keep coming back to when I look at stuff like that is like through you
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.560]   You kind of get worried when a company finally finds the car keys
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.400]   You know where you make fun of surface something like surface where?
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.200]   Justifiably that all it's not really relevant and there is a much better value
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:30.160]   But there's still Microsoft is still like looking for the car keys and once they find those keys and jump in the car
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.680]   And they release now they're finally gonna start driving
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.400]   That's when you start worrying the fact that surface three is so much of an improvement
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.600]   And the fact that people are not only aware of it
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:44.080]   But now they're thinking I'd actually want to own one of these things that's gonna be such an interesting data point as once again
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.360]   Apple tries to figure out what what role in life does a 9.7 inch iPad play
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.880]   In a world where you can buy a really good i5 base windows tablet
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.320]   For about the same amount of money assuming that you're buying one to get actual work done
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:02.600]   That was the amazing thing about the profits is you saw that with the Mac for years that they had a single-digit
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.640]   Market share but they made a significant amount of profit share
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:11.160]   And that's always because they've catered to customers who really appreciate value where cost isn't the first feature on their list
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.880]   And then the iPhone you see how that scales when there actually is market share to go along with that profit share
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:21.040]   They make ungodly amounts of money and the iPad is somewhere in between where it still has super high margin
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.400]   It's not as popular as the iPhone
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.880]   But it's more popular than the Mac and it makes you know tons and tons of money
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.800]   And I think that's part of the discussion that gets lost often is that apples model really it really does scale well
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:36.960]   They're under no pressure for the iPad and Tim Cook kept saying you know over the I forget the exact word over the long spectrum of history
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:42.320]   He wants to keep investing in that technology. There's no profit and lost per division at Apple
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.800]   So it's not like oh the iPad is not keeping up with things where the Apple TV isn't we're gonna cut them
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.680]   It's you know five years from ten years. How does it add to the overall value of our ecosystem?
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:56.440]   Go ahead go ahead Alex. I'm sorry. We've been talking for a while ago. I
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.200]   Just think it's interesting that that you know
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:06.240]   I mean we've talked about this before that you really are in a situation where every single division that is really running at Apple
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.720]   Theoretically is making money. I mean it's not you know and they'd be good businesses on their own
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:16.160]   I mean even the the much-derided final cut ten is it would probably be a very successful company if it was on its own
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.640]   You know and so
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:23.160]   You know as far as how many what what sales it's gotten over the last year and so every single division is kind of
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:30.280]   To some degree hitting you know hitting their mark. I do find that with the with the larger phone. I find myself just very
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.240]   I
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:39.320]   Don't use my iPad that often. I mean is that how you guys feel about your iPad or you still is a still part of that of that process?
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.200]   I just noticed that anecdotally I don't use it as often I use my phone or use my computer
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:50.120]   But I find that the iPad in general has kind of be which is obviously something I was very excited about and still still am to some degree
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.640]   But but I find that in a lot of ways the interface itself
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:58.800]   You know it's big enough that you want it to be more powerful and and as as Renee was talking about the
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.160]   That you know we're not taking full advantage of it
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.000]   But I partially think that's partially the interface
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.160]   You know there's a lot of things that I feel like I would do and I'm thinking of getting them
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:11.400]   You know Microsoft Surface specifically because there's a lot of things that every time I see the commercial. It's working
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.240]   I'm like it's working hard to believe Wow
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.240]   You know that that you know that's what I want
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:20.640]   I mean I want to be able to do that and I'm gonna I'm probably in the next week or two buying a surface
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:25.920]   Just so that I can do those things when I need to you know rather than continually waiting for Apple to finally
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.120]   You know put touch on my laptop
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:35.880]   I'm in sort of a weird position because I've I have explicitly set aside this year some money to buy a new iPad because my
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:41.080]   My iPad the one that I actually own as opposed the ones that I borrow and have to send back after 30 to 60 days is
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:46.640]   A third generation iPad like the first retina model and it's working and it was working just fine, but I
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.520]   Find myself
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:53.520]   Thinking a lot of the things that you've been thinking Alex which is that if I'm gonna buy one to
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.800]   Use the way that I used to use my iPad 3
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.720]   I'm gonna need something pretty powerful and if I'm gonna be spending
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:05.040]   $800 for an iPad what else could I buy for 800 bucks and the surface 3 is actually very very good
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.120]   I don't think it's suitable for my needs right now
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:13.200]   But if Apple excuse me if Microsoft again finds the car keys on Windows 10 and finds a way to make it really relevant
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:21.320]   That could really change a great deal and I'm I also agree with you in that ever since I bought my MacBook
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:27.160]   Pro 2013 last year or the year before the fact that it's not as light as an iPad
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.760]   but now it's light enough the battery doesn't last as long as an iPad but it lasts long enough and
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.920]   frankly using an iPad for content for like as an laptop relation
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:43.160]   Replacement is enough of a pain in the butt that I'm willing to sort of sacrifice those things and actually take a 13 inch notebook
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:48.120]   Along with me so it's there's a lot of moving parts and this is gonna be an interesting year for the future of the iPad
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:48.840]   I think
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:53.800]   Well, and I think that one of the things that I commonly think of when I'm in an airport because one of the things that you see a
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:57.480]   Lot of is you see a lot of kids using iPads and you see a lot of
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.520]   You know folks that are over you know 50 or 60 using iPads and sometimes I feel like I'm in the wrong
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:08.040]   Generation for the iPad you know the one that grew up on a computer
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.960]   You know that that you know I find that there's a lot of things that I want to do
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.760]   I probably use it a little harder. I want to type a little faster
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:19.760]   I want to have certain things I want to be able to cut and paste out of every application if I see text
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.640]   I expect to be able to unless it's an image
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.200]   I actually be able to cut it and paste them
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:29.120]   I can't say how many times I go into an you know an iPad app that they've decided for whatever reason security or
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:33.600]   Whatever that I'm not allowed to select the text and that kind of becomes this thing like I yeah
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.440]   Okay, now I can't use this anymore
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:39.880]   It becomes things like I just want to duck into one other app to get one piece of information
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.760]   Then go back again and the fact that I have to do this
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.680]   I have to do this a couple different times to do that. Yeah, I mean
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.040]   I'm also preparing a review finally of the Nexus 9 tablet and
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.480]   Android tablets
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:56.360]   Boy, they just don't have a fraction of the nice software that's available on iOS
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:01.000]   It's it's they can they barely have competency whereas they have equivalency on the phone end of it
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.880]   And yet, you know what if I want to use it as as a notebook replacement
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:11.240]   I can hook up a mouse to it and the thing I didn't really realize until I started using that way as well
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.560]   Well, that's one of the things about Android 5. That's really nice
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:19.480]   It really is an okay desktop operating system and I can use keyboard commands to switch between apps and it's like
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.760]   Just and it's I still can't write run two apps side by side
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:28.520]   But it's easy enough to switch between the two that I would never be tempted to switch to an Android tablet because again
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.160]   The tablet style apps just aren't there
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:37.080]   But it really did remind me of how easy it would be to just add a little bit of extra functionality to the iPad
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:42.200]   That would make it a much more credible choice to help it to justify that six to eight hundred dollar price tag
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.800]   Well, and I think that the thing is is that with the with the surface again
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.240]   You know for me one of the things that I think about a lot is that is that I want to
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.320]   I want to have it all I want to have a mouse
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:55.720]   I want to have a keyboard and I want to be able to touch the screen when I need to touch the screen when I want to sign something or circle
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.920]   Something I don't want to have to pull out my wackam tablet and and do it
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.960]   And one of the ways you can get kind of a preview of what that looks like is when you're
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.920]   Using duet duet is the little app that you know
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.400]   You can hook your ipad to and your ipad does become a touch screen for your OS
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:14.040]   And so so you can sit there and if you have it open a lot of times if i'm annotating stuff
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:18.440]   I'll have duet open and I can just sit there and circle things and talk about them and it's a second monitor
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.680]   But it's also a way for me to throw
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:26.120]   Something over that I want to draw on and then throw it back, you know and and and it's just that's
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.600]   And I feel like at you know at some point, you know
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.160]   Apple is no rush the
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:38.360]   iPad and the and the computer are way behind I get that so it's not like there's any threat that apple has to ever put touch screen into
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.880]   Their computer, but I mean there's people like me that are just I mean who are about a diet
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:46.920]   Die in the little Mac user you can get that are going out to buy a surface because they're not solving the problem
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:52.360]   Yeah, well, we made we made fun on the show. Okay. Maybe I've just made fun of the show of apple tv
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.040]   But that's such a good
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:58.680]   It's such a good demonstration of the power and the the abilities that apple has that yes
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:03.080]   It's kind of a duff sort of product for it's been so for the past year year and a half
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:08.440]   But apple does not need to rush out of replacement because they're seeing what sales are doing or not doing
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:12.040]   They can they can really nurse this along for the couple years until
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:17.240]   The rest of the world's the rest of their product line sort of aligns itself to make it
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.120]   To make it worth their while to make that really big
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:25.000]   Update if they if they did a major update last year it might have might not have been quite so clear
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.200]   What that hardware and software update would have needed to be
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:34.520]   Whereas if they decide to do that this year or even next year, they'll know okay. We've got the apple watch and we know how people are using the watch
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.520]   We've got big screen iPhones. We know how that's working. We've got home kit products out there
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:44.520]   We know how people are using those now we can finally build a new apple tv that is absolutely perfect for 2016
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.680]   As opposed to our best guess for what would have been appropriate for 2013 or 2014
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:56.760]   Interesting also to know that this is besides you know, I've already paid attention to the record iPhone sales, but uh max sales also at a record
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:01.240]   Uh, and app store sales also at a record. So uh
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:06.920]   Very good quarter. I've I've done a little uh calculations in my numbers spreadsheet
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:14.760]   They sold 74 and a half million iPhones in three months the global birth rate is 4.1 babies per second
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:19.640]   I think they're going to run out of customers because they're saying it's selling 10 iPhones per second
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.520]   so
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.960]   Folks bring the birth rate up or we're gonna we're gonna have to sell sales are going to slow here
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.360]   There are always no place for you to try to give a big
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:32.760]   There's selling twice as many iPhones as there are babies being born
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:36.680]   They're gonna start to like lobby the Chinese government to wave like the one child
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:42.680]   We need more of you. We need more of you buying iPhones. Maybe you have two hands. That's two phones
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:47.160]   And two risks and two legs. Okay, good point. You don't have to have just one
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:54.120]   That's kind of amazing that they're selling at more than twice as many iPhones per second as there are babies born and this is globally
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.200]   This is in the world. This is everywhere
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:02.840]   A profit of 18 billion dollars of course six billion dollars a month. That's about 200 million dollars a day
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.960]   eight million dollars an hour
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:15.320]   138 000 a minute 2 314 dollars a second just boom boom boom profit another ton of another 2 000 another 2 000
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:19.160]   I'm gonna have to modify a joke. I heard a couple years ago
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:24.360]   And when someone has that level of wealth, you know that part of their business has to involve over throwing
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:28.440]   Uncooperative governments from time to time. That's the amount of money this company's making now
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:32.600]   Let's assume that the 142 billion in cash is
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:38.920]   Available, which it isn't. I mean, that's why they have to buy some bizarre. They have to borrow 30 billion dollars
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.960]   Is that is that bond issue?
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:50.040]   Have we talked and I know I came in a little late did we talk about the ramifications of of the the one-time tax that may that may occur
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.640]   Yeah a little bit
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.520]   Well, but are you saying this is a proposal?
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:58.840]   In the us well congress right now that they should pay a one
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.800]   Oh, you're talking about repatriating the 142 billion
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:07.560]   Well, obama is talking about as of yesterday's talking about a one-time tax on all foreign assets
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:13.800]   So this is my budget for all the companies, uh, you know two trillion dollars of which apple has 178 billion
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:18.920]   That's sitting around um and and basically putting a one-time tax of 19
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.560]   And then they're talking about future taxes of 14 per year on foreign
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:31.160]   Revenue so that you can't fully avoid it now the one thing that that they are saying is is that the 19
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:38.840]   Um once it's been taxed you could bring all that money back without taxes and so in some ways that becomes a a break for
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:42.200]   uh apple bean or any anyone else well, they be
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.080]   What a 35 it's the 35
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:49.480]   So yeah, so so would be it would be a discount. I think that you know with the republican congress
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.040]   I think what may end up happening is a
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:58.280]   attacks across everything of 10 or 15 or something like that and then you can bring it back in which would be kind of the
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:03.400]   You know a compromise in the middle of that, but that could be a huge boom for four companies
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.560]   It's it's a it's upsetting
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:09.320]   I think some of them obviously don't want to pay any taxes on it want to leave it out there whatever they put it there
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.680]   like apple
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:14.040]   uh the the prospect of paying let's say 15 or
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:19.240]   Or 10 or 12 on all of it and then bringing it all back in you know could be a
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:24.280]   Uh, you know could be a real advantage over the 35 that they're paying now
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:30.520]   As a non-american though the idea of america taxing things that are outside of america is a little bit legally
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.680]   Questionable and well, I think it opens up
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:37.400]   It opens up a can of worms for basically every other country looking at it going well if it works for america
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:43.160]   We'll do it too. I mean I think that the you know the scooters on yeah, but I think that you know right now as an american citizen
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:47.320]   You pay your taxes no matter where you are in the world, you know it a lot of these companies
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:53.160]   I think the future uh is is not going to be that you can have all all these tax breaks
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.920]   You know you can kind of see things just like when businesses aren't working
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:01.960]   You know taxis didn't work and then uber came up and and you know the the the idea of having tax-free
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:06.760]   Income at the level that it's had I mean it's been a good advantage that a lot of companies have had
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:13.080]   But I think that we need to be realists about whether that's going to continue with the number of companies that are looking for places to find revenue
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:16.600]   Whether we like it or not. I'm not saying that I necessarily agree with it or not
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.600]   But I but I think that whether we like that
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:23.320]   Um or not we're very probably going to see some way to tax
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.200]   uh companies no matter where they are
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:32.200]   You're talking about obama's plan or the bar or the boxer rand paul plant because barber boxer and rand paul
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:36.520]   It's definitely not the boxer rand paul plant. That's the invested transportation act. They're saying
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:41.400]   Uh a tax holiday allowing companies to pay six and a half percent on repatriated
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.400]   This is but that would go to the highway trust fund
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:47.320]   What it well obama's saying the same thing except he's saying we're going to take 19
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.840]   No matter whether you repatriated or not. So here's the deal you're going to pay 19
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.080]   And then after that you can bring it in you can bring in any anything that you pay taxes on you can bring
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:59.800]   Back into the country with no more tax impact. So it's it is in some ways a tax holiday
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.960]   But basically what it's not saying what when you say we're going to repatriate the taxes
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:08.360]   Uh that we're going to tax you six percent the companies bring in whatever they need
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:13.160]   Yeah, that is and pays that six percent. So they they're okay. That's great. They'll bring in billions
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.520]   Uh, you know in because that is an opportunity for them
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:21.480]   When you tax all of it the concept is when you say we're going to tax everything that's sitting out there
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:25.560]   What it does is it takes away any inhibition for the companies to leave it out there
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.960]   Because now they've already paid the taxes on it. They might as well bring it
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.720]   You know, bring in and I think the goal is is not only to generate a lot of revenue, which it would
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.120]   um, but also to
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.120]   Uh to bring in
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:41.640]   All that the two trillion dollars bringing a big healthy chunk of it back into the united states to be invested into
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.040]   You know local, you know
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.080]   More local business, you know, because a lot of times decisions are made
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.760]   Those countries are charging like apples paying taxes in the countries where that money
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.960]   Yeah, like they're paying irish taxes or paying Canadian taxes or paying german taxes
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:58.600]   So they'll be paying those taxes plus american taxes, which is different than just if america alone was taxing them
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:03.240]   And then if right now the issue is is that right now they're but they're not paying any taxes
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.480]   You know
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:09.400]   Well, they're paying the local taxes on the local sales
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:13.240]   But all the profits that are going into the the problem that they're having right now of course is the
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.640]   Is that they're not paying any taxes?
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.120]   On and I am like the last person to talk about
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:23.800]   The the the benefits of taxing. I mean, I'm not I'm you know, not a big fan of them
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.000]   at all
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.080]   But but um as you look at it
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.000]   I think that that from a realist perspective
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.720]   I mean I have because a bunch of stuff that I'm working on
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.760]   I've had to study a lot of this over the last couple months and and
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.880]   You just kind of see that the trajectory is is that they're going to
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:43.560]   That countries are going to find a way to get dig into that you can't keep two trillion dollars floating around forever without
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:47.480]   Paying somebody for it. You know, that's I mean I think that that that's uh
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:52.200]   Apple sold a five and a half million max last quarter enough to give one to every person in ireland. How about that?
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:57.320]   Just they're as people ever listen where in ireland. Do they do they really think that they're
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:03.560]   Do they really think they're capable of processing five million? I thought activations on the same day. Oh, they can't I don't think so
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:10.200]   They could buy with i'm sorry. I said 142. It's 178 billion in cash. They could buy ibm
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:17.160]   It's current market cap is 152 billion. They could buy four gm and tesla and still have 41 billion left over
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.360]   So michr. So better find those car keys fast because
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:24.440]   By all the things they could buy everything. They could buy the music industry
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.800]   They could probably buy most of the uh television industry and like Alex
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.600]   I think it started or Andy said they start overthrowing unfriendly governments
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:36.200]   But they can't do it because it's uh in ireland and so they'd have to pay tax on it. They could overthrow non-american companies
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.240]   I mean if you look at you know, disney
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.280]   We've talked about this before disney's market cap is 155 billion
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:50.440]   So apple could buy disney with cash and that when you look at the the marketing opportunities of having marvel star wars
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.040]   Um, and then all the disney stuff all the disney properties. What do you do with all that cash? I mean, uh, what?
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.840]   What's the point of all that cash?
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.640]   Well, it's it's to be able to do things like that
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:06.600]   Yeah, but no, but they've never done that. I mean they've just never have they're spending two billion
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:11.320]   Yesterday on a data center their ability to you know, they people say they should buy twitter
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:15.880]   They should buy this with a tesla, but they yesterday they dropped they're dropping two billion dollars on a data center
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.440]   They could do the same thing tomorrow they could build 20 data centers
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.440]   They want to be more competitive with google and amazon
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:26.120]   I think the most competitive thing they do with that money is to other companies will simply license technology
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.120]   They need apple will buy it outright
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:33.960]   Uh, there was a statement some interview with I wish I remember which executive it was what was someone pretty high
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:38.360]   Pretty highly placed who was talking about the development of the nexus six phone saying that on
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:44.040]   That fingerprint's pretty fingerprint ID was one of those things on their wishlist for the nexus six
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.160]   It was actually gonna there's a little divot in the back of the phone that the motor
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.640]   They're gonna have put it right there, but as they were developing it
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:53.080]   They said who who has the best like fingerprint scanners on the market?
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:56.040]   Well, it's what's is this one copy that has the ones that really work
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:01.160]   But apple owns them out right now and so there's no way to get that and so that wasn't the only reason why they didn't put it on
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:04.120]   There but it means this one of the reasons why they decided to leave it off
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:09.480]   That's it's it really is just think about when you think about apple's money you think about firepower again
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:13.000]   It's not they don't have to buy what they need they don't have to license what they need
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:16.760]   They can own the technology that they're gonna make a tentpole feature
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:23.480]   Which is not only great for them, but it also means that if microsoft surface tablet wants to do something that tricky that that apple uses
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:27.960]   They're probably not going to be able to find either supplier for the part or a company that's capable of
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:31.480]   Manufacturing the way that they need something to be manufactured at least at that scale
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:37.800]   I was talking to an electronics manufacturer. Well leave unnamed. They were talking. I was complaining and it's what I do very well
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.040]   and
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:45.720]   About the fact that they were six months late on the on shipping this great little box that they were building for stuff
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.920]   I need and hence the complaint and and uh
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:53.720]   I asked them, you know, what was the delay and they said the iPhone they literally that apple bot
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.360]   There's this one little surface mount chip
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.160]   An apple bought all of them right
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:04.280]   They literally bought all of them for a year like the other and they were like they had the whole whole design finished
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:07.160]   Everything's working. They literally can't get the chips to build the you know
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:12.120]   There's one little chip that's made out of stuff that's very rare and there's only one company that makes them and you can't buy them
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.520]   You know because i think that i think that
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:15.800]   Sorry
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.800]   Palm used to complain about that all the time. Yep
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:23.960]   Yeah, and i think that apple continues to be able to do this where they can simply buy up the world supply of x y and z
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:27.800]   Um in a way, and they can buy it, you know, they can hedge against a lot of things
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.280]   They can buy a lot of things that they may or may not use in the future
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.840]   Because they have that kind of capital
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:38.440]   Yeah, i wonder if they ever do it tactical buying where there's a component that they've already rejected
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.600]   But they know that someone else can make a lot of hay out of it
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:44.680]   But so if they could have simply disrupt other people's access to it. I don't know that I do not know
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.040]   I'm just speculating i'm sorry i'm not even speculating but i'm wondering
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:52.680]   It's just that when you have this much money and your job is to make a world
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.120]   as a
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:57.160]   Do whatever you can to ensure the success of your product
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.760]   If you have the ability to simply say that we don't feel as though
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:04.360]   We're gonna we're gonna buy up every single pair of pants in the world
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.080]   And we're gonna be the king of pants like the old do we see k-joke now?
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.480]   Would anybody wants pants and have to come to me the king of pants
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:12.360]   if you had one of the things that
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:18.120]   Go ahead. Go ahead. Oh, i was just gonna say like it's i don't even think that's necessarily an ethical thing for them to do
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:23.800]   I'm just wondering it's there are things that you do the things that you say you would never do because oh for heaven's eggs
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.040]   Who is ever gonna give me ten thousand dollars to
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:31.400]   To be a prostitute with one person for one time, but okay, but don't here's ten
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.640]   Million dollars. Yes or no
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:39.160]   If there are things that i don't think i copies all we would never do that that just that's just it's a it's a too complicated thing
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:42.920]   And we would rather focus our attention on making our own products better
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:49.000]   But okay, guess what you have you have an amount of money in cash that can be expressed in terms of a fraction of a trillion
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.200]   Dollars now are you saying that you would never do this sapphire Andy?
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:56.200]   I should point out that apples tax
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:02.600]   Okay, we're gonna move on we're gonna move on we're gonna move on i should point out that apples tax rate is 26.3
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:07.240]   According to their quarterly report, which is about half a little more than half of what i pay
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.720]   uh in business taxes
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.760]   Um, of course, we're gonna high tax stay away miss so is apple never mind
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:17.880]   Uh, and uh their revenue gross margin
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:22.680]   Margin was between 38 and a half and 39 and a half percent which actually is not really a huge margin
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:28.280]   Jeff Williams got some nice credit after this quarter which he you know, he had he replaced him cook effectively as VP of uh
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:33.240]   It's new vice president of operations and he's been under the radar for a long time. But i got just thought him
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:34.840]   Yeah, really good job
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:41.000]   Having timclook as ceo and jeff Williams as as vp s vp of operations has been incredibly profitable for app
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.120]   Well, i want to show you a little way you can make a little money on the side
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:49.000]   I'm not talking 172 billion dollars, but i have a feeling there's some money sitting in the drawers
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.560]   of your home that's
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.760]   Just sitting there gathering dust i'm talking about all those old
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.400]   gadgets the iphone the
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:01.640]   The samsung phone the blackberry phone the ipad the tablets
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.760]   You got a surface tablet a samsung tablet a google tablet
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:09.160]   I've got somebody who will buy him from you right now cash on the barrel head
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:16.440]   It's called gazelle and one of the great things about gazelle is uh, you can get a quote right now and this and give yourself 30
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:21.000]   Days to decide those quotes are locked in for 30 days, which is a great deal
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:25.640]   Um the top dollar on a lot of products go get a quote
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.720]   They pay the shipping once you decide to sell it
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:31.800]   Press the checkout button. They'll send you a box with the prepaid shipping on it
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:37.160]   Then they'll also if you forget to wipe the data wipe it for you and send you a check paypal
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:43.320]   Or an amazon gift card to bump the value of the amazon gift card by 5 so you spend a lot on amazon
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.600]   It's a good deal good money for your old stuff gazelle
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:53.720]   Dot com they also sell you might wonder what happens to this stuff. Well the very best stuff that sold to gazelle
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:58.120]   They turn around they check it. They put it through a 30 point inspection
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:02.040]   They uh, and then they sell it as certified pre-owned
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.920]   They're have two classes of uh
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:08.520]   Of condition certified like new which is good as new
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:14.600]   Somebody bought something never used it sold it to gazelle. They're selling it to you and then certified good
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.840]   Which is yes, I'm slight wear gentle wear
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:22.040]   But if you've lost your phone or broken it or if you need a tablet, you don't want to spend top dollar
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.120]   This is a great place to get a great price
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:27.240]   Buy or sell at gazelle gazelle
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.960]   Lle
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.640]   Dot com
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:37.880]   What's your old iphone worth find out more than you think probably why let it sit there and gather dust? It's worth money
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.440]   gazelle
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.440]   Dot com
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.920]   Andy and echo from the share house. Shaka. Oh, hi
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:49.480]   Nice to have you Andy from the Chicago Sun times
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:52.520]   Uh the big one
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:56.280]   Uh also from uh from the vatican mr. Alex lensee
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.240]   No, he's not from the vatican
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:04.120]   He just came there from here from there and from uh, i'm more dot com mr
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.560]   I'll come here mike is always
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:07.080]   Can't hear you Alex
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.600]   Yeah, I like it. Sorry about that. No, it was good. That's good. That's good
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.320]   One other thing we learned in that earnings call the apple watch will ship in april
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:19.960]   We hadn't been saying fact even as late as last week that it probably be end of march
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:23.720]   This is not that big a difference at least we know we got the definition of early
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:26.680]   Early is january to april
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:31.320]   Mid is may to august and late is september to disember
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:35.320]   They said early 2015 we have learned from nine to five mak
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.760]   I think we talked about this last week mark ermine says they're working on the battery life
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:44.120]   Um, do you feel like it's pretty close to done? Uh, we were talking on twit
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:49.400]   And nick built and said you know because we mentioned there are a thousand prototypes in use right now at apple
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:52.600]   Nick built and says he knows some people who are wearing apple watches
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:55.320]   You think it's pretty close to done rene
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:58.600]   Uh, i think i think i move a target. Yeah
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:03.240]   And i think for a lot of manufacturers have probably done i think that bry apple is
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.800]   They're still polishing the gold
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:09.400]   Yeah, like the a carrot gold evidently that needs saves
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:13.400]   Yeah, yeah, they put saves in the stores. It's great. It's a big moving target
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:17.400]   They want it they're giving a lot of people are wearing them. They're giving a lot of people ability to test them
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:23.320]   They have third party apps being tested on them because the sdk is out and developers are starting to be able to target the device
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.320]   And that's going to have to ship with the device
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:29.080]   So it's it's getting a lot of pieces that have to land exactly at the same time and that
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.160]   They're going to use as much time as they can for it
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:35.560]   That's why apples usually loathe to give much advanced data on when they're going to ship or what they're going to do
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:38.200]   And we should point out could be april first or april 30th. I mean
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:43.960]   And you know and i'm happy for apple like a lot of people like it's funny because the internet is really upset that apple
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:48.440]   Isn't taking more time and doing things more making more stability and doing things better
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:53.240]   But at the same time they're really angry that apple is inshipping things faster and those are two, you know very contrasting truths
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:57.960]   Personally with photos for the mac and with the apple watch if they said early
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:02.920]   2015 i am happy for them to spend every hour of every minute of every day making that product as good as possible
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:06.360]   Before it goes out the door in early 2015. I don't need that february second
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:13.640]   Yeah, i'm glad that they're not setting themselves and locking themselves into an arbitrary ship date that they don't know if they can meet or not
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.040]   because in the end we we're so
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:23.000]   We're very very much trained to expect that whatever the next thing is we can't have it fast enough when really if we get it in april
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.200]   As opposed to march that's not going to change anybody's life whatsoever
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:31.480]   I thought it was interesting that there are a couple of different people reporting having spotted somebody wearing an apple watch on
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.600]   the on
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:34.600]   San Francisco bay area commuter rail
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.400]   Which would be interesting that the
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:44.760]   There that there if it's if it's true that would be an interesting data point in that apple is letting people off campus with these things
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:47.560]   Which would indicate that
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:52.920]   They don't it's outside of controlled environment and also they have already had that lecture about now if you drink
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:57.320]   Here's the here's the lock box you're going to put this watch in before you you're allowed to drink
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:04.520]   It's and do you think they have a case like they're there maybe they put it in like a moto 360 box on the
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:08.200]   There's no need to do that. There's this is this this this product is completely out in the open
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:12.040]   And as a matter of fact it might if I would not even be surprised if
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:18.200]   There were this were part of the promotional campaign say well now that we're we know that we know that it's going to be out in april
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:21.240]   We will allow our employees to be discreet
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:25.880]   But wear them outside in the hopes that maybe someone will see them and and we get a picture and say oh my god
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:27.560]   I saw an apple watch. I saw you saw an apple watch
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:31.960]   It smelled like rose water and it glowed like a rising sun
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:36.200]   I I wonder how funny people at apple find it when we talk about this kind of stuff
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:42.040]   I know like for example when an invitation comes out and people start guessing the invitations the design team just cracks open alcohol and starts drinking
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:48.520]   Because it's so funny the apple they've been wearing the apple watch since almost literally after it was announced as soon as it was publicly announced
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:51.800]   People who had carry political just started wearing them outside of apple campus
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:56.040]   If you have lived in kupertino, you have seen them for months since october at the very least
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:00.040]   It's nothing new. It's just at some point someone decided oh people might be wearing it outside
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:02.200]   Let's go get some right let's go try and get some pictures
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.520]   And personally these are apple engineers on their own time
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:09.640]   And they're getting a lot of paparazzi like treatment now which we can debate whether that's ethical or not because it's so it's a watch
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:14.680]   Doesn't really affect anybody's life, but this this is nothing unusual. This is what they've been doing for months
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:18.760]   There it is
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.920]   You have to be tested in it
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:24.440]   I mean yay good for you. You splattered an apple watch on the train
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:26.680]   Two thumbs up
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.440]   You could have done that in october
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.440]   Uh, mark german has tweeted
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:36.840]   This is this is how crazy it is. Here's the icon for the apple watch companion iphone app
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:45.720]   Well, at least it's the one they're using now. I mean we there were icons in the ios 8 beta that never shipped
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:46.840]   to
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:51.960]   Which is the ios presumably that will have to ship concurrently with the apple watch so that you'll have watch
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:56.680]   Compatibility is now in beta 5 which I mean we're pretty far along with 8.2
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.640]   beta 5 just came out
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:03.160]   As did x code 6.2 beta 5 with watch kit
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:09.800]   As did interestingly a new beta version of apple tv software for the third gen apple tv
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:14.520]   So yeah, those are all in lockstep. Yeah, they are
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.920]   Why is that so uh
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.640]   The x code is what they use to develop on the new beta
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:22.920]   So if there's new features in the beta that they need to update x code to go along with that's fine
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:28.680]   And apple tv even though out on the outside they give it some really weird os name and number that's always behind ios
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:32.600]   Inside it's running the same version of ios it gets updated when the phone does and then the ipone
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:39.000]   And the i forgot to mention someone from apple tweeted that there's a now playing glance on the apple watch
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.040]   It's been updated in the developer documentation and that would be for something that's music or something that's playing on your phone
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:48.120]   Yeah, it's almost like it's like the lock screen on the iphone you can look at that and quickly see yeah
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.360]   Yeah, so you can whatever it is
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:55.960]   Someone was asking about apple tv and you tim cook mentioned that it controls the apple tv during the keep during the introduction that's neat
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:42:00.920]   Um, this is a screen also a tweet from mark german
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.920]   But as as you point out, this could be this is a prototype could be different
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:09.000]   Could be the same but i feel like we're getting close though april's just around the corner
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.080]   And they've got to burn the firmware onto the watch at the factory at some point
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:15.160]   Yeah
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:18.600]   Do you think somebody goes with a briefcase locked to his wrist?
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:26.040]   It gets on a plane and flies to send Shenzhen china and says i think there are really solid deadlines for that kind of stuff when it has to be shipped
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.120]   And you know people take care of it. Yeah
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:33.240]   I could probably do it on the internet but on a really secure maybe use uh, I probably use one drive
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.160]   Here's the dream member that story. Yeah drop box
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:42.360]   It was that great story about i think it was return of the king when they had the final copy ready and the fiber didn't reach all the way to the production offices in
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:46.360]   New Zealand so they loaded it on an ipad ipod classic and put it in the pocket
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:51.480]   And they were running it from the fiber optic line back to the production office and a guy started following him
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:54.600]   And he thought it was he wasn't sure if they wanted the ipod or they knew what was on it
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:56.600]   And he just started running faster and faster
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:00.040]   You want to control your tesla from your apple watch
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:03.720]   There's an app for that
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:10.520]   Well, you don't drive it. Well, no me we're temperature controls a lot of a lot of people like who have pets for instance
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:15.880]   They will like you know, they can leave the they can leave the pet in the car because they can keep the car warm
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:18.680]   And make keep an eye on the temperature. Yeah, that's nice. Isn't it?
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:24.120]   I have a friend who was at some at times have been summoned like from a restaurant by police
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:30.360]   Because some some do good or was about to smash the windows that poor dog. He's freezing to death inside that car
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:35.400]   No, no, look at my wristwatch. I could tell you exactly how cool also. Look at that. Look at that dog
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:39.960]   He is like he is a bernie's mountain dog that he likes three days in the Swiss Alps
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:42.440]   I don't think three degrees is gonna bother him a lot
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:48.040]   And my boss has a tesla and he uses the app on all his phones to open the door when his kid just wants to run to the car and get something
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:51.720]   He forgot in it. It's it were to monitor the charge level. It's all sort of useful. Yeah
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:56.680]   Also, this is exactly the sort of integration that a company like tesla wants and a company like apple wants
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:03.080]   They want people who can afford to spend hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars for a gadget like this to use it to control their
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:07.800]   Gadget that costs tens of thousands of dollars. Right. Right really makes both companies look really good
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:12.520]   We can even see a map and how fast you're going
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:19.400]   Is a guy going 120 miles an hour down university avenue at Palo Alto. That seems a bad idea
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:22.760]   It was just watching testing
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.440]   purely for testing
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:27.480]   Well, and I think that I think the fact that and again, I there was a
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:35.800]   During the when they're talking about the number of sales and and android and everything else and then one of the things that one of the stats that came out this week was that
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:41.800]   You know the app store is making 70 more even though there's more apps now on the on the android store
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:45.400]   The apps the the ios app store is is making more money
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:49.000]   And I think that that is going to make a big impact on it makes an impact on apple pay
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.720]   It makes an impact on on what kind of things get developed for the watch because people are going to pay for it
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:56.040]   You know, they're gonna you know that it's I think it's going to be a market
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:00.280]   I mean I think especially for those who get out there in the first month or two
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:05.480]   You know who aren't part of 1.2 million or 1.1 million apps
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:09.080]   I think there's going to be you know a huge opportunity a bit of a gold rush
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:14.200]   And so we're going to see you know a lot of innovation and you know most of it will probably be pretty bad
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:19.720]   In the first three or three months, but it's going to be pretty exciting. I think that because people know that
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:25.320]   iOS users and especially the folks that are going to be first adopters once they pay $350 for a
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:30.600]   For a watch they're going to spend another $150 200 on apps within the first couple weeks
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:35.880]   We're you can't charge for you just in case people are wondering you can't charge for
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:40.760]   Watchkit apps because they're right now. They're only remote for you as they extend from the iPhone apps
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:45.000]   You have to charge for the iPhone app and then build that functionality and quote unquote for free for the watch
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.200]   Well, but I think that there's going to be a lot of apps that are that are specific for the watch though that are being supported through the
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:51.560]   I mean
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:54.920]   I think there's going to be new functionality that you're going to end up with on your phone
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:58.120]   That is going to be an opportunity to use on your watch if that makes sense
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.800]   I don't think they're going to be
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:05.240]   I think the first thing people are going to do are going to they're going to enjoy the apps that they happen to have installed already that have that express
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:10.680]   Functionality to the watch but they're also going to go and look for oh wow what other app what apps do we not own that are cool
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.680]   Thanks to have for this watch right
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:18.760]   I speak I speak from a certain amount of experience
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:21.480]   I
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:27.320]   Alright, let's uh, oh and you mentioned I should probably fill in the details
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:31.960]   You mentioned rene that apple was spending two billion dollars on a data center
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:36.040]   They the old sapphire the old sapphire plants being converted
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:38.200]   down by the mine
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.040]   Mesa, Arizona remember that plant that
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:42.680]   my claim
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:47.640]   Gt was gonna build to make sapphire then they went bankrupt and apple has the plant used to make solar panels
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:53.080]   They're going to turn it into a data center in mace, Arizona, which is good news for mace because it's going to put some
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:55.960]   You know you have a lot of money when you're like, what are we going to do that?
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:00.760]   We got sitting down there. We don't want to just light it. Oh, I mean, it's got a lot of infrastructure
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.440]   It just well just throws more computers in there
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.200]   I I suspect it has something to do with
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:08.760]   With appeasing the city government of mace because there was some concern about loss of jobs
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:15.640]   150 full-time apple employees will be hired there and three to 500 construction and trade jobs during its construction
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:22.040]   It will be powered by 100 percent renewable energy, including a new local solar farm. So that's nice
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:25.880]   That's the kind of agility that all that money gives you. Yeah, well though
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:30.120]   They're not to be fair gonna spend the two billion right away. I imagine it'll be spread out a bit
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:33.400]   No, just like you know, it's like putting it for us. It's like putting gazebo in the house
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:37.480]   Project you plan it out you spend the money. We're gonna do a gazebo
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:43.000]   Two billion dollar gazebo. I mean if it takes if it takes more than about six weeks
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:48.920]   They will have already made the money or two weeks in two or three weeks. They will already made that money. Sure
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:52.200]   That's a good point. That's just a couple of weeks salary there
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:56.200]   It's amazing when you look at how much money they tell you they've spent on the stock repurchases and everything else
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:48:00.520]   And you look at how much money they've made and the money hasn't changed like they spent all this money and they still have all this money
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.600]   It's kind of amazing, isn't it?
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:07.080]   Can't imagine and again at the trajectory that they've been on and who knows if they're going to continue the stock repurchased
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:09.320]   There won't be any stock left after about 2022
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:13.320]   So, you know like literally there won't be any stock left or they keep on repurchasing this fast
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:16.760]   And they end up with 150 billion dollars in the bank without any you know
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:19.160]   You know
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:21.240]   Without car like him without having to pay a dividend
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:23.800]   Yeah, well, I think that that's the I
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:26.920]   I think I personally think the whole buyback thing and the dividends are a waste of money
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:31.560]   I think apples should continue to you know do innovative things with the money not just buy it back for investors
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.920]   But if they're gonna do it
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:39.000]   I think that the buyback makes way more sense the dividends the dividends just pouring money down the drain to investors where has that
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.760]   I mean and when I say that I'm just saying that investors are getting something out of it
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:43.640]   The stock is going up
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:50.200]   You know that you're you're investing in a company that at the edit size should be growing one or two percent a year and is growing a lot faster than that
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:54.040]   you know, so the investors are getting their value out of it from there and the
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.840]   You know, I don't think that apple owes them anything
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:02.360]   But I think that if they're gonna do what they might as a buy do stock buyback because eventually again if they continue to do it
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:07.400]   Go down that trajectory they'll buy themselves back. What is the value of the outstanding apple shares?
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:10.040]   I
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.040]   Did the math at some point?
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:14.200]   Yes, we can find a calculation
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:17.720]   It's only complicated because you can't use shareholder money to buy back shareholder money
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:21.400]   You can use other sources of money to buy back. Oh, that's interesting. How interesting
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:25.320]   Because the money you have is shareholder money. So you can't technically buy your own shares with that
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:30.600]   You've got a couple shares outstanding of 5.825 billion. That's all shares
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:34.760]   Oh billion share and it's 118 dollars a share so multiply
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:40.680]   Comes out a little more than they got you've got the number sheet open Leo. Yeah, I should use these numbers
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:44.120]   That could be the only way they've actually screwed themselves. We're now they're so valuable
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:46.360]   They can't even they can't avoid by themselves out. Yeah
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:49.960]   So we're talking hundreds maybe set what is it 700 billion
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:54.200]   For uh to buy all that stock back. So that's what amazing
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:59.400]   I tried to compare the Samsung earnings to the apple earnings and the Samsung earnings were in trillions of of um, yeah
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:04.440]   And yeah, so then I converted apple and it's sort of breaking when I got to quadrillions of one
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:10.280]   I'll deal the only conclusion when you do that math is I don't want to piss off either company
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:14.600]   They they could own surface-dare missiles
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:19.400]   Our show today brought to you by our good friends at fresh books if you are a

[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:22.120]   apple and sam song are now in a dead heat
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:25.000]   globally
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.760]   For smartphone is it globally or is that nationally for smartphone?
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:31.400]   Dominant south koreans
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:34.360]   I won't say how many smartphones they sold in the december quarter
[00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:37.480]   but they shipped 95 million
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:40.120]   and that
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:43.800]   About 70 high 70s were high end phones that means
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:49.960]   Their smartphone sales were somewhere around 71 to 75 million which is right in there with apple
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:52.120]   Which sold 70 a four and a half million?
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:56.760]   Um, and of course we saw that apple had 50 percent of activations in the us
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.400]   Means sam song had something less than half
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:05.400]   Probably it's really hard math because app it's hard to decide what's sell through and what's sell in like what's actually sold to customers
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:09.800]   And what's stuffed into channels and ben baharen on tech pinyons that are really good. He has access
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:13.240]   He's an analyst. He has access to all sorts of devices inventory and sell through data
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:16.200]   And he put together a nice chart that basically said for the first time
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:20.840]   Their neck and neck and what's hard to remember though is that apple has never really been in the lead here there
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:25.960]   Were way behind nochia when they started blackberry was way ahead and sam sung zoom past all of them
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:32.280]   So apple's traditionally not been the the top player in phones steve jobs famously said he wanted one or two percent
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:36.280]   Of the market. So it's pretty it's pretty interesting to see apple's trajectory there
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:38.920]   And as far as apps
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:41.560]   Apple's making more money, but google play
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:47.160]   selling more apps google play out paste apples app store downloads by about 60
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:50.840]   percent according to app a ne in 2014 but the app store
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:55.080]   Somehow made more than 70 percent more in revenue than google play
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:58.600]   Class of clients are they going to afford the super bowl ad leo amazing
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:03.000]   There were two apps on the super bowl. There was there's that gods of war app too with
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.200]   uh
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:11.800]   Kate upton in a metal breastplate and leo lem neesam playing uh love lem neesam in the clash of clans ad great ad
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:16.280]   You know, it's funny. You give give me a choice between an attractive young woman and leon neeson
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:20.680]   I'm gonna take leon neeson every time he's got like Alex linde's got very particular skills
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:25.400]   I have very particular skills. Did you did you all see that? That was such a grab. I should run that
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:29.880]   I'm sure everybody saw it, but run me a question. Which one would you rather have as an enemy?
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:32.200]   I'd rather be
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:35.480]   On Lee and leon neeson side clash of clans which I play it's a fun game
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:41.240]   We've got a quick twig clan on clash of clans is uh is a game where you kind of attack
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:44.120]   Oh
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:46.840]   Wait a minute. He he lost. Do you want revenge?
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:49.320]   Oh
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:52.360]   I love it. I don't know you big buffet boy 85
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:55.720]   If you think you can humiliate me and take my gold
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:55:01.400]   Think again. I want to be big buffet boy 85 with lots of barbarians and dragons
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:05.960]   I can't wait to destroy your village. Well, you beg for mercy
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:08.760]   But you will get no mercy
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:11.320]   I will have my revenge
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:14.200]   Taken forth
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:16.440]   lion
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:18.040]   It's uh
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:20.040]   Liam
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:23.240]   You will regret the day you crossed angry
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:32.280]   Angry neeson 52
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:36.120]   I gotta have an angry neeson 52 now. I love it. I love it. Like he's really great actors
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:43.240]   It's like they were handed this key to a locked a locked cabinet somewhere in the world that they put on their key ring
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:45.800]   And at some point they say you know what I think now's the time
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:51.000]   I use this key to unlock that clause of this just filled with money for me to use this wonderful character that I've built
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:57.080]   In the past 30 years. I love that. I love that. I remember William shatners. I'm a shaman for gods for uh, was it um
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:59.960]   Warcraft world of warcraft. Oh, that's right
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:04.040]   I was shaman and then they had uh mr. T. Would you see we did that too?
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:08.120]   So great, but that just shows you how much money there
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:12.680]   I mean really the the news angle on that by the way is there's a lot of money in apps
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:17.160]   If they bought a four million dollar super bowl ad and I'm sure Liam wasn't cheap either
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:21.400]   in app purchase. Yeah, let's say it again in
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:26.280]   App purchase that is it generates a sickening amount of money
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:29.800]   I forgot who said it someone was saying this on twitter yesterday that they were watching
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:32.840]   I think it was James Thompson the developer peacocks that he was watching kids play
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:37.000]   And they had 10 apps going at once because they didn't like having to wait and they couldn't pay for stuff
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:42.040]   So they would have 10 games going at once and just switch between them as the as the timeout periods would expire
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:49.640]   Doesn't but doesn't that freak you out a little bit because that that really is that that really is at best
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:53.080]   uh obsessive behavior at worst addictive behavior
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.960]   And I really think that there might be a time coming when
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:59.480]   Everyone's gonna take three steps back and say let's look at this
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:05.800]   Like just passionately and say oh my god this this thing this could be the the tobacco ruling sort of thing
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:11.160]   This could be like the corn syrup problems that people are that people are attacking other industries for
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:18.840]   I do think that that app game developers might be facing a certain backlash like that in the next year or two where people realize that
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:25.720]   They're building machines to just keep people hooked onto a repetitive reward behavior
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:31.320]   About a facebook you could say it about games. I mean I I know that for me
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:34.360]   You know just checking all the things that I check on that I want to look at it
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:36.520]   I'm at a nice hotel
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:38.680]   and uh at and uh
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:41.560]   It's a Michelin, I guess three star restaurant downstairs and
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:43.400]   And uh
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:48.440]   I asked for you know for breakfast. I asked for a certain table and they were like oh you want to have the good the good view
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:50.600]   And I was like no, that's just where my cell coverage works
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:52.360]   You know, it's like, you know, it's you know
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:55.240]   And so I think that a lot of us are our lives become this I just know
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:59.000]   I noticed it when I said that that that our lives get very much wrapped around
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:02.360]   You know our devices to a level that we got a
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:03.960]   You know with it
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:07.800]   I'll make this quick because otherwise that this could turn to a to our topic, but I
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:10.200]   I appreciate that but there's also
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:14.520]   They really are they use the same psychology they use to build slot machines where it's not just
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:19.560]   Certain people are going to simply use their phones too much and be on twitter and be on facebook
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:24.200]   They're creating a game experience to make sure that the point at which your decision making is at the most week
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:26.920]   I'm not talking about in general I'm talking about at this moment
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:29.400]   Here's where we hit them with another decision to keep playing the game
[00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:36.120]   So that that's why I think that it's the tobacco companies could not back away from these claims the way that like mcdonald's
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:39.640]   Rather manufacturers could be they can say we just make food that people like and people like sugar
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:41.720]   They like salt. They like fat
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:45.720]   The tobacco companies had to admit after being forced of evidence that no
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:47.080]   We are actually
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:48.120]   Intentionally
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:52.120]   Goosing up these numbers to make sure that people find it very very hard to stop using the product
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:56.520]   Look at this. This is from think gaming. I don't know that it's a top grossing iOS games
[00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:59.000]   Uh, this is for one day
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:06.680]   One day revenue and clash of clans there were 194 000 new installs 1.6 million dollars for one day
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:09.560]   Game of war, which was the one that had kad Upton
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:13.880]   Uh 1.1 million a day 30 percent of that would be
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:16.280]   Uh
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:21.320]   Oh, yeah, it's apple gets that's right in fact add these up because this is one day
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:24.840]   Candy crissaga almost a million candy crissota saga
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:29.960]   390 000 boom beach 300 000 big fish casino quarter million hey day
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:34.600]   216 000 that matin and this is all one day revenue
[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:38.920]   Look how well shin bu lua show way john shanjo
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:44.760]   Doo da did look at the amount of money apple pays to developers and figure out how much of that is likely going into this top list
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:48.440]   Yeah, oh, yeah almost on minecraft pocket edition only
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:52.680]   $1,000 but that's not in that purchase was right that's just a
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:56.120]   You may you pay seven bucks up front. That is a great
[00:59:56.120 --> 01:00:03.240]   Great chart. Thank you scooter x for passing that along. Yeah, cross. You wrote it 28 000 a day. It looked like yeah
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:07.400]   There's money in that purchase. How much he wrote you could play without buying easy
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:11.880]   I mean, there's no kind of crazy actually to think that crossy wrote a case a buck for a character
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:14.440]   eventually $1,000 a day
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:19.480]   Boy in some ways though. I and I think that it's you know again like field runners is a good example
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:22.840]   I think I paid $3 for that and since have paid yeah 50
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:26.440]   You know, you know, you know because it you know, it's like buy more buy more things
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:31.640]   So I can you know I just want to buy my little extra whatever and I and I you know you get
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:35.960]   They do it really well because it's like 20 000 points that'll take you six months to
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:38.520]   You know to work through so it's not that big of a deal
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:44.120]   But you look at it at the end and go wow I I paid as much as a console game for this little game that i'm playing on my iphone
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:46.600]   And to andy's point that it is a whale system
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:50.280]   There are certain people who just spend thousands and thousands of dollars on these apps every weekend, right?
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:55.240]   But at the same time we we I don't want to shirk my responsibility here because we as a community said
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:57.560]   We're not going to pay 10 bucks for super monkey ball
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:02.600]   We'll take the free game and then pay you a thousand dollars so that our monkey ball looks better than the other guys monkey ball
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:06.920]   Or gets back on the race faster. So we said what we're willing to pay for, you know, yeah apple
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.640]   Has a responsibility
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:12.280]   Absolutely because they're the ones who said that no, we're not going to let you
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:15.960]   Release games that people could just try you have to keep keep
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:21.880]   Only to release things that are generating a reverend that get them to buy or get them to go away
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:25.320]   Um also, I'm sorry. I'll let you go
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:30.120]   No, I just think you know like with my kids. I don't I don't buy them anything
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:33.000]   And they they get the game. I mean that i'll buy the game
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.520]   You know or or download. I don't really buy I don't really download all out of free stuff
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:39.640]   Mostly because i'm always afraid that it's just going to be some in purchase hooks
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:43.640]   So I so I usually want to see something be 99 cents or 199 or 499 or 499
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:46.600]   Whatever and then I buy it and I feel like i'm going to get at least some value
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:50.120]   But when my kids get to the end where they want in that purchases, I'm like, I just move on to another game
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:54.840]   We talked to a lot of developers and they said that people won't pay to get rid of ads
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.720]   They put ads in and they offer to dollar and people just will put up with the ads
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:01.640]   They'll give you a level to download and they'll offer you to buy five more levels
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:03.800]   And you won't buy them. You'll just go to the next free game
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:06.200]   I mean it's it's everyone is sort of struggling
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:10.280]   It's a complex it's a complicated issue and I I've been looking in
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:12.040]   I've been looking at this and talking to people
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:16.200]   I've been talking to a lot of behavior psychologists as a matter of fact about how this mechanism works
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:22.600]   And a lot of the things that just put that bad taste in my mouth is that it's the same reason why you wonder why there are
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:25.480]   You get the spam email. That's just so ridiculous that you wonder
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:28.840]   God, what's the what's the point of even sending out something that's this stupid?
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:32.680]   And then you look into a why this why this was put out and how it was put out that way
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:36.840]   They're not looking to convince most people that this is a legitimate thing
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:44.840]   They're seeking out the 4% or the 2% that are that gullible to identify those people if they can target them later
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:48.280]   And that's what I feel like a lot of this in our purchase thing is doing later
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.360]   It's not most of us are able to
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:54.840]   Spend a certain amount of money that we're comfortable with and get our enjoyment out of the game and put it down
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:57.640]   But I think that I don't know for sure
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:01.480]   But I'd say I would hate to think that as part of these companies business plan
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:08.200]   It says there's a powerpoint slide somewhere that says that statistically speaking 4% have addictive personalities that we could that we can find
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:13.240]   That doesn't matter that we've got 96 users out of 100 that are just give us a dollar or two
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:17.960]   It's just out there to find those 4% that are going to give us 75% of our revenue
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:26.840]   Uh, the steve jobs movie is in filming it right now in uh just down the road a piece in uh,
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:32.920]   Cupertino they were at the flint center with jobs unveiled the macadocian 84 and did a number of other
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:36.680]   Uh events and as you may remember the steve jobs would be
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:40.520]   Is centered around uh three or four steve jobs keynotes?
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:44.360]   Uh, these are extras lining up over 2 000 people showed up
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:49.160]   To sit in the audience. I know I know somebody who did get in
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.080]   And they didn't even fill the flint center
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:55.320]   There's filled the first four or five rows and use movie magic to make that look like a lot of people
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:57.320]   But we do have some pictures
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:01.080]   Here's uh, michael fastbender who is playing steve jobs
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:04.360]   Yeah, I see that picture. I'm like, oh, I don't know if i'm really gonna buy that
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:06.520]   I know and that's Seth road in his was obviously
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:08.440]   I don't know
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:10.840]   Uh, it looks like he's got frosted hair
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:15.080]   He does but that may just I don't know the hair's wrong. It's just wrong
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:16.840]   uh
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:21.560]   Maco fastbenders gorgeous frankly, and uh, that's the problem right there
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:28.040]   Always be magneto to me. Yeah, Danny. Yeah, danny boy oldy director who's a great director, uh, really wanted him
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:34.280]   Uh for this role, uh sony apparently did not and nor did they earn sorkin the uh screenwriter
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:37.720]   Um, so they're right now
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:44.280]   Uh, they're going now over to the garage of steve jobs childhood home in lascatos
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:47.480]   And they'll be filming there. So these are first pictures now of
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:52.360]   Michael fastbender as uh steve jobs and seth rogan as wasniak
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:55.080]   Kate winslette will also be in the movie
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:05:00.680]   You know role at a playing person who had no historic importance, but at least we got k-winslet in the movie
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:04.200]   She'll be playing early employee joanna hoffman
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:07.240]   Katherine wadderson waterston
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:09.240]   In an early employee would be unimportant. Yeah, no
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:14.680]   People are part of the mythology, but yeah, which which actually brings up an interesting question like there's so
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:20.040]   For it's for a lot of people working at apple being one of the first 50 employees was certainly a highlight
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:25.080]   One of the highlights and for the highlight reel, but it certainly didn't it wasn't the sort of thing where they'd want
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:27.080]   Hey, now there's somebody who's playing me in a movie
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:32.360]   And now there are words being put in my mouth that I never said and intentions that maybe I really never felt
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:35.400]   And but now how many people are going to be thinking that i'm the person
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:40.680]   Uh, i'm the person who told steve jobs, you know what this sort of thing is never going to work
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:44.840]   We need to make sure this will work more like a mini computer than a personal computer steve
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:50.600]   Uh, I asked was what he thought about seth rogan playing him and he's very happy about that
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:55.080]   But seemed it feels like seth rogan got picked because he has a beard. I think they
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:06:02.840]   Is yeah, well, i call fast bender was male. Yeah, it doesn't is is is wav is was a part of a
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:08.840]   Consultant on that movie. I seem to remember that he was he was the all the ashton kotcher movie. I think was no no
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:15.000]   He hated the ashton kotcher movie. Yeah, yeah, I I don't know if was is a consultant on this
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.640]   I don't I don't believe that he could be insincere
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:21.160]   But that if he is a consultant for that movie then that certainly yeah
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:26.200]   Well, I asked his wife jannett. She said he's michael no no one thought michael keaton was going to be a good batman
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:30.440]   And he was one of the two grades. No kidding. It was amazing. No, go go from photos. Yeah, you can't tell
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:33.800]   We'll have to we'll have to see the movie, but they're filming right now
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:37.160]   So so so long as seth rogan doesn't laugh once during the movie i'll be fine
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.200]   You don't like his laugh
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:43.640]   Oh, yeah, I remember that last now
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:45.640]   It's fine so it's not like
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:49.080]   It's only when he's laughing all the time that i've it's like i've got like a
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:55.000]   Four and a half minute shot clock for that laugh that okay, then we're three minutes 50. I it's okay. I'm fine
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:02.040]   After that it's like, okay. I love this movie, but I got things to jam. I'm just genetically non-pre-disposed to a process that sound
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:04.680]   What do you think of this?
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:10.600]   Renee richy there's a little less competition for you joystick and the unofficial apple web log to uaw
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:13.400]   Absorbed
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:18.040]   by engazet all three owned by aol joystick was a gaming
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:20.760]   site video game site
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:25.560]   Founded in 2004 so was the unofficial apple web log tua w
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:30.600]   I don't I I feel like tua w was a still a credible and useful
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:36.840]   Blog yeah, I mean we never looked at the other apple blogs as competition because they all had such different unique voices
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:39.800]   And you know and all of their home pages looked pretty bright the news would be similar
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:46.280]   But the home pages all looked really different and I I wrote a a piece on sunday about how I arrived at my first mackerel in
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:51.160]   2009 and didn't know anybody and didn't know what to do and mike rose from tua came up to me and dave kalo and
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:56.680]   That whole team they just they took we went to we went to the movies together and they totally distressed that entire event for me
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:57.960]   They were all
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:00.280]   Class acts generous people to a one
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:07.480]   Strudy coddle did a fantastic piece about this yesterday where you know she was comparing apples philosophy of no profit and loss per
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:13.880]   Per product with like the aol way in some of these other sites. You know, maybe idg does the same thing where
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:19.960]   It's not really how important like for them it's important that to a raises revenues raises all these things
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:24.760]   But there's also something to be said for the value that it gives your brand or the coverage that it gives your readers
[01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:30.280]   That you can you can extract greater value than maybe the clicks that that particular website is getting and as
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:36.600]   As these companies sort of struggle with the modern internet and this is not like idg that was a print publication that was trying to become digital
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:43.320]   Weblogs incorporated was a digital publication, but still it's I mean, it's it's really heartbreaking. Yeah, it's a loss for the entire community
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:45.640]   uh
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:49.880]   Their last day is today you can go to tua w.com one last time and uh
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:53.160]   read michael jones story the end of an era
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:59.320]   Um, if you go to I think it's apple news dot today a bunch of them are making their own site
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:02.600]   Which is good news. Oh, so they're at some of them are out of work
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:05.400]   I think all of I believe all of them
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:09.240]   Some of them will have other jobs like some of them, you know have have day jobs
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:10.920]   Um
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:15.640]   But uh, that's not the right side. I'll find the name apple world. Sorry apple world dot today
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:21.880]   Uh apple world is funny that you can dot today you can do a uh dot today
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:29.880]   Yeah, oops not thought to that. I'm sorry. I'm very bad at this. Yeah, I'm sure we'll give me their super talented people
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:31.720]   I'm sure they'll uh
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:34.200]   Is that the right one? No, maybe not all fine. Anyway
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:36.360]   I
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:38.920]   I'm at least looking forward to some of these people starting their own
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:44.840]   Pride personal tech blogs because I think that's that's some of the most valuable stuff. That's come that's being put out
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:50.440]   I mean jason snell most famously decided. Hey, okay. I don't want to work for idg anymore
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:55.480]   I want to start my own thing and the power of one voice in which the entire publication
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:10:01.000]   reflects a specific point of view with no generalization and the ability to be passionate
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.080]   About that's that point of view. That's so valuable and something that is so hard to convey
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:09.800]   I mean not that this is a a blog rolling
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:13.480]   Event but one of the things I respect the most about imore is that it is
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:19.560]   It's a site that has enough funding to actually pay people and to have people that can do nothing but focus on coverage
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:23.320]   But also it still has that that that idea of we are
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:29.160]   We there was a piece that we would run that you would not if we if this piece were simply cut and paste under wired smashed head
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:32.600]   Or in gadget mass head you would not you would see that wait a minute. That's more of an imore piece
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.200]   Why I can't believe that fire is publishing this?
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:37.800]   So i'm hoping these people break out and and find a way to find
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:41.880]   Sponsorship and support to do keep doing their own thing even if it's on a reduced scale
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:45.880]   And it is i double checked it's www.appleworld.today
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:49.640]   And I think steve sant steven sandy and a bunch of other them are doing that apple world
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:51.800]   Dot today ww
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:57.160]   We'll take a break come back with your picks ladies and gentlemen first a word from jeff bridges
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:00.120]   He's sleeping
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:04.840]   Jeff just created his new site on square space. It's called
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:07.080]   It's called
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:11.160]   Sleeping or sorry dreaming with jeff.com. I guess he's making albums
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.880]   To help you sleep
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:15.880]   Um, this is this is such an interesting
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:19.800]   Site this is done with squares space. Look at the parallax view on this and stuff
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:26.200]   the uh audio and you know this you probably saw it in the square space ad in the super bowl
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:32.920]   But this is gorgeous and this is done with square space all go now to dreaming with jeff.com
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:36.360]   You can go flying with the dude from the big labowski or
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:39.560]   Troning with kevin flim
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:43.240]   I mean, I think one of the things it's
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:44.520]   Go ahead
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:48.360]   One of the things is greater with scarce squares spaces that you can you do get this kind of whizzy wig
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:51.880]   Uh effect, but you also can still inject custom code
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:57.160]   So you can be uh, you know building something and throwing it together on your own and when you decide you need a page
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:01.640]   That has something that doesn't exist on squares space which becomes less and less every every time
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:05.480]   Uh, you can still hire somebody to build pretty sweet for that page
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:07.560]   Yeah, I don't know how custom this is
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.720]   But uh, i'm pretty impressed by this
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:11.000]   Uh
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.640]   You can do in fact he even has it. I think that a lot of this is pretty stock he has a video
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:18.520]   Um of him building this thing
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:23.720]   Um, you start with the 30 templates 14 new designs part of square space
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:30.360]   Seven templates that are generic but also specifically for musicians artists architects restaurants
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.000]   weddings e-commerce
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:40.600]   You need to get this guy in triagulation. I really feel that's troubling. I'm going to talk to square space
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:44.200]   Obviously they've got a relationship with jeff. I think he's great. Oh my god
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:51.080]   And it's you know, he's done some really interesting web stuff. He's very sophisticated actually here. He is picking the templates
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:54.360]   He used the horizon template. It's easy to make changes
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:13:00.280]   You can go edit right on the screen no more toggling to preview mode if you want to use getty images is very easy
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:07.240]   Uh, $10 each they've got the stock images right there on the site social media is built in facebook twitter
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:10.120]   Instagram google plus tumblr youtube Pinterest and more
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:13.640]   And uh, if you want help, I don't know if jeff called to help lima
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:17.880]   But it's there for him 24/7 right from the square space offices in new york city
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:21.320]   And at eight dollars a month. I think jeff's gonna make a little money on this thing
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:26.200]   Look at he's he's now. He's he's I think he actually did this
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:28.120]   He's got using the e-commerce
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:32.760]   I think he actually did this because if you watch this video, which is on the square space site square space.com
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:36.440]   You can see him actually doing all this stuff editing it creating it
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.240]   It's pretty cool eight dollars a month and when you sign up for your free domain name
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.280]   Something like I don't know dreaming with jeff.com
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:50.840]   Square i'll tell the other thing I went there during the super bowl ad I figured if anything is going to tax a square space site
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:56.600]   It's a hundred million people all going there once and it was beautiful. It did not slow down
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:00.680]   This is a very rich media site a lot of great content on it. Well done
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:06.600]   Squarespace.com if you want to try it. It's free. Just click the get started button. You don't need a credit card
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.680]   You can use it for two weeks and if you decide to buy I'll ask as you use the offer code MAC break that'll take 10 off
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:16.920]   And uh, we'll get a little credit from square space for helping them out
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:19.560]   squarespace
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:23.640]   Dot com use the offer code MAC break when you buy for 10 off square space start here
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:26.600]   go anywhere
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:28.200]   even sleeping
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:30.200]   Dreaming with jeff
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:37.320]   Uh, let's get our picks of the week. I think we can kick things off with mr. Andi and not com
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:45.160]   Uh, my pick is sling dot com. This is no one has really the solution to internet internet television
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:51.480]   Uh, but this is a really good start to it. You want to get that is commercial. That's a commercial. Okay
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:57.560]   That if if nothing else it shows you the power of the power sling dot com of sling dot com
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:04.040]   Uh, basically 20 bucks a month and you get not just content from cnn not just content from espan
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:09.720]   Not just content from tbs and stuff like that you get their full live streaming again, including commercials too
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:15.240]   Um, it's 20 bucks a month the original pet the the existing package has about
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:20.920]   Uh, 12 channels to it and again pretty much that is the one where they're gonna put espan on it and everything
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:27.080]   They got the tbs tnt cnn hg tv di y food network. They've got
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:32.760]   Uh, because this is what they is this what they announced with this this is this is what they announced
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:41.480]   Uh, uh, it's starting off with and it's invite only with not a whole not a really large slate of channels
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:45.240]   But they're they've announced intention to expand this as they go
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:47.160]   uh, but
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:48.040]   I
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:49.800]   Ever since we lost
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:55.400]   Uh, you know that wonderful and I would say completely legal a area uh service
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:59.080]   Uh, we really still need the ability to be able to have a
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:03.240]   Access to cable channels live programming especially for live events live news
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:10.600]   Life sports like that at a reasonable rate and more than that a platform so that here is a hulu like service where they can
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:16.840]   Continue to work to strike deals with new companies and bring more content to the platform as things go
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:20.200]   Um, the I would be remiss if I didn't say that
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:24.760]   The alternative to this is to spend a couple hundred bucks for an actual sling box
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:30.280]   And plug it into your cable box and now have every single channel all 400 that you subscribe to
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:34.680]   Uh streaming to your ipad your iandroid device your desktop and stuff like this
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:37.800]   But again, it's a good start and for a lot of people who
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:43.160]   Might see a channel in there that they watch all the time. This is a good vote
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:47.000]   This is another point in the ongoing game argument
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.920]   uh towards
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:51.800]   Cutting cable. I'll I'll say that apart from the
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:59.960]   Short list of channels. It's hd. It's uh, it's stable. The interface is the interface is quite nice
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:03.400]   Uh, it really is just a perfect live tv
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:07.320]   Uh, the disadvantage is that they whatever
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:11.480]   Weird deal they have to strike with networks to get live programming
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:17.240]   Things like pausing and devia and like rewinding are turned off for now. Hopefully those will come back
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.640]   Excuse me those will come on in the in the coming months
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:26.040]   Uh, so but again, it's definitely one to keep an eye on definitely worth signing up for in cases in the month or two or three
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:31.000]   Until uh, you actually managed to get a code to start using this that you can actually start
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:35.800]   It'll be a package that you'll really really like 20 bucks a month not that bad
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:40.280]   Uh, I think that it's I think it's going to be really important to start to audit
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:43.960]   Uh, how much you're spending every month for entertainment
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:49.000]   And you might decide that well now that I I used to be able to buy cable and have netflix
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.280]   Now I think if I just simply cancel everything except for netflix and hulu
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:58.040]   Uh, everything will be fine for me. This is part of that alchemy as you try to figure out where if i'm going to spend
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:02.120]   $60 a month to bring entertainment into my house. How best can I spend that money?
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:08.280]   What do you say how long do you think it'll take to get an invite? I mean, uh, do they have they told you anything about that?
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:12.920]   I don't know they they have not given me any information about it. I've had it for about a week
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:18.280]   Um, and I will say that it's an it's I watch more cable news now
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:23.640]   Now that you watch it. It's it's nice. Well, yeah, it's also I like to I like to watch konin
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:26.920]   Uh, so it's nice to be able to simply have that sort of going
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:31.560]   It's as I said, I'm not I'm not recommending this as a oh my god
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:33.800]   You need to dump everything and get this because it's perfect
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:36.280]   It's another piece of a puzzle and it's also
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:38.920]   We started the show talking about how
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:43.000]   There's going to be a great upheaval coming. I think in 10 inch tablets
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.440]   We don't know how that's going to settle out people are going to have to decide what they really really want
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:53.480]   Streaming services for live content is like that too. We don't know yet whether the right answer is going to be a solution like this
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:55.880]   where uh dish
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:59.160]   Strikes individual deals to bring essentially cable service over the internet
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:04.680]   Or if the right the solution is going to be well tbs has their own app and then you have to launch this app to stream that
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:08.040]   Comedy central will have their own app you'd have to launch that to stream this
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:12.120]   But I'm glad to see more progress in this. I'm sorry to see area go
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:15.960]   But uh, I'm I want to see more services come up in this place because clearly
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:23.080]   The clock is running to solve the problem of how absolutely wretched it is to have all your service tied into a 500 cable
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:25.240]   Channel package that can't leave your house
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:28.360]   Alex lindsey you got a pic of the week
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:33.000]   I do and i'm gonna be you know, i've seen some online reviews of this app and uh
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.600]   They haven't been good, but I i've actually been playing with it here in rome
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:39.880]   And it and my my pick is going to be hydra. Have you guys seen hydra?
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:41.160]   Tell me about it
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:48.840]   So so hydra is an application on your iphone and basically what it does is you point it somewhere and you you hit go and it takes a hundred photos
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:52.200]   50 photos and it builds a 32 meg
[01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:54.120]   megapixel image
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:58.600]   So it basically, you know increases the resolution that you can get out of your iphone now
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:04.360]   You can't just be running around and taking pictures with your hand jiggling up and down and have it work
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:08.760]   I have done handhelds um and uh, you know, uh front with it
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:10.280]   You do have to pay a lot of attention
[01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:14.280]   There's a little crosshair in the center really keeping it as still as you can if things are moving in front of you
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:19.400]   Or there's a lot of water. There'll there'll be some artifacting but when you're taking, you know, I took some photos
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:21.080]   um
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:25.960]   You know of st. Peter's square from a from a castle that was nearby and you know set it up on it
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:29.080]   You know, just set it down on a on a bar and i'll try to post it somewhere
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:30.120]   But
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.960]   It was much better than what I got out of the iphone
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:37.320]   And even if you use the same resolution you go back to eight megapixels all the grain that I would have had that at that night
[01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:41.800]   Sharpness everything was better. So, you know, it's not the replacement for a good camera
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:44.760]   You know or or a better camera than what you get with your iphone
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:49.000]   But I and I haven't really liked the all the other features, but the high resolution feature
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.960]   I felt I felt was uh was actually a really um fun little thing to add
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:58.280]   You know and I think that it was uh and I've been getting a lot out of it when you put it on a tripod
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:01.720]   And you shoot something like a landscape or a or the pantheon
[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:05.960]   Um, the uh, it is it really is luscious
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:10.840]   Like how much data you can get out of it. So especially if you're going to be somewhere once
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:13.400]   Um, it is uh, you know or twice
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:19.480]   Uh, you you know, it's one of those things that you can get a little bit more than what you if your phone is the only thing you had with you
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:25.000]   Um to take pictures and so I would definitely play with it up here for $3.99 or whatever whatever that price is
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.680]   It's definitely worth having on your phone and playing it also has a your video. Have you tried that?
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:32.520]   I have not tried the htr video. I mean the only thing I got it for was resolution
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:37.080]   Uh, but the htr video, uh, may be very good. So I I played with the
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:42.440]   It didn't make sense. They have one that says zoom and zoom is just taking doing what it was going to do with a 32
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:45.960]   Mixle mega pixel but just giving you a subset of that which doesn't make any sense to me
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:50.040]   Uh, the low light didn't it didn't really work as well as I as I was hoping
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:53.080]   Um, so the thing that some of the pieces of it didn't work as well
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:56.760]   But for $2.99 it the if you know what you're doing with the camera
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:00.920]   If you're gonna put it on a tripod or hold it still or set your your hands down on something to rest them
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:05.640]   And shoot, you know and be very careful and shoot something still you are going to get a better photo
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:10.600]   Look at this, uh Jason. I have a I just paid for and downloaded it and took a picture
[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:16.680]   So this is the high res picture and Alex you were moving right so it's a little weird with you
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:22.600]   But look at the chat room. I mean, I've zoomed in. I don't know quite a bit. Look how far away it is
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:26.360]   And it's Chris. You can read it and you can take the same photo
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:28.120]   Just take the same photo with your with your camera
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:33.160]   You know, just just pull it out and just take a take a photo with you with the iphone out and then compare the two details are you?
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:38.760]   And you're just gonna find that it's not the it's not the same resolution, you know, it's just really a much different experience
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:46.360]   Yeah, that's so for $2.99. Yeah, that's great. That's a 32 megapixel snap. It did about 50 images
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:52.440]   Uh, right and it seems like so it also I'm I'm not sure exactly what it's doing when you handhold it
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:56.200]   It seems to be 50 when you put it on tripod. It actually seems to take advantage and it goes
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:59.960]   It goes oh, I you're I'm not moving at all because many of us don't have tripods for
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:02.200]   for our phones
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:07.400]   And then zoom would say use that same thing to be able to zoom in to x with that
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.480]   Yeah, but it still often makes no sense
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:14.760]   No, so other than I guess you save drive space or save memory by using zoom. It doesn't make any
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:19.880]   Any sense at all right? So high res is the one you're probably going to use. Yeah
[01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:25.000]   High res is the thing that I would least you know if you're going to decide whether it's worth $2.99 all the other stuff to me was
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.240]   extra
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:29.240]   and uh and then the
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:33.160]   So it was worth $2.99 just for the high res and if you like the other stuff, that's great too
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:39.400]   Yeah, yeah apps like this really make me salivate for the idea of an extensible camera app like just a f apple to somebody decide
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:46.200]   We're just gonna make this sensible every one of those if you you never take square great remove that replace it with this wonderful super duper third party
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:49.880]   High definition mode. Yeah, I was very interesting. So hold on that feature
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:53.800]   Look at that. Wow, you know, it makes it it makes me
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:57.000]   Look at it and go, you know and think about the google project
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:03.640]   You know the the air are a project of being able to swap my phone my my phone camera out for something with more with more guts
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:08.680]   You know, so I mean you definitely see like oh, I really want a camera that can shoot 32 megapixel. That's all I gotta say
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:13.640]   HYDRA it's in the app store and it is
[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:15.800]   299
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.800]   Hill Hydra the hydra
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:18.760]   Hydra
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:22.680]   Every time I get a good image out of it. I do want I do find myself wanting to say hail hydra
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:26.280]   Ayl, but one selfie and four more come strike up where is it?
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:30.520]   And finally
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:37.320]   Richie your pick of the week a while ago back in December, I think Microsoft bought an iOS mail app called a complete
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:42.200]   And they have now relaunched it as outlook or iOS and again
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:48.200]   This is not your father's Microsoft, you know, and when everything would have to be born in Microsoft and just for Microsoft
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:53.080]   This app has support people have called it the best gmail app for for iOS
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:58.680]   It has support for exchange mail for outlook mail for gmail. You can put almost any app any
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:03.080]   Standard i'm app mail account you want to in there. I didn't test pop accounts
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:07.400]   But you know those are fairly standard as well and it just does a lot of things really well
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:14.440]   It's simple. It's elegant. It is I dare say outlook if you've ever used outlook on windows xp or you know windows 2000
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:16.840]   This is not what you remember. This is a really elegant
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:19.960]   uh state-of-the-art mobile application
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:26.360]   Um, microsoft is been making a ton of apps. I think dan from around courts that they have a hundred apps out now for iOS and android
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:29.320]   Which is remarkable when you think about the history of the company
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:31.960]   But they're they're doing really really great stuff all the stuff
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:36.280]   We used to say microsoft labs is fantastic for and we wished microsoft itself would do it
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:37.560]   They seem to be doing it now
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:41.960]   So I I've been trying I did have some problems with password recognition in some of the accounts
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:45.880]   And if you have two factor running you're going to want to generate an app specific password for it
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:51.640]   But if you if if apples built-in mail client isn't great for you if you don't want to use inbox for some reason
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:55.480]   You don't like the gmail app. I would really strongly suggest you at least give this a try
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:59.880]   It's uh, it's very very nice. And if you liked I completely absolutely moved to this
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:02.440]   It's got everything you loved and more stuff in it now too
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:07.320]   We covered it on ipad today as well as our app cap for ipad today this week because it's
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:11.960]   I've had ipad and iphone. Yep. Although it looks a lot more like a comply on the iphone
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:16.200]   It has that swiping and all that stuff. I want it to change so much. Yeah, which is nice. I mean
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:19.880]   They didn't change it just to change it. Right. All right. They found the car keys
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:27.080]   Renee richy is at imore.com. He also does a great podcast called debug
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:30.280]   There's a must listen for anybody who's an apple fan
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:34.440]   And uh joins us each week. Thank you for being here Renee and your took
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:39.400]   Is it cold in there? Is that why you gotta have gotten warmer? It's up to minus 20 now yikes
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:41.960]   yikes
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.880]   yikes
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:46.200]   From roma up on the
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:52.920]   Is it the palatine hill your honor? Is it the palpatine hill that your own? I don't the emperor up on emperor palpatine hill
[01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:57.480]   Yeah, Alex lindsey of the pixel core at Alex lindsey on the twitter
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:06.440]   I know I know right who let's let's let's reap rewind and say he said that he was coming from an unnamed castle
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:13.320]   Which everyone know you can't narrow it down for which castle
[01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:17.960]   The thing is is that it's I can't remember all the names of all
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:20.360]   We had a little time to walk around on saturday
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:24.840]   I can't remember all the places that I went I'm just kind of wandered around until my legs couldn't go any further
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:29.480]   So it was uh it was a good time and pontips. It was one of those that he was
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:34.600]   But i'll tell you you know just a case you're wondering the pizza in rome is
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:36.440]   Is it good?
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:39.720]   I went to this place called pizzerarium and it is supposed to be I guess
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:45.720]   Anthony Bourdain said it's the best in rome. So of course that I went and you just get it's just like tiny little postage stamp of a
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:49.160]   Of a restaurant you can't really stand in it other than just go order and walk out
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:51.560]   I mean it's one of the best meals i've
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:59.240]   Ever had well, you know seven euros. Wow. It's just incredible. So anyway, so but but uh anyway
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:01.880]   It's it's it's it's cool. It's my second time here in rome
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:04.600]   And I've I've gotten a chance to actually see some of it
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:09.640]   So you find all the electronic stores, which I usually do Alex is the man in the high castle
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:13.880]   Anyway, so but yeah, and if people want to hear me complain about the taxi drivers
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:17.640]   You can just follow me on twitter. I see on your twitter though that uh 25
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:23.160]   So I don't understand how this works because you know the black cars in you in uber
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:28.520]   Yeah, are cheaper than the taxi drivers those nice fancy cars are cheaper than a taxi
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:33.640]   They're mercedes like a black this jet black perfectly, you know, uh, you know
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:36.280]   Polish mercedes will show up and pick you up
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:41.320]   Or you can get into a kind of a beat up taxi where the guy kind of knows where he's going and charges you twice as much
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:45.320]   And if you put bags having having you know, like put bags in this trunk
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:50.360]   Yeah charges you another 20 euros for no apparent reason then we can't figure out exactly what it is other than you're an american
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:53.880]   You'll finally pay after you argue for a little while you know, you know, you know, and so
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:29:00.040]   So so like there's only 12 of them. I think we only see 12 of them, you know, and at a time
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:04.600]   So you do have to kind of time your uberness because you will go up there and there'll be no ubers
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:09.160]   And uh, and then you then you're back on a taxi which then generates more complaints that I put on twitter
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:12.440]   I think you'll put some instagram pictures up too. I seem to remember
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:17.240]   Uh, I put a couple photos. I put maybe not well I asked I've been taking
[01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:24.120]   I've gotten this kind of habit on on either facebook or twitter of posting images of wherever i'm at and then making people guess exactly where that is
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:29.000]   And so so and people were pretty good at it. They think what's your what's your instagram?
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.240]   I don't have instagram. Oh, you don't I keep looking for it. Okay. I don't know. I
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:39.000]   I don't think where you I saw your pictures. I think I posted on facebook facebook. Oh last place I would have thought
[01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:43.560]   Yeah, no, I know so I think I pay I posted it. Um either on twitter or facebook
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:45.880]   Yeah, it's not on twitter and it's not on google plus so
[01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:51.160]   Yeah, it must be facebook facebook because you have some you have a fun quiz
[01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:53.480]   Where the hell am I?
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:57.560]   You got a guess like exactly where that is and people got pretty pretty darn close
[01:29:57.560 --> 01:29:59.560]   Because Alex is a mature himself. I think
[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:06.680]   Sometimes sometimes I wait I definitely wake up in the morning. I'm not totally the man in the high castle. That's where you go. That's the
[01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:12.280]   That's the shot and there's the Vatican, right? That's that's that's the st. Peter's basilica right there, right?
[01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:16.440]   Exactly. Yeah, so that was needo. We're gonna try to guess. I made a mistake leo
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:24.200]   The outlook is only good for uh exchange outlook iCloud google and yahoo not at uh, oh you can't use other pop services or on that service. Okay, that's good to know
[01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:27.400]   Good to know
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:28.360]   Thank you, Alex
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:31.800]   Mr. Andy and ico Chicago sent Chicago sometimes
