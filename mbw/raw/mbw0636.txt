[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   It's time for Mac break weekly. We have the full panel assembled. Renee Richie from
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.320]   iMoreAlex, Lindsey from the Pixelcore and from WGBH in Boston. Mr. Andy Inaka we're
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:18.160]   gonna talk about of course the Mac mini and the Apple MacBook Air but we most of
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.200]   all will talk about the iPad Pro. Is it too much horsepower for a little old me?
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:32.000]   It's all coming up next on Mac on a very special big Mac. You'll see what I mean.

[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:57.400]   with Renee Richie at iMore.com and the vector podcast iRenee. Hey Leo it's
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.200]   snowing outside but it's nice and warm in here with all of you. How cozy. I like it
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.440]   when it snows outside as long as you're inside. Yeah totally. Also Andy and not
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.800]   co from WGBH in Boston Boston Public Radio it's probably snowing where you
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.320]   are too I would guess. No but this is the apparently the weather is having its
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.360]   annual leaves on the trees clear and sail. Very very first wind and it's
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.040]   really really ambitiously trying to clear all the trees. All the leaves must go
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.760]   in coming in inventory of snow is coming and you must make room for it.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.600]   That's great to have you and also from the nation's capital or Toronto.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.880]   Actually that's Seattle isn't it that's not the CN tower that's the sky needle.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.600]   Alex Lindsey pixel core.com hello Alex hello good to see you. Good to be here. How many of you got
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.080]   new Macs iPads anything. I'm still holding out and I'm letting them ship out that first
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.600]   that first section and then once they once they kind of move through them then I'll
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.640]   I'll look at buying them after they say oops sorry we needed to do one more thing.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.640]   Please don't want me to test for you Alex. Take all the very best. I'm letting you guys do it.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.040]   I have to say if you could eliminate take out of your mind any consideration about money
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.600]   because this is going to add up. I would absolutely recommend getting the new 12.9
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.680]   iPad Pro plus pencil plus keyboard. I would absolutely recommend getting a Mac book here but not if
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:34.520]   it's your only computer and they Mac mini is maybe a desktop with a 5k monitor. All of those
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:41.960]   are for what that that niche that they feel they're really great. Yeah I'm I was looking really
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.800]   hard at the Mac mini couple nights ago there might be there might be a Mac mini in my future
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.560]   in the near the end of the year. I think it's I mean look it doesn't have the the
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.880]   Xeon pro chips but very few people need that kind of horsepower or multiple processors.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.960]   The desktop chips in the Mac mini plus the amazing connectivity options it offers
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:11.560]   mean it's I think a really good desktop machine. Honestly the A10 inside it is accelerating all
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.080]   the video stuff so it gives you a little edge over what the Intel silicon by itself can do
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.120]   which is really nice. Yeah above all it looks like it's it'll it'll it's kitted out to last
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.920]   year at least four five or six years. My worry was that the next update to the Mac mini was going
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.960]   to be incremental by nature and really wasn't going to be worth investing a whole thousand bucks in a
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.880]   whole new box just to get the new silicon or maybe like one or two extra ports. This really does
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.920]   look like you could spend 1500 bucks for to max it out and trust that you're going to get a good
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.640]   lifetime product out of it. You're probably going to want for some of you anyway an eGPU but that
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.040]   actually isn't a bad way to go either. In fact a lot of people are a little perturbed because
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.120]   Apple has announced that they're going to start putting the Vega the Radeon Vega inside the MacBook
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:01.400]   Pros and people who bought their MacBook Pro six months ago are going wait a minute. I want that
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.120]   but if they didn't do it you were like why aren't they updating? Yeah I know. The eGPU right you
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.680]   can't win. The eGPU is a pretty for the Mac mini a pretty good choice. You know the the motherboard
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.560]   the Intel graphics are nothing to write home about but for many of us that doesn't matter.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.800]   I have to say by the way just my anecdotal story about the MacBook Air because a lot of people
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.800]   complained about the wide chip in there and it's fast enough it's more than fast enough. I'm happy
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.600]   with it. In fact I've kind of put aside my i9 MacBook Pro because the air is so much more portable and
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.280]   light and it's good enough it's fast enough let's put it that way. I don't feel like it's sluggish
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.520]   and F it's like coming home again to use it. If I didn't have to render Final Cut Pro at events
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.240]   fast I would still be using it. I would be using it Macbook. You know who you are if you're doing
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:06:00.040]   that you need a MacBook Pro but the MacBook Air for most people is a great very portable
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:07.480]   beautiful. I wish the keyboard were not the butterfly but it's not as bad as the original
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.680]   butterfly and it's just great and no touch bar which makes me happy but touch ID which makes me
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.760]   happy. It's a really nice little laptop I'm very happy with it. It's the Goldilocks computer almost
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.400]   literally. Literally in the middle. I got the Gold. It just fits so well. It looks so good that
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:31.400]   you gold. The Gold is really pretty. All right we've talked about this and Renee you had these
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:37.800]   all last week. It's just that I got mine this week and Friday, Thursday I guess. I don't remember
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.000]   what day. People are still asking about them like every day there's just questions and questions
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.920]   and questions because other people are waiting. They're like Alex and Andy they're waiting to see
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:52.760]   what the beta testers are going to think. I'm pretty happy with it. I think all the news really
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:59.080]   though is about the iPad Pros. You already know what the Mac mini is. You already know what the
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:05.960]   MacBook Air is. They're just updated versions of existing products. There's a T2 chip in there.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:11.160]   In fact one of the things we're learning is that Apple may use the T2 to block some third-party
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:20.600]   repairs of new Macs. That's probably similar to when you replace the screen in the touch ID
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:29.080]   on an old iPhone. They say well the secure enclave has been breached and so as a result we can't
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:34.200]   certify those repairs and make it secure again. What's your sense of Renee what Apple is saying?
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:41.880]   It won't work at all. It'll brick it or what? No so my understanding is that they've set it up in
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.920]   such a way that the security is really bound to a lot of the components. They're hardwired
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:51.720]   directly and one of the things with the MacBook Air specifically is that it doesn't have a touch
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:56.840]   bar. On previous Mac Pros the touch bar and touch ID were literally hardwired together so that if
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.920]   you saw a price on Safari that price would be on the touch bar and you knew there was no spoofing
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.080]   man in the middle. Nothing going on to sort of cheat you and because it doesn't exist on the
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:11.480]   MacBook Air they've hardened the connection between the Mac book and the actual Mac display
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:17.240]   and touch ID and that will work but if any if at any point that the secure enclave cannot verify
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.320]   that connection including if you do a certain third-party repair is that break the hardware
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:26.200]   pairing. My understanding is that all that happens is it will it will refuse to authenticate touch
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:31.160]   ID on the machine because it now can be spoofed and you'll have to use an iOS device to do it like
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:36.840]   you would on a Mac that doesn't have the touch ID sensor. So T2 take it and give it the way.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:44.920]   Yes. It give us in the sense that it is for instance when you close the laptop lid now we know
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:52.120]   that the T2 blocks the microphone. There's a lot of security in there but there's some question
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:57.000]   about whether you'll be able to install on an unsigned operating systems like Linux on a Mac
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.600]   and so I asked about that and you absolutely can but again it will you have to go in you have to
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.520]   boot into the recovery mode you have to go into the system integrity protection settings you have
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:10.200]   to turn it down to nothing like you have three levels of settings almost like gatekeeper where
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.960]   you have full security partial security and nothing you turn it to nothing then you can run any
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:19.080]   operating system you want but again at that point touch ID can no longer verify that as a secure
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:25.080]   connection to the sensors you'll have to you everything else works you'll just have to use an iOS device
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.320]   to authenticate Apple Pay like you would on a device that doesn't have touch ID.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:33.800]   That's not the end of the world that's fairly common in the Linux world that things like that
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.840]   don't work. Kyle Wiens of iFixit who's by the way going to be on triangulation on Friday says
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:45.240]   oh awesome he told the Verge the T2 is a guillotine that Apple is holding over product owners.
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:55.640]   Apparently when you get the when you get a repair the T2 chip now checks for the parts
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:02.200]   during a post repair reboot we're not Apple confirmed that this is true but we don't not
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:11.560]   sure how they're going to react right if if it says well those are third party parts right.
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.800]   Yeah I mean they're really I'm not I'm not buying the whole apples trying to stop people from repairing
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.960]   their their machines I mean it may be a side effect but I don't think it's the main issue I
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.680]   think that Apple is moving more and more into health and financial services and as a result and I
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.600]   think they're going to continue to move that way and I think that you know our you know privacy
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.240]   and security are going to become more and more of an issue as we keep going forward and as a
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.080]   result Apple is putting hardware devices and it makes sense that if someone's tampering with the
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:43.160]   computer you don't you don't want to tell them well but there's tampering and there's repairs.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.440]   I understand but the thing is is they're not going to be able to tell the difference between
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.920]   the two and and there and you know if you're if you're not from that area I just don't think I
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:56.040]   here's the I just don't think that Apple they're more concerned about the security than they are
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:01.800]   about because of larger business things than you know and specifically related again I think towards
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:07.240]   you know security related as it relates to health and financial services which are going to become
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.920]   a big part of what they're doing I think. And so I don't think I think that they're mostly
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:16.120]   interested in security and and one of the casualties of that is being able to repair it.
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:21.560]   Here's what the Apple repair manual says for max with the Apple T2 chip the repair process is
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:28.040]   not complete for certain part replacements until the AST2 system configuration suite has been run
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:33.080]   and that of course checks with the T2 failure to perform this step will result in an
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:38.760]   inoperative system and an incomplete repair. What they don't say is what parts and I think that
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:43.080]   that will be the determinant of whether you're right or wrong Alex is if they say well look any
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:49.320]   part concerned with security yeah I have to say that's that's reasonable go ahead Andy I'm sorry.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:55.720]   No I was just going to say that Alex is Alex is right the it's easy to
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:01.240]   subscribe to Malice on Apple's part what was actually just simply collateral damage
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:07.400]   what they think is a higher priority for them security is the highest priority of all if it
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:12.600]   makes this device harder to fix that's not a problem it's on their radar but the security
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:18.920]   the integrity of the entire system is on their radar I we should definitely note that this gives
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:25.800]   them an ability that they didn't have before but it would take it would take a really serious change
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:33.800]   in philosophy for Apple to simply decide to make an item unreparable simply to kill other people's
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:39.960]   fun and or opportunities or just to make it less reparable to begin with every time that they
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:46.200]   every time they screw consumer over like again removing a headphone jack it's not because they
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.920]   did that for fun it's because there was a technical problem that they were not in the mood to try
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:57.160]   to solve because they felt as though having a much much thinner device or having a display that goes
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.800]   all the way to the edge of the bezel was more important to them than including this thing so
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:06.840]   reparability is the second or third tier sort of thing for them and making sure that the integrity
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:11.480]   of the entire system is maintained even when parts get swapped out is definitely the first
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:17.800]   priority for them so I you're right we cannot we cannot know Apple's intent in any of this
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:23.880]   and so I'm you know we're at this point speculating an Apple's intent let's not we don't know what
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:31.000]   Apple's intent is what we can say is the upshot of it is that you don't have and again we don't
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.760]   know which part changes will and will not be affected by this but there will be at least some
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:43.800]   parts that no third party can repair that only in ASP and Apple approved service bureau or Apple
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:48.440]   itself can repair because only they can run the appropriate software this is exactly what John
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:56.200]   Deere says about its tractors and and we don't I mean I'm willing to stipulate that Apple's doing
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:04.200]   this on the side of the angels but what I'm saying is that it does in fact impact your right to
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.960]   repair well it makes it also makes it less attractive to hobbyists and I think they know that like
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.960]   when they made they went out of their way to say that the third party they ram could be changed
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:17.160]   in the Mac mini but they suggested strongly that unless you were like an iFixit class with that
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:22.040]   you take it into Apple to have it done because and so they're there specifically for the Mac
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:25.560]   Mini I mean they understand that that's a different market and hobbyists and people who do want to
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.560]   mess around their computers are much more likely to buy it for things like laptops that have those
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.880]   sorts of security chips they're not aiming for hobbyists anymore they think their market is
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:38.360]   decidedly mainstream and people who prefer iPads but still need a Mac and they're catering for
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:43.240]   those but it is fair to say that you know they're less they should be less attractive to hobbyists
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.320]   and maybe hobbyists should go elsewhere and if Apple sees that as a big part of their market
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:53.240]   atrophy maybe they'll change and address it yeah but just a footnote to that there's a difference
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:58.760]   between hobbyists and simply getting value for your system you don't know what's going to happen
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:04.200]   to your laptop or your Mac mini or whatever after three or four years and it really is a kick in
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:11.160]   the pants when you're told that well there's a there's a $130 memory module that has gone bad or
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:16.440]   your SSD I know that this is the third time in five years you've had to totally reformat it because
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:21.640]   it kept spitting out bad blocks and that would be maybe a $200 part but we've not given you the
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:26.680]   ability to replace that and so we're gonna have to ask you for a thousand dollars for a brand new
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:31.720]   logic board or it's probably a good time for you to replace the machine that's a kick in the pants
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.840]   when you look at alternatives and think that well if I
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:41.640]   pardon me if I bought an Intel nook I would have been I wouldn't have had a Macintosh but I would
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:46.200]   have had a completely up and back running machine for a hundred and thirty dollars instead of looking
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:51.400]   at god why am I have to spend eight to hundred to a thousand bucks to replace an entire thing
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:56.040]   just because a simple hundred dollar component was not meant to be replaced well it's definitely a
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:00.920]   factor but I it's it's part of the larger calculus yeah I'm sure there's other reasons but I've had
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:07.400]   that experience directly a long time ago I uh the power connector on one of my power books that's how
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:12.520]   long time ago it was it was a power broke I took it to apple they said yeah we have to replace the
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:18.200]   logic board that'll be fifteen hundred dollars fortunately there still was Mac Adam Tom Santos's
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:23.640]   wonderful Macintosh store with real repair people and the guy said yeah no I could just
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:28.600]   re-sider that on the motherboard and they fixed it for ten dollars and it was fine those days are
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:35.800]   long gone frankly repairability is not is not a is not a prime feature in any apple device or many
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:40.120]   any many consumer electronics devices there there there are a lot of really talented cowboys out
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:46.600]   there and cowgirls out there and so I much rather make make it available to make see to see if there's
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:53.240]   people who can who can fix things if you want to like replace uh if you want to upgrade the the
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:59.080]   storage ram on an iPhone it is possible to do that you can simply there you can buy the right tool
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:04.920]   you can you can exactly you can uh replace remove the ram refill the solder put a new ram
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:12.360]   and yes that is well beyond even a hobbyist but the idea of uh when you're googling for answers to
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:16.680]   my the my twenty three hundred dollar MacBook Pro that I bought three or four years ago
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:22.520]   can't be fixed for less than twelve hundred dollars that so as far as apple is concerned
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:27.720]   and then you google and you see well someone is willing to uh it can can swap me up my motherboard
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:35.240]   with a or a reflow and replace the SSD here for something less than four hundred dollars if I
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:39.880]   want to take that risk this is the we have the principle that if I own this MacBook I can actually
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:44.280]   do what I want with it including throw it in a mulcher or trust some cowboy or cowgirl to try
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:50.520]   to fix it for me so I'm hoping that we will see the same opportunities for people to find a fix for
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:55.400]   a problem because there are a lot of people for room that was quite a stretch to spend twelve
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:18:01.960]   hundred dollars even on a MacBook Air and if they can keep it going or if they can uh hand it down
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:07.400]   to a kid who's going off to school who needs a laptop instead of having to find another thousand
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:12.280]   bucks that they don't have to give to that kid that is a big big win so I don't I don't think
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:18.760]   apple would shut that door capriciously but I'm very much in favor of people being free to find
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:24.120]   those kind of cowboy frontier solutions on their own the verge does make the point that you tend
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:29.640]   to keep max around a lot longer than you do phones so it's more of an issue and wean's said something
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:34.760]   kind of interesting if apple does this it will dramatically increase the likelihood that right
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:40.120]   to repair legislation passes and forces them to reverse the course I doubt apple considers the
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:45.480]   political calculus but politically this might be an in-politics thing to do well not just that but
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.720]   it's also the EU which is being a lot more strict about such like that I would doubt that apple would
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.800]   do something that they couldn't reverse uh that's they wouldn't they wouldn't lock something into
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:58.200]   hard breath that they couldn't reverse if they had to uh in and uh because of the political
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.760]   situation changing both here and abroad yeah I think I think you actually nailed it the right
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:09.320]   thing to do is to say well as they have with Linux uh you it's your device you can do anything you
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:13.240]   want with it but just understand it won't be security anymore yeah exactly that's why that's
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.480]   why that's why Renee's explanation is so valuable that that to me is the right thing to do to say
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:22.760]   that if you're willing to go here is a free firmware tool that will basically say that you will have
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:28.600]   the security of essentially a 2004 Mac book which is none but you will be able to do what you want
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.760]   with it but just realize that all this cool stuff that is not happening to you because you're running
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:38.440]   a modern modern Mac you are on the other side of that great wall right now uh and the orcs and the
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:45.000]   zombies are shopping their nights for you well and I'm not clear that I mean we've talked about it
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.840]   a long time here but I'm not sure that the average person I mean there's a lot of
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:53.080]   Mac fix I mean I fix it thinks it's important but I don't know if the average person
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:58.360]   right now I think right now I think right to repair is important yeah I just don't think repair
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.560]   I'm not saying I'm not saying that it's that it's that it's not important or important but I think
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:07.160]   the average user you know a lot of people I mean if you're smart you buy I disagree I think people
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:12.680]   you know there's a risk business in replacing iPhone screens for instance yeah I think real
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:17.880]   people like my kids believe they should be able to take it to a store and get the screen fixed if
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:24.840]   it breaks they do once it breaks yeah yeah and yeah and I wouldn't I guess I wouldn't buy a piece
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:29.160]   of electronics that I thought was important that I didn't put Apple care on you know from Apple I
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:34.200]   know and so I don't think about it well you know like it's that's a profit center for Apple that
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:38.840]   doesn't well that doesn't the thing is that doesn't help you when you're in trouble I've got I'm in
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:43.480]   that situation right now I've got it's it's not as though I can't and this on this MacBook Pro
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:49.240]   my it's not as though I can't reformat it and get back to a working SSD but the thing is I've
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:53.640]   already reformat it a couple times you're just bad blocks to keep popping up and I would much
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:58.920]   rather replace it and now I'm looking at more and more interesting ways of fixing it then
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:05.160]   unfortunately because I've got perhaps the I think the 2015 MacBook Pro was the very last MacBook Pro
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:12.280]   where the SSD wasn't actually soldered in it's actually on some sort of a board Apple looks like
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:16.360]   they didn't use something quite standard so it's not as though you can just go on to eBay and get
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:21.000]   it replaced but at least at least there's some solution available to you this is something that
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.120]   I wasn't looking forward to three years ago and I'm not sure I would be paying I would have been paying
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:31.960]   AppleCare year after year after year it's like I said you're in the position where you're saying
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:37.560]   this is a two if this was any other laptop of this if this had been my my thinkpad this would have
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:43.480]   been like a hundred and thirty dollar thing I just buy something online at the OWC or whatever
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:48.840]   I've done do some screws I slipped the other one out I put the new one in I'm done but this is a
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:53.400]   thing and I don't want to have to spend two thousand dollars you can control hundred dollars
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:22:00.520]   because this is just a three no this is just an SSD I need to fix man so that's I really hope that
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:05.880]   the door remains open for people to find ways to fix wrong things if they believe in recycling
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:10.920]   they certainly should believe and people being able to keep an old beater running running it's
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:15.560]   very good for the environment keeps it keeps out in the hands of kids and keeps in the hands of the
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:21.800]   second owner the third owner on Craigslist or eBay who can now afford for four hundred dollars the
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:27.160]   2005 model that used to cost three thousand dollars but at least they've got a working laptop
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:31.400]   it's it's a very very positive thing to make sure these things stay out in circulation and
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:36.440]   max they build max to last they build iPads to last may as well keep them running while they're
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:40.760]   lasting we're gonna take a break I think I still have three or four cheese graders
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:45.960]   and they're repairable for highly repairable but I haven't even two and
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:52.600]   I've got one I'm using one as an end table right now yeah yeah there you go yeah I mean I
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:58.760]   think for the environment alone the lack of repairability on these newer devices is not is a little
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:03.400]   shameful and I it is possible to do it I look at Lenovo's you can still swap in anything on the
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:09.480]   Lenovo and and we should say it's not that's not limited to to Apple a lot of manufacturers it's
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.640]   it's much less expensive to manufacture when you glue things together stuff like that it's just
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:18.280]   that look as we keep saying with Apple they're the only company making Macbooks that the only
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:23.960]   company making iPads so if they don't if they don't make any that means there's absolutely no
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:29.000]   one in the world that makes a easily easy to repair MacBook so you don't have that option someplace
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.600]   I think there's like a there's sorry go ahead really no I was just gonna say I think like I said
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.200]   before I think there's a lot of choices that can happen here one is that you can make a Macbook
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:43.480]   much more repairable the other is that you can make it absolutely inexpensive and available to get
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.400]   what you consider to be quality parts if you've got any issue like oh people are gonna put in bad
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.680]   batteries and burn down their houses and we don't want that to happen so we want you to have
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:55.000]   certified parts then and I think Apple started doing this they've increased the iPhone repair
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.880]   program going back I think several additional years lately then just it's incumbent upon anything
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:04.120]   you take away from me it is now incumbent upon you to totally support and provide you better do it
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:09.320]   yeah at a reasonable or a fair price yeah I cost or something yeah totally yeah that's that's fair
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:15.560]   let's take a break I want I do want to talk about the iPad pro lots of stuff to say about this
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:23.240]   very interesting device but first a word from LastPass you know I set up a bunch of new computers this
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:27.960]   week and the practically the very first thing I put on all of them is LastPass because LastPass
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:32.840]   is my password vault it makes it easy to install the rest of the software I'm going to put on
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:40.040]   LastPass lets you secure every password protected entry point to your business too and this is
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:46.440]   important we take this so seriously to it every employee gets a free LastPass account that's part
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:54.040]   of their benefits to being an employee and we use LastPass Enterprise because unfortunately you know
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:25:01.720]   password hygiene is not very good in general bad passwords cause about cause about 81% of all
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:08.040]   breaches and that means reused passwords passwords that are easy to guess passwords that are written
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:13.640]   on a post-it note and stuck to the screen of the computer and I know you've seen all three you've
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:19.560]   probably done all three LastPass makes it easy to create strong passwords with their password
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:25.800]   generator unique random passwords and there's in there's no incentive to make them week because
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:29.720]   you don't have to remember them you don't have to write them down LastPass keeps track of them for
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:37.480]   you and even auto fills them iOS 12 that auto fill on LastPass is so sweet it uses face ID to
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:44.440]   automatically unlock the vault and paste it in does it on Android as well now too so that's a nice
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:51.880]   feature LastPass also allows us as a business to set policies for instance master password
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:57.160]   requirements we can do password resets when people forget their master password we can restrict
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:03.800]   access as we need to we also can require multi-factor authentication which we do LastPass has its own
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:08.120]   authenticator app you can use any authenticator app but I like the LastPass one because it doesn't
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:14.120]   do a six digit code it just pops up an approver deny request on the phone when for instance our
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:18.840]   bookkeeper logs into our QuickBooks account that means even if her password were compromised
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:25.560]   no one else can get in unless they have her phone too I can go on and on it's really a nice with
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:31.160]   there are over a hundred policies that you can set as a LastPass enterprise user we create shared
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:35.480]   folders too so all the ops people have one shared folder the business people have another shared
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:42.680]   folder that keeps the passwords kind of constrained within a you know an area but it also means we
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:47.080]   can give people access to assets without giving the password at all the auto fill means that they
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:53.080]   just log in it's there which makes it a lot harder for them to steal it or give it away or share it
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:57.160]   and we know a lot of employees share passwords too not just with people in the enterprise but
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:03.320]   everywhere LastPass offers a variety of passwords for no matter what your situation LastPass premium
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:08.360]   for personal use I've used that for more than 10 years I upgraded to families for our family
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:12.760]   because without we can we can share passwords Lisa and I can share all the accounts for like the
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:17.480]   cable company and the power bill and stuff like that that makes it so easy when I create a new
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:21.400]   password that she needs access to I just put it in that folder it's automatically shared with her
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:27.160]   LastPass teams for smaller businesses 50 or fewer employees and what we use of course LastPass
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:36.120]   enterprise it is the best 43,000 businesses use LastPass for business 16 million people
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:41.000]   trust LastPass for their own passwords it's literally the number one most preferred password
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.280]   manager and needless to say your passwords are encrypted only and decrypted only at the device
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:53.480]   level so even somebody at LastPass can't get access to them only you do LastPass is awesome go to
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:28:00.440]   lastpass.com/twit set up your account right now lastpass.com/twit especially if you have a business
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:09.000]   you really need to use LastPass trust me learn from my experience Renee Richie does I guess
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.640]   without Serenity Caldwell around to do your reviews of the pencil Renee has done his he's up to his
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:20.840]   game you're pretty good artist Renee it's misspentyouthleo this is awesome
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:26.440]   so the the pencil review on imore.com is done with the apple pens that's that's
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:32.040]   recognizably Tim Cook I just want to say that's pretty good I don't know who that is
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:36.760]   me getting my meme on that's me getting my meme on you've got your stylus but you're
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:44.760]   looking at the new stylus so let's talk about the iPad Pro the pencil the keyboard all in one because
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:50.440]   it's a it's a whole new thing first of all in this review you're talking about the fact that
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:55.960]   the means of pairing to the old iPad Pros through the lightning port obviously no longer work
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:00.440]   with the new iPad Pros that means your old pencil will no longer work with the new iPad Pros
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:06.040]   it cannot pair nor charge off the old pencil cannot pair nor charge off the new iPad and the
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:11.320]   new pencil cannot pair nor charge off the old iPad a lot of you got a pair new and new and old and
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:18.120]   old so you need to get a new one uh hundred twenty nine dollars but you can get it engraved
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:24.760]   yes leo's pencil yes actually says dream boy but there's a long story behind that
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:31.640]   Megan says dream girl and there's a whole story anyway uh but actually that's nice because there's
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:37.640]   no question of who's pencil and if you're in a multi iPad family as i am or a multi iPad business
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:43.000]   as i am it's nice to have your name or something identifying on your pencil your home or sims or
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.560]   simpson thinks was going the back of that leo that's how you supposed to tell it apart
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:50.760]   oh yeah little pencil cap it won't work with the charger though you gotta it has to be flush
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:54.440]   on the charger one of my grapes in that video is like i love the apple logo on the pencil i don't
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:58.040]   like the word pencil there especially with the engraving because it's just it's it's a little
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:02.440]   much it's like rocket record is a little much yeah there are a number of people complained about
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:07.480]   that it's a knit it's absolutely a knit yeah you no longer have to worry about losing the cap
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:12.760]   which is good there is no cap yes it does apparently the Megan told me these are interchangeable the
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:18.280]   nibs are interchangeable the old one yeah the app and the core technology in the so the pencil the
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:22.600]   all the pressure sense of technology for the pencil is not on the ipad screen it's in the pencil none
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:26.920]   of that has changed with pencil too so all of that works the same the tips are the same the
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:32.760]   the angulation the the pressure all of that remains the same as the previous one it's it is i am not
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:39.640]   a drawer so i have yet to find a good use for it but i suppose if you buy an ipad pro whatever
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:44.920]   which whichever size you pick you really ought to get the pencil make them bend tomsen graphs yeah
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:51.320]   that's about as good as i'll get and uh the keyboard right now you can only get an apple the new apple
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:55.320]   portfolio keyboard but i know that bridge and others are going to do third party keyboards as
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:31:00.680]   well but the apple keyboard is pretty good and i really like the folio case it wraps around very
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:07.640]   nicely it makes it very portable this is the 12.9 which is in my opinion exactly the right size
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:12.680]   it's more laughable like that keyboard like before i used to use it in my lap like even at
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.960]   apple events and it would it would little bit precarious because it would almost like teeter
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:20.760]   totter but now it's really solid and you know big points in the lap ability scale and as apple
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:25.560]   said it's about the size of an eight and a half by eleven or i guess for you foreigners what is it
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:34.280]   a one piece of paper yeah i don't know a three a four i forget four yes standard size a four is
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:38.680]   that what it is um or as somebody else said it's about the size of a magazine kind of like that
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:46.520]   um i i have to say there i have no quibbles about the hardware at all uh it is a
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:52.200]   a romantic it's legit fantastic it's legit super fast it's a beautiful screen
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:59.800]   um my all my complaints are as neilipatel and others have said about the fact that the software
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:11.080]   just doesn't live up to the hardware mmm yeah so um this is a laptop priced device that
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:18.440]   should be reasonably replace your laptop it is still in my opinion an adjunct device now i know
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:24.840]   and this is where i mean when i say money should be no object if you don't think about how much it
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:32.120]   costs you should just have an iphone an ipad and an iMac and an iMac book just have mall and then
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:37.080]   you have the right tool for the right job but if you want to make the ipad be your own and at the
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:42.920]   price they're charging it probably most people this is your only apple device it isn't gonna do
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:49.080]   everything you need to do i could do like i i'm not like Federico Vitticci level ipad only i could
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:53.320]   do that again if it wasn't for final cut pro i know spenety can edit you know i move you on ipad
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:59.080]   like an ace i i cannot so i need for photoshop and final cut pro i still go back to the mac but
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:03.160]   when i travel and i only think my ipad with me those are really the only things i miss and i feel
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:07.560]   like it hard to write do you find it hard to write on it no i love i love writing on it but again like
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:12.760]   i'm i'm keyboard agnostic but i get what niele and like other people like steve tron smith there are
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:17.160]   certain basic things that it's missing and i'm not i'm not a person who thinks that apple has to
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:21.400]   make it a mac like i think that would be a huge mistake i'm all for apple reinterpreting computer
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:26.360]   paradigms like they did drag and drop and all those things but they need some way for right now if
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:30.360]   you want to use external storage for example you need an app that supports it which no no human
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:34.760]   should have to deal with old school unix hierarchies of file systems but also no human should have to
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:39.160]   go fit like figure out how to just stick their card or stick their drive in there and have it
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:44.040]   work especially because apple has built file picker the same as image picker and you stick a card
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:48.600]   in there from a camera and it just works so why don't my file i like cloud go that external thing
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:53.160]   is just by wireless not by it is but then you've got like let's say your stuff is on a card or
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:58.120]   you're in a school and you get like you get a thumb drive or something and you shouldn't have to go
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:03.640]   like go find a mac and upload the stuff that's that's my point you can't just live on it and that
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:07.640]   really is a limitation of iOS it's not a limitation of the hardware it's a limited it's not even a
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:12.120]   limitation yeah i mean like it's not they have all this stuff they just have not enabled it in
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:16.200]   file and guess like they had a bunch of stuff that was supposed to be an iOS 12 they got pushed back
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:20.520]   so they could do all the performance enhancements including a new home screen springboard thing
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:24.760]   and i'm very much hoping that includes a lot of the stuff that's going to really make
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:30.120]   this ipad sing but until then they're gonna have to put up with niele for like six months that he's
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:37.800]   gonna be right yeah i kind of a kind of agree kind of don't agree chiefly because i think this can
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:46.760]   replace your laptop but only when you accept that most people have a unique method a unique job that
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:53.240]   they use their laptop for for someone like fernay they need to have their desktop with them in a bag
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:35:00.280]   because they are i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna tip the hat to fernay because rene is like always
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:06.200]   capturing 4k video somewhere he is always either at the same time writing editing and publishing
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:11.960]   and streaming three of those at the same time and so there can be no compromises and even if there's
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:17.560]   even if there's only one rare occasion where someone where someone where someone needs to get a
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:24.680]   file from one of these onto the storage that's gonna be a big issue if you if you're using your
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:31.640]   entire office on a laptop other people like me it's more like i need a lightweight device that i
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:37.560]   can carry with me all day long it's not not gonna hurt my shoulder and it's not gonna be for everything
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:45.080]   i need to do outside the office and i'm willing to take a long logitech k 11 keyboard for for
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:51.080]   really heavy typing if it means that this this ipad will also be my book reader when i'm on the
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:57.640]   flight or it will also be a really really good tablet pencil art thing when i need to act when
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:01.800]   i'm in a place where believe it or not i can't i'm not allowed to take pictures anywhere but i can
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:07.560]   do sketches and i'm gonna do sketches where i go so you just can't say that it's going to be a
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:11.480]   replacement for a notebook you really have to come up with a list of what do you do with this what
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:17.480]   do you need a mobile thing for and will this or will this not deal with that the bigger and even
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:23.320]   to the cost thing i think that there's an argument to be made where you're talking about like a macbook
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:29.080]   pro that's going to cost you at least two grand if you think about it as i'm going to spend that
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:35.400]   two thousand dollars on computational solutions maybe for a lot of people a better solution is
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:40.360]   going to be i'm going to spend a little less than a thousand dollars on and i'm excuse me on a mac
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:45.160]   mini and i'm going to spend a thousand dollars on an ipad so i will have a real computer quote
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:50.760]   unquote when i get home but for field work i will have this nice nifty high-powered tablet that
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:55.960]   weighs a lot less and is a lot less problems to deal with than a notebook so you really have to
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:01.560]   you really have to skin the onion to find the answer to that i think and i find myself going
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:06.440]   home i don't take my i don't take my computer home anymore like i don't you know i i i uh i take my
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:11.960]   ipad home so so i you know because if i'm going to wake up in the morning and uh or at night and
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:17.080]   i'm thinking about stuff you know the ipad is you know just it's uh kind of a thought process but i
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:21.640]   you know i i'm sketching or i'm surfing around or thinking about stuff or you know that type of
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:27.320]   thing and you know it it is uh and i feel like part of me feels like we're just old when we think
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:32.200]   we can't use the ipad my that was Steven Sinovski's contention was that it's just a generational
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:37.720]   thing but i disagree my daughter my daughter is in the middle of a 30 page uh she's nine years old
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:43.400]   she's written 30 pages of of a story she's won't show me until she's done but um but that's like
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:50.200]   saying because kids like mcdonald's uh you know it's good enough for them uh i don't i just think
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:54.600]   they don't have an experience of a real work environment i think the reason there's disagreement
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:38:00.040]   on this is for some people it depends what you're what you're trying to do there's this is a great
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:04.760]   article by austin man is a photographer for some people if what you are as a photographer
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:10.920]   and lightroom does what you want it to do and you can import raw which you can uh he says this is
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:16.520]   perfect this is the for me as an artist this is exactly what i need this is the best way for me to
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:22.520]   work and absolutely true but there are plenty of things you can do with a computer that the ipad
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:28.120]   requires either a struggle or can't do it all there's mostly it's mostly struggle it's mostly
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:33.960]   workarounds and that's why i think yeah a ten-year-old can write a report on it but until the ten-year
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:38.520]   old really starts to understand there's multitasking and the ability to have a web browser underneath
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:44.920]   your word processor and you can go back and forth it's it's there is a better way to work and it is
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:51.000]   a bit of a struggle right now given the way ios works to get a job done on and maybe will always
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:57.880]   be that way i think for now my conception is the ipad is an ad junked to a real computer
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.920]   for a few tat and i'll notice alex you still have a real computer work
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:08.200]   for a few tasks it does well but but at the price of a real laptop i mean it's expensive
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:13.320]   yeah i don't know if that's enough i think there's like i think there's a real like apple announced
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:18.520]   the ipad pro and the macbook air at the same event i think that's not accidental i think they and i
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:22.440]   think that graph they showed where they showed ipad sales compared to laptop sales a lot of people
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:26.360]   said oh that proves it should be a laptop alternative but i think what apple was saying there is like
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:32.200]   look how many people they issue laptops but they really want an ipad and for a lot of people
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:36.360]   laptops are still inexpensive like they're super smart people too they're just inaccessible
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:41.080]   confusing alienating computer boxes that they never had a rapport with an ipad is something
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:44.600]   different it's because they can touch it and interact with it and it's direct and they it's
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:48.920]   not a replacement but it's an alternative and for their workloads you're exactly right like they
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:53.000]   do writing and they do browsing and they do fake they do a bunch of things that they would never need
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.600]   mac hardware for and that's fine and there's people in the middle who like really want ipad hardware
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:04.040]   but really want it to be more mac like and i think a few things like having file picker work the
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:09.080]   same as photo picker having some sort of external capacitive because like you're typing on that
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.880]   keyboard you have to still reach up and touch the screen which is annoying is not being able to
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:17.160]   touch the screen on the mac and there's like three or four things that i think if apple just
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:21.960]   or use already existing technology like they already have focus ui in apple tv which is ios
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:26.840]   which lets you pick things on the screen with external input like if all those pieces come together
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:31.320]   hopefully in ios 13 it'll a lot of those walls will crumble and you'll still need
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:35.880]   them like i'll still need a mac for final cut pro developers will still need a mac for xcode for a
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:41.560]   while but a lot of the other sort of small the xcode development i've been thinking about this
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:45.720]   you could put obviously apple could with xcode in the ipad but it would not be a good environment
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:49.000]   because you couldn't have your emulator running at this i mean it would just it would not be an
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.680]   ideal environment you look at developers they have giant screens and they have multiple screens
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:58.200]   because they want to be able to see their code they want to be able to see a lot of it they want
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:02.520]   to be able to see the output of it they want to have a web browser running there's just a lot of
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:07.640]   things you want to do that maybe like diet xcode like remember diet coda well there is there's python
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:12.920]   is to there are some very good there's swifty there's some very good programming environments for the
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:19.560]   ipad but they're but they're really not again it's a struggle it's not the idea you're apps with you
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:23.160]   and i think photoshop will be because it's also important to remember that ipads are ram constrained
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:28.280]   compared to max massively ram constraint compared to max but photoshop has found a way to let you
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:32.040]   sort of take your photoshop with you using a subset of really important tools and i think
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:36.200]   you know developers would love the ability it's it's not full on xcode but it's i can take my apps
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:40.920]   with me and work on the beach for a while and hit that button i would say in almost every case the
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:44.120]   assumption that adobe and others are making is you will also have a desktop
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:49.640]   yeah i think i think for most people buying in my i think they're most of them do have a desktop and
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:55.560]   i i i i i also think though that there's you know we'll see what happens with with the programming
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:42:00.280]   interfaces and so i mean or when we talk about xcode i think there's a real gap between
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:08.040]   uh shortcuts and swift and i think that that gap someday i think apple's gonna fill with a
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:12.440]   nodal a nodal programming interface you know like where and that's where an ipad becomes really
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:17.480]   useful where it's not as powerful a swift but it isn't as limited as as shortcuts but i don't know
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:21.240]   where a professional programmer that uses a nodal interface is great for learning great it's not
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:25.560]   about it's not about it's not about professional programmers using it it's about people being
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:29.560]   able to build something more complex than what they can do with shortcuts and where they don't
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:33.400]   want to write code like with you know with pixel conda with that we had what we did you could build
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:39.240]   very very complex composites but there was also just nodes that were you can add code here
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:43.080]   just add java into this like you can say take your inputs and then you can just write whatever you
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:48.040]   want so there's this bridge because what happens is i think that you know shortcuts is great i mean
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:53.560]   it's amazing but there are things that are complex that i think people would use on an everyday basis
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:57.080]   if they had a nodal programming interface where they could just say i want to you know i want to
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:00.440]   take these inputs and i want to go do this and i want to you know i can build little interface and i
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:05.160]   can put it together and it's done you know really in a clean way you know people kind of using the
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:09.320]   the idea of programming every day now what's going to happen is is that a that's where kids
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:13.960]   start to just jump into it where kids get stopped is all the text you know and so they start getting
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:18.600]   to the fact that that they can build all the stuff and they don't need to have you know all this code
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:22.200]   and then but what happens is is the the ones that really get into it are going to feel limited by
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:27.400]   the by the nodal interface and want to have a you know the first i just going to want to have nodes
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:33.560]   that they can add you know code to but the next step will be to have you know you know go to swift
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:37.240]   you know and and and i think swift is the future i think that you know the apple's not going to
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:44.120]   keep on and over a long period of time uh keep on investing in anything else so is it fair to say
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:50.200]   that the ipad is one of two things either a standalone device for somebody whose needs are few they
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:55.560]   want to watch Netflix do a crossword puzzle browse the web maybe do some banking and email
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:00.840]   or well i that's one poll market or your kids who want to you know watch
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:07.000]   finis and fur and the other person is it's an adjunct it's a it's an accessory to a full-size
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.280]   computer i mean i see as a professional photographer you'd want lightroom photoshop whatever tools
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:17.880]   you have on your desktop but it's nice that it hooks up to lightroom cc on the ipad i think
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:21.480]   let's you both i think for again for a bunch of people who never bought computers or never
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:25.000]   light computers never used them it is all the computer that they need like i know i've used
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.720]   this example before but i got my mom and i'm actually barely used it i got her an ipad now she has two
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:33.720]   of them she alternates between when the power runs out on one of them and she calls her a computer
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:37.720]   and it's the best computer she ever had she buy a three hundred twenty nine dollar ipad not the
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:43.240]   ipad pro that she might she might as is my problem she loves this ipad pro four really they didn't have
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:47.080]   that back they didn't have all the tools and all the things and some people just want to run like
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:51.480]   they just want to run photoshoot uh i'm playing lightroom they don't need a whole computer for
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:55.480]   that's all they want to do it's an austin man i've seen there's a bunch of small right niches they're
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:59.320]   not the steve jobs niches anymore that he outlined in the beginning but they're small but on the
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:04.120]   other end having an ipad pro might be all you need to go mobile and then instead of getting a macbook
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:08.840]   pro you have your iMac at the desk and because i think groover said this well a long time ago
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:15.480]   because the because the ipad is so light it lets the mac get really heavy oh that's a good line i
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:20.920]   like that yeah no it's great and i think that also we're just starting to see what what apple does
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:25.640]   or what not what apple does but what developers do with the usb c you know when you know i can
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:30.920]   imagine you know having this screen and being able to plug it into my black magic camera and
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:35.400]   be able to do paint and have scopes and all that other stuff that's that's there and those kinds
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:39.480]   of things i think are going to be uh you know the kind of thing that we're going to see more of
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:44.200]   you know um but because right now i have a whole bunch of external apparatuses that i have to go
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:48.200]   through to look at scopes while i'm looking through the video camera while i'm doing other things
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:53.160]   and that's just one example and you know there are large sales workforces not sales force but
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:59.080]   well actually sales force but um but there are large workforces that are you know spending a lot
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:06.680]   of money on development where they're giving um insurance adjusters salespeople um uh you know
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:10.520]   all kinds of other folks this is this is what we're issuing you if you want a computer you'll go
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:15.320]   buy it um we're giving you an ipad uh you know i think that the ibm partnership has probably done
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:20.440]   pretty well for apple and um the you know and there's a lot of dedicated things that are happening
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:26.120]   um within a lot of these verticals you know and the ipad having a lot more power and a usb-c
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:31.080]   connection opens it up to a lot of those things that we haven't seen yet so for now maybe not
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:35.160]   but for some of those you know using embedded into a lot of other things i think that there
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:41.400]   is um a lot of application for apple um in the uh in the enterprise market for it
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:47.960]   i i just think that the thing the thing to keep in mind is that computing today is unrecognizable
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:55.000]   from what it was 10 years ago uh or in alone 15 or 20 years ago it's no longer the idea of here
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.680]   is my computer everything that we need a computer for is now spread across multiple devices and so
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:05.800]   we don't have to take our apple 2e with the monitor and the two disc drives with us when we go to
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:10.760]   college or when we go when we go when we go to the store we've got a pocket computer shaped like a
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:17.000]   phone for that and we don't necessarily even need a computer a a computer when we go out just for
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:22.520]   for a half hour jog we've got a watch that will uh track us and let us contact people and let us
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:27.720]   listen to music when we got that when we get home to our desks we got the big big hung along to
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:31.880]   desktop with all the drives attached to it and sometimes we just need a three hundred dollar
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:37.160]   tablet so i think that the idea it's so long we can't let ourselves be limited by the idea that
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:45.160]   computing is now the one device to rule them all it really is nooks and crannies you keep
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:51.000]   filling with little devices as they become needed i think that it does so it will uh the the hub of
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:57.960]   this experience will always be a rather conventional display with a keyboard and a screen and probably
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:03.720]   some sort of pointing device because that really is the lingua franca of computing is the thing that
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:08.840]   that will make uh give you give you most bang for the buck but instead of spending all of your
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:14.200]   budget let's say on one big machine that does everything i really think it's going to be more
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:17.880]   about hey well here's a three hundred dollar Chromebook that will do all the stuff i need a
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:23.000]   conventional pointing device screen uh and uh and keyboard for but i'm also going to buy this
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.560]   really cool eight hundred dollar nine hundred dollar ipad pro for when i want to do things that
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:34.120]   are kind of sophisticated and fast and unique uh and on and on and on so that's why you know it really
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:39.240]   is it's about what hold do you have in your computing higher in your computing life what will
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:45.480]   fill and spackle that hole perfectly uh and it's more of a mosaic than a than a mural and i also
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:49.640]   think that we're spending more money on our on our electronics and less money on our cars and less
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:55.880]   money on other things my kids older and younger have no interest in cars um you know and uh in a
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:49:00.600]   lot of other things i think a lot of people are spending more money on the you know uh on those
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:06.200]   apparatuses whether it's the the the laptop or the iphone or the or the ipad um then they are
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:12.120]   interested in spending on other physical uh you know devices that that we used to used to have
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:17.000]   i mean my kids don't ask me usually to go buy something for them at the toy store um they asked
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.040]   me for new apps so you know like like you know they i want they want to buy a new app they don't
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:25.640]   now that that's partially a function of the fact that that we that they don't have
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:30.600]   an existence where they see a lot of ads um you know like so so that might be part of it but but
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:36.600]   you know they just don't they're not that interested in in having like every little toy that was out
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:41.720]   there you know and i think that in the same way i i find myself spending more money on on digital
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:46.840]   product than i you know in digital platforms um then i do on on physical things and i think that
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:55.960]   we're going to see that trend continue so how much faster is the a12x bionic in the new ipad
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:59.960]   pro compared to the what is it an a10 in the three hundred twenty nine dollar ipad
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:07.320]   is it enough of a different get the number um so the app apple will tell you this too the pro
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:13.240]   the processors in the current generation ios devices serve two main purposes one is if you really
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:18.120]   do push the silicon like if you really do run high level ar apps or you know computational
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:22.120]   photography filters or machine learning all but there's a bunch of stuff they can still peg these
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:28.120]   devices uh portra mode you used to peg those processors not a generation or so ago uh but
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:32.680]   they're getting more and more overhead but for the most part for most people they're not intended
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:38.840]   to be pure power now they're intended to still run ios 16 five years from now because they really
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:42.840]   do is that whole thing Lisa Jackson explained at the iphone event they're one of the best ways they've
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:47.640]   found not to fill landfills is to make devices last as long as possible whether you keep them
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:51.400]   that long or you sell them or hand them down or something so one of the principal jobs of
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:59.320]   a12 i keep calling it a 1210 because damn apple marketing of a12x in this uh device is to allow
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:04.440]   you to run ios 16 or 17 five years from now and all the overhead that will come with that operating
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:12.440]   system inevitably in the future so it is the case there is at least a range of abilities and
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:18.280]   prices in for ipads and i think people might be tempted to get late latest and greatest thing
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:22.040]   but it's very expensive compared to the three hundred twenty nine dollar ipad and for many
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:27.800]   people of the people i the first group the people i talked about surfers emailers netflix watchers
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:33.000]   less expensive ipad is more than adequate unless they really don't want to keep it for five years
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.160]   i mean if they want to keep it for five years and it's you know a thousand dollars and amortized as
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:41.160]   two hundred bucks a year and it might be worth it for them if they do want to buy more often and
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:45.000]   maybe getting the smaller ipad it's three hundred bucks and if they decide they don't like it or
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.920]   something really attractive comes out next year or two years from now and it's super easy to ditch
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:55.640]   that or give that away and get something else and and and and an ipad pro particularly a tricked
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:52:01.000]   out ipad pro with a pencil and a keyboard and a significant amount of storage really is for
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.800]   somebody who has a professional use for it so that they can justify the price or enough money
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   that they can say i don't have to justify it i'm gonna buy it and i think honestly most of those
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:18.600]   people will also have a computer of some kind of desktop computer of some kind and those people
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:24.280]   if they need to we'll start offloading work you know they go back and forth even you know what was
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:31.160]   his name austin man the photographer who's singing the praises of the ipad he has it definitely has a
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:38.280]   desktop computer at some point with light room in it that he's using they had him and his workflow
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:42.600]   at the event and i think it was i forget it was a macro pro or an iMac pro and a hassle
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:47.800]   black camera and an ipad pro yeah he's i mean this is a good article the new ipad pro
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:52.360]   photographers he really talks about it and he the thing he says it's really interesting is
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:59.240]   it has changed his artistic flow and in fact the stuff he edits on the ipad the photos he edits on
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:04.440]   the ipad actually look they are done differently not better or worse but differently than
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:08.360]   i'm keenly aware my images actually look different than they would if i added it on my mac
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:13.640]   not better or worse but different he said the tools have a major impact on the process
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:18.440]   and i find myself expressing myself differently as an artist through ipad pro i think that that's
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:25.080]   really great i think that that means it you know i think art does adjust to the tool you're using
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:32.520]   and i bet you it's a more expressive and and workflow for him that it's and as i watch his videos i
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:38.040]   it's clearly he's like he likes editing on the ipad pro with light room and of course as light
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:43.320]   room gets better too on on ipad pro i expect you could do more but right now even adobe
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:48.360]   is saying and when you do that it sinks back to your desktop so and where the raw file lives
[00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:53.720]   and uh you can have then the raw file and your continue your workflow there it's not it's not
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:56.280]   the end point it's the beginning point the ipad
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:54:03.720]   so that all i mean i'm trying to find where this fits in in people's lives i i think that it keeps
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:07.880]   on getting closer to i mean i think that you know i i'm not going to get into my workflow again about
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:13.560]   about how i'm illustrating though alex right it's it's such it's the power in this thing this is an
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:19.000]   amazing this is a computer from the future but it but it's running sulfur from the past it's a
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:24.600]   portion canada it's it's got amazing it's got a more lamborghini in canada it's got amazing you
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:28.600]   know you love driving it but then winter comes and you got to go back to the four by four yeah
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:32.760]   sorry alex i mean you're having to get cutting edge yeah i but it doesn't do everything that's the
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:38.120]   that's why i think it's also for me it's that what's frustrating is just is just trying to figure
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:41.720]   out how to replace i think a lot of these programs are still trying to figure out how to replace the
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:46.200]   mouse you know there are just things that you just go well i don't know how to like i complain about
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:51.800]   you know again like some of the the uh the i you know the the pages and keynote and you know all
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:55.560]   those other stuff you get into it and and it's just like this goofy thing that you have to do to
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:55:01.560]   get something done you know like i i use omnigraphy a lot a lot and um i can't use it on the ipad
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:07.960]   like just what i do is too complex for it and and i just and i and but i understand the complexity
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:12.360]   of what it takes to make omnigraphy to have that i don't know how i would do that without
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:15.560]   being able to hold down a keyboard and use a mouse and everything else because it's such a
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:23.080]   complex set of connections right what city is alexin now you've moved i moved i i i've got the
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:28.200]   teleporter working great you know like like you guys it's a wormhole commercial break i work for
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:31.640]   the commercial break because it does take a couple seconds and it looks like a little bit of a glitch
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:36.360]   let me give you a commercial break and then i want to talk about a couple of issues that we've
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:42.920]   discovered one we discovered earlier today and ios today with the ipad pro and audio but first a
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:49.000]   word from privacy oh i love privacy i love it i have been using privacy for some months
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:56.600]   it is the only credit card i use on the internet privacy.com i have a plugin that
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:56:02.760]   that will give me a credit card number uh for anywhere i go when i have that credit card number
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:09.880]   and use it it locks to that merchant so it cannot be used anywhere else you don't use the same
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:14.600]   password everywhere why use the same credit card number everywhere when you shop online i get a
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:21.480]   brand new virtual visa card number for every purchase i make plus i can establish limits i could
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:26.280]   say it could be used once and once only or i could say it could be used as well you know as many
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:30.840]   times you want but there's a limit on the amount each charge could be or the amount each month can
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:36.920]   spend or each year can spend you can freeze and unfreeze cards it's another reason to use it for
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:42.200]   subscriptions i don't have to worry about figuring out which subscriptions i have they all go through
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:49.000]   privacy.com and when i'm done with the subscription i just freeze the card it is so awesome you never
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.640]   have to worry about being billed twice or upgraded without your consent you don't have to worry
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:59.640]   about forgetting to cancel subscriptions or free trials and you can earn up to five percent cash
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:08.520]   back refunds work even if the card is closed or paused so i just this is it's pcidss compliance
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:13.240]   same security standards as your bank now i should let you know it ties into your bank account
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:19.720]   so it is not a credit card is a charge card you pay for it immediately so you're not going to run a
[00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:24.120]   a balance i think for me that's good too because credit card interest rates are so high there's
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:30.520]   you don't have to worry about with this and with the cash back up to five percent it pays for itself
[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:35.880]   you don't pay privacy there are there privacy.com is a hundred percent free to use they make their
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:40.440]   money for the merchants just like any other credit card they will not sell your information
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:46.840]   there are no hidden fees it's so private there's another feature i like i don't have to use my real
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:52.520]   address when i use a credit card i can make up any address any zip code i want
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:57.160]   they support two-factor authentication of course i turn that on as i do everywhere
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:04.200]   you get full control of your data so you have access to transaction data via web book api
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:08.120]   i don't even bother doing that i just haven't text me or mail me when the cards are used
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:15.080]   i have a complete paper trail of every time the cards used i love privacy.com privacy.com has
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:19.800]   saved customers over one hundred million dollars and unwanted and unauthorized charges
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:27.720]   due to compromised cards or hidden fees or forgotten subscriptions it is i mean it's just it's to me
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:33.720]   it's a no-brainer a unique credit card for every merchant for every transaction if you want so
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:40.600]   there's no threat privacy.com/macbreak you'll get five dollars off your first purchase just a little
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:50.920]   thank you for using that special URL privacy.com/macbreak i don't i don't know how else to tell you about
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:57.240]   this except just set up an account and try it it'll cost you nothing you can use the app on ios you
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:03.000]   can use the app on the desktop and you can also i just use the web plugin makes it very easy for me
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:10.440]   and it is really awesome privacy.com/macbreak we thank them for their support.
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:17.400]   So i on ios today my mom was on the show we like to do that every year for the holidays get mom
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:23.400]   on the show and she uses FaceTime she's not a skiper she has an iPad Pro at home the big 12.9 inch
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:29.080]   previous generation and she loves to Skype on that i skiper you know fairly regularly just to say
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:33.560]   hi and all that stuff and she uses headphones because she has the old iPad Pro with a headphone
[00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:39.720]   jack we thought well she won't by the way let me send her a new iPhone because she doesn't want
[00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:44.520]   to lose the headphone jack i understand that but i thought well the good news about this usb-c is
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:50.760]   it does support audio out analog audio out through the adapter that apple sells and i think that's a
[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:55.720]   standard adapter i used my the one that came with my pixel c and that our pixel phone and that worked
[00:59:55.720 --> 01:00:04.360]   fine or it's we found out you can use a DAC on this so it we connected the usb to a usb compatible
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:11.480]   digital to analog converter we use the FiO FiIO it works great in fact it gives you very good
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:15.320]   quality audio out if you had a really good quality DAC you'd be getting digital data
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:20.440]   audio data when you're playing music back from the iPad Pro the DAC had converted to analog plug
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:27.880]   in good headphones or a stereo system that's a really an ideal way to do it but face time won't
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:32.520]   face time no matter what we connected to the usb port continued to come out of the speakers
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:39.880]   now imagine the airpods if used up you know bluetooth would work fine i hope didn't try that
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:45.160]   we were able to airplay it and get the audio out that way is that that's got to be a bug i
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:48.920]   nobody's ever told me about this before but that's yeah no that sounds really like a bug i should
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:54.040]   just work with headphones yeah so that's something to be aware of and i i guess i'll file
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:59.400]   can you can an individual file a bug with apple yeah if you have a developer account you can go
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:06.120]   to bug recorder dot apple dot com yeah just file that in there um oh by the way tolly said i
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:09.960]   signed up for privacy connected to my bank account enabled to factor while you were doing the ad
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:16.360]   oh that's awesome that's how it really is that easy sorry i didn't mean to go back in the ad
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:21.240]   all right no problem number two and i think that i'm not alone in this lisa yesterday
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:26.440]   texted me hey apple just had me change my iCloud password yeah and so my immediately response to
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:30.040]   her was are you sure it was apple it wasn't what you didn't because i've been getting phone calls this
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:36.440]   is apple actually they were robo calls this is apple computer this is olivia from apple computer
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:42.920]   your iCloud account has been hacked i ignore that because apple does not do robo calls to my knowledge
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:48.840]   no uh but this was through she said no no it was on my device and then it happened to me this morning
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:55.640]   i uh my iPhone suddenly says oh you need to re-log into iCloud uh and i get that once in a while so i
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:02:01.560]   did it and it said nope we need to change your password now your apple id is locked you need to
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:06.440]   change your password and now it turns out it's not just me and lisa according to nine to five mac
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:10.520]   others are experiencing this do we know what's going on i've actually had that happen to me
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:16.680]   those a couple weeks ago i get it all the time because i'm always signing up new apple devices
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:23.640]   and i i trip the velocity indicator so it was because we installed new apple devices no i
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:26.920]   know i think there enough people are doing it now and i don't want to speculate because the worst
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:31.160]   thing to do in a situation is to speculate but like for example things that could cause this is
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:36.360]   you know a database gets um gets hacked from a different company like the famous home depot one
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:40.520]   and people suddenly go out and try all those passwords on every other account they could find
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:46.040]   there's just a massive amount of password attacks coming in and it trips a bunch of stuff a lot of
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:49.800]   this uses a lot of it uses machine learning and one of the things about machine learning is that
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:54.120]   it's infectious and it can do all sorts of strange things like change your keyboard character to an
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:58.360]   a in a box when you're not paying attention i'm not i'm not saying that's what this is but i'm saying
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:03.080]   there's a bunch of things that could happen that could cause a large number of iCloud accounts a
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:07.080]   lot because it looks like again it looks like a non-normal a non-trivial amount of
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:12.440]   of accounts so my guess is that apple will eventually say we had such and such a thing happen and we
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:16.360]   it affected a quote unquote small percentage of our customers and we've done it. I don't know what
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:23.320]   triggers a GDPR report but GDPR requires 72 within 72 hours if there's been a breach you have to
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:28.520]   report it so yeah if there was not be a breach it could just be like a bunch of hackers trying
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:34.440]   something odd happened yeah apple be an apple breach either right apple or airs on the side of
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:38.760]   security and makes you change your password and there's various levels because not everybody got
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:43.480]   the same level some people just had to enter their password to to make and that happens every once
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:47.320]   in a while because the credentials get thrown out so some people just had to enter their password
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:52.600]   others you know with two-factor others had to prove that it was their device by getting a code sent
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:56.920]   to another device and yet others had to create a new password which is the most annoying i've had
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.960]   through that several times now which is the most annoying thing because then you have if you have
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:04.120]   more than one apple device got help you you're in your it's a day-long activity fixing them all
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:09.320]   and updating. Yeah I'm going to need to now lock in what I did is I just made it monkey 1 2 3 so
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:14.040]   it'd be easy to log in on all of these devices instead of that long strong password I have to use
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:18.760]   last for every time so that's going to save me some time from now on but that means I have no
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:25.320]   joking it is it's a pain in the butt I have many as you know I have a few apple devices and all.
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:28.840]   You kind of be careful I don't know if you saw it but a guy on twitter tweeted a picture about
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:36.120]   a wallet for eKarnsie and people on twitter very quickly showed in 11 of the 12 words that
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:41.640]   guarded his wallet just by using Photoshop to increase the contrast on the inside of the image
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:46.840]   that he tweeted it's like never talk about anything because they'll find a way. I did think it might
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:55.000]   be just because Lisa and I both set up new MacBook Airs and new iPads in the last couple of days
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.600]   and of course new iPhones last month and that maybe those all those new devices but that's got to be
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:06.200]   this time of year pretty common in Apple land. Yeah so again that can be a trigger but I think
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:10.120]   there's way too many people for that to be like trigger case and all of all of them especially
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:15.240]   now that it's like a week after launch right nine to five says we haven't quite worked out the
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:19.720]   pattern or the cause but we've received many reports of users waking up to find their apple
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:25.160]   ID has been locked. Now some of them it looks like yeah and there's different ways to reactivate
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:29.400]   some actually have to answer security questions I hope to God they don't ask have me answer security
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:36.120]   questions. That's the worst I don't know what my fifth grade teacher's name was.
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:41.160]   Well the problem is that I tend to not want to use the ones that you know you get into this
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:44.360]   thing where you think you're going to remember it and you don't want to use the obvious questions
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:47.880]   the obvious answers for some of those security questions and then you don't give them and then
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:54.280]   you just screw it. You can't figure it out. Apple probably should step up and just say something.
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:06:01.880]   Yeah by the way the other problem is that with those security questions is that the name of the
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:07.160]   street that you that you were that you used to live on as a kid a publicly unfavorable information
[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:13.560]   and B it's the same information so if you if you tell one website what was the name of your first pet
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:19.240]   or what was the name of your first college roommate now you're trusting the security of that site to
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:24.040]   not be violated so that when your bank is asking that question when other things are important
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:31.160]   or asking that question that's that's why I have to make I have to wait for it to scroll down and
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:36.840]   say why don't I give you a question that will only what was when when you were abducted and taken
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:44.440]   to Venus which of the which of your your captors 11 toes turned into a purple squared.
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:50.840]   Yeah I mean security questions are bad provided questions are worse.
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:57.560]   Yes the only real way to his yeah we're trying to get the question from you your porn star name is
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:01.560]   the street you grew up on and your first yeah and then suddenly that company has but only a
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:07.880]   reasonable way to do this is in last pass generate a pass basically treated as additional passwords
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:13.080]   you have to store the question and your response in last pass and use last pass to generate random
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:17.640]   responses it's the only reasonable way to handle it but you keep that does not work in all cases
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:23.560]   I've literally seen I can't remember what it was some big company that provided drop down for
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:29.880]   questions and then a drop down for answers your favorite color is this you couldn't put an arbitrary
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:37.240]   answer in that it it infuriated me. Yeah just horrible. This security questions are
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:41.880]   I'm surprised Apple uses them but I guess it's the only way you can do this
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:46.760]   with normal people but it's just a bad idea. Please don't. Yeah that's
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:58.360]   Apple has responded to the reports that some iPhone 10 screens are having some sort of touch
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:04.840]   disease. Mark Gurman in Bloomberg says Apple says iPhone 10 units have faulty touch screens
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:12.280]   also some 13 inch MacBook Pros are having problems you'll know there isn't there a site there's a
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:17.400]   site where you go for Apple to enter your Apple serial number right. Apple did put up Apple put
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:22.520]   up support articles so if you it's support.apple.com it's not it doesn't matter which version of the
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:26.760]   iPhone 10 if you have that problem it affects all versions from the minute they started selling them
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:31.240]   to win the end of life them in September so if you have an iPhone 10 and either it's not properly
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:35.000]   registering touch or it's registering spurious touches like something happens and you never
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.320]   touch the screen you can take it in and Apple will fix it and if you already paid to have it fixed
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:44.680]   they'll reimburse you the 13 inch MacBook Pro with no touch bar is different that's not a
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:49.880]   replacement program it's a service program so if you have an error with the SSD which can be either
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:55.160]   corruption or failure of the SSD if you put in your serial number it will tell you if you have an
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:59.560]   affected model and then if you do you can take it in again and have the SSD replaced it's not
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:03.560]   every one of them but you can enter in your serial number and they'll tell you if it's you so people
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:12.120]   should go to support.apple.com yeah and all let's get that fixed yeah at least you're at least you
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:17.080]   know it's not in your imagination it's you're you can finally you can take this article and show
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:23.800]   it to your friends your spouse your parents say no you see i didn't i was at the bottom once again i
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:28.040]   mean a lot of people get super frustrated they're like apple's not listening to me but this it's a
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:32.280]   big company when they get reports of problems it hits the system and a certain number reported
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:37.560]   it triggers one of these programs and a lot of it is very programmatic go to support that apple
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:42.920]   like how scroll down to the bottom they have an exchange and repair extension programs and actually
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:49.800]   turns out to be there's a dozen of them here there's a number of different problems so if you know
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:54.760]   it's probably a good idea once in a while to check that and and see if they'll email you if they
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:57.960]   know that you're on the list they'll typically email you so you can also just check your junk
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:03.960]   and save it yeah that's the problem right it's it's all in the junk mail uh let's see the
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:18.600]   what was uh oh uh it was singles day uh 11 11 sunday and we talked up all about how
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:24.440]   alie boba sold a billion dollars in the first 85 seconds they had a record breaking 30 billion
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:35.400]   dollars in sales 30.8 billion dollars in sales on double 11 11 11 amazing but apple did okay
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:42.360]   as well in fact apple's iphone beat both walway and chow me the two biggest cell phone companies in
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:51.400]   china on 11 11 during the alie boba singles day event iphone sales led other smartphone brands on
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:59.800]   alie boba so that's i guess good news global global sales of course starting to flatten in the west
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:09.800]   but you got a whole new a whole new country to sell stuff to in china um stanley passed away
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:17.720]   yeah and i know i you comic book fans are sad although he was 95 he got a good long life excel
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:23.480]   c r stan excel c r an app store is honoring him i don't know i hope i'm not stealing anybody's pick
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:32.280]   but uh they have a remembering stanley uh section in the app store where they have a number of
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:40.440]   there's a story and uh and a tribute to them so that's nice inside the story a collection of 10 apps
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:46.440]   in three groups read and draw play the games act and learn eight comic book reader apps i didn't
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:54.040]   know there were so many i think we've talked about a number of them nerds are particular about
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:12:01.880]   their comic book reader apps everybody's true problem and everybody wants to fix it so true i had i
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:07.080]   do have a i do have a really awesome stanley story okay let's hear it okay so
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:14.680]   it's 1999 it's the one and only time i've ever been to the san diego comic con and i'm staying i'm
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:19.000]   staying like at the very very top floor of the mariot which is like right next door to the convention
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:25.160]   centers like part of the convention center and so i'm uh hit hit the button go down to go down
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:32.760]   stairs i'm like i'm on like the 88th floor whatever and the the door the elevator stops at the 86th
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:41.800]   floor and stanley gets on nice and i'm alone in an elevator with stanley and i'm silent until like
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:48.680]   the 78th the 76th floor and at which point i turn to him and say well obviously i'm going to say
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:52.680]   thank you for all the wonderful work you've been doing you've done for the entire career
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:58.280]   and you couldn't but oh well thank you very much aren't you aren't you and then you notice that i
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:03.720]   had a press badge i said oh well oh you remember the press so who do you write for and i say well i've
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:08.760]   worked for this job for the shot was sometimes but i've been lately i've been doing a lot of features
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:14.280]   for playboy magazine oh playboy you know you know i have you happen was a very very big fan of
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:18.600]   cartoonists and comics and we see i started we start talking about like cartoonists in the
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:22.680]   60s and 70s they start asking well what's what's the freelance market like now is
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:27.320]   or is it good to be freelance or freelance for these days and i find myself now talking to stanley
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:31.720]   about you know being a at that point not at that point not a freelance journalist in a collapsing
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:36.440]   market but a free unsternelist and in a thriving market and i'm watching no one is getting on the
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:42.120]   elevator i'm all i'm alone on an elevator and then we get finally get to the the first floor
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:48.680]   and we're any odd conversation and then there are times when like your your your brain wants to be
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:56.040]   the least helpful part of your entire body and fortunately my brain knew that i that if it screwed
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:02.360]   me up here i was gonna throttle it and so it gave me the presence of mind to say as i think
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:06.040]   there's some people meeting him the lobby said well stan thank you so much it was really really
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:10.280]   great thrill hope you have a great rest of the show instead of saying hey santa where are we going
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:16.360]   next let's keep working keep working and so so it goes dinner coming over to my house
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:22.040]   and i i interviewed him once or twice like after that but that was like he was the nicest guy again
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:29.160]   being trapped in an elevator with a comic book fan at kamakan and he could not be the nicest
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:34.680]   the nicest most generous person ever he was i got a very very stan moment that's all there's a lot
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:39.880]   to be said for that that is awesome stanley here he is at the 1975 kamakan
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:41.960]   please like downy
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:48.200]   that is a hell of a publicity still i really would like that that picture
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:57.800]   he was he was 1970ing at a 1979 level even back then oh he was a hot very very high level
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:04.440]   do you want to buy a johnny i've diamond ring
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:11.480]   well it's entirely diamond there's no when they say it's a diamond ring they mean it's a diamond
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:19.320]   ring it's a ring made out of diamond baby so absolutely all glass no bezel literally yes
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:25.160]   sotheby said the ring was created for the red auction so they're raising money for uh
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:32.120]   fighting hiv aids in africa uh don't know what it'll cost it was created by the diamond foundry
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:37.560]   a certified carbon yes a little weird to sell diamonds to benefit africa but
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:43.880]   this is a certified carbon neutral diamond producer well yeah the point is is that it's it is a diamond
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:48.600]   i mean i think that this is actually the point is that it is a diamond that is not made in africa
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:53.080]   so it's benefiting africa but it's a synthetic diamond and i think that one of the things that a
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:59.000]   lot of folks are trying to do with this is uh there's a fight that's going on between de beers
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.400]   and the synthetic creators the beers is really trying to run up thing that if it's not
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:08.920]   no if it's not pulled out of the ground it's not real you know and essentially synthetic diamonds
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:15.480]   are identical identical to to the uh to what's coming out of the ground and that's de beers problem
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:20.360]   and um and so de beers runs a big a lot of campaigns about it even though they're starting to invest
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:25.480]   in synthetic because they're you know they don't want to be left out um but there's a on the synthetic
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:32.360]   side there's a lot of push to sell diamonds to people uh like me that work and have done a lot
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:39.000]   of work in africa and won't buy a diamond you know i my uh my wife has a yellow sapphire instead of
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:46.760]   a diamond because i wouldn't buy one um and uh and so uh uh and and so the the the issue is is that
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:50.280]   i think that there's a there's a large market and i think they see that so this is a huge on in
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:56.280]   addition to raising a lot of money for africa uh the it's it's a it's a it's a marketing push to say
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:00.680]   we should and i'm sure that bono is behind this kind of marketing push and so it's probably johnnie
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:05.960]   i uh we should start really considering synthetic diamonds the the right way to go as opposed to uh
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:12.200]   pulling them out of the ground good good good good uh a mere 150 to 250 000 dollars
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:18.840]   but it's for a good cause yes how when one of the chances that thing isn't going to break into like
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:24.120]   14 different pieces as soon as you just like flex your i have a feeling that i have a feeling
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:28.200]   it's not made by baincy come on you you buy another one Andy fun
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:34.680]   i think i think that that goes into a little box and it sits on somebody's desk or sits on somebody's
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:39.080]   wall i don't think that yeah that's good where diamonds are pretty hard aren't they
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:45.000]   they're brittle yes right they're they're they're hard for scratch purposes they're not hard for
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:51.160]   ex accidentally excellently tap your your your you're tracked your hand against the desk while
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:55.480]   you're making a point hard you wear it and tie it out and that kind of cap burglar and that kind of
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:18:00.760]   shape is is uh not going to be great for something this brittle so it's it's going to be a great thing
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:04.440]   to talk to your friends about and put on your uh put somewhere but it wouldn't be great to
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:08.440]   wear it every day well that was my pick of the week so
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:17.080]   how many alexes is that uh quite a few right a few let's take a little break and then we will
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:23.560]   get back with your picks of the week my friends but first let's talk about belts i need a good
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:30.280]   stiff belt not that kind of belt i'm talking about slide belts by brig taylor high quality
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:36.200]   comfortable ratchet belts you know there was a there's a flaw in the whole concept of a belt a
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:41.720]   piece of leather you put around your waist with a few holes and if your belly doesn't match those
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:46.040]   holes well tough you're either gonna your pants are gonna fall down or you're gonna be uncomfortable
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:53.560]   slide belt uses a patented ratchet mechanism that gives you 32 precise adjustment options
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:58.920]   in every slide belt and by the way some of the most beautiful buckles you've ever seen slide belts
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:05.080]   these these are the holiday gift not just for guys they have slide belts for ladies too
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:12.200]   notice i got the twit buckle on here these these belts can be interchangeable so it's kind of like
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:16.440]   apple watch bands you have different materials they have all kinds they have everything from full
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:22.200]   green and top grain leather straps to high quality canvas animal friendly vegan straps once you get
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:28.600]   the strap you put the buckle on you can trim the strap to get it close to your waist size but then
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:33.160]   you know this is what lisa hears uh every morning as i put on my slide belt she
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:40.920]   cheers the ratchet and then can i have to say i commend them for this as the day goes by and
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:47.400]   my belly expands with meals i can slowly ratchet it out without making any noise so you can easily
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:53.320]   expand it surreptitiously and your pants will no longer fall down your belt will fit perfectly
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:20:00.040]   and by the way looks dynamite it is such an improvement to the traditional belt you can remove the buckle
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:05.800]   mix and match with other straps for com ultimate customization and versatility for its great for
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:11.320]   casual wear around the house dress at the uh at the uh office or wear it to a holiday party because
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:16.200]   they have great colors and and it's and it's a great travel belt because it's easy to slip on
[01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:25.080]   and off but if you are traveling my suggestion is you not wear this one the survival belt by slide
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:33.000]   belt this probably is not tsa approved this belt buckle however is is going to be awesome for the
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:41.640]   next time you're stuck in the wilderness because it has a built-in knife uh bottle opener flashlight
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:50.520]   and fire starter your set it's all and it's all kind of secretly hidden away inside your slide belt
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:56.600]   utility buckle i always think this would be a great gift uh whether you've got a bunch of groomsmen
[01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:01.240]   to give a gift to you could by the way you can have these monogrammed with the names of the
[01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:07.800]   bride and groom if you want or a holiday gift for the man in your life or the woman in your life
[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:14.120]   lisa probably wants one too i think this is coming soon uh rene watch out slide belt watches with

[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:25.560]   andy i see you have a couple let's go let's do it man uh i just got a one of the coolest
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:31.640]   phone apps that i've ever seen uh it's called the rpm app it's an app for testing the speed and
[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:37.720]   accuracy of your turntable you run it on your on your iphone finally put your iphone on top of the
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:42.920]   turntable and as it rotates it uses the accelerometer to measure the speed and the wall and flutter
[01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:49.080]   and the code i i like i link to a youtube video from one of my favorite youtubers techmoan
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:54.200]   who does like talks about like vintage audio stuff that's where i that's where i keep seeing
[01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:58.440]   it from and it's just the coolest thing ever one look and one of the reasons why it's so cool is
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:04.200]   that the display stays constant so you can keep reading it oh my god it's rotating oh my god
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:08.040]   that's hysterical so it has a little yeah exactly so it has like a little circular display in the
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:13.080]   middle of it that uh he's probably showing something yeah there you go uh so and we'll not so it'll
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:19.000]   not only give you the speed but also like the vibration the only eight three and a third we gotta
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:27.480]   fix that turntable yes awesome uh and like i said if if i only own one kind of novelty turntable but i
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:31.880]   had to get the app because i just wanted to put the phone on the turntable and watch it rotate
[01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:37.160]   around while the display stays like levels so i could read it uh and i suppose if you are an
[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:43.640]   audiophile or if you like to treat yourself you know what i i suspect i thought i could hear
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:48.680]   a point oh two percent very you know i'm glad i was right there that now i know i was absolutely
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:56.520]   right there yeah uh but yeah it's just the it's just pretty damn cool rpmapp.info rpmapp.info
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:04.760]   very nice uh rannay your pick of the week so my pick i apologize in advance it's it's it's a
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:08.920]   i'm gonna pick thrifter because they're gonna do their black friday stuff yes but i have to say
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:12.600]   in advance that thrifter is owned by the same company that owns i they're not like the same
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:16.200]   network but the same parent company it's mobile nations owned thrift yeah well i don't think it's
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:20.040]   mobile nations i think it's a company that owns mobile nations also owns thrifter but i really
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:23.800]   never pay attention to that stuff i didn't even know there was a company that owns mobile nations
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:30.200]   all the money all the money goes through ireland no um i somewhere in the us i don't know that's
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:35.320]   very far better that's the less you know the less you can testify to we're not going to press you
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:38.840]   on this yeah no but i believe it's the same company that owns mobile nations owns thrifter but
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:44.920]   anyway they're gearing up to do another one of their 24/7 um black friday things where they look at
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:49.560]   every deal they vet them they make sure they're actually the price is actually good it's not just
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:53.560]   you know they raised it before now they're lowering it again and they're going to do up to the minute
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:59.080]   they're going to have um twitter notifications web notifications a newsletter with the best deals
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:04.920]   for 24 hours uh and they're they're already talking about some because apparently black friday now
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:08.760]   starts in the beginning of october and runs until christmas day and it's really like a month and a
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:15.400]   half black something or other overfest it's like new christmas they're moving christmas uh yeah
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:20.040]   it's it's crazy and they've already got like there's deals on itunes cards i don't know when they start
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:25.960]   but they'll be like itunes cards 50 cards for 40 dollars and dan disilva who runs thrifter gave
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:29.720]   me a bunch of tips like you get those cards and you use that to get your netflix subscription
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:32.920]   or to get your apps or something and then your because those are already discounted for the
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:40.280]   holidays was like double discounts um walmart is doing 300 dollar cards on iphone 10r and 10s
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:44.440]   and because walmart sells everything that's basically like getting money back on on what
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:48.600]   anyways there's a whole bunch of them and they're always changing but if you go to thrifter.com they
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:53.160]   will always have up to the minute stuff on all the black friday things and i always say don't buy
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:57.800]   things you don't need they don't use this as a way to spend more money than you have to but make
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:03.080]   your list know what you want to buy both for yourself and for others and then find deals on
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:07.640]   those things and that way you're actually saving money and not just spending a bunch of money on
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:12.280]   things that you wouldn't otherwise buy yes 100% or get an ipad pro.
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:17.240]   if it's on discount like if you can put on one then it gives you money back.
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:21.880]   honestly it seems a shame to talk about the cost of these devices when you know there'll be some
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:26.600]   deals out there or at least some ways to get better deals on someone's gonna want something
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:31.240]   from you bad enough they'll give you a break on the cost of the watch. There you go. Alex
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:36.680]   Lindsey pick it awake my friend. So mine is is not very expensive. Oh good he said it's the
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:46.440]   indian reservation now the wig wands. So um so I I uh you know I walked into a I there are times
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:50.040]   when I you know it's middle of the day and I just feel like a McDonald's hamburger just
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:53.640]   just a hamburger like I don't want it. I don't want anything else. I don't want it double cheese
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:58.920]   man. That's two hamburgers. No I don't want more. I just want that you know there's something about it
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:04.040]   I probably go to McDonald's you know once a month or so for this this one little thing I just want
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:09.480]   I just want a hamburger maybe every quarter or something. We call them regulars. Yeah and so I
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:17.640]   walked in. I walked in as a long line and then I saw this I saw the app you know the little thing
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:23.160]   and and the little mobile mobile section I checked it out. I was like the app is really good. So
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:28.440]   you know that this is the thing that I think that a lot of McDonald's app oh my gosh it's really
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:34.520]   good. It's like it's like really well done. Like in the week is the Mickey D's app. So so here's
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:38.040]   the thing is for the people who are listening it's not it's not necessarily that you should go to
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:44.280]   McDonald's. You should look at the at the design of how they put this app together. So it is you know
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:48.840]   it is just the problem is is that point of sale for a lot of these companies you know for a lot
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:52.680]   of these companies is not done very well. You know it's cumbersome it's a pain in the neck you don't
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:57.720]   get the information you want. You you either have to customize too much or not enough and so it's
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:01.880]   not so much that everyone should go out and use McDonald's. The the big thing is is that I just
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:09.400]   wish that designers would look at apps that were well thought out and user oriented when it comes
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:14.120]   to buying the stuff where we're going to minimize the amount of pain it takes to you know to actually
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:17.800]   order something and to know what you're ordering and and so on and so forth. It tells you exactly
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:21.800]   where your nearest McDonald's is. You know it's going to have it ready for you when you walk in.
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:25.880]   Like and it just figures all of that stuff out and it's just done it's done really well and
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:30.040]   effortlessly. So it's not it's not a pick that again that everyone should go out and get McDonald's.
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:34.680]   It's a free pick so you know I can you know but the point is is that what I what I've been looking
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:41.080]   at a lot around point of sale is you know I've been downloading a lot of people's restaurant apps.
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:48.280]   You know and I think it makes a huge difference for a lot of retailers and restaurants to figure
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:53.400]   out for brick and mortar to figure out how to make it easy for people to buy. I go to I get a
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:58.200]   Greek salad there's a place called in DC called GRK Fresh. I think it's just in New York and DC.
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:03.240]   It's like this Greek thing and I get a Greek salad every day. Now partially it's a really good
[01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:09.640]   kale salad but I can also order it so I can order in less than 60 seconds on my computer and then
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:14.280]   walk in and pick it up. You know and and the thing is is that that is you know that's half of the
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:19.080]   puzzle. The other half is that it's a really good salad but the point is is that is that that ease
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:23.960]   a point of you know and not trying to put a bunch of marketing on top of it and not you know like
[01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:28.920]   the number of clicks is super important when it comes to figuring out how to use these apps and
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:34.520]   and I think that a lot of companies feel I feel like they're falling down you know on the fact
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:39.560]   that they make it too hard to to order stuff from them and I think that brick and mortar would do
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:44.120]   a lot better if they could figure out how to make that super seamless and super easy and I think
[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:48.600]   that McDonald's has done a pretty good job. Awesome. That's my I'm loving it as they say. Can I
[01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:54.840]   can I log one small point of rebuttal? Yep. Now they hit. So okay so then not only do they have
[01:29:54.840 --> 01:30:00.040]   the app but they also have like the the the kiosk inside the store so you don't have to actually
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:05.480]   interact with it with a person. Oh yeah. So you see this. Now see this this is the double this is
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:09.640]   the double whammy that disappoints me about the kiosk because I how do I not know about this?
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:15.480]   I went into one and I didn't know it was completely changed at this point in the live on term
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:20.120]   like long enough. That's the that's the issue. I worked at McDonald's all through high school.
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:24.440]   I was a role Mac Cafe now we don't have a donald anymore. I'm deeply addicted to McDonald's food
[01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:28.840]   but I guess because of that I try to not go anywhere near it and you you're triggering and
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:35.160]   saying trigger warning. Okay. I'm just saying. Okay at this you know that you don't go into
[01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:39.000]   McDonald's because you want to peruse the daily menu and ask what the special are. Yeah.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:43.880]   I because once a month I want like either a Big Mac value meal or a quarter pound with
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:49.320]   cheese value meal once a month I want it. It's really really tasty. Okay. And so you would think
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:55.240]   that like the value meals are like would be like a top level selection but not only that but there
[01:30:55.240 --> 01:31:01.880]   is no menu option for value meals. What you have to do is tap at a sandwich at Big Mac and then ask
[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:07.160]   for a value meal. But the thing is again I'm not I'm I don't go to McDonald's enough that I've got
[01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:13.720]   this done the muscle memory yet. I don't know where to find value meal and as soon as I god bless
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:18.120]   god god bless these people they're very very well trained. They only want to be helpful
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:24.840]   but they see someone above the age of 15 years old using a touchscreen device and being confused
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:30.840]   for a moment and then suddenly I'm uncle do you need some help using the kiosk and here let's walk
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:35.160]   you through this like I know I know how to use this. I know how to use tap and pay. I just want to
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:43.240]   know where the bad. Don't condescending to me. I'm yes. I'm your elder.
[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:50.840]   Our generation one world one too for you. Get away from me. You've realized that I used to I
[01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:56.840]   got my email through Fido net. Okay. So yes I'm also very technologically hip.
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:04.280]   Now I'm going to get the McDonald's right now. I'm going to McDonald's. Yeah the kiosk is useless.
[01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:07.720]   Like I used it. I'm like I'm never going to use this again. So it wasn't that their kiosk was a
[01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:12.280]   complete fail. So it's obviously two separate teams that put this together. Well there you
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:15.800]   know what I'm sure trying to figure out is can we do McDonald's without humans.
[01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:21.480]   You know so that they've got they've got one in Phoenix that runs on two people. I understand
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:26.200]   that is so that the and the people get paid more because all they do is manage the machines.
[01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:33.800]   But the so far at least the reports are is that they that they have you know they're adding a lot
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:38.440]   what they're trying to do is add a lot more. Thousands people are now delivering 1000 stores
[01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:42.920]   every three months are getting self order kiosks. I think that they're supposed to try to get but
[01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:47.240]   they still have the regular ones there. And again the kiosks are so bad. I don't know why anyone would
[01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:51.320]   would use them. But the mobile is really good. Like I don't know if I'd ever go to McDonald's
[01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:56.760]   without ordering ahead of time now because you know you just so do you pick it up at the kiosk or
[01:32:56.760 --> 01:33:02.280]   there there's a there's a side area. It's kind of like Starbucks when you order like
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:06.120]   and the Starbucks one is like I don't do order the Starbucks one because it's just mass chaos.
[01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:10.120]   You know like Starbucks hadn't figured out how to like I still go and order because I actually
[01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:14.280]   want to be hot because I don't never know like with Starbucks you don't know whether you're
[01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:18.520]   going to show up and it's going to be not ready or you're going to show up and it's going to be cold.
[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:23.480]   Like there's no way to tell the time. And so it kind of defeats Starbucks but
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:27.960]   and it might be the same way with McDonald's. But after I did the first try I was like oh I'm
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:31.320]   going to just use this all the time. I'm not going to go in and stand in line and
[01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:35.240]   you know do all that stuff and really cool if McDonald's had like healthy good food.
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:42.280]   And then all this stuff they do but they sell it alongside the Big Mac value meal the fries taste
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:47.320]   so good. That once a month though I really really kind of got to have.
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:53.960]   I think by the way the secret to McDonald's bag salad at home for three bucks. I know.
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:59.480]   My gosh I started ordering a meatless Big Mac which I didn't know was a thing but they
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:05.000]   basically give you a Big Mac without any patties in it. Oh yeah. The secret to McDonald's I
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:10.360]   believe having worked there for many years is they put sugar in absolutely everything.
[01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:15.640]   And salt. I mean everything. No there's salt but the key
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:21.080]   indicative ingredient is sugar and it's just got a lot of sugar and it's.
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:26.520]   Did you make the off menu items Leo? Like I used to use the fish into the into the Big Mac.
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:30.680]   All the patties whatever you whatever you needed grilled cheese I know how to make that.
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:38.520]   I can do it all. I didn't know. Apparently the whole subculture until I started working
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:41.880]   McDonald's. I just want to say that's when it all that's what my troubles began.
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:48.120]   I'm glad that I'm glad that they they used to have like a they would make a Big Mac only out of
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:53.480]   like quarter pounder components. So if you like the big big quarter pounder bun and the quarter
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:59.880]   pounder patties but made like a Big Mac with special sauce and I had that a couple of times when
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:03.960]   it was still on the menu and I decided it's a good thing that this is not a regular meal item
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:09.880]   because I can barely justify the Big Mac as it is. You know I yeah. The only reason I don't still
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:15.880]   work at McDonald's is they gave me an offer at one point to they said and then they and then they
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:20.200]   looked at me when I said no I don't want to be I don't want to go to hamburger you I'm going to
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:25.720]   Yale thank you anyway. They said we we're not going to rehire you you're not management material we get
[01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:30.680]   the feeling you don't you don't want to you don't want to make you don't want to live your opportunity
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:40.520]   yeah yeah think of it as a window opening not a door closing. My pick of the week is from tools
[01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:47.640]   and toys.net their annual Christmas catalog is out lots of Apple stuff and I want to point out
[01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:54.600]   that they donate 11% of their gross 11% to app camp for girls operation Christmas child in St. Jude.
[01:35:55.160 --> 01:36:01.800]   So it's a really good thing let's go let's go look at the Apple stuff. A lot of good places a lot
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:09.400]   of good for instance here's elevation labs draft table iPad stand yeah this is stuff here I mean
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:15.960]   don't you think you need 12 South's air pot leather AirPods case I think you do of course this is
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:22.760]   trying to call a war like Han Solo's blaster I know doesn't that look cool oh man hanging off your
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:29.560]   belt. Oh yeah those are my ipods my earpods so this is there's the there's the pocket printer
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:34.360]   the print pocket printer this is a great way if you've got a geek in your in your life I don't
