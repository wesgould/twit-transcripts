[00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:03.080]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, episode 112, the week after the week before the week after.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:10.840]   So we are here now all settled in with our new laptop computers and our new iPhones and our new
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.840]   iPods and even our Google phones, some of us, ready to talk about the world of Macintosh.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.760]   Joining us this week, very pleased from across the pond, Mr. Don McAllister of Screencast's online.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.960]   Hi Don.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.520]   >> Hi Leo.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.680]   Hi.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.160]   How's it going?
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.920]   >> Always great to have you from Liverpool.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.360]   >> Good. Just do me a favor though, just no ring-o impressions this week.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.800]   >> We won't do that anymore.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.480]   We'll leave them to you.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.560]   We can do the authentic ones.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.320]   Screencast's online is a wonderful video podcast you subscribe to with a bunch of screencasts.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.760]   As you might expect, there's a free and a paid component and it's just a fantastic way
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.760]   to learn about your Macintosh.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.840]   And you wanted to talk a little bit about firewire and things and the display port.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.360]   I'm very interested about the display port.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.840]   >> Yeah, there's a couple of things in the woodwork, but we'll have a little chat about that.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.400]   >> Excellent.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.960]   Alex Lindsey is here, but soon he's going to be leaving us for six weeks.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.720]   >> Well, I'll still be here.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.440]   I can still, it actually turns out the time will actually work.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.200]   It'll be midnight in Tokyo.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.400]   >> Is it going to be in Tokyo for how long?
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.960]   >> It looks like six weeks.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.440]   >> Wow.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.080]   Doing what?
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.400]   >> I'm helping out with some visual effects for an independent Japanese film.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.360]   >> Oh, that's cool.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.200]   >> Yeah, so a friend of mine, Quasi Carlson, who was the producer for--
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.240]   >> Oh, yeah, I'm a real question.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.720]   >> --the other women.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.520]   And so he's working with Hans Kanosa and they're shooting a film over there.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.520]   And so there's a bunch of visual effects and they asked me to kind of stick my head in on it.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.880]   >> Well, that's really cool.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.920]   >> Yeah, I'm kind of looking forward to it.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.560]   I'm-- I-- you know, sushi's one of my favorite meals and I plan to--
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.480]   >> Have you been to Japan before?
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.960]   You must have.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.960]   >> If not, no, I've always heard that the way to go to Japan is for someone else to pay for it.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.760]   And I'm taking advantage of that.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.120]   >> I think it's true.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.720]   And not only that, you're not going to be the tourist in Japan.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.040]   Is it-- so you're going to be in Tokyo proper?
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.400]   >> Yeah, I'm going to be in Tokyo proper.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.000]   They're putting me up in some kind of corporate housing or something like that.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.480]   So--
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.960]   >> That's correct.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.600]   >> So it-- and so, and Karlyta gets to come out for a couple of weeks.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.480]   >> Oh, good.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.360]   >> Yeah, so she's going to--
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.720]   >> You bring Malakai or leave him at home?
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.960]   >> Yep.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.320]   I think she's going to bring him with him.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.200]   Bring him with him.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.680]   >> Oh, that's great.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.520]   >> So it should be a lot of fun.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.280]   It's going to be-- I'm going to be moving into Petaluma and then we'll--
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.080]   I'll be there for me.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.640]   >> Well, that's fantastic.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.280]   Let's definitely stay in touch.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.280]   I presume you'll have good bandwidth in Tokyo.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.760]   >> It sounds like the place that I'm going should have much faster bandwidth than I have in the office.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:40.120]   >> It sounds as though any cell phone you buy at any kiosk for $20 will have better bandwidth
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.240]   than anything you can get any in the office in the United States.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.200]   >> Yeah, it's pretty much.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.240]   >> Pretty much.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.200]   That's Andy and Akka, ladies and gentlemen, from the Chicago Sun Times and the Celestial
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.360]   WasteOfBandwidth.com.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.560]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.280]   >> Hello, Don.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.280]   I'm not a fan of the Ringo accent, but what accent can I do instead?
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.640]   >> Oh, just go for anything kind of--
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.120]   >> He doesn't--
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.240]   >> Excellent, Mr. Sulu.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.240]   Any time we need the Mr. Sulu, you could do that.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:14.280]   >> Well, actually, in the light of our new election week, I think that I should deliver
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.520]   all of my comments in the manner of John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.600]   >> I thought it was Sparak Obama.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.320]   Okay, we'll take it.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.160]   >> No, I'm just teasing.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.680]   >> I knew it was Kennedy.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.720]   >> It was closer to that guy, Duncan Donuts.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.600]   God, give me a scratch, tick of the harrow, then go on yourself.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.800]   >> Speaking of Mr. Sulu, Apple got some attention for supporting--
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.240]   well, now this gets so complicated, and I apologize for Adon for our crazy
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.480]   electoral process here in the US of A, but in California, it's even crazier.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.840]   We have a referendum process.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.440]   There's a Proposition 8.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.640]   If you vote yes for Proposition 8, you're voting against gay marriage.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.080]   If you vote no, you're voting for.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.760]   So yes is against.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:04.040]   Apple just put in 100 grand towards the no on eight, which means yes on same sex marriage.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.320]   >> And evidently, I think this is one of the--
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.200]   I think they said it's the most expensive proposition ever.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.440]   They're spending so much money that it actually rivals the presidential election.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.520]   Most of that money coming from out of state, of course.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.640]   In fact, apparently a lot of it's coming from the Mormon Church and the Catholic Church.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.920]   >> Yeah, it sounds like it.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.960]   And then from the other side, it's just about--
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.000]   >> Google and Apple.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.200]   >> Both Google and Apple put money.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.400]   >> Google and Apple had a ton of actors.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:34.840]   >> Well, the reason I mention that, Mr. Sulu went San Francisco legalized a gay marriage in the city.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.120]   I was the first guy to get married, I think he was.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.280]   He was among the first to get married.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.200]   Okay, that's really killing the conversation.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.920]   >> No, no, no, no.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.560]   I'm--
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.680]   >> Are you working on your Sulu?
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.040]   Are you warming up to the Sulu?
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.320]   >> No, it's just that I'm a great fan of the man in all of his work.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.200]   And I want to make sure that's not perceived in a mocking context.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.160]   >> Not at least.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.640]   No.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.200]   >> In fact, I'm--
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.560]   >> Hey, listen.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:03.160]   Although, I was-- I had one of those ideas that this would be a good way to avoid working for two or three days,
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:10.840]   to do like for the holidays, a holiday book on tape of a Christmas carol spoken by a guy
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.680]   who's trying to sort of sound like George D'K.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.840]   >> I think actually--
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.440]   >> He could hardly--
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.000]   >> Was dead.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.720]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.520]   >> Of this, there can be no doubt.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.640]   Or else the story would have no significance.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.640]   >> You're the Frank Calenda of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.840]   It's very clear right now.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.280]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.600]   >> You could do it in many different voices, though, Andy.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.320]   That's the beauty of it.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.520]   >> Yeah, some people could get tired by number three.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.840]   I know, I'm always careful just to do voices for a minute.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.600]   >> I was just heading to PeterDavid.net.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.800]   Peter David is a good friend of comic book writers, the Star Trek novelization writer.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.960]   And so she was talking about-- he was at the wedding, and he was-- he had some comments about
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.520]   William Shatner's invitation or non-invitation and reaction to the--
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.200]   >> He was not-- Shatner was not invited?
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.360]   >> He was invited through-- unfortunately, they're not
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.120]   they were talking back.
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.840]   Okay, this is George DeK trying to do it Peter David and--
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.800]   >> He was married in LA, by the way, not San Francisco.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.400]   >> Back in July, had breakfast with George DeK and Brad Altman,
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.120]   his husband, and naturally discussed the upcoming wedding.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.120]   They were talking about how they'd have to whittle the invite list down from several thousand to 200.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.840]   >> And I had to ask--
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:23.080]   >> Shatner.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.160]   >> And I had asked the question, I'm sure you would have asked.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.160]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.840]   >> So yes, the list.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:36.040]   >> I don't know. Yes, said Brad, nodding firmly, and George agreed, adding,
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.360]   "I think it's time to let the past goo."
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.600]   >> Oh, were they not friends?
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:47.400]   >> Yeah, it's-- now, you really have to read to the stars, which I think a past audible pick of
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.960]   the week, and actually a very, very good autobiography, that you start reading like,
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.240]   "Oh, it's a Star Trek biography. This is going to be-- kitchen can't be fun."
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.000]   But then he actually has a really great story to tell, of which Star Trek is only
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.280]   one part of it. But yes, you do pick up one of these books thinking,
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.840]   "Where's the part in which they have some Shatner stories?"
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:11.400]   Yeah, apparently, Sulu was supposed to get promoted to Captain in Star Trek II.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.360]   And so they wrote it in this great scene.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.680]   >> But Admiral Kirk has some say in that, I'm afraid.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.560]   >> Oh, well, no, he didn't. He did it the most passive--
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.360]   he killed it the most passive, aggressive way possible.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.040]   He tells the story in the book about how they were going to do it by having just like,
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.720]   "Hey, they're walking through the decks." And Admiral Kirk says,
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.640]   "Hey, by the way, Sulu, congratulations for promotion to Captain.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.240]   I guess this is going to be our far last cruise together before you take your new posting."
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.080]   Yes, you're very, very honored.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:45.720]   And I guess that Shatner realized that if I talk in a more flat monotone than normal
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:50.760]   and don't make eye contact, then they won't be able to use this take anywhere.
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.640]   >> Oh, that's terrible.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.920]   So I think the fact that Doris Deque actually invited him to the wedding anyway
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.640]   shows the enormous strength of character that is evident when you read his autobiography.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.560]   >> That's great. Well, we'll make an audible pick again soon.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.040]   I haven't read it yet, and I forgot about it.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.320]   >> I did want to ask, how well is that initiative going?
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:16.360]   Here in Massachusetts, we actually expanded gay rights to marriage instead of--
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.920]   >> Like California. It's illegal in California. So the deal would be
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.480]   that this would overturn that and make it-- I think makes a constitutional amendment
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.720]   that it's illegal. >> Right.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.680]   >> But about how's it going?
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.080]   >> No, it wasn't very close at all, but it's become a very close race according to the polls.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.880]   It's hard to tell. These propositions are tough to predict ahead of time.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.720]   There's not a big polling sample, and there's not a lot of money in it.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.880]   But in this case, there was a lot of money in it, and I think all the ads
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:49.320]   for it, which far out number of the ads against, seemed to have had some
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:57.000]   gains of traction, because it was strongly losing. It's very confusing, strongly losing,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.680]   but now it's apparently much closer than it was. And I don't know. We'll find out in a week.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.680]   One week to election day, everybody vote. Hey, before though, I want to--
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:10.520]   right at the beginning of the show, mention this free crossover office because it's the deal ends
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:15.800]   today. So go to CodeWeavers. Actually, I think CodeWeavers is down.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:25.320]   Did you hear the story? It was a weird bet that the-- let me see if I can find the-- I want
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:35.080]   quote the exact story. It was kind of a bet that the CEO of CodeWeavers made that kind of--
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:40.360]   I don't know if it backfired or not. Here, let me-- come on. Come on. Come on, firefox. Thank you.
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:45.080]   I should be using Safari. Live and learn. The Weber side-- the site is still down.
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:50.360]   Yes. Yeah. Well, they have a special site. I've got a round of it. There's a down.codeweavers.com
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:55.320]   which is according to the Brett-Molik server. Down.codeweavers.com. So Jeremy White is a CEO,
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:01.960]   offered a challenge to another CEO, the chief executive of the USMA, George W. Bush. He gave
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:10.120]   him six lame duck goals during the twilight of his term. And should he meet any of those goals,
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:16.280]   White would make crossover free for one day. Now, this is a $40 product that normally sell to Mac
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:23.480]   users. It allows you to run-- it's wine, basically. CodeWeavers does wine, which is the Linux application
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:28.920]   that lets you run windows applications natively without running. It's not an emulator exactly.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:34.600]   It emulates the API, so you don't have to run a virtualization to do it.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:42.440]   So apparently, according to the Ultimate Apple Weblog, some found White's proposal a great
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:47.480]   motivational tool others found it smug, partisan, and kind of a goofy way to promote the company's
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:52.200]   products. But in any event, none of the six challenges seem to be on the path to achievement.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:58.520]   However, a funny thing happened on the way to January 20 due to the global economic
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:02.600]   conditions and through no fault of the president. The price of crude oil dropped precipitously,
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:09.640]   and the cost of gasoline moved in parallel, bringing it down to the target $2.79 level in
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:16.760]   Minneapolis. Goal number one. And then the Ultimate Apple Weblog says, "Can anyone say
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:23.480]   Taco?" So today-- and this is October 28, 2008, in case you're listening later and you're going to
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.840]   be slamming your head, you said, "Oh, I got to listen to Mac break weekly. Today, it comes out."
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:33.240]   Today, until the end of day, you can download one license per customer for crossover Mac,
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:40.680]   actually crossover Linux, and crossover games. And the license will be for a download-only
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:45.000]   flavor of the pro version. That includes the games optimized build and the option to share a
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.360]   Windows "bottle" among multiple users on the same machine. They call it a bottle because it's wine.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.280]   Get it? You'll have to choose either the Mac or Linux product for your free copy,
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:01.720]   and licenses are eligible for support and update renewals after one year for $35.
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:07.080]   This sounds like a good deal for everybody. It's, I think, a great way for crossover to promote
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:12.360]   their product. And they're not going to lose a lot of revenue because you have to renew it after a
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:19.480]   year anyway. It is just one day. It's just one day, too. There's lots of people that are listening
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:24.440]   right now. There won't be about it then. But the site is down. So a lot of people have-- I don't
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:30.440]   think they realize the power of the Twitter. Well, I think that also, I think that right now,
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.360]   you can still download it. The site is down. Yeah, you won't get the serial number. Now,
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:39.480]   I sent for the serial number yesterday, got it. So I was able to download the product and run it
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:43.480]   with the serial number. They say they'll mail you the serial number as soon as their servers recover.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:49.240]   But you can download it now. So what was it done? Yeah, it's down.coderivas.com. And they've
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.160]   actually-- it's quite clever, actually, because, obviously, people were hurting by not being
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.240]   available. They put just a single page up, which is optimized just for high bandwidth.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.000]   And you can just pop your email in. They'll send you the serial number. But they have put some links
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.880]   to some full-vision downloads, some fully unlocked builds. So you can actually download it, give it
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.800]   a go. I mean, I downloaded it about two hours ago. And that seemed to be working fine. Yeah, it came
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:14.120]   in pretty quick. Although, when the first site went down, you had to think that it meant thousands
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:20.200]   of people were hitting it, right? So, I mean, let's say they give away 5,000 copies of the program.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:25.880]   That's a lot of revenue. That's $200,000 in revenue lost. Of course, those people made it
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:30.840]   reply to it. Exactly. I think that a lot of times when we think of revenue being lost,
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.920]   we think of the thought that they would really go get it. I mean, I'm going to download it. I
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:39.000]   didn't really consider it but download it before this. Yeah, me. But I will now. And, in fact,
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.440]   it may do very well for them, because if it does a good job running Windows applications,
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:49.320]   maybe a lot of people will say, "Whoa, this is great. Maybe I don't need VMware,
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:54.200]   Fusion or Parallels." I mean, I wasn't going to bother downloading it, to be honest, even when
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.760]   I heard about the free offer. But people were twittering about it today. And then I realized,
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.960]   we might actually talk about it tonight. So, I best download it and have a look. So,
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.480]   it's one of those things. I mean, I'm perfectly happy for the limited number of Windows applications
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:10.520]   that I need to run just running Parallels or Fusion. But you don't need a copy of Windows with this.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:15.480]   You can actually, but I'm right to think you can only run optimized packages that have been
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.800]   optimized specifically for this particular environment. So, you have to get that from CodeWeavers or?
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.960]   I'm not sure. I'm not sure. That's a bit because it's so new to me. I'm not too sure. But I don't
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:30.200]   think it's, but it's definitely not like a virtual machine. I think you do have some sort of specialized
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.600]   app. Yeah, I have some experience with Wine. And I presume it's very similar to Wine, which
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:39.800]   basically emulates the Windows APIs. And if you, in fact, if you look at the CodeWeaver site,
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:44.120]   maybe you can't see it, but they have a database of which applications run and at what level,
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:49.960]   how well they run. And what they do is they tweak, the application is exactly, you would
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:55.240]   install it from a Windows, you know, from Word or whatever. The application, as I understand it,
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.600]   the application is the same. Of course, it has to be because it's a commercial application.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:04.920]   But what they do is they tweak crossover to make sure that it responds to the API calls
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:09.640]   and exactly the way the application requires. So they did Word first, you know, they'll do the
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:15.320]   big, most popular applications first. It's interesting that the games, the games actually work with
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:20.600]   it. Some of the Half-Life, Half-Life, for instance, things like that. But again, it sounds like
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:26.200]   you haven't haven't installed anything yet nor have I. No. I think all of us Mac users aren't
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:30.840]   all that excited about it. But if you're one of those people that has to use,
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:38.200]   while somebody called the radio show this week and said, "There's no act for the Mac. I need to use
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.160]   act." And act will run on crossover office.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:48.600]   Well, the big win of crossover is that bootcamp works great and parallels and the rest work great.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:54.040]   But you do need to buy a copy of XP or VISTA to make it work. This just simply tries to say,
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:17:00.200]   "Oh, well, Word wants a window." Well, here's Lemme just faking into thinking that this Mac
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:06.840]   Windows actually, Windows Windows, Windows Word needs access to the 2SB. Okay, well,
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:10.280]   let's trick it into thinking that the Mac Print driver is actually this print driver,
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:17.480]   which is why it works on some things, not others and why at some point most the software needs to
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:22.920]   know what the quirks of almost every really popular Windows app is. But I mean, even when it
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.760]   it's all new for what, $60, like $17? They said $40.
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:32.360]   $40? Yeah. So great deal because I mean, Windows would cost you a couple hundred bucks.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.160]   Yeah, exactly. So have any of you tried?
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.680]   No, please try it. That's the funny thing.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:44.200]   I've tried it, but not recently. It really did strike me as a sort of solution where
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:49.480]   if you have a need for a specific Windows program and if that Windows program happens to run really
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:54.520]   great under this piece of software, then it's a great value. Otherwise, if you have sort of an
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:18:00.280]   ongoing need to run our very Windows software, just stick a curve on your wallet, quote,
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:04.520]   buy and quote a copy of Windows XP because we've never heard of BitTorrent and
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:14.200]   what? Nothing. Earl, Earl BitTorrent. Earl BitTorrent. He's a guy who gives you discounts.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:19.720]   He works with the Best Buy over in Marblen town. And I mean, sometimes, you know, if it's a little
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:23.080]   bit out of stock, a little bit out of date, he'll get you a good discount. You know,
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:27.880]   it's all my censure or all the time. He's great. He likes muffins. Make him some muffins. I'll
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:33.080]   put him in a good mine. Yeah, that's it. Earl BitTorrent.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:38.520]   So, well, good. Well, we'll just have to say, I guess everybody will know a little bit more
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:44.040]   about crossover next week. We'll have a better idea of what the heck they will do for you.
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.000]   I think it's going to end up to be pretty good PR for these guys.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.760]   I think they got a lot of attention from us. Yeah. All right. Exactly.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:57.320]   Let's see. No Scott born yet. I was trying to get Scott born. Google Earth released for the
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:01.000]   iPhone OS. I'm sure all of you are planning to pick on that on your Apple Mac pick.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.800]   But and so we'll leave that details for your pick of the week. But that's pretty exciting.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.800]   I haven't played with it yet, but I've downloaded it and put it on my iPhone.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.160]   Yeah, I'm talking about it. That's pretty nice. I love Google Earth. Apparently,
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:20.280]   it's very close to the functionality of Google Earth for the desktop. So that's neat.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:25.640]   Yeah. Plus it uses like the tilt sensors. So the 3D perspective will change depending on how
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:30.120]   you're holding the device. Wow. So when you're holding it flat, you're seeing basically a sky
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:34.920]   view when you sort of hold up at 90 degrees. Now you're seeing the terrain around you. Oh, that's
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:40.200]   cool. Which is good if you don't want to actually just look to the left or the right of your iPhone.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:45.880]   Assuming you're using it like in real location mode. Now on the Google phone,
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:49.800]   it's even cooler because the Google actually has a digital compass built in.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:55.560]   So if you actually just sort of turn in place, you will be able to see like street level terrain
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:00.600]   as you turn that street view, right? That's that's street view mode. Yeah. That's for that's not
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:05.800]   Google Earth. That's Google Maps with street view. Oh, I'm sorry. Again, my confusing. It does.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:11.560]   It does have a mode. It'll it'll it'll integrate. It is the first thing on the G one that kind of
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:17.640]   maybe wish that that that the that the iPhone had a built-in compass. Well, I'm a barcode reader,
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:22.680]   which the iPhone can ever do because it doesn't focus. Yeah. Oh, that barcode reader is
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:27.160]   also read or hadn't I literally was like, Oh, I think I need to buy exactly. And that's
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:32.040]   and unfortunately, that's like the only application of that kind for the G one, the only one that
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:37.080]   makes such a compelling demo that someone doesn't want to give the phone back to you. Well, but that's
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:40.520]   going to change because you know, there there's suddenly applications flooding into the store.
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:44.280]   Today I got up this morning. I always check every morning on the new apps and there were like 30
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:49.160]   new apps. And by the way, watch out iPhone because there's four new tip apps. Merlin's
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:54.200]   Merlin's spinning in his grave, four new tip calculators, and there's two new flashlight apps.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:58.680]   So the G phone has everything. I can't take that platform seriously and
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:02.200]   build this an application that let's be simulate holding up a lighter at a rock show.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:08.360]   It's just a matter of time. But you know, there are there are this is this was the big question
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:14.360]   mark with the G one is are there going to are there going to be you know, is the app ecology
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.760]   environment going to be as rich as it is on the iPhone and boy, it seems to be growing very rapidly.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:24.120]   Yeah, that's the huge weakness that the iPhone has and will always have until Apple changes its
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:30.520]   policy. I mean, the G one out of the box, I think in my review, I want to make sure that it didn't
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:34.680]   like damn with fame praise. I think it's a great it has a lot of liabilities and a lot of limitations
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:39.960]   right now, but a huge amount of potential. I think that out of the box, it has it has more
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:44.600]   potential on day one that the eye than the iPhone did on day one. And that's just because of the way
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:50.440]   it's attitude towards apps. I agree. You know, I'm really I'm on the fence. I now have an iPhone
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:56.760]   and a G one sitting next to I'm actually carrying them both, which I hate to do, but they both have
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:02.120]   their merits. And and the G one is very attractive. I think if I had if I had to choose at this point,
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:06.280]   it'd be the iPhone, but it's much closer than it has any rights to right to be, I think.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:11.640]   Yeah. And if you like if you like like a mechanical clicky interface, I think the G one is the best
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:17.960]   clicky phone I have ever used so much so much so that I would actually put it. I think I do think
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:23.080]   the iPhone is way superior for everything that I want a smartphone to do. But if you again like
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:27.960]   that tactile clicky interface, I have to admit that I can there are a lot of things I can do
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.320]   faster. Yeah, just with a little track ball and with a little keypad.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:38.440]   Yeah. The fact you can expect a keyboard shortcut to anything is just amazing. You can launch any
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:43.080]   app you can launch any URL and saying I haven't I haven't really exhausted it. But I think you can
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:47.880]   also if you if you're always emailing your boss, you can essentially go, you know, alt whatever. And
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.720]   then suddenly you're looking at a black message or form for your boss. You can also with any I
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:57.320]   think it's called any cut you could put a button on the desktop. I'm gonna I've already filled up my
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:02.120]   three pains. They need more pains. But you put a button on the desktop that will direct call direct
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:07.800]   text or direct mail anybody as well. So if you if you if for instance, I put one for Twitter and I
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.560]   just press the button and I'm instantly typing to Twitter and that's and by the way, there is now
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:16.760]   a Twitter application Twitteroid. So yeah, not that this is going to become the G one phone show,
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:20.920]   but it's something to be aware of. And again, it's important for people.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:25.080]   I mean, I think that people, you know, it's it's important for Apple, you know, to pay attention to
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:28.840]   what's happening with the G one you bet. And Apple deserves a pat on the back. This this phone wouldn't
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:35.800]   exist if iPhone hadn't happened. Maybe it would have. Yeah, because I'm really good street view,
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:41.800]   though, he noticed that my Mac room is in a few other sites now, but I've taken a peek at the new
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:47.080]   2.2 firmware for the iPhone and they put those in Google Street View into the year to the new
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:52.360]   firmware to be confirmed. Yeah, that's exciting. Now it will again, because the G one has that
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:56.360]   compass. It won't have that cool feature. You can point the G one in a building and see it.
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:02.600]   You know, I don't know. Although let's think about this. I'm standing on the street looking at the
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.800]   building. Oh, cool. I could point my phone at the building and see a picture of the building.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:11.240]   For those, I think you need to orient yourself as useful. Right. I know I get myself turned around a
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:17.800]   lot trying to figure out is it on this corner? I want this for Japan. Yeah, I'm, you know, I'm
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:23.640]   trying to figure all that out right now. I mean, it's I would like to have a lot more tools like that.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:29.720]   You know, I think that some of the new updates for 2.2 look pretty exciting, you know, as far as
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:33.720]   being able to handle mass transit and stuff, since that's that's in beta right now. Do we have any
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:39.560]   idea when that will be out? I don't know. I think they went through the second level of beta.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:45.880]   Is that right? Yeah. So probably before the end of the year, I imagine, but getting public transit
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.720]   walking direction. So Andy, you think that the I saw your Twitter go by you think that it's mostly a
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:55.080]   safety issue is why they're not giving us turn by turn? I'm just trying to guess as to why they're
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:25:01.160]   not giving regular like car nav turn by turn directions. I do think that this is a case of the
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:07.720]   arc the way the iPhone is set up. You can't you're always you're in your nav mode and then you want,
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:12.440]   Oh, Jesus podcast kind of stings. I want to switch to a Twitter cast to a Twitter cast. And then you
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:17.560]   go back and go to the the iPod app maker switch come back. And unfortunately, your nav app
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:23.400]   is it still going to have a lock? I know that it's an Apple app, but with a third party app,
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:30.120]   be able to hold the GPS hold the GPS location, hold your tracking information, or with a third
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:34.600]   party app, then have to essentially start again from from from square one. And here you are doing
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:39.880]   65 miles per hour down I 95 and trying to of course, you're not supposed to, you know,
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:43.400]   operate things while you're driving. But of course, you're going to operate things while driving.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:48.040]   I don't think it's a technical issue so much as someone's someone an Apple saying, there's so
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:54.680]   we don't understand what our liability would be. If someone designed someone designed an app that
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:26:00.360]   either got somebody lost based on GPS information that the iPhone itself was delivering to the app,
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:05.800]   or if there was something about our architecture that made it not work as well as Tom Tom Tom on
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:11.240]   the on a blackberry or any other device. Because I'm looking for technical reasons why
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:17.160]   that can't happen. Excuse me, why a turn by turn nav app will not work. I'm not finding it.
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:21.880]   I'm looking for like a licensing and a legal reason why it wouldn't work. And there are reasons
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:29.640]   why Google will not I believe that Google's terms of use even to people who are using the API says
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:34.840]   you cannot use this map data in order to build turn by turn directions. That's fine. But Tom Tom
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:39.800]   doesn't Tom Tom doesn't use that Tom Tom will just upload a gigabyte worth of local map information
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:44.520]   into your device. So that's not a problem. That's what that's what I want more than anything else.
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:49.080]   I don't really care about the turn by turn. You know what I really want is like when I have a GPS
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:53.720]   signal, I want to be able to know where I'm at on a map. I was driving up to one and I ended up
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:58.360]   lost and not be able to I can't I didn't have a cell connection, which means that I don't I can't
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:02.280]   figure out you know I can see a dot in the middle of my screen. I just don't know where that dot is.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:08.360]   You know, I I'd be happy to give a one gigabyte of my phone to a local map of the United States.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:15.960]   Yeah, especially with POIs and other like local information. There's a GPS app that allows you to
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:23.000]   I believe allows you to download like NGS topo maps and like hiking maps and that sort of stuff.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   I really think that someone needs to build an absolute kick butt GPS map for the GPS phone.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.120]   Ah, goodness gracious. I'm taking another drink of something here.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:36.520]   Have some brains on it. You know, that's funny. Even the G one even the G one doesn't have turn
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:40.920]   by turn. When we say turn by turn, we're talking about, you know, kind of this GPS, you know,
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:46.200]   these these dashboards DPS. Yeah, intersection onto Breyer Street. I have even I bought the
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:52.280]   demo's hopper voice for my Tom Tom. Look out for the lizard. Exactly.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:28:01.240]   You're turning left and when you arrive, you don't want to be here, man. Why would anybody want to
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:08.120]   be here? It's really interesting. There's also a GLADOS, a user generated GLADOS one that lies
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:12.200]   that says turn left when you're supposed to turn right. It also says there's cake.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:21.560]   Swag next boat grab turn left. I have to say, having a that kind of customizability is really,
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.280]   really cool. I'd like that's the kind of thing you'd expect to see in a phone.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:29.080]   You know, that kind of because it's a computer with much more functionality and
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:32.440]   downloadability, you don't need to go to a computer and hook it up and USB it over.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:37.080]   I got to say that even without the turn by turn directions, the iPhone is one of the better
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:41.640]   navigators that I have on my dashboard. I have a I still have the Garmin when I when I don't know
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:45.560]   where I'm driving to in it's an hour and a half drive. I do have the Garmin Nuvi up on the dash,
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:51.240]   but I also have a and so that'll give me the turn by turn stuff. But when I need to get an answer
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:57.320]   to the question of G is I 95 coming up or not or you know, what is is a traffic head? I'm not
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:01.480]   looking at the new at the Nuvi screen. I'm looking at the iPhone screen. It's just one of the
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:08.040]   prettiest navigator interfaces I've ever seen. And again, I do have $75 in my wallet just waiting
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:12.360]   for the first company that does a good like car dashboard navigator app for the iPhone.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:16.120]   Right. It's really strange that none of them have actually come forward though. You would have
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:20.600]   thought, you know, I think I remember hearing that Tom Tom said they were already well on the
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.640]   way. Yeah, I mean, I'm sure everybody's developed it, but you got to get it passed to Apple and
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:29.480]   Apple says in their SDK rules. No, but that's it. That's a look. That's a big hammer that these
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:35.560]   companies have in their in their pockets. They can go both them and the and the sling box people.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.880]   They have these apps. They are champing at the bit to release it. And I think I've said this before.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:45.400]   I'm wondering when what will happen when these guys decide that, look, what if we were to endorse
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:49.880]   jail broke phones? What if we were to basically say we are the jail broke phone condors someone?
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:54.520]   We're going to legitimize every tool that involves putting custom apps on the thing.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:58.760]   We are going to give you, sirs. We're going to we're going to we're going to give like the
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:03.880]   the Pwnage program, the Pwnage team. We're going to fund you to the tune of $150,000 a year
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:07.800]   so that you can have enough time to basically turn this into a professional product because
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:11.640]   we have apps that we want to sell. We have no ability to sell it right now,
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:16.440]   but we're tired of Apple, you know, telling us what to do until it's what not to do.
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:21.960]   Let's talk about some of the other features of 2.2. I really like public transit and walking
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:29.160]   directions in the maps. Huge. Yep. How many people said I go? That's more important than
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:34.040]   knowing where to drive. I mean, if you're in New York or Tokyo or, you know, many of these other
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:39.320]   places, I need to know how to, you know, where to get the next. I was going to say how many people
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:45.400]   here have bought like New York City transit apps and San Francisco bar apps just because,
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:49.880]   hey, I'm heading there this weekend and I could either get this map for free that works great or
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:56.040]   I could spend $1.99 and have it all on one device. And I have to point out the ultimate Apple web
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:03.240]   blog has a screenshot of the firmware including and I'm really hoping this is this is a rumor.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:10.120]   This is a rumor that there will be podcasts in iTunes. And by the way, I'm really pleased with
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:17.560]   the screenshot that they use, which is of Mac break weekly. That would be fantastic news.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:23.000]   That would be maybe that's why they said the podcaster app shouldn't exist.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.240]   But boy, this is this is really, really important, I think, for us, don't you?
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:35.160]   Yeah, I mean, being able to play that stuff directly. I mean, I just, you know, that's, you know,
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:39.880]   it's just it after the application that got blocked came out, it became more and more
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:43.000]   clear of how much I really want to just be able to listen to stuff without having to.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.360]   It looks good. I mean, it looks good. Well, we'll hope that that's the case. I mean,
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:54.760]   what I'm looking at is basically the same interface as before with iTunes, but there's a button
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:32:03.160]   that says get more episodes. So if you're already listening to an episode of same Mac break weekly,
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:09.880]   you press the button get more episodes and you would get more episodes. That would be huge.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:13.320]   That's the way they've gone down the road with the Apple TV at the last release, isn't it?
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:17.320]   Because they sort of broke the mold in that you didn't have to subscribe to the Apple TV to listen
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:21.640]   to a watch to podcasts. You can actually stream them live and it just makes a whole difference
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.560]   to to what you consume as regards podcast. It just makes it so easy. It's very much an
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.840]   on demand service, pick and choose and then just watch what you want. You don't have to plan in
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:32.280]   advance and just stream them to have that on the iPhone. That'd be great.
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:37.480]   That is that is a tip that's always worked. All the way back to 1.0. If you go into Safari and
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:44.200]   you use Safari reader to bookmark the XML feed for podcast, it will give you a list of episodes.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:49.080]   You can tap an episode name and it will stream that episode to you live. But this is that won't
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:55.240]   help you when you're on a plane. Other rumors, according to Apple Blogs, David, Apple Yard,
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:33:01.640]   location sharing via email. That would be useful. Hi, I'm here. Click this link. You'll see a map
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:06.520]   of where I am in directions and SDK support for manipulating line in audio.
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:09.640]   What would that be for recording?
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:14.360]   It would give you an absolute ability to record.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:20.440]   Are we talking about adjusting line levels, things like that? Basically getting a better
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:27.160]   quality recording? Maybe. Yeah. You'd have you'd have. Can you record now on the iPhone? Yeah.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:32.680]   They're playing only a recorder. Do you have access to the mic, Jack, though, right now?
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.680]   Yeah, this is a little application.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:40.120]   This would just make it more that they could control the levels and stuff like that, I guess.
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:48.280]   iPhone software, according to Arnold Kim, looking to iPhone, Helis, a Greek
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:52.840]   iPhone shot showing a screenshot asking for a rating before you delete an application.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:59.400]   The G1 phone does that when you delete an application and says, "Why? Why? Why? Tell me why?" It's a little
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:07.400]   annoying. You see that scene in Lifetime made for TV movies. I'll change.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:16.840]   You're going to be in the end of a year to miss me when I'm gone.
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:22.920]   There's been quite a lot of chatter on Twitter this week about there's a service called Quitter.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.360]   I don't think you've seen that. I use it.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:27.560]   I stopped using it. I couldn't take it anymore.
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:31.160]   People stopped following you. I haven't received one yet.
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:39.880]   There weren't many, but those that did, they really cut you to the chase.
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.880]   Do they come from Twitter?
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:45.560]   Yeah. Well, basically you get the name of the person.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.080]   I must have misconfigured it.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.360]   Oh, right. No, you get the name of the person that's followed you.
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:55.240]   And also you get the last tweet that you did as well. So you can work out what it was.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.640]   Or you can try and work out what it was. You said they'd offended somebody.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:00.200]   But of course, people just don't follow people for lots of different reasons.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:07.240]   Oh, all you have to do is go on there and say, "I support Apple in their fight against Prop 8."
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.360]   And you'll get 100 unfollows. I could try it right now.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:13.240]   Just to see.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:16.680]   I've seen so many people start to use the service.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:20.440]   Use it for a couple of days. I'm not using that anymore. It's too emotional.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:26.520]   There's a standard five warning signs you might be an alcoholic.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:29.960]   I think we need to have five warning signs you might be a Twitter-holic
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:35.720]   just because we can say, number three, if you use this service, you know what?
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:38.840]   It's not the only one. There's two that do this, by the way.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:45.880]   So I guess nobody's just, nobody's unfollowing me. They just all love me.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:47.640]   We all love you.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.680]   All 60,000 of them.
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:49.560]   Oh, you're almost to 60.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.640]   Almost to 60,000, but Barak's over 100,000. And Kevin Rose, he's so great.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.520]   It's just naws and naws and naws that you doesn't.
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.760]   What does it take? Do I have to run for president? Is that what you're telling me?
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:06.120]   Kevin Rose, who's also ahead of me, says we're close. We're neck and neck. He's being very generous.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.480]   He's like 20,000 above.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.000]   Now, what side are you using for those rankings?
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.840]   There's Twitter-holic is the old one, but the one I like is Twitter.
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:19.180]   I think Twitter counter Twitter counter.
[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:20.200]   Because.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.380]   >> Twitter counter.
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:24.340]   >> I did not think this is important.
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:25.900]   It's not important to me.
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:26.960]   It's just.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:27.960]   >> No.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.260]   >> That's the time when I go to Twitter haul it just to make sure that you're getting
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:31.180]   your your do.
[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:32.220]   >> Thank you.
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.480]   >> So I want to make sure that you get your recognition.

[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:46.080]   in the New York Times, more followers than this service and I'm on the list.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.620]   >> Yeah, well don't use Twitter haul it.
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:50.000]   Use Twitter counter.com.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   Let me see.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.680]   I'm going to they have an list the global top 100 most popular Twitter users.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:57.680]   I like that list.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:58.680]   One of the things Twitter.
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.680]   >> That's much better than most followers.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:01.680]   I want most popular.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.680]   >> Global most popular.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:03.680]   >> Most beloved.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:06.880]   >> And they even tell you like how much you're adding a day so that you could see how fast
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.880]   you're going.
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.040]   Princess you know Obama's adding 841 a day.
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:11.040]   He's now up to 108,000.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.720]   I'm never going to catch him.
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:13.720]   Kevin Rose.
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.520]   He's up to almost 70,000.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:18.280]   He's adding 347 a day.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.600]   I'm almost 60,000 but I'm only adding 154.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:21.880]   I'm never going to catch up with.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.560]   I'm losing.

[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.120]   >> Mm.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.720]   >> See that's why this would be useful.
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:39.440]   I mean there's you know there's some value to kind of this kind of thing.
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.760]   Let me search for Andy and not co.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:45.440]   You're just I H and A T K O right?
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:49.360]   >> And let's be fair you know what is your tax strategy.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.840]   >> I make less than $50,000 a year.
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:57.640]   Will my tax rate increase if I follow you as a Twitter for.
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:58.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.880]   You know I think it all comes down to that thing about saying announcing your VP in nominee
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.280]   is going to be on the on the Twitter.
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:07.280]   I think people are following now because they want to they want to they want to follow them
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.280]   on November 4th.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.280]   Wouldn't it be great.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.040]   I mean this is not going to happen.
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:15.520]   But here would be a blow a striking a blow for transparency if he you know twit tweets
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.520]   during the day.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:21.440]   Sean I voted oh man at my stomach is jumping watching the early polls.
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:22.840]   Oh I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:28.400]   Oh boy thinking about defense secretary but I don't know it'd be fun if he actually did
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.400]   all that.
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.000]   >> More fun if he did it while I was president.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.760]   >> Yeah in the office.
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:34.480]   >> Where's the bathroom?
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:39.280]   >> What's this locked door?
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:44.320]   Oh man the White House Network blocks Hulu dot com.
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:48.360]   >> Just once just once I want the secret service to show up when I'm ready for a meeting.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.520]   >> That would be funny.
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:55.680]   So you have 10,571 followers according to Twitter counter you added 131 cents yesterday your

[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:04.680]   >> No I have I have an important rule I never ask people I'm happy I'm happy to have people
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.200]   following me I will never ask people to follow me.
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:11.040]   >> You had a big jump though yet but this is the biggest jump you've ever had I think
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.480]   in the last day.
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:13.480]   What did you do?
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:18.760]   >> Well I don't know like right doesn't it doesn't include things today because today
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:24.760]   I had an idea of doing the Twitter version of match game 76 where I just I just like
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:29.800]   have the first line of something and someone has to reply and it's a reply and give it
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:34.640]   to the my current status is time for another round of Twitter match game 76.
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:41.520]   >> Dinosaurs don't have lips that's why blank and so far I've got about 20 or 30.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:43.680]   20 or 30 good replies.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:45.680]   >> Wow that's what.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:49.620]   >> That's that's that's that's something pretty cool one of them is nice and Scott
[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.520]   born is here hey Scott.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.520]   >> Hello Skypates me.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:59.080]   >> I'm the usual don't worry just hate it back that's what I do.
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:04.200]   I was sitting here thinking well why hasn't Leo called me I did I was sitting here thinking
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:06.520]   why isn't Leo even showing up on my skydide.
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.520]   >> Oh.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:11.000]   >> Well I was watching and you had some pretty girl in your studio and I heard you say something
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.600]   about going to get T so I thought maybe you're blowing it off.
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:17.480]   >> Oh no no that was a twit from a to that was Sarah Lane and twit from two days ago
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:24.680]   by the way weird kind of thing on twit we had Sarah Lane on from revision three and Kevin
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:30.280]   Rose just calls in who I guess is I don't know is he the boss at revision three I mean
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.680]   he owns it.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:37.200]   >> I'm latter back to CEO so I guess he's the boss but Kevin owns it so we out rank some
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:42.440]   anyway Kevin calls in says hey this is exciting you know we're going to do we're going to
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:48.360]   do the dig reel on Tuesday or Wednesday everybody watch the next day they fire Sarah they fire
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:52.880]   Martin Sergeant they cancel a bunch of shows they cancel to pixel perfect and I see I know
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:57.320]   it's a lot of people Alex are saying why don't pixel course should take it back but you were
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:59.480]   producing it for revision three weren't you.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.480]   >> You were producing it for revision three it wasn't it wasn't our show it was always
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:03.480]   their show.
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.480]   >> Somebody should bring it.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:12.040]   >> I'm trying to figure that out we had like I had like a hundred requests yesterday literally
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:16.240]   a hundred a hundred and something or other to do something with pixel perfect so I'm going
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.240]   to figure it out.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:20.640]   >> Well one of the reasons Sarah was here is actually we were talking about but the problem
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:26.200]   is with the global economic meltdown I'm kind of nervous about doing any hiring or spending
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.200]   any money.
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:32.720]   At the same time here's two people on the street who I would kill to have Martin and Martin
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:33.720]   Sergeant.
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:36.120]   >> I saw that I was like what kind of show can we.
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:39.680]   >> I don't even do a video so that's the problem is I'm only doing the live streaming
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:46.240]   video and it's anyway Sarah and I are talking I think I can work out a way to bring them
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:49.200]   into the into some time maybe maybe the two of us.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.600]   >> Is this me that I should have someone else start my car for the next couple months.
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:53.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:58.000]   >> I have a plan there's going to be a little bit of a big week.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   >> See my whole theory on the global meltdown is you spend everything you've got now before
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.040]   it becomes worthless later.
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.040]   >> Is that your theory?
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:09.760]   >> Yeah I just I'm buying a new truck I'm buying all new all new camera anything I can.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:13.440]   >> We have cash we have you know like six months operating cash sitting here.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:17.600]   >> Well see if we have the situation that Alex is familiar with and Zimbabwe where you
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.720]   need a wheelbarrow of it to get a hamburger.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.240]   >> Now yeah it might as well you might as well spend it now because you're going to need
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:26.280]   a thousand wheelbarrows to get that same thing you know 10 days from now.
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:27.280]   >> I really I really.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.840]   >> That's what I'm telling my what.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:30.960]   >> I don't know what to do.
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.160]   >> But see that's what provisions three is doing and what a lot of sensible companies
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:39.400]   are doing Jason Calicanis wrote this memo that leaked out I guess it wasn't a leaked
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:43.200]   out but it was his email newsletter about why Mahalo is laying off people and it's to
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:47.840]   get more runway you know you've got a certain amount of cash and you want to slow your burn
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:51.720]   rate down slow the amount of money you spend every month down so that you can survive
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:55.240]   because the key for everybody at this point including ice is to it and I'm sure Pixel
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:59.920]   Core Alex is making it through to the other side of this slow down.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:03.360]   >> That's actually we're not really experiencing a slow down so we're.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:05.480]   >> We aren't either but I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:10.840]   >> Well but the thing is we provide low we provide high quality low cost video production
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:15.280]   and we're actually having clients come in doubling and tripling orders for next year
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:19.080]   because they're firing the companies that are more costly.
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:21.400]   >> We're not sure.
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:24.560]   >> I think all our advertising contracts end at the end of the year.
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:29.160]   So we're maybe not all of them but all but one I think end at the end of the year so
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:36.000]   we're just waiting to hear if they all renew then I hire but if they don't I don't know.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.400]   >> Isn't that weird how like the economy has flip flopped a lot of different jobs.
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:45.080]   I've often reflected upon the fact that if I hit major journalism and been hired as
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:49.000]   like a full time reporter at a newspaper I probably would have either been laid off or
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.320]   accepted a five or six years ago.
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:54.880]   The fact that I freelance means that I am more probably more valuable to the places
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:58.440]   I write for than I ever have been.
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:02.280]   >> And yet you see stories like the New York Times you know running out of money.
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:06.600]   I mean it's just it's a very scary time for print.
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:08.880]   >> Well I think you're fine because you write.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.040]   See I think anybody creates contents okay.
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.040]   >> Right.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:15.280]   >> The people are in trouble are people like me who are trying to build a business around
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.680]   content where you don't know if there'll be any revenue next year.
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:22.520]   >> Well but then again people don't have to invest like 8.1 million dollars into getting
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:23.520]   your show on the air.
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:24.520]   >> No we're cheap.
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:29.600]   >> In terms of like getting advertising I mean if I were if I had a business that was
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.720]   not you know if I did not have a brand new brand of shaving cream to promote if I had
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:38.120]   a more modest business you know I can get a lot more bang for my buck out of shows like
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.120]   yours.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:40.120]   >> Of course you can.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:45.280]   Just the fact that I have so many Twitter followers if I decided to start self-publishing
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:50.840]   books I think I could make a fairly good living just writing books not forcing people
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:54.760]   to buy up and simply saying here's something it's on the iPhone store buck 99.
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:55.760]   >> Yeah you're right.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:56.760]   >> If you like it buy it if you don't.
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:02.000]   >> Oh there's all sorts of way I'm not worried about me personally there's all sorts of ways.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.960]   I would keep I would keep this enterprise alive we have enough money to keep it alive no
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:11.200]   matter what but but it's just a question of can we expand is this a good time to expand.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:12.200]   That's my question.
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:16.280]   >> I still think that I think that especially for niche niche markets you know I think that
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:17.800]   makes a lot it still makes a lot of sense.
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.760]   >> I was higher Sarah and I'm Martin I mean those guys are great the problem is we also
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:24.320]   we don't do any video and this is why by the way where I revision three is cutting back
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:29.440]   because they do the much more expensive video downloads those are very very costly they
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:34.040]   can't afford see I can afford to keep doing shows that don't have huge numbers because
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:38.440]   they cost nothing to make but videoed cost a lot to me.
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.440]   >> You can.
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:42.480]   >> Yeah you make it cheap.
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:47.640]   >> I think you're right about the right thing Leo because all startups have to worry about
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:50.920]   their runway and there's a lot of startups that are really good right now there's a ton
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:56.160]   of startups out there with great ideas and they're all kind of on hold because well you
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:57.720]   know there's nobody.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:01.720]   Well there's money there that's the misnomer there is a ton of money it's just that people
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:07.800]   are scared and they're sitting on it and you know it's the thing is is that once again
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:12.320]   I you just look at all these investments a lot of them are tied up in these T bills because
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.280]   they're safe.
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:18.400]   But as soon as people start getting those statements and go congratulations you made
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:23.480]   0.22% on your investment this month they're going to you know what that's not quite what
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:24.960]   I was looking for.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:29.960]   >> We're going to talk about the Macbook Pro and now two weeks in and get some reviews
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:34.960]   on Macalester has some thoughts about the display port and also snow leopard we're learning
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:39.560]   more about snow leopard which is good because we can contrast it now to what we're learning
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:47.560]   from Microsoft this week has unveiled Windows 7 and we'll talk a little bit about snow leopard
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:52.440]   versus Windows 7 because Windows 7 code name this didn't work.
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:57.640]   >> You know it's funny because Microsoft essentially with what they've said about Windows 7 and
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:03.280]   the fact that most people think it will come out this time next year August of 2009 that's
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:06.520]   pretty much Microsoft saying don't buy Vista.
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:07.520]   >> Yeah.
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:08.520]   >> Stop.
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:12.920]   Wait we've got something better for you and I think Vista sales are going to drop off
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:17.480]   the map I guess people will still buy new computers with Vista but if you're I mean business
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:19.920]   isn't going to upgrade to Vista now they're going to wait for Windows 7.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:23.400]   Anyway we'll talk about that in just a little bit and why snow leopard should make you all
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:27.000]   very very excited but before we do that I want to mention our good friends.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.080]   >> Audible.com they're still with us they still care they still love us.
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:36.800]   Audible.com/Macbreak is the place to go for your free audio book actually what you get
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:42.600]   is a credit not to say this I have to qualify this you get a credit toward a book free and
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:46.600]   the reason I mention this is one of the books we recommend Anitham is so damn long it takes
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:50.960]   to I think it takes two credits because it's like you know huge but generally most books
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:54.960]   are one a single credit and some great stuff I've just started Legacy of Ashes which might
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:48:03.380]   be two credits because it is the entire history of the CIA starting in 1946 and it's mind
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:12.200]   boggling story all true all very carefully, conscientiously researched first person stuff.
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:15.200]   That's a great choice do you have of Andy you always have a book I don't want to preem
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.200]   to your recommendations.
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:20.760]   >> No, no as my fact I still haven't finished like the book that I got the last book I got
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:24.520]   and I do try to make sure that I'm recommending books I've actually read or I've read enough
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:29.320]   up so I'm actually going to re recommend to the stars the autobiography of Starks Mr.
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:34.800]   Sulu and it's especially the way we open the show it sounds like I'm being snarky and it
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:38.680]   sounds like I'm being oh isn't this kitchen can't be fun but it actually is a very very
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:45.560]   good book I first read it in hardback because there's a wonderful chain of salvage stores
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:49.520]   and New England called Billy 19 and for two years time every two months they'd get a new
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:54.800]   Star Trek autobiography and so yeah for Buck 99 I would buy all of them and read them and
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:58.520]   can't be campiness but that was the first one that actually George DeKay's autobiography
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:02.640]   was the first one that actually read like a really great compelling autobiography.
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.560]   >> Now don't confuse it with Elrond Hubbard's to the stars.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:08.640]   >> No, you'll get a very different story.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:11.560]   I mean because DeKay has led.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:13.200]   [LAUGH]
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:19.360]   >> Yes, it's basically some people played Star Trek some people lived Star Trek.
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:25.720]   But a combination there's a two there could be some sort of gay alien being who comes to
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:27.560]   American becomes a TV star or something.
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:30.680]   No wait a minute that really happened never mind.
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:33.240]   >> Now come on.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:36.880]   >> All I want to say is that he did lead a really really interesting life.
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:37.880]   >> I want to read it.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:40.760]   You know I you've recommended it before and I forgot.
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:43.440]   >> It starts with his childhood and internment camp.
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:44.440]   >> Oh really?
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.440]   >> Wow.
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:46.440]   >> Exactly.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:52.800]   >> First generation American citizens his parents are emigrated from Japan and of course
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:53.960]   that was during World War II.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:50:00.680]   He spent a number of years in internment camps from being a studious and hard working actor
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:04.560]   to in a situation where his parents were supportive but clearly would have been very, very happy
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:08.360]   if he went to college for a different degree than theater.
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:12.040]   Yes, you do get lots of interesting stuff about Star Trek and lots of good dirt about
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:16.520]   Shatner which is at least two dollars and fifty cents of the purchase price of any Star
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:20.760]   Trek biography or about a biography is bad stories about William Shatner and it definitely
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:21.760]   delivers.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:22.760]   >> That's kind of disappointing.
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:25.920]   I always thought Shatner would be a cool kid cool guy to know.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:26.920]   >> Really?
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:29.840]   >> Was he a bit of a prima Donna?
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:31.960]   >> A bit of a prima Donna.
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:35.320]   >> William Shatner don't you know why it's?
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:41.400]   >> No, no I think anyone who's seen Star Trek 2 Star Trek 2 has two of the most hyper atomic
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:45.160]   powered over acting performances ever committed to film but you know what?
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:49.560]   You'll like Ricardo Montelbon and you want to hang out with Ricardo Montelbon with Shatner
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:53.760]   you know that this is just the best he can do.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:51:01.160]   But the audiobook is good is also good because again, one of the reasons why people so enjoy
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:07.640]   doing a George De K accent is that it's such a rich old theater like theater teacher sort
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:12.520]   of voice that's very very soothing and very very malefolous in which every single syllable
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:17.040]   is considered and applied exactly the way that it should be applied.
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:21.400]   So again, you know go in there for the bad stories about William Shatner stick with it
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:25.320]   because it really is a very great autobiography of a working actor.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:26.720]   >> Looks like they only have the unabridged version.
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:32.360]   Let me play a little bit of George De K to the stars just so you can hear this voice.
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:34.360]   >> In Los Angeles.
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:41.320]   >> The convention was a tribute to Gene Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek.
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:46.160]   >> The truth is the word so the entire program was an expression of our affection for an
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:50.040]   artist visionary who had touched so many.
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:56.400]   But there was a hint of melancholy that day for Gene had been ill for a long time.
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:52:02.680]   Over the past year, we had watched as he was assaulted by a series of strokes.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:04.400]   He was now in a wheelchair.
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:09.920]   >> Well, he really does get every ounce of drama out of every word, doesn't he?
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:16.160]   >> I would have to put my iPod on like 1.5 speed in order to listen to that.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:17.160]   >> I think it's great.
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:21.040]   I love George De K. >> Now you go go go kids with your My Spaces
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:26.920]   and your blog spots and your flared trousers and your unconventional lifestyles.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:27.920]   This is acting damage.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.240]   >> This is actually- >> Now wait a minute.
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:32.880]   I think it's elegant and I think it's eloquent and I think it's interesting.
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:35.440]   I just think it's too- >> Darn.
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:36.440]   >> Slow.
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:37.440]   >> You're in a hurry.
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.760]   He's a man in a hurry, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:42.280]   >> I got four audiobooks I got to listen to.
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:44.360]   That's going to take the place of three of them.
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:48.720]   >> If the Spartans were read at that speed, well, you'd never finish.
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:51.560]   >> I always have gray hair by the time it was done.
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:56.520]   >> But I just, I think the Spartans would be instead of eight hours, it'd be 16 hours.
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:59.680]   >> It's only a three hour audiobook.
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:03.320]   You're not going to get sick of it.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:04.640]   It's only three hours.
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:05.640]   Maybe that's why they abridged it.
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.640]   >> It's a bridge, that's why.
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:10.360]   >> They said we just don't have enough tape for you, Mr. Soothe.
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:14.240]   >> He's so popular now because of heroes.
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:16.840]   So I would think it would- >> Is he out of heroes?
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:17.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:18.840]   >> That's neat.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:19.840]   >> Oh, that's right.
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:22.640]   He's kind of like the- >> A little squeaky guy's father.
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:23.880]   >> Yeah, he died though.
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:25.720]   Well, you may have come on and off.
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:26.720]   I'm sorry about that.
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:28.720]   >> Dying on heroes doesn't mean a thing.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:30.920]   >> Yeah, we're going back into another show, really.
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:32.120]   >> Kind of like lost.
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.120]   >> Yeah.
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:34.120]   >> It's kind of like lost.
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.640]   >> Should I watch Fringe?
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:36.640]   >> No.
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:37.640]   I like it.
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:38.640]   >> Oh, I gave up on it.
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:39.640]   >> There you go.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:40.640]   Two opposites.
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.200]   I enjoy it.
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:44.160]   >> It's an iTunes download on the front of the side.
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:47.240]   Well, anyway, we know- >> It's like a new X file.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:49.080]   It's like an updated X files.
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:50.080]   That's kind of the- >> I think that.
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:54.560]   >> In my- >> There you go.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:59.560]   >> Well, we do love Mr. Sulu to the stars, the autobiography of Star Trek's Mr.
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:00.560]   Sulu.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:03.600]   That's our audio book recommendation of the week.
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:08.080]   Make sure you check it out at audible.com/macbreak.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:12.240]   If you're not listening to audiobooks on Audible, you're missing out on a world of entertainment.
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:13.640]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:15.680]   We thank you so much for the support.
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:18.520]   Mac Break Weekly.
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:22.840]   So Don sent me a note saying, "Hey, I'd really like to talk about DisplayPort.
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:27.600]   We've now had our MacBook Pros for a couple of weeks, some of us.
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:29.120]   I'm still loving mine.
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:30.680]   I just love the feel of it.
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:37.040]   It just feels like a solid, but not solid, like a Panasonic Toughbook kind of solid, but
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:39.800]   a kind of an elegant, solid machine.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:41.160]   I'm loving the keyboard.
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:42.640]   I'm loving the screen.
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:46.280]   I know it's glossy, but- >> And I am getting fingerprints on it, but
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:48.360]   I still- I just think it's gorgeous.
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.440]   >> What about the trackpad?
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:52.440]   >> You know, there's some weird stuff going on with the trackpad.
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:56.120]   Kevin Rose tweeted this, and I had to say it's my experience too, that sometimes you'll
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:55:00.120]   click on the trackpad and it doesn't- if you click by pushing, I use the tap method
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:04.960]   mostly, but if you click by pushing, sometimes it doesn't seem to notice it.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:08.760]   And what- the best I can determine is that it's where you click on the trackpad that
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:11.320]   matters, and if you're clicking all the way to the left, you're fine.
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:13.320]   >> Well, here's- >> And here's my problem.
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:15.640]   So I got- I ordered mine on day one.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:19.800]   I took a few days extra to get mine, because I got it from the Apple store online as opposed
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:21.560]   to picking it up.
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:22.560]   And it's beautiful.
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:23.560]   I love everything about it.
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:24.960]   I love the screen, love the keyboard.
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:26.320]   It's blazingly fast.
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:29.200]   I got the 2.8 gigahertz processor.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.200]   Everything's cool.
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:34.280]   And then all of a sudden, the cursor just starts scrolling across the screen.
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:35.280]   I don't even have- >> So I'm good.
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:36.280]   >> -- enhance on the computer.
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:38.520]   >> You've got a booger on the trackpad, man.
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:41.280]   >> Yeah, you know, and then it does it intermittently.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:44.560]   I call Apple, they're going, "Well, yeah, we have had a couple of problems like that,
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:46.200]   so I'm sending mine back today."
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:53.040]   >> I find myself having sort of just a conceptual problem with the trackpad, that I'm used to
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:56.600]   having the strongest finger in the hand is the thumb.
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:59.520]   Use that to basically hold on my old MacBook.
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:01.120]   Use that to hold down the trackpad button.
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:05.360]   And then your other fingers can lightly dance on the trackpad and move the pointer around.
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:10.440]   I'm finding it's difficult to maintain pressure downward and still slide up, down, left and
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:11.440]   right.
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:12.440]   I just find that awkward.
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:16.680]   Then again, I've been using trackpads the exact same way for what, seven, eight, nine years
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:17.680]   now.
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:20.040]   >> Why do they have to go and screw with something that's just perfect already?
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:23.120]   Because Steve hates buttons.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:27.400]   >> And I really do think they're trying to wean us off of the separate button model for
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:32.280]   the trackpad so that they can integrate a touchpad at some future date very, very easily.
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:34.280]   >> Oh, yeah, that's a guess.
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:35.280]   >> That's a guess.
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:36.280]   But I see that happening.
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:38.280]   >> Oh, yeah, I gotta say.
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:44.360]   I used immediately the same way as I use my old MacBook with my thumb resting where the
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:45.360]   button would be.
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:48.560]   And I click in the same place just because there's no separate mechanism seems to work
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:49.560]   okay.
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:52.200]   So it's not bothered me yet.
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:53.200]   Go ahead, Alex.
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:54.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:57.080]   >> I would just be glad you have an on and off button.
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:58.080]   >> Yes.
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:00.080]   >> Steve doesn't like any button.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:04.920]   >> Yeah, so we have a really search for the on off button on this thing too.
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:05.920]   >> Well, it's right there.
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:06.920]   What are you talking about?
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:10.360]   >> I mean, it's just kind of perfectly recessed and all the way.
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:11.360]   >> Yeah, it's beautiful.
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:12.360]   It's fitting finishes.
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:13.360]   >> I understand.
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:17.360]   I'm just saying that I kind of miss just, I went back to my air when I realized that
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:20.280]   my MacBook Pro was on runaway typing mode.
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:22.480]   >> Well, yeah, that's broken.
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:26.840]   >> And mine was DOA when it doesn't do it all the time though, Leo.
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:29.600]   That's the weird thing.
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:30.600]   >> Mine was DOA.
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:31.840]   It worked for the first day.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:33.880]   I guess that's not technically DOA.
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:35.480]   >> It was dying on arrival.
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:36.920]   >> It worked for the first day.
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:40.200]   Allow me just enough time to install everything and then die.
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:43.520]   >> I will say that I thought the screen was brilliant.
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:45.560]   I think that the keyboard is great.
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:48.400]   Typing was no problem when I could type.
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:53.160]   Blindingly fast and I'm really disappointed because this essentially means I'm relegated
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:57.760]   to not being able to get the new MacBook Pro until version two because I'm not taking
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:02.160]   another chance because I spent two days configuring this sucker.
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:04.480]   And I don't have two more days to reconfigure another one.
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:07.920]   So I'm going to let somebody else experiment and figure it out and then I'll get the next
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:08.920]   one.
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:11.080]   >> Now, Don, how do you like yours so far?
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:12.320]   >> Oh, I haven't got one.
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:14.280]   I decided to, again, get in one.
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:16.400]   I've stuck with my MacBook Earth for now.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:19.600]   So I was sort of wavering but decided eventually.
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:22.200]   No, I'll just hang on till January and see what comes out.
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.360]   >> I think I thought I'd bought an air.
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:26.560]   I might feel the same way, but I was due.
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:30.280]   So you had some thoughts about DisplayPort.
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:33.120]   Actually initially very positive and then you kind of thought, well, maybe not quite
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:34.120]   so much.
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:35.120]   >> Positive.
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:38.920]   It's a bit of a quandary really because I mean, I blogged about DisplayPort ages ago because
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:42.360]   I sort of saw that as the way forward for Apple and probably one of the reasons why
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:45.760]   they hadn't brought out a new range of cinema displays.
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:50.720]   And when they brought out the new 24-inch matching cinema display for the new MacBook
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:53.120]   and lo and behold, it had DisplayPort on it.
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:54.720]   I thought, oh, great.
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:59:00.880]   One of my interests is that DisplayPort is bi-directional protocol.
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:02.720]   It uses a bi-directional connection.
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:07.800]   So you can as well as sending video to a monitor, you can also pull data back across DisplayPort
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:08.800]   as well.
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:13.960]   And I sort of, I was a bit puzzled because no one had been making a song and dance about
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:17.040]   how the video from the video camera on the new cinema display and how the audio from
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:19.360]   the microphone was getting back into the MacBook.
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:22.840]   And I wondered whether or not it was the DisplayPort that was actually doing that.
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:27.280]   But since then, I've been chatting to a few people and primarily Paul Shadwell over on
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:31.440]   Twitter and sort of he said, well, he's not that sure that they'll actually be using the
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:32.840]   DisplayPort at this stage.
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:37.160]   And it might just be coming back across USB because there is a USB connection back from
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:38.160]   the cinema display.
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:39.160]   We will know when that comes out.
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:45.800]   I'm really excited because this one like cable has power, DisplayPort and USB on it.
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:49.440]   So you just put your, I think I'll get one from my MacBook, the new MacBook Pro, just
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:51.760]   because it seems like such a nice integrated solution.
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:52.760]   Yeah.
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:55.920]   It's apparently it's much higher bandwidth than HDMI.
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:57.920]   And also there is copy protection.
[00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:01.800]   I think it was discussed on a last week show with a couple of shows that, you know, to
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:05.200]   view copyright material, you need some sort of DRM or...
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.000]   HTTP, you need, yeah.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.120]   But they have got their own version of it within DisplayPort, I think.
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:13.120]   Okay.
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.640]   So we just don't know if Apple is going to implement it bidirectionally, but they will
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:17.280]   eventually, I'm sure.
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.280]   I think so.
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:21.280]   This might just be the first foray into deploying it.
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:24.880]   The only issue is that when you, most of the time when you hook up laptop to something,
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:27.480]   it's to something that wants VGA or DVI.
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:30.040]   So you got to get that special dongle.
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.040]   Maybe you got to get two because you got a one for VGA.
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:37.240]   I mean, mostly when I use my laptop in the outside world, it's so up to projectors.
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:38.240]   And...
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.240]   Cool.
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:42.600]   I still think I was a little surprised that, I mean, I just, I think that this is fine.
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:43.720]   I mean, the DisplayPort sounds great.
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:47.600]   I just wish everyone would just go to HDMI or something like that, where we just...
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.600]   Because everything reminds me of...
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:51.680]   Well, this is the successor to HDMI.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.680]   That's the theory.
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:54.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:55.680]   It's from VGA.
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:56.680]   It's from VGA.
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:57.680]   It's a...
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:58.680]   It's a standard.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:00:59.680]   Right.
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:00.680]   And it's open.
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:01.680]   Unlike HDMI, it's an open standard.
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:02.680]   Not proprietary.
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:03.680]   Right.
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:04.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:07.040]   I mean, they did go with HDMI for the Apple TV because that's primarily to connect up to
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.040]   a TV.
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.200]   So they went with the standard for that.
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:13.160]   But I think that they're probably looking at future computer displays.
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:16.640]   And also, and again, if you remember back to those paintings whereby they've got the
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:21.640]   paint for having cameras built into the actual screen with the individual pixels and things,
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.320]   they need to get data back from display.
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:29.000]   So DisplayPort gives them that ability to bring video data back from a monitor.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.120]   It means you could have a touchscreen monitor too.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:34.560]   Well, and the big question is, is if they really got into this, whether they would...
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:39.680]   I mean, if it's sending the information back and forth and if that is fast enough, the
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:45.600]   kind of speeds that are talking about here, 10.8 gigabits per second, would be enough
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.600]   to bring full...
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:50.680]   It'd be enough to bring full data back from a big camera too.
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:53.120]   You could have a high-risk camera on the thing.
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:59.000]   Well, theoretically, if high-def cameras supported this format, instead of fire...
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   You wouldn't need a...
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.160]   Well, you wouldn't need a...
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:07.840]   This is not necessarily good news for AJA or Blackmagic or companies that make conversion
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:13.240]   boxes because this would be basically a cable that could pull theoretically this really
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:20.680]   high quality data from an HDSTI port or something else from a high-end cameras could theoretically
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:25.240]   go straight into the computer because it's already in a digital form.
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:28.640]   Most of the high-definition stuff coming out is in digital form already, so it would just
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:31.920]   be a matter of figuring that out.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:36.680]   Say again, I think you've faded out there.
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:40.560]   It would just be a matter of figuring out what that data looks like when it came in.
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:43.480]   It could be a totally a software solution at that point.
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:46.600]   Maybe that's the strategy because I mean, you really get the feeling that Apple is kind
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:50.960]   of giving up bagging firewire by not putting it in the MacBook.
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:51.960]   Maybe that's the strategy.
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:52.960]   Maybe maybe...
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:55.720]   Have you seen cameras say maybe we'll use DisplayPort?
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:56.720]   Is anybody trying that?
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:00.680]   Well, the thing that's happening right now, mostly with cameras is that most of the new
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:02.920]   cameras don't have firewire.
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:06.720]   They have USB and they don't do live viewing except through the HDMI port.
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:10.280]   So they're the only way you can really see the live feeds.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:16.760]   Most of the time now, you can't really hook a new camera, a new SD card or drive-based
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:21.800]   camera to your computer via USB and just watch the video like you used to be able to
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:26.760]   do with firewire, which is still one of the reasons we use some of the older cameras as
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:29.720]   far as the little firewire cameras that we use.
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:33.360]   I like to have that ability.
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:39.120]   But you do, the HDMI coming out the back of the cameras is not only a live feed, but
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:40.760]   it is uncompressed.
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:46.400]   So the data coming out of a $500 camera with an HDMI port in the back is theoretically
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:47.400]   higher quality.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:52.640]   I mean, the lens may not be, but the signal is higher quality than a digi-baited camera.
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:57.240]   It's a very very quality data stream coming out of the back of that out of these little
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:58.520]   cameras.
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:01.480]   That's kind of the tradeoff, but they don't have a firewire.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:05.680]   So the only way to be able to watch that right now is to get something like a black magic
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:09.720]   card, which is like $250 and put it into your computer.
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:14.720]   Theoretically, if this port went both ways, they already have a cable that I believe goes
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:17.440]   from the display port to HDMI.
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:19.560]   You could theoretically go from HDMI to the display port.
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:25.280]   So you could theoretically hook one of these little cameras into the display port if it
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:28.440]   was going both ways and digitize from the camera.
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:33.800]   Now the reason that would be interesting is because Apple ProRes, your drive, internal
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:43.640]   drive on your laptop is actually fast enough to digitize Apple ProRes, but that is between
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:48.600]   five and 10 times higher quality than what you're capturing to the internal drive of
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:49.960]   these little cameras.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:54.480]   So you could get a much higher quality signal into a laptop on a set, so on and so forth.
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:58.200]   I mean, that's what we'd love to see if they enabled it.
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:00.840]   It wouldn't take very much for them to do that.
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:05.160]   So I know I just kind of went deep into the...
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.160]   But that's why we love you.
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:13.080]   I've heard this with explanation from Alex so many times that I actually understand it
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.080]   now.
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.560]   Hey, Scott, you've plugged your mic again.
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.240]   You're on your room, Mike.
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:18.800]   Oh, correct.
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:24.480]   Is it because you like, lean back in appreciation of what Alex is saying and then go in the
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.480]   thing pulls...
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:27.480]   He leans back because he's like, "Oh, here he goes again.
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:28.480]   I'm not going to listen to this."
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:29.480]   Fell over.
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.560]   He's not going to edit.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:32.560]   It's just my...
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:33.560]   The bottom line.
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:34.560]   All right.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:39.400]   But for podcasters, the bottom line is you could get great, great, great green screen
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:44.320]   and stuff like that from little, little cameras without much cost if they make this display
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:46.200]   poor go both ways.
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:47.200]   Very cool.
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:51.040]   Now, what about the firewire controversy?
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:53.680]   You've the fact that they lead you to the Mac break week.
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:59.440]   I got so many emails and tweets about...
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:02.240]   Talk about the fact there's no firewire on the Mac book.
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:05.920]   They're against all of us indie musicians and they're against all of us indie.
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:10.080]   We talked about it last week as Derek K. Miller sent us a note.
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.080]   It's really true.
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:12.080]   I think it's a real...
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:14.000]   Well, I don't think it apples against them.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000]   I just think...
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.400]   You're making a differentiator.
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:17.400]   I mean, look...
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:21.520]   Did you guys talk about what Steve said at the conference call?
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:23.240]   About which?
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:26.520]   Steve Jobs at the quarterly conference call, which by the way, it's very rare that he
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:28.440]   makes a personal appearance.
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:33.080]   He said, "There's a reason we're not creating a $500 notebook and that is we...
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.800]   It's just not the business we want to be in.
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.120]   There's a lot of crap out there.
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:37.840]   We don't want to be in the business."
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:40.800]   He said, "This is a differentiator for us.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:45.040]   We're going to address a certain market segment and that's the segment we want to be in.
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:47.880]   And we're going to let the rest of the bottom feeders fight it out.
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:51.080]   I thought it was a brilliant position of the business case.
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:55.360]   Now, not from necessarily the user's point of view, but a great business case for some
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.600]   of the choices that they made.
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:07:02.160]   Actually, we didn't talk about the Apple results at all because they came out after the show.
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:06.360]   So not only did we not mention that Steve appeared on the call, which is very unusual,
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:12.880]   but we didn't give you information like the fact that Apple has sold 6.9 million iPhone
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:16.120]   3G's in the quarter.
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:20.520]   Max shipments jumping 21% in the quarter, in three months.
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:23.560]   I remember when they were talking about that's all they would sell total.
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:28.960]   Well, remember, we kind of mocked Steve Jobs for saying we'll sell 10 million in the first
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:29.960]   year.
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:30.960]   Actually, not we.
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:31.960]   All right, me.
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:35.120]   There's no mouse in your pocket, Bubba.
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.120]   All right.
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:40.360]   Well, actually there is, but that's about entirely.
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:46.800]   First quarter sales dramatically higher than the first generation, which took five quarters
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.200]   to sell 6.1 million.
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:50.320]   Yeah, they sold a lot.
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.240]   And here's a staggering fact.
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:58.200]   I one time made a joke, which a bunch of people got mad about and sent me Twitter's over.
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:01.520]   I made a joke that Apple had more cash on hand than Microsoft.
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:02.520]   It was a joke.
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:03.520]   It was clearly a joke.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:04.520]   But now it's not a joke.
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:09.360]   Apple today, as we speak, has more cash on hand than the Microsoft.
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.360]   So why is Apple stock down?
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:13.040]   It's just it doesn't matter.
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:14.680]   I told you guys last time is there.
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:17.800]   It's going to go down no matter how good the report is.
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:22.280]   The expectations are what drives stocks, not reality.
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:28.120]   And expectations are much like some of the people that you deal with in regular life.
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:31.000]   People's expectations sometimes tend to exceed reality.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.480]   But the fact is we haven't had time to see what the current economic conditions will
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:37.480]   do to Apple.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.640]   We'll probably see a little bit less performance.
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:44.400]   And I think most of the market reaction came to Apple doing what everybody else is doing,
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:48.920]   saying, hey, our future results don't look so good because of the current economic crisis.
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.480]   And that was really what the market was primarily reacting to.
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:56.320]   But when you look at the fact that they've got more cash on hand than Microsoft, that's
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:58.320]   kind of a staggering fact.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:08:59.320]   Yeah.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:04.920]   No, that's a and it bodes well, although you have to think in this time, it's hard to
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:06.480]   know what to do with that cash.
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:08.280]   That's we were talking about earlier.
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:10.680]   If I was Steve Jones, I'd be buying real estate.
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:11.680]   Yeah.
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:15.480]   Maybe acquiring companies, would this be a good time for Apple to acquire some companies?
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:16.480]   I think so.
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:20.020]   I think, you know, when you've got the most cash on hand of anybody and you're in a down
[01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:24.440]   market and everybody's hurting, I mean, everybody knows that, you know, you see, this is the
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:28.240]   time to buy when those are or those when you buy yourself when they're high.
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:30.200]   It's not done to take rocket science.
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:34.080]   I think they're in a great position to survive whatever happens.
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:37.640]   Now whether or not, you know, their stocks going to go crazy in the next quarter or two,
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:38.640]   nobody knows.
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:41.560]   But I can tell you that they're going to survive just based on their cash position.
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:49.800]   They sold 800,000 more handsets than Blackberry over the same quarter, 2.6 million computers,
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:54.360]   up 21% by unit and 17% by revenue, which isn't, I guess, interesting.
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:55.920]   They don't make quite a funny.
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:59.360]   I don't know if you've got it broken out there, but here's a real staggering number as well.
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:04.400]   They owe 40% of their sales total iPhone.
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.920]   That just shows you that they're not a computer company anymore.
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:07.920]   Nope, they are not.
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:10.840]   40% of the number is iPhone.
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:14.360]   So just imagine if they had not done the iPhone where they'd be today.
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:18.480]   8% increase in iPod units shipped.
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.960]   I guess we were thinking maybe the iPod would run on a steam.
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:21.960]   Guess not.
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:25.560]   11 million iPod sold.
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:31.160]   Quarterly revenue of 7.9 billion, a profit of 1.14 billion.
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:35.400]   Dramatically up, Steve said one of the best quarters in our history, if not the best quarter
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:38.960]   in our history.
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:44.520]   Now, of course, Apple's announcing expensive products in a down economy.
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:51.920]   25 billion in the bank, which is pretty nice, zero debt.
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:54.080]   Sounds like a strong company.
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:57.800]   Would you, no, I know you're not buying Apple stock, but would you buy Apple stock if you
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:58.800]   could?
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:03.520]   Yeah, I think, you know, it depends on your time horizon.
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:07.480]   So once again, if I was Alex's age, I'd buy a lot of stuff because he's not--
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:09.640]   This is a great time to bargain on if you've got 20 years.
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:14.560]   If you're young and you've got a 30 year time horizon until you retire, then it doesn't
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:17.920]   really matter what happens to the market this year, next year or the year after that.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:24.000]   If you look at historical averages in 30 year chunks, I mean, the market's way up over
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.240]   what it was even 10 years ago.
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:32.560]   I think that this is a great time to buy any stock if you've got the money, but there's
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:34.240]   risk involved in all these things.
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:40.480]   And I'm just guessing, but I like Apple's chances to get back to 200, let's say.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.920]   I don't think it's going to happen tomorrow.
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:46.440]   I do think that they're going to climb back up.
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:52.280]   I got to tell you, I was probably not as bullish on them until I heard Steve get on
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:53.960]   that conference call and say what he said.
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:58.760]   That was a very strong business case for the decisions they've made.
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:01.840]   And I recognize that users may not appreciate all of those things.
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:04.040]   But sometimes wearing my hat.
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:05.040]   Good businessman.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:09.960]   Wearing my users hat, I may wish that there was a firewire port, for instance, on a MacBook.
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:13.200]   But as an investor, I'd say, man, this is a strong case.
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:17.720]   Well, in his defense, by doing that, they were able to make the MacBooks more powerful,
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:20.120]   more equal to the MacBook Pros.
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:26.120]   The differentiator now is really lack of firewire and lack of the second graphics chip.
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:30.400]   I think with the firewire though, Leo, and I've seen it a couple of times, I've said
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:33.720]   it myself, it is a consumer laptop.
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:36.480]   And most people want firewire for one of two things.
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:39.960]   I mean, obviously, those geeky people like using the target disk mode to build other
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:40.960]   machines and things.
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:42.880]   But your average consumer probably doesn't want to do that.
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:47.160]   So they either want the, they would want firewire for either an external drive or for
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:48.160]   a camcorder.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:51.680]   Well, the external drive, I mean, you can get loads and loads and loads of USB drives now.
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:52.680]   So that's not really an issue.
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:55.880]   You can go to any sort of hardware shop and get an external drive.
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:01.920]   It's been mentioned as well that most camcorders, most consumer camcorders now, I think Alex
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:04.640]   said before, that they don't come with a firewire connection anymore.
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:09.520]   They come with a USB connection and use the ABA, HCD or whatever it's called.
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:11.920]   So they don't need a firewire on a consumer device.
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:17.520]   And it is a differentiator, but there's not really a tremendous need now for firewire
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:18.680]   on a consumer laptop.
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:22.840]   Yeah, my wife hasn't used firewire probably in five years.
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:28.640]   I mean, that's the kind of, I think a pretty average consumer of, she has a MacBook Pro,
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:31.520]   but only because she wanted more screen real estate.
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:37.400]   But outside of that, it barely made sense even for that because she would never use
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:38.400]   that.
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:42.760]   And that's, although I could not imagine living without firewire, I do think that it's interesting
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:46.320]   that they did go to firewire 800 said, basically, if you're going to use it for Pro, you're
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.240]   going to get the Pro connection.
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:52.280]   We're not going to do all this other stuff.
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:54.600]   And if you're not, you're going to buy a cheaper computer.
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.680]   I think it's a pretty clear differentiation.
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:01.920]   I guess I don't think it's that big of a deal because most people I know that are using
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:08.840]   a MacBook or not don't do a lot that would need the firewire.
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:11.040]   Snow Leopard on its way.
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:14.800]   And we're starting to hear some ish, some little bit of inside stuff.
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:18.880]   Apple's always said Snow Leopard really wouldn't introduce new features but would just be a
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:24.320]   clean up of the existing Leopard.
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:30.400]   Fitting its name, it's a snowier Leopard, a whiter, cleaner Leopard, a bleached out Leopard.
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:37.600]   The good news is that the Finder and quote, almost all other graphical apps will be delivered
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:38.600]   with Coco.
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:44.080]   Finally, finally, we're abandoning a carbon and going to Coco across the board.
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.480]   We'll look at the know.
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:50.520]   Will the Coco Finder make any difference, Alex?
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:57.600]   You know, I have heard rumblings from Apple folks that everyone's very excited about it.
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:01.000]   It's supposed to be a lot faster, more responsive and more stable.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000]   You know, that's the...
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000]   Will it look the same?
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:07.120]   Yeah, I don't have the impression it's going to change in the way it looks but it sounds
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:12.080]   like it's just going to be the theory is or the experience people have been having is
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:13.080]   that it's much faster.
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:15.760]   It's all 64 bit, right?
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:17.320]   It's all of it's 64 bit then, once they get there.
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:18.320]   I believe so.
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:19.640]   Yeah, and I don't think that this includes...
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:23.280]   I haven't heard anything about this but I don't think it includes Final Cut Pro Studio.
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:26.160]   Yeah, I don't think Final Cut Pro is on Coco.
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:28.800]   Too hard to rebuild that.
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:30.120]   It's too much code.
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:32.600]   Apple's still gonna hear, is this what we're gonna hear about it?
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:35.640]   Mac world, since there's really nothing else left Apple to talk about.
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:36.800]   I bet you they do.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.920]   It's interesting because in a way, this is exactly what Microsoft is saying with Windows
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:44.160]   7 is we're going to take Vista and clean up.
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:48.480]   They are changing the UI, which is I don't think Snell Leopard's gonna change the UI.
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:53.320]   But I think both companies have this situation where they've got a mature operating system
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:16:00.000]   and now the best most sensible thing to do would be to smooth the rough edges.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.480]   There's a lot of them right now.
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:08.520]   They've added a lot of cool features but all of them work at different levels of stability.
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:09.520]   I do wonder if this...
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:13.480]   The phone is fully Coco as well so it's just the move to move the desktop as well as that.
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:15.560]   Oh, I didn't realize the iPhone was fully Coco.
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:18.760]   Yeah, well the Coco, it's Coco Touch so it's...
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:20.960]   As far as my word, it's fully Coco interface.
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:21.960]   Interesting.
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:22.960]   Andy?
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:25.320]   No, I was just gonna say that.
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:30.280]   I wonder if this is finally the chance that all those rumors about features that have been
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:34.560]   heard about 10.5 and 10.4 that you hear well would have been nice if they did that but
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:36.880]   it had to be delayed just to make that outline.
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:39.560]   If now there is enough...
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:43.200]   There's so low...
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:46.360]   The basically now there's gonna be enough time to basically take some stuff off the whiteboard
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:49.400]   that's been up there for the past couple of years.
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:53.800]   Now that we no longer have to figure out, well let's make Safari...
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:55.240]   The new version is Safari work really well.
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:57.840]   Let's make the new version of Spotlight work really well.
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:00.000]   Let's get back to my Mac.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.200]   Let's get an icon for back to my Mac because back to my Mac is not gonna work but we'll
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:05.200]   have good icon.
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:12.080]   If now there's money in the budget and time in the budget to say, "Well, let's do a
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:13.400]   tweak to the definer design.
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:16.360]   Let's do a tweak to the way that the dock interacts."
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:17.560]   I'm wondering if we were not gonna...
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:23.120]   If they are simply not committing to a major upgrade which gives them the ability to simply
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:30.680]   for the first time since 10.0, create a new edition of the OS that's on their terms on
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:35.840]   what they want to do that is not all about living up to expectations.
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:41.240]   I'd be displeased if there weren't a demonstration of some kind of 10.6 in January and I'm wondering
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:45.760]   if there's gonna be a few surprises in the keynote because of it.
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.640]   And we could see new iMacs.
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:48.640]   Do you think...
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:50.560]   Well, I mean the rumor was that we'd see new iMacs right about now.
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:53.000]   If they don't do it in the next couple of weeks they're not gonna have time to do it
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000]   before Christmas.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.240]   So then it would be a January thing, right?
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:58.240]   Yeah.
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.160]   I mean I don't see that happening before January.
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:01.160]   Yeah, I think you were...
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:02.600]   They gotta save something.
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:05.560]   Also, when was the last...
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:10.720]   They did a major refresh at the iMac in terms of like a whole case redesign, a whole thing.
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:12.560]   They rolled out the DeLoreans and what was it?
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:13.560]   March February?
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:14.560]   Yeah, so they're pretty new.
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:15.560]   You know what?
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:17.960]   You know what's desperately needs updating is the mini.
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:18.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:23.760]   And Job says on the conference call, Job says the Apple TV is just still just a hobby.
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:24.760]   Yeah.
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:30.120]   I think the mini and the Apple TV aren't going anywhere near where they hoped they would.
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:31.120]   And if...
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:32.120]   It's too bad on me.
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:33.120]   They love them both.
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:34.120]   Yeah.
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:37.600]   If the down economy is gonna have an impact on Apple, that's my prediction as to where
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:38.600]   we'll see it.
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:40.200]   They'll kill them?
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:44.000]   Yeah, I think they'll just say, "Hey, resources don't make sense to...
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.000]   You know, but doesn't make sense to put resources into stuff that's not top performing."
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000]   I...
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000]   Tom, why not?
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.280]   You see, the Apple TV is putting a flag in the ground and somewhere that Apple wants
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:19:00.080]   to be and needs to be and really is the future, which is this kind of the idea of this
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:03.440]   IPTV solution that's just easy to use.
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:08.480]   And I think the mini is important to their business because it is the only $600 Mac.
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:09.480]   Yeah.
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:14.440]   I was gonna say both of them have really important positions in the product line.
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:18.120]   Apple TV, I think its position is very, very secure because it's a way for them to sell
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:21.360]   HD content that makes sense into living rooms.
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:24.840]   It's their fight against Blu-ray and other HD formats.
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:29.760]   As for Apple TV, I don't think they sell a whole lot on a read to begin with, but I
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:33.400]   think it's a way to seal the deal when they're trying to sell 500 to a school system.
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:38.920]   And they can say, "Well, the minimum buy-in is now $599, it's not $1,099."
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:47.040]   Although, if you look at their quarterly results, the truth is those two products are way down
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:48.680]   on the low end in terms of performance.
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:52.760]   And I'm just saying, I don't want them to go away, but I'm just saying that if you're
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:57.280]   looking at where you cut costs and it's where the economy's like this, I think you have to
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:59.480]   take a long look at that and say, "Hey, it's just the real price.
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:04.520]   The reality is we make 80% of our profit from 20% of our products.
[01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:06.000]   We need to develop that direction."
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.000]   You can bet iPhone is going to get plenty of money for its development budget.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:14.680]   I do think the fact that the Mac Mini has been untouched in how many years, not even
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:18.720]   a minor update in what a year and a half or something, I think that's the most telling
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:20.600]   thing about that product.
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:22.080]   I'm using it right now on my TV.
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:24.600]   It's funny, one TV has a Mac Mini on it, one has an Apple TV.
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:28.840]   They're used in many ways the same as TV as home theater devices.
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:30.720]   They're great home theater devices.
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:33.320]   I like the Mac Mini because I can surf the web as well.
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:39.440]   I have it hooked up to a big HD monitor and I can watch movies if I want, of course,
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:44.960]   but I can also very, very quickly just switch over and be reading the morning news or whatever
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:47.840]   on my general purpose TV.
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:48.840]   I love it.
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:53.760]   I think the Mini is probably that's hurting the Apple more than anything else, the Apple
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:57.840]   TV rather because people do use it as a home-theated thing.
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:02.320]   That's the only reason I would see why Apple might make it more difficult for people to
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:03.320]   use them to Mac Mini.
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:07.920]   But as far as the Apple TV, I didn't go with what Steve said at the MacBook event about
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:11.480]   Blu-ray, because Blu-ray is a big part of the equation in that the only way they can deliver
[01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:14.960]   HD content now is through the Apple TV.
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:18.960]   Him saying that the licensing prompt was a problem for Blu-ray, I doesn't really wash
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:25.160]   with me because this is the company who have got major deals with every studio in the universe.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:27.760]   He was saying Blu-ray to fail is what you're saying.
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:28.760]   Oh, yeah, definitely.
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:32.120]   Yeah, we've seen it well on Mac's bike now, I would have thought.
[01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:37.320]   But no, definitely looking at delivering content by the Y and the Apple TV is perfect for it
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:38.920]   to get it into the living room.
[01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:44.360]   Well, even if the goal isn't to make the download business stronger, there's a strong
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:49.840]   business case for saying, well, we saw the war between Blu-ray and HD DVD.
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:53.920]   That doesn't mean we won't see another contender and there's no need to standardize on Blu-ray
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:54.920]   now.
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:22:00.720]   There's so much to talk about, but we do have to get to our picks of the week.
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:06.120]   This is the time when we get to say our cool new hardware, software products, maybe overlooked
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:08.520]   products for the Apple fans.
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:14.560]   Can be an iPhone application, could be a piece of hardware for your Mac mini, could be software
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.400]   to run in your Macintosh.
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:19.200]   And I'm going to start with you, Alex Lindsey.
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:26.600]   I don't think I've suggested this one before and I feel like I stepped over it, but I just
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:29.640]   started playing with a program for the Mac.
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:30.840]   It's new on the Mac.
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:37.320]   And I'm kind of holding my ground here at the kind of the more geeky end of the visual
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:41.360]   effects spectrum here, and it's called Houdini.
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:43.480]   And I don't think you have a name to that now.
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:44.840]   I don't believe I recommended it.
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:45.840]   It's new on the Mac.
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:51.000]   It's on the Unix and Linux for a long time and Windows for almost as long of a time.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:57.280]   Oh, it's another procedural node based 3D animation and visual effects.
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:59.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.360]   Oh, that.
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:02.200]   One of those.
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:03.200]   Of course.
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:06.280]   So the company is called SideFX.
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:09.240]   And it's something that I've just been starting to play with.
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:10.560]   And I really like it a lot.
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:16.000]   Now if you like shake, if people like shake or like that kind of nodal based approach
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:22.880]   to things, a node, a nodal based compositor or 3D app allows you to just basically start
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:24.680]   setting up very, very basic rules.
[01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:26.600]   So I set up this goes to this and this goes to this.
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:28.760]   And for some people, it's very visual.
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:30.000]   It's very right in front of you.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.640]   You can kind of really, really go into creating very, very complex things.
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:39.680]   Some of the most complex kinds of animations, whether it's particle systems or the way skin
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:43.520]   rolls over something, a lot of times you need a lot more power than what you can get from
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:46.280]   a general 3D application.
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:51.080]   And so anyway, this has been, you know, most visual effects firms that I know in the world
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:56.280]   have at least one copy of this laying around.
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.760]   And a lot of them have, you know, five or 10.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:03.080]   And now the high end version of this costs, you know, thousands, tens of thousands of
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:07.240]   dollars, you know, or used to, I think it's like 18,000 is like totally loaded up.
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:10.560]   You describe it as, oh, 10, 20, Alex's, it sounds better.
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:11.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:12.560]   Did you see the thing?
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:16.760]   By the way, did you see the little Alex visualizer that someone posted?
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.160]   Oh, that's cute.
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:20.120]   How to visualize an Alex?
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:22.120]   Yeah, it has a bunch of it.
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:29.160]   You can type in a total number and it'll show you it's it's called what's an Alex.com.
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:30.680]   I did not do this.
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:33.320]   Oh, this was this was posted.
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:35.400]   This was on the Mac break ideas.
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:37.400]   So what's an Alex?
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:38.400]   Okay.
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:39.400]   So he says $18,000.
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:40.920]   Let's see what it says.
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:43.400]   $18,000, 25.71, Alex's.
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:45.760]   Oh, and look at all the little Alex heads.
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:46.760]   Alex heads.
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:49.560]   So so anyway, so so what's an Alex like?
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.480]   So anyway, it's a lot of a lot of Alex's.
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:59.560]   The great thing though is that they have they have gotten very, very aggressive about
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:01.400]   making this available to a much wider audience.
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:04.360]   I think they've realized that it takes a lot to to learn it.
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:07.840]   And so you can actually get a free version of this.
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:12.920]   It'll only render 720 by 576, which is, you know, basically the what you could do for
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:13.920]   standard definition.
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:20.200]   And there's a small watermark if you if you put pay $99, so it's a much lower expense,
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:25.560]   you can get a what they call the starving artist edition.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:29.800]   So so you can work on personal projects.
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:34.280]   You can do a lot of your own stuff there at HD 1920 by 1080.
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:37.720]   And so I would now these are what they call non commercial.
[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:40.120]   And this is something that I pushed for for a long time.
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:43.000]   And this is one of the reasons that I wanted to make sure people knew about it is this
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.240]   idea of being able to sell what's considered a non commercial.
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:50.400]   You can't use it for production, but you can use it to learn.
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:52.800]   And I've always thought this is really important for especially these companies.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:54.080]   Well, my idea didn't they?
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:55.280]   And that was a great idea.
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.280]   Alias or so.
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:57.680]   Well, they, yeah, we did it first.
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:58.680]   I just want to point out.
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:25:59.680]   So we.
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:03.320]   But yeah, they did it, but they did a PLE and it was free.
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:04.360]   What personal learning edition.
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:05.360]   It was free, but with a watermark.
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:06.360]   Great idea.
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:07.360]   I find really annoying.
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:11.040]   I love the idea of a $99 version that doesn't have a watermark.
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:12.520]   You can really do your own work.
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:16.400]   So if you're doing, you know, fun stuff and you're and you're doing stuff for a school
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:19.400]   or if you're with a school or you're doing it on your own, you're doing all these other
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:21.880]   things for only $99, you can get to play with this.
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:26.360]   Now you may find that you can download the apprentice for free from side effects.com,
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:32.720]   then you can also go to, you know, download the, you can pay $99 if you think you're going
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:35.680]   to go down down the direction and now you can make your own demo reel.
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:37.840]   You can put together your own fun examples.
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:41.200]   And I think a lot of people who are getting into 3D would love to just, you know, just
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:45.000]   have some fun with it, create some cool effects for their home movies, so on so forth.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.680]   So for $99, you can do that and really use what the big guys are using.
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:52.880]   Now, if you, as soon as you start wanting to make money with it, you're not licensed to
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:53.880]   use it with these ones.
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:55.560]   You have to start paying real money for it.
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:56.760]   But it's a great place to start.
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:00.200]   And it's a really, you know, an interesting way to approach it.
[01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:04.200]   I haven't, I'm not 100% sold either way on it, but I think it's an incredibly great
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:05.200]   business model.
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:08.600]   And I think it makes a lot of sense for our listeners if they want to play with what
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:13.240]   true high end 3D looks like, they should give it a shot.
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.240]   Excellent.
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:15.240]   Side effects.
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:16.240]   Go.
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:17.240]   Excellent.
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:18.240]   Thank you, Alex Lindsay.
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:19.960]   Don McAllister will let you get a, get a word in edge wise here.
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:21.520]   What do you have for us this week?
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:23.400]   You play with a lot of new stuff for all the time.
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:26.560]   Yeah, yeah, well, can I be very cheeky and just put two, two short ones?
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:27.560]   Be cheeky.
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:28.560]   Go on then.
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:32.800]   The first one is, I think Merlin's actually a big fan of this particular application.
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:34.320]   It's just been relaunched.
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:35.320]   Pathfinder.
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:36.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:37.320]   Pathfinder.
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:38.320]   I used Pathfinder.
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:39.320]   I did use Pathfinder.
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.320]   Right.
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:44.320]   Well, they've just relaunched and they've come out now with version 5, which is amazing.
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:46.160]   It's a really, really nice implementation.
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:50.040]   I mean, it was good before, but now it's, it's like the old Pathfinder on steroids.
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:51.880]   It's a Pathfinder replacement.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:52.880]   Yeah.
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:56.040]   It's basically, well, they've included some new features in it now.
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:59.200]   One of the things I always used to not like about the old version was that you couldn't
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:01.560]   have a dual pane, but they've now included dual pane.
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:02.560]   Excellent.
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:04.160]   So you can have select two windows next to each other.
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:07.560]   They've pulled in the sidebar from Leopard, so you can get direct access to the sidebar
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:10.000]   through, through the new version of Pathfinder.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.840]   Lots, lots and lots and lots of new features.
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:14.040]   They've even got cover flow in.
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:18.320]   So you can have a dual pane, cover flow view, and also have it in this mode underneath cover
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:22.280]   flow rather than just the, sorry, the column view underneath cover flow.
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:23.280]   It's just amazing.
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:25.720]   So I'd well recommend Pathfinder 5.
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:27.120]   That's from Coco Tech.
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:31.200]   It is, I'm sorry to say, an upgrade of $20 for previous Pathfinder owners.
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:32.440]   Yeah, it is a paid upgrade.
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:35.240]   But to be honest, from what I've seen, it's well worth your great price.
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:36.240]   Yeah, I like that.
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:40.560]   I find her a lot, but I could never quite, you know, it was never quite much better than
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.480]   Finder enough better than Finder to keep using it.
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:46.200]   But I keep whining it to be the next big thing.
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:47.200]   It is Coco, isn't it?
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:48.200]   I think it is.
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:49.200]   Yeah.
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:50.200]   Yeah.
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:51.200]   It's by Coco Tech.
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:53.200]   It's by Coco Tech at all.
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:55.840]   It's a get your Coco Finder now.
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:56.840]   Yeah.
[01:28:56.840 --> 01:29:00.640]   But the problem would be forward is that you sort of couldn't replicate the Finder sidebar
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:03.360]   because there are some nice features within the Finder sidebar.
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:07.960]   So if you read a shortcut in Finder, it didn't appear within, you know, in Pathfinder.
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:11.720]   But now it's fully integrated and it works really, really well.
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:15.120]   It really does look like the next version of the Finder as opposed to an alternative
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:17.120]   Finder, a very impressed designer.
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:18.840]   Well, I might already pay the $20.
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:19.840]   Sounds good.
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:20.840]   Good pick.
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:21.840]   Yes.
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:25.920]   Well, the other thing is an event that's going on here in the UK that a friend of mine is
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:28.280]   putting on Scotty.
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:30.000]   It's called MacDev.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.440]   So there's a MacDev UK.
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:32.680]   Sorry, it's not called MacDev.
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:33.680]   It's called...
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:35.160]   P70 and Invitation.
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:36.160]   And I would love to go.
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:37.760]   It's going to be just outside London.
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:38.760]   Yes, that's right.
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:39.760]   Hatfield.
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:40.760]   It is MacDev.
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:41.760]   Sorry.
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:42.760]   MacDev 2009.
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:45.680]   16th and 17th of April in Hatfield, which is just outside London.
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:46.680]   And basically it's...
[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:50.280]   I think it might be the first UK-based developers conference.
[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:51.720]   It's not an Apple event.
[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:54.680]   It's one that Scotty's organization have put together.
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:58.880]   And they've got a whole load of developers coming across from the States, European and
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:04.200]   UK developers as well, and they're just having some sessions, some workshops, social
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:07.000]   events, and it looks to be a really good event.
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.080]   And it's coming up when?
[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:12.000]   The 16th and 17th of April.
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000]   And the URL if you want to go.
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.360]   Yeah, it's going to be MacDevEurope.com.
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:20.240]   And very much more reasonable than MacDev.
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:22.400]   UWDC in the US.
[01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:23.880]   Was it 99 pounds?
[01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:24.880]   What was the...?
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:27.120]   I think there's a deposit you can put on.
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:29.520]   I think it's about 200 pounds actually.
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:30.520]   Oh, OK.
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:31.520]   Look.
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:34.520]   Yeah, you can pay a deposit up until January of 99 pounds, and then the full conference
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:35.520]   fee is 399.
[01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:36.520]   Oh, OK.
[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:37.520]   I take it back.
[01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:38.520]   Yeah.
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:39.520]   That's a reason.
[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:40.520]   It's for a...
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:42.160]   Well, it's for a serious Mac developer.
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:43.160]   It's for serious developers.
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:44.160]   Yeah.
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:45.160]   And the spaces are limited as well.
[01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:49.400]   So there is a student conference fee as well, but they have limited places for that.
[01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:51.720]   So you're a student to have a look.
[01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:53.360]   But yeah, check out the website.
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:56.280]   Lots of information on there.
[01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:57.280]   Thank you, Don McAllister.
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:58.280]   Yeah.
[01:30:58.280 --> 01:30:59.280]   I'm going to...
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:00.280]   Well, you know what?
[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:02.040]   I'll mention mine later because I don't want to steal anybody's thunder.
[01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.600]   Andy and I go, "You're next.
[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:05.640]   What do you got for us?"
[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:11.200]   There's a really great utility that I love and I use every single day.
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:16.720]   And I've wanted to recommend it for the past two or three months, but it has one big drawback
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:20.120]   that's made me say, "No, I probably shouldn't recommend it."
[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:26.200]   But given one of the other topics here and also given the fact that this is such a great
[01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:28.600]   and unique utility, I'm going to go ahead anyway.
[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:32.320]   I'll say what the one defect of the product is at the very, very end.
[01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:37.200]   So that by the time I'm done explaining what this utility does, you won't care anymore.
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:38.200]   It's called some...
[01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:40.720]   It's utility called replay media catcher.
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:41.720]   Yeah.
[01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:48.240]   It is the ultimate piece of software for capturing any piece of streaming video or audio that's
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:50.360]   coming into your machine.
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:54.480]   There are a lot of utilities out there that will download a YouTube video.
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:59.880]   There's KeepVid.com, which will give you a download link for content from a lot of different
[01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:01.280]   streaming media sites.
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:05.920]   They don't always work and they don't always work very well or they're difficult to use.
[01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:13.880]   And they certainly don't work with systems like Hulu.com, the streams, all that cool,
[01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:18.520]   like last night's episode of the office or house and that sort of stuff.
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:21.080]   Replay media catcher couldn't be easier to use.
[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:25.480]   You simply launch it and it's a simple one window interface and you click a record button
[01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:29.600]   and then it simply starts looking at all the incoming connections through your internet
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:30.600]   connection.
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:35.360]   And when it sees what appears to be a streaming video stream, it simply starts capturing it.
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:42.280]   And before long, it gives you that really weird Kryptonian language font of what it's labeling
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:46.280]   it until it sees enough of the stream to say, "Oh, this is an episode of house.
[01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:49.560]   It is an episode called house's head and here's other data about it."
[01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:54.600]   And by the time you save it, you have a video file that has been tagged with all that information.
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:58.640]   It'll work with services like Last FM and Pandora exact same way.
[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:02.480]   You just don't have to say, "Please point at this application and record for the following
[01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:03.480]   30 seconds."
[01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:06.000]   It simply says, "Oh, I noticed a new song is starting.
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.640]   Hang on a sec.
[01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:09.000]   I can name that to innate notes."
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.880]   Yes, it is the Ramones.
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:12.680]   I want to be sedated.
[01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:16.040]   When it's done, it gets saved as a separate MP3 file.
[01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:20.440]   It is the most automatic capture app I've ever seen.
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:21.560]   It always works.
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:24.280]   It's $39.95 dirt cheap.
[01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:27.000]   It has one rather significant drawback though.
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.160]   It is a Windows only product.
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:30.160]   Andy!
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:31.160]   Andy!
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:37.160]   Now, I'm saying this because a lot of people are running Bootcamp number one.
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:38.160]   Okay.
[01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:43.880]   So, you can run under Bootcamp, run under emulation.
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:50.160]   I just want there to be an app that is one tenth this nifty for the Mac.
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:53.280]   And also, you can put it on your iPod, you can put it on your iPhone.
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:58.000]   And I know it's okay to hate me for mentioning a Windows product on this podcast.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:03.760]   But like I said, there comes a time in which I have to say I use this so much.
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:07.120]   And people keep asking me for different tools for capturing this sort of stuff.
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:09.280]   And they say, "Isn't there a screen-capped utility?"
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:13.600]   Like, "Well, yeah, if you want to manually select a certain area of your browser window
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:16.320]   and manually start and stop and you want to have...
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:22.760]   Unless you're running like a 16 quad cluster machine with 400 terabytes of RAM, you'll
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:26.600]   be satisfied with 12 frames per second in mono audio."
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:32.120]   So, again, hate me, whip me, beat me, I'll pay a 20 bucks, leave it on the dresser.
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:33.440]   Sometimes people like that sort of thing.
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:37.320]   But it's a great utility and if you have Windows XP or Windows Vista, or I'm not sure
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:42.120]   if it'll work with this wonderful freebie app that we're recommending at the very top.
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:43.880]   But it's worth recommending.
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:46.520]   I will never mention a Windows app.
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:47.520]   It's okay.
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:51.160]   At least for the rest of the year.
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:52.760]   So what's the URL?
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:57.560]   The URL is applian.com, A-P-P-L-I-A-N.com.
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:34:59.560]   And it's about 30 bucks, 40 bucks?
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:01.040]   It is $39.95.
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:02.040]   If anything...
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:03.040]   I actually use it.
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:04.040]   I'm just giving you a hard time.
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:05.040]   It's a great...
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:06.040]   I mean, if anything, I wish you would.
[01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:10.840]   Take this as a call to arms for some developer to create something this cool for the Mac.
[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:11.840]   Yeah.
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.680]   No, I'm kind of with you on that.
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:16.120]   There isn't anything like it.
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:19.360]   So it works okay in virtualization, it works in parallels?
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:20.960]   I use it in bootcamp all the time.
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:21.960]   It works fine.
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:25.000]   But I wonder how well it'll work in that.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.640]   I've used it on VMware in one of those...
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:32.000]   Unfortunately, I've sort of been conditioned in parallels in VMware so that if I'm doing
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.880]   anything that is sort of speed sensitive to...
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:38.200]   I practically use it as a bootcamp situation.
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:40.520]   I basically know I'm not going to have Photoshop open.
[01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:42.400]   No, I'm not going to have this browser window open.
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:46.360]   No, I'm not going to have a million browser windows open running flash or anything like
[01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:47.360]   that.
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:53.040]   But again, if you're in a situation where I'm packing for my trip, I want to have last
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:56.120]   night's episode of house and it's not...
[01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:59.800]   Well, actually, if you have a house, I suppose you should just buy off the iTunes store since
[01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:01.520]   you can now buy those things off the iTunes store.
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:03.240]   But there are things you cannot buy legally.
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:04.240]   So there you go.
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:05.240]   Well, stay tuned.
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:06.680]   I have another way you might want to watch house.
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:10.920]   But let's get to Mr. Scott Bourne for his peck of the way.
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:16.120]   You know, like somebody just handed me a silver necklace full of garlic.
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:17.120]   You had your fingers in your ears.
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:20.720]   You were going, "La, la, la, la, can't hear you can't hear you can't hear."
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:28.000]   Okay, well, you know, I tend to also not give specifically Mac related pics, although I've
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.480]   never done anything windows related.
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:30.880]   I haven't gone that crazy.
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:35.680]   But I do a lot of photo related pics because all the statistics we have say that Mac owners
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:39.160]   are very highly disproportionately into serious photography.
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:41.280]   Oh, I'm sure that's true.
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:44.800]   So my pick this week is anything.
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:50.200]   Everything at all manufactured by a company called lenscoat.com, L-E-N-S-C-O-A-T.
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:52.560]   Guys, happens to be Scott that runs it.
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:57.080]   I've tested and purchased and used a bunch of stuff from them.
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:00.000]   And they make these cool things like they call them body bags.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.360]   They're neoprene bags that you can put your body in, your camera body in.
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:06.000]   Yeah, yeah, these, those are great.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.600]   You can get little pouches to put your lenses in so that if you don't want to stick them
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:12.880]   in a pure photo bag, they won't get messed up.
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:17.520]   They make these things called hoodies, which will, in my opinion, do a much better job
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:21.280]   of being a lens cap than anything the manufacturer makes because they're easier to get on and
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:24.600]   off and they provide more protection.
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:30.840]   And of course, they make covers for all the big lenses like I use, the big 3-800 Sigma,
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:32.920]   the 2-400 Nikon.
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:34.840]   They make them for Canon and Nikon.
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:41.120]   And they design everything for the specific camera body grouping or lens grouping that
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:42.120]   you're using.
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:43.920]   They really work hard on their stuff.
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:47.440]   They're available in both camo and just black.
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:51.560]   And it's all very affordable that, you know, some of the stuff's 20, 30, 40 bucks.
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:56.720]   So lenscoat.com because if you spend a lot of money on your new camera or your new lens,
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:57.760]   you want to protect it.
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:59.440]   And this is a good way to do it.
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:01.600]   Yes, everybody uses those body bags.
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:05.880]   Those are really, in fact, I think, I think Ross might have been using them in her sale
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:06.920]   across the ocean.
[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:11.160]   Yeah, they're very, they're very cool because what I don't like to do is carry my stuff
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:13.800]   around in a bag that screams, "Hi, I'm a photo bag.
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:14.800]   Steal me."
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:15.800]   Right.
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:19.320]   So you can just throw your stuff if you completely coat all your stuff with lenscoat products
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:20.560]   and use all their pouches.
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:22.440]   You can just throw it in any old bag for the most part.
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:24.200]   It'll be fine.
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:25.400]   Thank you, Scott Born.
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:26.400]   lenscoat.com.
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:28.480]   We took it down.
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:29.480]   We did.
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:30.480]   It looks like...
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:31.480]   It just took this idea.
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:36.200]   Well, yeah, I mentioned it's funny because I tweeted that Don McAllister was going to be
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:37.640]   on Mac Break Weekly.
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:41.240]   And our audience went from 1200 to 3500 like that.
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:42.720]   So you've got some free Don.
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:44.880]   Alice, you've got some fans done.
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:45.880]   Wow.
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:46.880]   Don't know about that.
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:50.520]   And so all 3500 of them are now hitting the lenscoat site at the same time.
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:54.640]   Evidently, that's too many.
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:57.840]   I sent you guys invitations to this a couple of days ago.
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:01.880]   It is currently a closed alpha.
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:06.160]   And they, in fact, said, "Don't talk about it yet because we're going to go, you know,
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:08.080]   our public beta is coming."
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:12.760]   But there is a way you can get this without participating in the closed alpha, I think.
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:15.320]   And if not, then just keep your eye peeled for Boxy.
[01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:19.280]   B-O-X-E-E dot TV.
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:22.880]   Boxy is a port for Windows, Linux.
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:27.200]   Oh, yeah, Macintosh is in there too, of XMBC.
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:33.560]   And it is really slick and a very good way to watch Hulu, to watch Comedy Central, Revision
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:40.200]   3, to listen to Twit podcast, to watch Pixelcore stuff on your Mac.
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:43.480]   But again, you have to apply, you know, to say, "I want to be a part.
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:45.920]   You have to send them a note saying sign up.
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:46.920]   I want to sign up."
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:48.480]   And it is a closed alpha right now.
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:51.000]   However, there is a version for Apple TV.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.080]   And if you've already got the Apple TV flash that we've talked about several times, I
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:56.360]   think Merlin picked it and I picked it.
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:40:00.120]   I just love it from Applecore LLC, applecore LLC dot com.
[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:02.720]   It's the patch stick, basically.
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:06.240]   And the newest patch stick has Boxy built into it.
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:10.120]   Now I don't know if you have to have an account or not.
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:12.520]   I guess you do to use it because you've got to log in.
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:16.240]   So maybe even if you've got the Apple TV, you can't use Boxy.
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:17.840]   Yeah, you still need an account.
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:19.240]   Still need an account.
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:23.440]   So sign up for an account or beg your friends.
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:28.120]   I don't know how many invitations I get for being a member because I send everybody invitations.
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:29.120]   This thing is fantastic.
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:31.640]   I was watching Hulu last night, watch the office.
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:35.680]   Now I was watching on a big screen TV and it's probably better to buy the high-def version
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:37.520]   from the iTunes store.
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:41.320]   But if you're too cheap to buy it or you want to watch it right now and you forgot to buy
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:43.560]   it, you can watch it right now.
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:45.640]   Hundreds of programs on this thing.
[01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:48.640]   It's also a media player, a very slick media player.
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:49.720]   It does photos.
[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:50.880]   It does music.
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:51.980]   It does movies.
[01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:54.680]   It really is a great addition to the Apple TV.
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:58.840]   It's just another reason to pick this ATV flash.
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:03.800]   If you haven't got your ATV flash yet, go to applecorellc.com.
[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:08.960]   It is, yes, it is an open source product that they have packaged up to make it easy for
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:10.360]   you to install.
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:16.840]   It's worth the money just to get this thing because believe me, if you did it by yourself,
[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:18.040]   it would be a pain in the butt.
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:24.560]   50 bucks for the ATV flash highly recommended and then check out Boxy by sending them an
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:25.560]   invitation.
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:26.560]   What do you guys think?
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:27.560]   Have you played with it?
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:32.880]   I downloaded it a few days ago and I've been using it for like three days and I do really,
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:33.880]   really like it.
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:36.520]   It grabs everything from all your libraries.
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:38.960]   It's a really slick interface.
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:44.600]   I kid you not that it made me sort of, you have the standard complaint about anything open
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:49.920]   source which is the technology and the architecture always fantastic and the user interface looks
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:53.240]   like it was designed by someone during a lunch break wearing mittens while they were
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:56.280]   typing the design for the user interface.
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:57.280]   It's very, very slick.
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:41:59.360]   It looks like a very, very professional thing.
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:01.720]   It's a little bit quirky but it's still an alpha.
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:05.200]   It's very early alpha and I think it's surprisingly stable.
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:06.200]   Exactly.
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:09.560]   Yeah, they didn't want me to talk about it but I did anyway because it's so cool.
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:11.720]   What do you think Alex?
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:14.600]   I saw you were because, see now the other thing is a social media thing so I could see
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:17.360]   what Alex is watching and other friends are watching and that's kind of cool.
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:20.320]   I just started playing with it and I couldn't quite get my head around it the first time
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:23.440]   I saw I have to kind of, I think the interface is really, really slick.
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:26.240]   I just didn't quite get all my, all my, yeah.
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:28.920]   I think I just, you know, just close to the end of the day.
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:33.760]   Put it on your Mac or your Apple TV but you've got to get the invite from somebody.
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:36.800]   Don't ask me because I'm sure I've sent everything out that I can.
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:38.280]   I invited all of Mac Break Weekly people.
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:40.120]   Don, you sound like you've been playing with it too.
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:46.680]   Yeah, I had a go, a friend of mine over at the automated home website sent me a link
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:50.840]   to it and I tried it out and it's very impressed actually, very impressed especially with it
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:51.840]   being on the Apple TV.
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:52.840]   Yeah.
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:55.320]   I must have had that much chance to play with it because it's been working all the hours
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:59.800]   God sends to try and get a few shows in the camp my way next week on the Mac Mania thing.
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:03.800]   So I've sort of been putting in the overtime to get the show finished but the few chances
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:06.400]   of how to play with it, it does look very impressive.
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:09.800]   In fact, there's another media player on there as well which is the port of the Xbox
[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:13.720]   media center which is also the ATV flashing on the.
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:16.600]   And that you don't need a, you don't need anything special.
[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:18.680]   No, that's right, that's right.
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:22.800]   It is a little, it looks beautiful but it is a little bit more complex to set up and it's
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:26.120]   something I'll probably do a show on in the next month, well not next month, in the next
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:27.120]   few months.
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:28.120]   I'd love to see that.
[01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:32.400]   I think you do some hand-helding to hand-held to get through that but both really just show
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:35.680]   you the power of what you can do on a platform like the Apple TV.
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:40.360]   I love my Apple TV and now that I've hacked it with the ATV flash, it's just the most
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:41.360]   incredible device.
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:42.360]   I just love it.
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:48.920]   I got quite a shock actually because as you say Hulu is on the boxy one and I've never
[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:52.400]   been able to get to Hulu obviously because I'm in the UK but it started to work but
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:54.880]   then I discovered it was only some free content that you can get to anywhere.
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:58.000]   I thought I could actually get to Hulu from it but.
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.240]   I wish the quality were a little bit better but you know what, you know what, you know
[01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:01.240]   what's going to be.
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:06.480]   You know they're going to slowly upgrade the quality of the video and that's the future
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:07.480]   of television.
[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:11.840]   I mean you're seeing the future of television right there, there's no doubt in my mind.
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:13.640]   That's exactly what it is.
[01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:15.920]   All right, that wraps up our picks for the day.
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:17.680]   I really want to thank you Don for joining us.
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:24.720]   We're about to leave on the most amazing Geek Cruise yet, Macmania 8 in the Mediterranean.
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:25.720]   I'm so jealous.
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:29.320]   Randall Schwartz who wasn't going to get to go has got a pin in his wrist and he's going
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:30.320]   to be there.
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:31.320]   Excellent.
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:33.960]   So I'm really happy.
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:38.720]   And you and I and Andy and Ico are going to be going on Macmania 9 next year to China
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:40.320]   and Korea and Japan.
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:41.320]   That's right.
[01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:42.320]   The three of us.
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:46.320]   It's like we're going to be doing one of those Bob Hope Bing Crosby road pictures.
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:49.840]   We're off on the road to Korea.
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:50.840]   It's going to be fun.
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:51.840]   I can't wait.
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:55.040]   So if you have not yet signed up, if you want to go to China, Japan and Korea with us
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:45:00.080]   July 2009, go to insightcruises.com and sign up.
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:01.480]   We'd really love to have you on board.
[01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:02.680]   These are just great events.
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:06.960]   If you've never done them before, Mac folks don't take up the whole ship.
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:11.560]   They're usually a hundred to 200 strong, but it's wonderful to hang out with people who
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:16.320]   just share your enthusiasm for the platform.
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:17.320]   We have lectures.
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:20.480]   We talk about getting the most out of your Mac.
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:23.800]   But I think it's just going somewhere interesting with really neat people.
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:25.240]   It is fantastic.
[01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:32.200]   And Leo, I have the name and location of a four story Japanese stationary store or as
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:37.560]   they call them their stationary stores that I'm going to be spending 50% of my discretionary
[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:38.560]   income from.
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:44.040]   I'm going to be coming back on board that ship with five different packs worth of stuff.
[01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:47.000]   And people are going to ask me, what did you spend $3,000 on Andy?
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:50.920]   And I'll have to hang my head low and say pencils and note paper.
[01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:51.920]   Oh my God.
[01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:52.920]   Well, I'm going with you.
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:53.920]   I hope you let me count.
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:56.560]   It's going to be the ultimate field trip.
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:45:57.560]   Field trip.
[01:45:57.560 --> 01:45:59.720]   We're going to a stationary store everybody.
[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:00.720]   Is that pathetic?
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:03.280]   Oh, it's a cool one.
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:04.280]   It's a cool one.
[01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:05.280]   Is that a football car?
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:06.280]   Where is that?
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:07.760]   Oh, I have it.
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:11.240]   It's in some sort of foreign language almost the address and the name of the place.
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:12.920]   Because we're not going to Tokyo.
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:16.400]   We're going to some smaller towns on the south side.
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:19.840]   I have a friend who has a lot of experience and I gave him like a itinerary.
[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:22.640]   I said that I said that there's some things I want to do in Japan.
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:26.720]   One of them is that I want to go to a real Japanese stationary store.
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:31.800]   I want to see every single kind of paper imaginable, every single kind of pen and writing implement.
[01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:36.600]   I want every single San Rio thing that they don't sell in the United States of America
[01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:38.280]   that can be put onto the end of a pencil.
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:39.280]   I can't.
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:40.280]   I want to at least look at it.
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:41.280]   This is going to be fun.
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:42.280]   Yes.
[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:43.280]   This is going to be.
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:45.560]   Oh yes, 3000 years worth of history and culture.
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:46.560]   Okay, that's nice.
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:50.080]   But please get me the get me the curopey denture adhesive.
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:51.080]   I want that.
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:52.080]   I want that.
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:55.960]   We'll we'll make a special excursion just for that.
[01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:56.960]   That'll be a lot of fun.
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:47:00.960]   So insightcruises.com Andy and I co is at the Chicago Sun times.
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:04.560]   Of course, the CWOB.com and by the way, I think we're all going to be at Mac world
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:05.800]   Expo in January.
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:06.800]   That's another place.
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:07.800]   Yeah.
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:08.800]   You want to go?
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:14.400]   We'll be doing Mac break weekly special edition right after Steve Jobs keynote on Tuesday.
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:18.680]   And then we're all giving lectures, various lectures throughout the throughout the week
[01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:19.880]   at Mac world Expo.
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:22.520]   So you can catch us there as well.
[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:25.320]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, he's about to go to Japan.
[01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:28.480]   We should give Alex some shopping list.
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:29.480]   Yeah.
[01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:31.480]   I have Sundays off, I think.
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:32.480]   We're Saturday or something.
[01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:34.480]   I get I get they off.
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:35.480]   It's like it's like 10.
[01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:39.640]   Well, you'll give us an update from Japan.
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:42.200]   He is, of course, the head honcho at pixelcore.
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:47.560]   You go to pixelcore.com to find out more about this amazing guild of multimedia artists.
[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:50.440]   Not only training, but also work as you can tell.
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:52.560]   There's a lot of work in the world now.
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:56.160]   And I think there are a lot of people probably out of work who think who really should consider
[01:47:56.160 --> 01:48:02.160]   joining pixelcore as a way of joining the next generation of employment.
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:07.480]   Also pixelcore.tv for all your great podcasts, including Twip this week in photography.
[01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:08.480]   Yeah.

[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:13.880]   Hello.
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:14.880]   As Alex Lindsey.
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:15.880]   Alex Lindsey.
[01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:16.880]   All one word.
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:19.160]   Scott Born's on the Twitter as well as Scott Born.
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:24.840]   He's also the co host of this week in photography and is leading some really neat aperture workshops.
[01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:25.840]   You just came back.
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:26.840]   Where were you now?
[01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:31.880]   Well, we were at the Grand Teton National Park and we're in the middle of our new contest,
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:37.400]   which we're running at f64.com for a chance to win a free all expenses paid trip to Yosemite
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:42.680]   in winter with another group of pros and another bunch of like $3,500 where the prize
[01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:44.520]   is free to person and photo gear.
[01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:47.080]   And so we're doing that next and that's going to be fun.
[01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:49.080]   Also want to let you guys know they're going to Japan.
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:52.880]   I want you to learn this one phrase because you'll need to say this often.
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:54.400]   Okurimasen.
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:56.760]   Which means I have no idea what you just said.
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:57.760]   Exactly.
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:01.720]   I wish to add my name to the Ben Zupi of champions.
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:09.080]   If you really want to go for it, Ii, doximashita, okurimasen.
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:11.680]   I'll have to have a lot of lessons before we leave.
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:14.760]   Yeah, just get you and here's the really crazy thing.
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:17.800]   You'll get some software program that's going to teach you to speak Japanese and you'll
[01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:20.920]   be all excited and you'll say a couple of things that people in Japan will actually
[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:26.600]   understand and then the horror of you listening to their response at 250 miles an hour will
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:30.160]   help you realize you might have just said anybody here speak English.
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:31.160]   What?
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:32.160]   Karimasen.
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:33.160]   Karimasen.
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:34.160]   Karimasen.
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:35.160]   Karimasen.
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:36.840]   Which means do you understand?
[01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:37.840]   And yay.
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:38.840]   What kurimasen?
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:39.840]   I do not understand or?
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:40.840]   Hi.
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:41.840]   Karimasak.
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:45.120]   So that's really confusing because as soon as you say yay, it sounds like yes.
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:46.120]   It's yay.
[01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:47.120]   Yay.
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:48.120]   It's no.
[01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:49.120]   Yay.
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:50.120]   No.
[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:51.360]   You take the form of a question.
[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:54.520]   If you learn conjugation of verbs in Japanese, it's really not that bad.
[01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:56.280]   What kurimas is the question.
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:57.280]   What kurimasen do you understand?
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:58.280]   What kurimas ka?
[01:49:58.280 --> 01:49:59.280]   Yes, I do.
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:00.280]   What kurimasen?
[01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:01.280]   No, I don't.
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:02.280]   Oh.
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:03.280]   And then it goes across the board.
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:05.200]   Of course, then you have to learn it in three different ways so that you can speak to
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:08.040]   your elders, your peers and your juveniles in different ways.
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:09.240]   But that's another conversation.
[01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:12.360]   I should bring, I should just bring Colleen.
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:13.600]   She was lived in Japan for a year.
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:14.600]   She speaks perfect Japanese.
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:16.480]   She's just I've heard a gun with me.
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:17.480]   Why not?
[01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:18.480]   I haven't even been a bad plan.
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:20.480]   I plan to be an American.
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:21.480]   There you go.
[01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:22.480]   I'm stupid.
[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:23.480]   I don't know.
[01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:24.480]   Huh?
[01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:28.400]   No, no, no, more like I speak American, which is the international language of everything.
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:29.400]   Yeah.
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:30.560]   And you better too.
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:32.560]   That'll do you fine.
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:34.120]   Careful of t-shirts and that.
[01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:36.160]   I will learn Japanese for well, okay.
[01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:40.120]   I suppose I could speak Japanese if you're not smart enough to know English by now.
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:41.120]   Ooh.
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:42.720]   I'm an American tourist.
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:43.720]   I'm a real foreign.
[01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:47.000]   And I think I'm not going to go to that stationary store with you after all.
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000]   I'll let you go on your own.
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.480]   Another Mac break.
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:51.380]   It's broke.
[01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:58.380]   I'm not going to go on your own.
[01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:01.380]   I'm not going to go on your own.
[01:51:01.380 --> 01:51:05.380]   I'm not going to go on your own.
[01:51:05.380 --> 01:51:08.380]   I'm not going to go on your own.
