[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.000]   Time for Mac Break Weekly, our first episode
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.480]   from the brand new Twit Brick House Studios.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.640]   Leo Le Port here to my left.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.920]   I'll see if this works.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.440]   No, to my right, Alex Lindsay from the PixelcorePixelscore.com.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.640]   And he's just next door now.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.240]   I know, it's easy for you to get here.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.480]   I was like, oh, and then I suddenly realized when I was like,
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.440]   I could run over to the cottage.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.000]   And I was like, oh no, I have to walk across the hall.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.720]   They Pixelcore shares this Supercast studio with us.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.560]   You have about 40% of it.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.960]   It's such a big space, it's 9,500 square feet.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.720]   It was pretty awesome.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.680]   During Twit, we had projected Twit at about 200 inches.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.600]   Wow, I saw that when I came back.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.280]   And so it was great.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.000]   We were drinking beers and eating pretzels
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.120]   and heckling you virtually.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.600]   Now, to my other left, Mr. Andy, and I go via Skype today.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.120]   Hey, Andy, it's good to see you once again.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.880]   Well, I'm glad that you guys moved out of the cottage
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.920]   because in this economy, I really, really
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.000]   needed the place to just lay low for a few weeks.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.360]   Just until I find something else, I'm so grateful to you.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.880]   This is not going to be like a six to eight months.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.400]   You could stay as long as you want.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.720]   It's actually-- we've got it through May of next year.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.000]   It brings me free free free free free free free free free.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.920]   All right, then.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.880]   We might table this conversation for later.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.360]   Come on, what's out here?
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.400]   I'll just take a digital background plate
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.120]   of the background here.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.560]   That's right.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.800]   We want to give people the impression
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.160]   that you are still coming to us from Boston.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.560]   Everything is still fine with us.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.320]   We've had Lion now for a week.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.800]   How are we feeling about Lion?
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.160]   So far, other than a couple things not working,
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.160]   I think it's been working well.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.960]   I have to admit, I only put it on my small laptop.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.200]   And it's in a dual boot because I'm just still--
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.160]   I tend to do these things very slowly.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.640]   Yeah.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.560]   So for the show, I've been doing it.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.200]   But it's only been like, oh, I've got to do some homework.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.920]   And look at it because most of all our production computers
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.560]   were taken a little bit more time because there's
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.040]   been a lot of production programs that are breaking
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.440]   when you use a large number of incompatible apps.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.760]   There's a lot of incompatible apps.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.200]   And so people just need to remember a lot of people
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.400]   have been going, oh, I installed Lion and nothing worked.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.320]   And you're kind of like, OK, well, you need to watch
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.480]   and make sure that your app is ready to go, especially
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.880]   if you have more expensive apps that
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.080]   take a little longer, especially production apps.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.680]   On the Mac, you need to take a little time
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.960]   and just slowly move into that.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.480]   We have one iMac in the back that has a Lion that
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.800]   we're kind of starting to test.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.280]   I put it on everything.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.680]   I put it on everything.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.400]   How about you, Andy?
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.480]   What is your take so far?
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.200]   Well, it's kind of interesting that you mentioned
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.400]   that you have it on the iMac.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.080]   I have come to realize that I was at a disadvantage
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.080]   because I had the developer edition.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.920]   And it was only on an iMac that I don't use for anything else.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.240]   So that had two different effects because I'm
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.280]   working on a few books and I can't have it on my main MacBook.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.320]   So that was the other situation.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.640]   But I find that it makes a lot more sense to me now
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.840]   that it is on a smaller screen, something
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.760]   with an integrated touchpad than it did on a big iMac
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.440]   with a keyboard over here in the touchpad over there.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.360]   So I find myself using gestures a lot more.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.680]   I find myself using spaces a lot more than I did before.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.200]   And also, the flip side of that, though,
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.840]   is that it also means that things that were only--
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.240]   when I was just testing it out a couple hours a day
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.480]   and writing my review, that were just, oh, gosh,
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.040]   that's kind of weird that it works that way.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.120]   Now that I'm using it 10 hours a day for a week
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.920]   or now, oh, for the love of Holy, logo-stipping, whatever.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.040]   Is that a good for the love of or a bad for the love of?
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.440]   For the love of the explicit tag, yeah.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.240]   I mean, I think--
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.480]   Is that a happy Andy?
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.440]   I'm sorry you were breaking up there.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.080]   Is that a happy Andy?
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.120]   Well, I love line.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.760]   I think it's great.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.800]   I think it's a critical upgrade.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.520]   I think that everybody should-- after they've made absolutely
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.920]   sure that they're not going to be locked out
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.920]   of their favorite apps, I think that everyone should upgrade
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.240]   to it.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.680]   But it's only underscored, my impression,
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.080]   that the invisible scroll bar thing is just--
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.680]   it's not just simply a redesign.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.600]   It's a mistake.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.200]   It's a full-on mistake.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.120]   It's a stupid mistake.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.080]   I've been taking screen captures of every time,
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.480]   especially when I'm on the web.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.000]   I'll find a circumstance under which something simply
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.520]   doesn't work because a panel inside, first as Google Reader,
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.000]   thinks that it has the entire width of the frame.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.800]   So we'll put a little pop-up menu dingus button
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.600]   at the extreme right of that column, which is great
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.880]   because that still works just fine.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.320]   But now if you expect to have a scroll bar there,
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.680]   you will move the mouse pointer to reveal the scroll bar.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.800]   You want to grab that handle to scroll all the way up
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.960]   or right down to where you want to go.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.120]   But as soon as you click down, Google Reader
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.280]   gets the click instead of the scroll bar.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.280]   Right.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.000]   And some of the other apps where it looks--
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.040]   there's a box or window that looks so pretty and so well
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.280]   designed that I think, OK, well, I'm seeing everything
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.520]   that's inside this window.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.880]   Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.360]   It just happens at the bottom of the box,
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.800]   the bottom of the window happens to be a natural division
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.120]   between one section of content and the other.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.200]   You have no idea that there's actually four more pages
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.800]   where the stuff to scroll through.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.320]   That is a loss because this scroll bar used to tell you--
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.760]   used to give you information.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.840]   And yes, and yes, you can always switch that back.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.640]   And yes, I've got two separate issues here.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.040]   You know that I don't like the idea
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.560]   that they reverse the direction of scrolling.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.760]   But I can at least dismiss that as saying, well, you know what?
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.000]   It was arbitrary to begin with.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.080]   It's just after a few weeks I'm going to get used to it.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.480]   I still don't think it's a good idea,
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.440]   but I'll get used to it.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.000]   This idea of invisible scroll bars
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.160]   absolutely flat out, bad, stupid idea
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.480]   that I have to guess was the subject of long arguments
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.600]   that way this simply said we got a ship.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.760]   It's a stupid idea, period.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.400]   You agree, Alex?
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.800]   I haven't gotten used to it either.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.040]   I think Andy said it all.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.360]   I like the scroll bar.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.320]   I'm attached to it.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.480]   I don't like the reverse.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.680]   I don't like the--
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.520]   It's defense.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.360]   In its defense.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.440]   It looks nice.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.200]   It takes up less space, so we have more content.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.520]   We have pretty big screens as it is.
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.440]   I don't feel like I'm running out of content a lot.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.240]   I'm working hard here.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.240]   You're working at it.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:23.840]   I don't like--
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.520]   In its defense.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.840]   --your friend or rebuild your apple cred.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.840]   I-- well, you know, here's a funny thing.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.520]   I like lion.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.720]   I haven't had any problems.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.000]   I got used to the fact that the scroll is reversed,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.360]   and I don't even think about it anymore.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.440]   I do like some things like, for instance, this,
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.200]   where you launch mission control with a three finger up
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.200]   motion.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.760]   I like being able to go from full screen to full screen using--
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.320]   I never used-- I stopped using spaces almost immediately,
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.400]   and now I automatically am using it all the time.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.040]   I think I'm starting to like it, to be honest with you.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.400]   And I've lived with the scroll bar thing.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.800]   I think I maybe just don't have the habit
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.000]   that you guys did of using the scroll bar directly.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.200]   Because that's where you-- that's the biggest loss, right?
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.800]   Is that you can't just-- it's harder to click on it.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.840]   Well, not only does it make it harder to click on,
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.480]   but there are many instances in which things now do not
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.680]   work because of this design concede.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.200]   OK.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.800]   That happens a lot during the web,
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.760]   but it also happens more often than you
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.760]   would think in real apps, where if it makes something
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.480]   stop working, bad idea.
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.000]   Or rather, you have to have an exceptionally good reason
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.800]   for doing it.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.440]   And when you say that, yeah, but we
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.760]   need all that extra real estate on our 2,000 pixel
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.840]   by 1,500 pixel display, I mean goodness,
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.040]   that would be a whole extra six dots that are going to waste.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.760]   Like, yeah, again, it makes perfect sense on an iPhone
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.880]   screen does not make any sense whatsoever,
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.400]   even on a MacBook Air screen.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.280]   I hear you tell it, because I'm--
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.280]   I absolutely agree with you on spaces.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.040]   Again, when I move to a machine with a smaller screen,
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.240]   that's when spaces really comes into play.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.240]   It doesn't feel like a 7-6 screen.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.200]   All of this stuff seems good on the air.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.000]   And it's better maybe on the air than it is on the 27-inch
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.680]   screen.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.000]   Absolutely.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.280]   I think that that's the case.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.480]   And I think they expect to sell a lot of 11-inch airs.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.240]   So they're kind of building an OS for the airs
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.720]   and for the iPads, right?
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.000]   One million copies sold on the first day.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.960]   It's a good start.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.280]   How about the upgrade process?
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.360]   Has that been pretty painless?
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.720]   I mean, I actually haven't done a clean install yet.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.880]   I've done nothing but an upgrade in place.
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.760]   I did make a USB key right away.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.360]   And I mentioned this last week, but a reminder.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.680]   You can't make the USB key once you install a line.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.720]   It deletes the installer.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.160]   So you have to get the installer out.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.200]   I think Don McAllister did a great little tutorial on that
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:38.520]   as well.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.280]   He has a screencast.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.280]   He has a screencast on it.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:40.720]   A screencast on it.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.200]   OK.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.080]   But I think the install went surprisingly smoothly.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.040]   And the fact that a million people now have downloaded this
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.880]   and presumably installed it-- and I haven't heard a single
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.920]   howl of pain.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.840]   Any upgrade issues that I've heard?
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.560]   Anybody heard it?
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.400]   I didn't do a clean install even after I said I would.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:57.920]   I know.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.560]   I was like, oh, I just want to see it.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.520]   And so I just put it on.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.520]   And it works.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.520]   And it works.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.040]   There are a few simple issues.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.320]   There are some permissions issues that often happen
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.320]   when you do a regular upgrade.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.680]   There are also some permissions issues
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.800]   that have to do with the fact that now the OS interacts
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.280]   with files in a different way.
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.320]   So things that you'll want to do something to an app.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.320]   You could have done look at a split.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:21.960]   It's no leopard.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.240]   Now we'll tell you-- I'm sorry to have permission to do that.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.240]   I don't.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.560]   I have to admit I'm not crazy about the new Finder conceit
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.320]   of all my docs.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.880]   I want to see the computer.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.000]   And you have to go back into settings
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.280]   so that you could see the computer.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:38.000]   Otherwise, there's really no way from Finder
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.560]   to get to your computer's contents, which is--
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.800]   I'm not sure if I could.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.640]   That's more of a style thing that gave me
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.680]   a little bit of a blip.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.440]   But I understand the logic they're going to.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.160]   They moved-- when I'm expecting-- when
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.160]   I haven't attached USB device like a memory card,
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.640]   I'm expecting it to be in a certain place.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.120]   Now it's actually a different place.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.560]   I actually-- I don't see it in other favorites.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.640]   Is it hidden somewhere that I'm missing?
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.320]   I'm sorry?
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.200]   I don't see any of your favorites.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.920]   Is it under devices?
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.120]   OK, so I can't see-- in other words, I can't see my hard drive.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.520]   I want to see my hard drive.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.840]   OK.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.840]   OK, yeah, that is a level of abstraction
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.720]   that they decide to get a new way with, which I actually think--
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.640]   well, no, which I actually think is a good thing.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.920]   It's not that abstract.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.520]   OK, well, my hard drive.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.880]   But that's where we're old folks.
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.360]   I mean, we want to know what we think about it.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:21.860]   Really?
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:22.720]   But I think part of this--
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.720]   well, OK, I want to go to the system library file.
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:30.080]   I defy you in the default behavior of the finder to find--
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.840]   I could find the--
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.640]   Leo, well, now it's crowd.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.320]   I could find-- now I don't know what's happened.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.720]   It's broken.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.760]   But find-- go to-- because you frequently, maybe I'm only
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.200]   the one who actually have corrupted my finder.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.720]   Let me reopen it.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.240]   Maybe I'm the only one who does this.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.200]   But system library-- so you get there from the root.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.680]   How do I get to root directory here?
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.680]   I can get to Leo.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.240]   You got a Macintosh drive, don't you see that?
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:58.040]   And there's no more, by the way, as far as I could tell,
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.040]   library folder.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:11:59.800]   But where are you just at?
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.480]   MacIntyre's folder.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.480]   And the home folder.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.480]   Didn't we see the Macintosh?
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.280]   Yeah, because I had changed the--
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.840]   where when you open a new one--
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.080]   Well, you changed that.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.240]   Go under finder preferences, and you'll find it.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:08.640]   I did.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.640]   I changed the preferences.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:15.160]   But by default, there's no way to go from Leo, my home
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.000]   folder, up a level.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.200]   But that's kind of OK, because there's something
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.640]   that was told to me back when the transition from Mac OS
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.240]   to a core of Unix went--
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:30.240]   an Apple engineer told me that if our philosophy about the Unix
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.200]   switchovers, that if you don't want to see the Unix
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.440]   and you see it, you fail.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.640]   If you want to see it, but you can't find it,
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.600]   then we've also sailed.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.360]   It's not that hard.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.320]   I mean, you go to the Go menu, you can find it.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.120]   It means it's coming in.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.680]   People who have that sort of sophistication,
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.560]   who want access to the root library folder,
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.680]   they can easily-- I think they can pretty easily find it.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.280]   But it's not going to confuse people
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.520]   who are going to maybe save a file someplace outside
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.240]   of their home directory, which they can do.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.440]   And then they can't find it again,
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.800]   because it's not in their documents for a little square.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.440]   It's default behavior is you're in your home directory.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.120]   And I think the default behavior also is if you're not geeky.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.440]   The idea is that many people never
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.440]   need to see their system folder.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.120]   And so the idea is to keep them out of it.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.000]   Don't go there.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.920]   As a father of a three and a half roll.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.720]   That's a good find.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.320]   Parts of my TV interface that I didn't even know existed.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:15.920]   That's a good point.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.600]   Everything else, I'm kind of glad that the system folder is
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.520]   no longer available, because every time my kids open up
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.000]   my iPhone, I've got different desktop images
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.200]   and different pieces.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.000]   And they've changed a bunch of settings.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.440]   So I think that if you're talking about a school
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.600]   or a corporation or whatever--
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.200]   No, you're right.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.680]   By default, hiding all of that stuff
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.880]   just keeps you full out of trouble.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.680]   It's exactly what Andy said, which
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:41.240]   is if you're smart enough to want to use the full system,
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.400]   there's ways to get to it.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.840]   But it's just not by default.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.080]   It's hidden.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.480]   Also, I think it's a good trend to try to--
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.880]   what I was saying before about abstracting the file system,
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.240]   where it's no longer really important
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.520]   that I have a certain file that's inside a pictures folder
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.080]   inside my user directory, inside my documents folder.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.080]   So long as whenever I need this file,
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.880]   the operating system can help me find it.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.640]   So I think it's kind of cool that we now have at least
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.360]   an alternate view on my Mac that simply says,
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.360]   I know that at some point I wrote this outline.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.200]   I don't know where it is.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.280]   Passwords you have--
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:11.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.160]   I'm sorry I'm looking a bit clumsy right now.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.080]   When I'm talking-- in the old setup,
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.840]   if you guys were talking, I could still hear you
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.920]   so I could stop talking.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.640]   But now it's hard for me to hear you when you're--
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.760]   It's not full duplex.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.160]   Yeah, there's like-- you start--
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.200]   I get essentially, I think, from my point of view--
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.040]   oh, well, actually, maybe that's me.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.040]   OK, that's right.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:30.880]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.520]   I'm saying now the echo is diminished,
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.400]   but now it sort of chops out as I'm talking.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.960]   So we're having--
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.720]   It's a new studio.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.880]   And normally in a new television studio,
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.840]   you do a month-long shakedown cruise
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.200]   before you go on the air.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:47.560]   No.
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.960]   This is it.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.080]   We're in the month-long.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.840]   For the next 30 days, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.280]   this is a Twit Beta 2.0.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.560]   You guys remember the days?
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.520]   Oh, it's worse than the cottage for a long time.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.520]   Let's take a break.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.920]   We're going to come back with more.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.480]   We are our first Mac break weekly from the Brickhouse studios.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.000]   Eileen Rivera is running the board.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.840]   We call it the Master Control.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.000]   She's doing great on the MCU.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.920]   It's nice for me because you know what?
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.640]   I used to have to be doing all this stuff,
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.160]   and now I'm just sitting here.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.040]   It's actually kind of boring.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:21.840]   I don't know.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.680]   We're going to come back and leave us like playing some games.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.840]   And we'll buy one of those Fisher Price busy boxes.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.880]   Put it in a busy box.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:27.920]   Buttons do nothing but--
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:31.040]   [HONKING]
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.360]   That'll make me happy, Andy.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.720]   Always keep the talent happy, Eileen.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.280]   That's the first lesson being produced.
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.080]   Yes.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.440]   Very, very true.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.360]   Just give me buttons.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.480]   They don't have to do anything.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.760]   Just buttons to push.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.080]   Hey, I do want to talk a little bit about our friends at Citrix.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.320]   They make the great product go to meeting.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.440]   And if you've never used go to meeting, man, it is great.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.640]   Can I talk about--
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.040]   no, I can't.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.640]   I'm still in the aid.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.840]   OK, we'll just try it out.
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.720]   That's all I'm going to say.
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.640]   Something exciting is coming.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.240]   You know, I am probably in--
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.440]   Do you know what I'm talking about?
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.520]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.480]   It's very exciting.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.520]   I'm excited about it, but I'm trying to move on,
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.480]   because I don't know I've been left out of the loop.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.360]   Anyway, but--
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.560]   Can I not talk about that yet?
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.200]   Is that still endy aid, Lisa?
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.900]   The thing and the thing that we did-- we did it like two weeks ago,
[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.400]   we saw it.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.640]   Oh, well, here's the deal.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.040]   It's going to launch soon if it hasn't launched already.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.480]   You could try it right now if you go to go to meeting.com.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.360]   This is actually a good tease.
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.240]   Just go--
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.240]   And go to the free for a month.
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:36.240]   Right.
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.160]   And you'll be able to try this new thing.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.680]   It's awesome.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.160]   I mean, real awesome sauce.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.280]   Go to meeting for Citrix.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.360]   These guys know what they're doing.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.120]   They've got great remote access solutions.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.440]   128-bit SSL.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.720]   It's easy to set up a meeting ahead of time.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.760]   Or even on the fly, you could do it via your email.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.080]   Because conference calling is built in,
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.440]   both on the telephone, you know, you get a conference bridge
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.160]   and VoIP.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.000]   So on a computer or on your iPad,
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.720]   you can use the built-in microphone and speakers
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.360]   and do the conference call that way.
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.200]   So increasingly, we don't even--
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.560]   even if it's just that what we--
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.680]   we don't have anything to show, all of our conference calls
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.400]   now are go to meeting.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.920]   And that way, if we want to fire up a screen, we can.
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.240]   It's so easy to set up.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.760]   It's easier to set up a conference bridge that way
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.000]   than any other way.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.320]   And we just click a button.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.840]   We use go to meeting for all of our--
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.800]   we probably-- we have big group talks
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.600]   and all kinds of between different people.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.880]   And we end up using all of them, a lot of competitors,
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.920]   which I'll leave out.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.840]   I've tried them all.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.800]   I know what you're talking about.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.880]   Our clients will have, well, we're going to use this.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.160]   We're going to use that.
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.560]   And I have to say that go to meeting
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:40.840]   is definitely the smoothest operation of all the online
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.680]   meeting software that we've been using.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.760]   Let me just put it this way.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.000]   If you've used Google Hangout and you've said, boy,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   that would be a nice addition to go to meeting.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.400]   [GROANS]
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.840]   You haven't seen that yet, have you?
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.320]   I have not.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.440]   And the quality is so good.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.360]   Go to meeting.
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.280]   Just get help.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.040]   Andy, we should next time-- we're going to go to meeting.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.960]   This is why no one puts the O on NDA.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.280]   I don't NDA me.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.200]   That's just-- I lose slips.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.200]   See?
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.040]   Go to meeting.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.000]   Go to meeting.com, use a promo code Macbreak.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.960]   You can try it free for 30 days, and you will get this feature.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.760]   I think in the next few days, I think--
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.680]   I got a PR email about it.
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.720]   That must mean it's soon.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:20.720]   Soon.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.220]   Soon.
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.400]   Go to meeting.com, promo code Macbreak.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.440]   I'm just telling.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.160]   Try it.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.000]   I was just saying, try it.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.280]   I'm not allowed to talk about this,
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.040]   but try it.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.640]   You've got to beach house in Normandy.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.200]   I expect a lot of visitors to strut the windows.
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.360]   I'm getting any more.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.880]   Really, I'm getting--
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.600]   sometime in June, it might get a little hectic.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:46.080]   I'm just looking through here to see if I could find the PR
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.760]   message that they sent me.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.600]   Because I think that-- I think it's public.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.760]   Don't show my screen, because I don't want to show my email
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.960]   from-- go to meeting.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.240]   Anyway, moving along, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.320]   this is Mac Break Weekly.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.040]   Andy Inako is here via Skype.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.920]   So the picture is not as good as it's going to be
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.920]   once we get the video cast working.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.680]   I like the Andy right here, though.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.320]   Isn't it cool?
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.600]   It's much more natural, because I was always
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.200]   kind of like turned like this, looking at him.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.840]   And it actually--
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.160]   from a--
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.120]   I'm a little--
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.040]   It's a little scary.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.160]   We actually-- we have to raise it a little bit
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.320]   and increase his head size.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.320]   But other than that, it's just like he's here.
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.960]   He's going to increase his head size.
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.440]   There we go.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:29.840]   There we go.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.840]   Not too big.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:33.920]   I do like this.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.760]   The whole idea is because--
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:36.520]   OK, great.
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.440]   That's scary.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.600]   That's terrifying.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.080]   I am terrified now.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.600]   It's now the eye.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.040]   I never knew you had green eyes, dear.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.080]   Just like David Bowie.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.440]   One green, one brown.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.040]   Does it compel you to do what I tell you to do?
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:49.800]   Yes.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.280]   Yes, master.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.480]   Yes, master Andy.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.200]   What is it?
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.360]   What is thy bidding on my master?
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.960]   [GASPS]
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.600]   Are you sad you didn't get to go to Comic-Con
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.480]   with those Wolverine whiskers?
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.720]   No, because it's whatever going to Comic-Con.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.640]   It's like, yes, yes, exactly.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.840]   I grew up sideburns.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.480]   I walk around every day in my real job, my real life,
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.760]   just for three hours at Comic-Con.
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.360]   This is how I look.
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.040]   Although I was really, really pleased.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.440]   I was at Chipotle a week ago.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.360]   So in Comic-Con, it would be on my sideburns.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.560]   Usually, if they name a name, it's usually either
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.720]   that guy from Blue's Traveler or Wolverine.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.600]   But he said, you look just like Isaac Asimov.
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.680]   Oh, yes, you do.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.480]   How you guacamolean chips, sir.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.440]   That was the nicest thing.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.560]   Those are Asimovian.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.560]   Those whiskers.
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.360]   That's why I had a way for him to die before I can give him.
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.440]   The long waiting--
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.600]   I have Asimov's whiskers.
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.360]   Cosplay.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.080]   Isn't that what they call it?
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.000]   Cosplay, where you do the costume?
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:50.320]   Yes.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.200]   Did you see the slave Leia PSA, public service announcement?
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:57.920]   No, I did not.
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.520]   The Cosplay public service announcement?
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.200]   Please don't.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.680]   Yes, please.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.680]   Every year, millions of women dresses slave Leia,
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.520]   and only to go to a party and be embarrassed.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.400]   And everybody else who's dressed like slave Leia.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.560]   There are many choices, please.
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.200]   I told a friend of mine that next year,
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.920]   I think that you're only going to be seeing slave Leia
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.880]   as done ironically.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.000]   No, I'm not slave Leia.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.480]   I'm ironic slave Leia.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.760]   There's a difference.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.240]   I'm steampunk slave Leia.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:28.120]   I'm Star Trek's Dave Leia.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.560]   Is there anything else to say about Lion?
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:30.640]   I have to say it.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:34.680]   Oddly enough, it sounds like I am in the minority once again.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.880]   I like it.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.720]   I'm putting it on every--
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:37.520]   I didn't say I didn't like it.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.000]   I love it.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.200]   And I would never--
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.320]   I still have one machine that's still on Snow Leopard
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.920]   just so that I can take screenshots and do comparisons,
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:45.680]   stuff like that.
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.600]   But I cannot wait to upgrade it.
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.080]   I think that it still saves the most significant upgrade
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.080]   they've done since 10.3, 10.4.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.320]   Especially in terms of what the features that users will
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.280]   benefit from.
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.040]   I agree.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.280]   And I was like, oh, all night saying,
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.840]   is on the outliner upgraded?
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.240]   Yes, on the outliner upgraded.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.960]   Is reader now available for a while?
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:07.360]   Yes, it's really--
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.840]   Oh, yeah, the reader upgrade is nice.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:09.920]   Yeah, the full screen and everything.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.240]   All these great apps that are designed for full screen now,
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.240]   it's like, oh, welcome to the future.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.480]   No, I think as we get apps that are lion compatible,
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.200]   they're only a handful that I use.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.800]   Mostly they're drivers, low levels, like carbonite.
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.600]   And it's because they change how the file system works
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.200]   and the versioning so deeply that a program like carbonite,
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.080]   oh, we've got to change a lot of things.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.720]   But I think all of that's going to happen.
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.840]   And I do firmly believe that I'm going to learn to love it.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.480]   It's just, as it said right now, and so there's
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.640]   lots of little things that I'm just--
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.160]   And we're dipping our toe in very carefully
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.600]   because of so many production apps.
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.000]   When you deal with the Adobe apps,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.080]   and a lot of the other things that a lot of those
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.320]   compatibility things, you have to kind of be very careful of.
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.920]   Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.720]   Now let's see what else happened in the Mac world.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.480]   I think we talked about this last week.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.760]   The idea-- Apple's got what?
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.400]   70 plus billion in cash.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.920]   The rumor was that they were going to buy Hulu.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.240]   We talked briefly about it.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.600]   Now, according to all things D, they're saying,
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.760]   don't you hold your breath on that Apple Hulu deal?
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.880]   I don't get the Hulu thing at all.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.480]   I don't get why Apple would buy Hulu.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.400]   This doesn't make sense, right?
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.920]   We kind of agree with this.
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.480]   Yeah, I mean, it doesn't do it perfectly.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.840]   Because you would normally you would buy them
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.000]   because they have a bunch of relationships.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.640]   But the reality is the problem Hulu has
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.400]   is that all those relationships are breaking down.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.080]   Right.
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.240]   So it doesn't necessarily make any sense.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:25.560]   Yeah, all right.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.560]   And the relationship is they don't need technology.
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.360]   We also, following up on another story
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:34.400]   we covered last week, the fake Apple stores in China.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.200]   Those are awesome.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.360]   Even the employees.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:40.920]   Even the employees were kind of angry saying, no, we're real.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.920]   But the Chinese government has swooped in and closed
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.240]   at least a few of them.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.720]   I didn't know this, but in Kunming, there were five or six.
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.520]   We knew of two.
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.600]   There were a lot of them.
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.440]   It really is almost like it's part of the commercial culture
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.240]   over there.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:01.280]   Because when I was in Beijing, I wanted to go see the copy
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.280]   of the pirated electronics--
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.040]   Supermark.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:06.520]   And they're not--
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.400]   It's in the mall.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.480]   You can find it exactly.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.600]   And I was like, well, can I take pictures?
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:11.200]   Oh, sure, absolutely.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:11.680]   No, sure.
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.080]   Take pictures of all of our stuff.
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.320]   The more people know about this place,
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.680]   where you can buy an iPhone for $39.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.760]   Absolutely, like, OK.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.760]   So this is something different.
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.880]   Apparently, the Chinese government
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.240]   says we didn't close the stores because they
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.240]   sold fake Apple products.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.320]   We closed the stores because their licenses, their permits,
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.040]   were a suspect.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.320]   Because they were selling fake Apple products.
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:36.880]   Well, I don't know.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.440]   I mean, I'm with you Andy.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.960]   I don't think the Chinese government has really
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.640]   been a lot to protect property rights of Western companies.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.680]   I think they don't on purpose.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.680]   It's part of the business model.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.640]   This is the official statement.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.360]   Media should not misunderstand the situation
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.960]   and jump to conclusions.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.280]   Some overseas media has made it appear
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.080]   the stores sold fake Apple products.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:01.960]   He's not exactly denying it.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.680]   He didn't know exactly that.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.040]   Just because they look exactly like Apple products
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.960]   does not mean that they are counterfeit Apple products.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.000]   China has taken great steps to enforce intellectual property
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   rights, and the stores weren't selling fake products.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.280]   We're just investigating whether Apple had applied
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.440]   with the Chinese government to have its store design
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.840]   and layout protected by law.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.320]   Because Apple would never does that kind of thing.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.560]   The thing about Apple is that they're not
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:27.200]   very careful about trademarks or patents.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.680]   I just can't imagine them ever bothering
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.920]   to go through that little piece of paper.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:32.520]   So we don't know.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.280]   Maybe they were selling real Apple products.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.760]   And then the question is, are you allowed to duplicate--
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.280]   if Apple said, please don't duplicate our store layout,
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.320]   then China would enforce it.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.200]   We just don't know.
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.200]   They do have four stores in Beijing,
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.360]   and Shanghai.
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.880]   They're planning up in several Apple, the real Apple.
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:55.200]   This company sales in Greater China--
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.720]   this was from the last week's earnings call--
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:03.600]   $3.8 billion for the quarter, growth of 600% from year to year.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.760]   So it's a big market.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:08.520]   It's a market they probably don't want to lose.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.840]   Well, and it's still--
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.640]   I mean, Apple-- I've read somewhere that Apple--
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.360]   the brand in China is actually doing extremely well.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.400]   I mean, and it's going to keep on growing like that.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.760]   Over?
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.040]   I'm going to do this for Andy.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.960]   Over?
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.960]   Oh.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:26.920]   I feel like-- go ahead.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.040]   Flaunt your hand license.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.840]   Some people get a 40-meter radio, and then suddenly they're,
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.120]   ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.600]   Tell me about-- I love explaining you
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.480]   about how this rectifier and this icon, they can't
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.360]   set as better than the rectifier in the old one.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:44.680]   This is Kilo Hotel 6, Quebec.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.680]   I don't know.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:46.680]   I can't remember.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.880]   Do I have to send you a postcard acknowledging--
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.880]   Yeah, QSL.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.080]   --that I was just thinking, you're you.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:50.600]   Boston?
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.680]   Actually, I'm not telling anybody what my call sign is,
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.360]   because it's so god-awful.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.880]   Apparently, you can have bad call signs.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.600]   I called the people that do the vanity call signs,
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.640]   and she said, oh, yeah, you should change that.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.000]   So, oh, god, that's horrible.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.680]   So I am changing it to--
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:11.920]   we've applied for a whiskey 6 tango, whiskey tango,
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:12.920]   which is--
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.640]   W Vista.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:19.120]   It was a K. I can't remember.
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.640]   I'm actually not trying to remember it,
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.880]   because I want to forget it, so that I can have-- it's
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:23.520]   traumatic.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.120]   But we're going to have W60WT.
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.520]   When I say we, I mean me.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.480]   You can't use it.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.200]   Just in case you were thinking of that.
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.820]   Did you see there's going to be a grand central station
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:37.800]   Apple store?
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.640]   It's supposed to be the biggest ever in the world.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.720]   Now, grand central station is gorgeous.
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.160]   Are they going to-- what are they going to do?
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.400]   Are they going to-- well, look at this.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.640]   Here's a rendering.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.320]   They're going to keep the walls, keep the lights,
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.800]   keep the chandeliers.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.520]   So a lot of the deco stuff will stay.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:57.680]   You know, I could see if this worked,
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:01.160]   I could see them doing it in a lot of the big train stations.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.680]   There's a lot of these big open spaces.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:06.280]   I know there's one in Philadelphia's Grand Central Station,
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.360]   or whatever, the 33 station.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.760]   And where there's big open areas,
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.000]   and they're not really using it for anything.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.080]   And it would be perfect for stores, because you're traveling.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.120]   So really, this isn't used.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.560]   Like passengers, all right.
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:15.960]   Is this--
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.120]   Not anymore.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.680]   Is Grand Central closed?
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.000]   No, no, they're just-- I don't know.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.800]   It's mostly a commuter hub.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:26.320]   Even if you're-- it's where you go from commuter rails,
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.680]   like Outer Burrows and New Jersey and--
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.320]   So this is the main concourse.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.440]   And it's all-- and it's like the whole one side
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:38.920]   of the main concourse, 23,000 square feet.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:39.760]   Oh, I see.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.360]   It's above the main concourse.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.840]   It's around the balcony level.
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:43.640]   I get it.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.120]   Well, and a lot of these--
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.400]   Actually, that's cool.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.800]   So you're looking down on the current stations.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.560]   And when I take Amtrak a lot, and if you go to almost any really
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.600]   good train station that was built on the teens
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.000]   or the 20s and 30s, you will see that it was originally
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.600]   designed to be just the welcoming concourse
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.560]   for the entire city.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.600]   It was like, we're going to put our best foot forward
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.520]   and show you what a great city Philadelphia is
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:09.160]   by having you emerge in this cathedral-like structure.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:12.280]   And then after train travel sort of paired off,
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.600]   all this space did not become necessary.
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.080]   It's not as though you can't tear down
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.920]   8 million tons of marble because it's
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.040]   an extra reception area.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.400]   So that's a nice pair of wrought iron gates get closed in.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.640]   And now you can just simply open them up
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.040]   and do other cool things with them.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.280]   But I'm kind of curious to see, especially a place
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:31.080]   like Grand Central.
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.880]   There's a great documentary about just the sort of sweeps
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.520]   that the police have to do every night.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.720]   And the relationship that they have with the homeless community,
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.280]   where they don't necessarily want
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:42.080]   to be bullying people with nightsticks.
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.480]   They acknowledge the public space.
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.120]   But they have to make sure that people don't sort of camp out.
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.200]   They can rest.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.360]   But they can't camp out.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.040]   So you add not only a place that's
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.960]   already sort of focused for people to sort of be there
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.400]   all the time, but also you add Wi-Fi.
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.640]   So even the people who are not homeless
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.320]   are going to be encouraged to be in the Apple store
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.360]   all the time.
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.760]   So I don't think this is going to be necessarily
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.760]   a problem.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.040]   But I'm interested to see what kind of plenty they're
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:09.040]   going to do to make sure that if there are folks in there
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:13.560]   that clearly have no desire to ever get an iPod ever,
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.000]   or an iPad ever, are they going to be OK with them hanging
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.240]   up for six or seven hours while they wait for the late train
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.120]   to go in?
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.200]   The chatroom's telling me this is the balcony,
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.960]   is a restaurant right now, or a food court right now.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.320]   So not a huge loss.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.800]   But I think the homeless people would be--
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.680]   what they should do is put little sleeping bags under those
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.000]   tables.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.560]   I think it'd be very comfortable.
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.040]   You have some great--
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.760]   some nice place bags.
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:35.760]   So it's bean bags.
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.680]   You get those bean bags and throw them out there.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.440]   Actually, that could be good marketing for Apple,
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.600]   because it'll make them look like there's always anticipation
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.440]   for the iPad 3.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.280]   People waiting.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.480]   The light has already started.
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.400]   That's what you do.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.360]   You enlist the homeless people to make a permanent line.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.080]   It does make it a lot easier to go by to get in line,
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.400]   because now you can just get on a train
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.680]   from a lot of different places.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:56.680]   Right.
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.600]   And you just show up, and I imagine this will be a hot spot.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:04.080]   So at 23,000 feet, they say it's 3,000 square feet bigger
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.520]   than their flagship store at Fifth Avenue.
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:10.920]   I don't know how big the London store is.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:11.800]   That's a pretty big one.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:12.160]   It's huge.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.400]   And it's gorgeous.
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.160]   That's-- 23,000 square feet is big.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:16.680]   Yeah.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.520]   That's a monster.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.040]   Well, especially if they don't do it,
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.680]   and if they don't build it as a series of levels,
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.280]   if it's just one big open plan--
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.400]   which it looks like it is.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.560]   I mean, the great thing about the region street
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.520]   store is that there are like three different levels to it.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.920]   It doesn't really communicate as a big space of dead air.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.360]   It's like, do I want to go to the theater?
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.480]   Do I want to go to iPad, Latin?
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.160]   And Petron's raised a good point.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.880]   What about-- would this make Apple free Wi-Fi
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.680]   throughout Grand Central?
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:41.880]   That would be cool.
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.920]   That would be really expensive.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.240]   I don't see how they can stop it.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.720]   Well, they get it all the way into a certain area around them.
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:48.080]   Right.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:48.520]   But at the--
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:49.920]   Oh, cool.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:52.760]   They would also have to build stuff inside the Grand Hall
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.280]   and all the staircases in order to make it work.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.240]   So I'm not sure that they would want to lease
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:01.920]   that sort of access from the rest of the space.
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.560]   Let's see here.
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:03.560]   We're going to take a break, come back,
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:08.400]   and talk a little bit about the flight of the apps
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.600]   from the App Store.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.000]   Apple's in-app policies go in effect
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.320]   or went in effect a couple of weeks ago,
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.800]   and now they're starting to enforce it.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.160]   And a lot of people are responding to that.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.440]   We're getting close to launch of not only iOS 5,
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.680]   but the rumors are strong about a new iPhone.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.560]   We'll talk about that a lot more.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.600]   Andy Inako is here from the Chicago Sun Times
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.760]   and the Celestial Waste of bandwidth.com.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.200]   You said I'd have a bottle of Mexican Coke
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.320]   in front of my screen.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.080]   Oh, we should-- can we get the Mexican Coke for Andy
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.760]   to look at longingly?
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.280]   You can't drink it.
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.600]   I can't drink it, but at least I can look at it longingly.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.640]   We'll get a straw.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.480]   Also, how sensitive there's one nearby print.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.840]   I'll just have a little straw come up out of the--
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.440]   out of the Coke here so we can just--
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.360]   that would be kind of fun, right?
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.720]   Put it right there for him.
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:51.840]   Drill hole in the table so you can
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.360]   like slowly drink it.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.200]   Hey, it's all part of the news service
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.400]   here at the Twit Brick House.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.360]   And I believe we have some in our refrigerator down
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.680]   in the basement if there's not some up here.
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.120]   Is your fridge working in the basement too?
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:02.640]   Yes.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.280]   We've got fridges all over this place.
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.080]   Holy gosh, I should probably ask, do I get rollover coax?
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:10.120]   Like, when I come in like next month or the month after,
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.280]   like, will there be like nine coax waiting for me
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.640]   because I've been rolling over coax.
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.880]   I want rollover coax.
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.360]   Yeah, I'll pay the extra $3 a month for the rollover plant.
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.320]   Unconsumed coax, rollover coax.
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.920]   It's a whole new idea.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.080]   I like it.
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:24.480]   We're going to take a break and talk to you
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.200]   a little bit about hover.com.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.280]   I love hover.com.
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:31.040]   You know, my new domain registrar.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.720]   We have a special offer for the Twit network only.
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.600]   And also, I'm pleased to say, you know,
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:39.960]   we started using hover because they don't upsell you.
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.720]   You know, it's affordable, but you
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:44.800]   get who is privacy, for instance, as part of the service.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.240]   It's not 100 clicks to buy a domain.
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:52.840]   I just bought for my wife, I think, fancypants.com.
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.000]   I think that-- no, no, wait a minute.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.120]   I was about to say, that's a pretty good one.
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:56.680]   It was.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.120]   I wouldn't expect to be able to get fancypants.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.200]   Something with tunics.
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.040]   Fancy tunics?
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:00.960]   Fancy tunics.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.480]   I've got something with tunics.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.360]   She thinks she might have a tunic business.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.400]   And I was actually at a restaurant.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:11.000]   And I bought it on hover.com on the phone at a restaurant.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.200]   She said, no, because she said, I have this idea.
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.720]   And I said, well, I'll get the domain when I get home.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.080]   She said, no, somebody will steal it.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.360]   I said, well, we haven't announced it or anything.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.240]   She said, no.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.240]   So I went to hover.com.
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:25.560]   I was able to do it on my smartphone, like that.
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.120]   Do they have an app or do they have a--
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.240]   No, I just didn't have an website.
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.080]   They have a website so clean that it just works fine.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:30.640]   That's great.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:32.080]   It's very straightforward.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.560]   They also have these great videos.
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.000]   I'm going to show you these new-- let me show you a video.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.680]   This is from their Help site on Hover's new domain
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:40.680]   management tools.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:44.040]   They've really updated the domain and email management.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.640]   And I'll just show you a little bit of this video
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:47.720]   while I talk about Hover.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:51.720]   It's easier now to manage domains, domain privacy,
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:56.280]   domain forwards, email accounts, making changes in bulk
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.680]   for domain renewals, privacy, and password updates.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.520]   This was-- I have to say one thing that I wanted to hover
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:05.080]   to do was to get a great dashboard app for managing
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:05.560]   your domain.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:09.560]   So here we're simply buying a domain right there.
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:14.680]   This is the three click and you've bought it system, which
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:15.880]   I have to say I really like.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:20.600]   But now you've got Mr. Wesley Pants, whatever is the crew.
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.800]   Look at this, how easy it is to manage this.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.800]   Boom.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.400]   Really simple.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.400]   They've got a lot of Ajax-y nice features in here.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.600]   So here's the deal.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:33.560]   If you are moving your sites over to hover.com, it's $10,
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:37.320]   but you get full additional year on your domain name.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:40.640]   And they have .co as well as the traditional.com
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:42.760]   and all of that.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:46.520]   .us.ca as well if you're in Canada.
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.200]   That concierge transfer service for all your domains,
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:53.360]   normally $25, they just do it all for you free to tweet listeners.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.320]   Just call hover, give them your username and password,
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.600]   and they'll take it from there.
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.560]   They'll get the authorization codes.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.480]   They'll unlock the sites.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.800]   They'll deal with all the emails.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.960]   It really is much easier.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.480]   I did it by hand, and I'm still doing it.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:07.160]   It's such a pain in the butt.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:11.760]   Mr.WensleyDale.com/CheeseShop is all ready to go.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.200]   I finally got some Wednesday deal cheese.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:13.600]   It's quite nice.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.800]   It's quite good.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:15.440]   Quite sharp.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.880]   Gromit.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.960]   So call hovers customer service numbers
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.120]   right on the website, hover.com.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.560]   And say, hey, I heard it on Twitter.
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.440]   I want that free transfer.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.880]   And if you need a new domain, you'll
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:29.320]   get 10% off by going to Macbreak.hover.com
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:34.560]   and using the offer code Macbreak, M-A-C-B-R-E-A-K, obviously.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.680]   I love this new domain management system.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:40.840]   Hover.com, Macbreak.hover.com, save 10% right now
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:44.240]   on your new domain or move your domains
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:47.280]   and have them do it for you for free.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.480]   I have some bad news.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.200]   What?
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.240]   The Mexican Coke is all gone.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.560]   The Mexican Coke is all gone.
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.200]   We have this.
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.200]   So bring it over.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:56.480]   We have this.
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.720]   This is coming to you right now.
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:01.120]   Is this made with true cane sugar?
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:04.000]   Can I have a straw for Mr. Inaka?
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.400]   No, that's fine.
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.680]   If it's not--
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:07.720]   If it's some-- sorry.
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:15.000]   If it's so lucky, I really don't know what to say.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.400]   I was like, well, we didn't need that TV.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.960]   In fact, not only was the top on there,
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:19.520]   but we had a good gas bubble built up.
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.240]   But I'm not going to drink out of the bottle.
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.280]   That's rude.
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.040]   And probably somebody else has already done that.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:24.920]   Watch this.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.760]   I just put it behind the TV and it goes away.
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:27.960]   D'nah.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:28.800]   It's magic.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:33.760]   I should do that with more crap.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:36.560]   Just put it behind the TV and it'll--
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.000]   no, never mind.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.280]   I guess Chad has to be there waiting for that.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:43.680]   So iOS-- we know iOS is coming out in the fall.
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.320]   And it would only make sense that there'd
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.040]   be a new iPhone at the same time.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:51.640]   And now, boy Genius Report is saying, yes.
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.960]   Mid-September-- early to mid-September launch
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:55.880]   for the next iPhone.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.600]   I don't know if it's the iPhone 5, the 4S.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:00.680]   But that makes sense, yeah?
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.320]   Rumor is 8 megapixel camera?
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.760]   Ah.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:06.120]   Higher resolution display?
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.680]   I can't imagine them making it much higher.
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.680]   It's pretty high-quality as you mean.
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:12.120]   One thing I know we won't get is 4G.
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:14.640]   I can't see 4G this fall.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.960]   AT&T began communicating with its employees yesterday
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:20.840]   that the, quote, "companies retailed store expected
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:24.360]   to see a great deal of foot traffic in September."
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.640]   Workers have been asked to finish any employee training
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.560]   as quickly as they can.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.200]   Makes sense.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:35.000]   Mac Rumors said that Apple is recruiting former employees
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.560]   to return part-time between August 15 and September 15.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.720]   Could just be back to school sales, of course.
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:47.440]   iOS 5, the latest version just came out, 4-point.
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.200]   Are you keeping up with the versions, Andy?
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.760]   Are you downloading those?
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.360]   I can say that there have been developers
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.080]   have access to new versions.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:56.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:57.560]   There's this thing.
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:00.200]   And this is why I'm not a iPhone developer.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.600]   Because then if you do that, you can't talk about it.
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.280]   Although there's a really cool thing.
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.200]   It's the people who've been an Apple insider
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.960]   and elsewhere in reporting that they recently
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.440]   shipped a new version that can actually
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.800]   do over-the-air updates.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:12.840]   Over-the-air.
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.720]   So, for us, all the previous ones required,
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.120]   like you got to dock it to Xcode.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:16.880]   You got to do all this.
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:17.480]   You got to do that.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.320]   You got to install the new iTunes.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.760]   With the new one, a core in Apple Insider,
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.520]   you just tap a button.
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:22.480]   You can just update it.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:22.680]   So--
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:23.160]   That's exciting.
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.240]   Actually, this is--
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.680]   I sort of think preview as to how different the iOS 5
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:28.800]   is going to be, iOS 4.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.960]   So it really is going to be much more like a traditional desktop
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:32.480]   computer.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.160]   I love that.
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:33.680]   I love that.
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:34.520]   Over-the-air updates.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:35.120]   That's so sweet.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:37.800]   Now, this is actually 435, which just did come out.
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.320]   That fixes the PDF exploit.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:43.080]   So that one, unfortunately, is not over-the-air.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.400]   Did we talk about the password exploit?
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.680]   The man in the middle?
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:47.520]   We did not.
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:49.280]   But that's on Lion.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.880]   I thought it was on both Lion and Leopard.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:51.240]   Oh, it is.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.040]   You're right.
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:52.480]   You're right.
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:53.240]   I thought that was going to be worse.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.680]   They didn't fix it on Lion.
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:55.880]   Shall we mention that?
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.960]   I think it might be worth mentioning.
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.920]   That's great, dude.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.200]   Are you talking about the--
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.800]   So if you leave your-- this is to get into your system.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.200]   So a lot of people will set it out.
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:10.680]   And if you have an automatic login, a lot of people,
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.720]   you want to put it away so that you can--
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.880]   you think that if someone came and opened your computer,
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.520]   they wouldn't have access to your computer.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.240]   But it turns out that there is a software.
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.360]   And I don't have it right in front of me.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:21.760]   So--
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:22.280]   But you can--
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:27.200]   There's a program called the Passware Kit Forensic 11.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:30.600]   And what it does is it captures memory over firewires.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:33.160]   So if you turn it off or you reboot,
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.800]   there's no keys in memory.
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.120]   But unfortunately, the keys do stay in memory when you sleep.
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.120]   Unless you say--
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:39.600]   Unless you say--
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.080]   Yeah, and they're unencrypted so they can be slurped up
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.280]   by this program.
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:46.520]   I think, though-- and this is what I turn on.
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.960]   It's hard to-- I'm trying to read between the lines
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.440]   on this Help Not Security article.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:54.080]   But it sounds like if you turn on that require password
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:56.160]   to wake up from sleep--
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:56.640]   Then you're fine.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:57.400]   Then you're OK.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:00.160]   It's only if you expect it to wake up from sleep
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.720]   without re-logging it.
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:02.680]   And that makes sense.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:05.240]   It would have to keep the password in memory.
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.680]   So that you can use it.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:10.280]   Also, it bears stressing that, although this is a real thread,
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.800]   whoever wants to get your password
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.160]   would have to have physical access.
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.180]   And also, it's not as though they can just simply
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:18.280]   sit at the next table over a pen hour or whatever,
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:20.000]   just sniff something over Wi-Fi.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.400]   It would have to be my computer goes next to your computer.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.040]   I dock it via firewire.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:27.120]   I run a utility that spends several minutes minimum looking
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.600]   at your memory, looking for the password,
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.320]   and then disconnect.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.920]   And if I get away with that, yes, I have your system password.
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:34.680]   I can do damn near anything I want.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.560]   This is not-- but it's a difficult thing for someone
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.040]   to pull off.
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.920]   Someone would have to really have to target you.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.720]   This would be the kind of thing that you would have if you
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.120]   were stealing someone's laptop.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.480]   Like, it's not so much that someone would walk by and--
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.960]   It wouldn't even be good then, because if you stole it,
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.280]   you'd have to make sure you got to it and opened it up.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.240]   And they didn't have the--
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:55.080]   This is-- the reason I didn't bring it up--
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:55.800]   I'm glad you did.
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.200]   But the reason I didn't bring it up
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:00.440]   if you have physical access to somebody's system--
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:01.360]   There's a lot of ways to be done.
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.920]   You're pretty much-- you're in.
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:06.560]   So any attack that requires physical access,
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:08.920]   I don't deem to be a huge security problem.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.840]   I mean, look, if I could get your system,
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:13.440]   I could take the password, I mean, the hard drive out
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:14.240]   of your system.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.320]   There's all sorts of things I can do.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.320]   So once you have physical access--
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.440]   I talked to a couple of people who are familiar with how
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.120]   a biosperson, how this mechanism works,
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.920]   and they told me that in their opinion,
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.240]   although they don't work for Apple,
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.760]   in their opinion, it would not be a difficult thing for Apple
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.320]   to just scramble this encrypted password.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:33.680]   And just at least make it that much more difficult to do.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:34.600]   But--
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.280]   There is-- you know, it's kind of in the nature of encryption
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:42.560]   and passwords that-- and this is why you can rip DVDs.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:45.040]   Even though they're locked, the key has to live in memory
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.360]   while you're playing back the DVD.
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:48.880]   So it's kind of in the nature of stuff
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.600]   that if you have to decrypt a password
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.600]   and have it available to you to use it,
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.320]   that password is somewhere stored in the clear.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:59.120]   If you want to have a consumer experience where things aren't
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.120]   going to be--
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.560]   Well, you'd have to log in every five seconds.
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:04.520]   You know, you're going to give up some kind of security.
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:07.080]   So yeah, it's good to be aware of it.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:12.440]   I don't think people should panic by any means around this.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.920]   I do think it's generally a good idea
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:18.920]   to leave your computer on a login status.
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.360]   Oh, I generally just would--
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:23.000]   I said it immediately when it sleeps,
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.640]   when it goes to the screen saver, no matter what,
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:28.880]   I said it so that I have to log back in.
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.880]   Because especially with a laptop,
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.840]   there's always this issue of it would be fairly simple
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:34.800]   for somebody just to take it.
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.800]   And if you were logged in as me,
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.320]   I'm using LastPass and lots of techniques
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:42.240]   that make it very easy for me to log into websites.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:43.840]   But you'd have access to all that stuff,
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:46.080]   including my banking if you know what you're doing.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.240]   So no, I always do that on laptops for sure.
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.240]   I don't know about desktops.
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:52.320]   I don't know if that's as a big deal on desktops.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:56.120]   Let's talk a little bit about the DVD-less Mac minis.
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:57.280]   A number of people have taken that.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:59.640]   They're reading the tea leaves to say,
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:02.280]   maybe it's the end of the line for physical media.
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.560]   On the Mac, I think so.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:04.480]   I think that--
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.240]   Now we have the air without a DVD,
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.720]   and we have the mini without a DVD.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:08.800]   I wouldn't, to be honest with you,
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:11.000]   I wouldn't even be surprised if the Mac Pro went
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.920]   when eventually it comes out, is released without a DVD player.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:16.720]   I think Apple is done.
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:17.400]   I think they're just moving--
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:20.200]   And they don't mind the 70-plus bucks
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.600]   that you'd have to spend to get an external DVD.
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:24.000]   With them or somebody else, I think they just
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.200]   don't want to design for it anymore.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.880]   You have to buy an Apple brand.
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:27.640]   Do you have to buy?
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.760]   Oh, yes you do, at least on the air.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:30.840]   It will not work with a--
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.480]   I've tried other US DVDs.
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.760]   It has to be the Apple brand super drive.
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:35.920]   I haven't tried because I don't miss it.
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.520]   I'm sure there's a workaround.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.480]   It does make them thinner.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.760]   It does make them simpler.
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:42.800]   And I think there's a whole category of people
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.240]   who no longer use physical media.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.320]   I don't miss it.
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.040]   And I think that's really the deciding
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:47.800]   argument for Apple.
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.280]   I think that they look at the numbers.
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:52.160]   They realize how rarely their users are actually
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:53.680]   putting discs in the drive.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:56.080]   Honestly, the only time I ever put a DVD in there
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:59.280]   is when I buy the rare times when I actually buy DVD.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.120]   And that's not for playback.
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:02.800]   That's only for the two hours it'll take.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.080]   Just rip all these DVDs into video files.
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:07.960]   And then once again, I never use that DVD drive.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:08.600]   Right.
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.720]   But that does make the question.
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:14.120]   A lot of people buy Mac Minney's as home theater PCs.
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:16.520]   And then you would want a DVD player in it.
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:19.400]   Yeah, but when you want HD, and then you're not
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.240]   going to be able to get HD without Blu-ray,
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.640]   and you're not going to be able to get Blu-ray.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:25.680]   So you're going to want to do some sort of a digital file.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:28.440]   That's a good point.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:29.480]   Do you rip Blu-rays?
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:30.480]   What do you do?
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:32.480]   You can rip Blu-rays.
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.760]   The tools are more available for Windows than on Mac.
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:38.160]   But you can get your soft has a commercial program for Blu-ray.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.680]   And there's even a free app.
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:42.240]   There's already an open source tracker.
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.160]   It gets updated kind of frequently, I think.
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:48.760]   But a couple more things that we'll get to our picks of the week.
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:50.280]   Did you see?
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:51.560]   I think this is in the UK.
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:55.680]   You get free Wi-Fi at McDonald's in the UK.
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:01.040]   And they published-- or somebody put up the instructions
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:01.680]   online.
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:02.760]   It's not a very big image.
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:04.120]   I don't know if you can see this.
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:05.480]   But let me point it out here.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:08.960]   The first two columns are how to get the Wi-Fi working
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.680]   on a Windows machine.
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.840]   The third column, which has but three steps,
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.720]   is how to get it working on a Mac.
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:16.560]   Right.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:19.920]   And as John Gruber says, there is no step four.
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.160]   There is on the Windows side.
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:22.240]   Look at that.
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:23.720]   Yeah, I mean, that's pretty dramatic.
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:26.840]   Although let's be a little bit more fair.
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.160]   And that part of the problem is that Windows is still
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:32.280]   supporting XP in 2000 and like three different operating
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:32.560]   systems.
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:33.520]   You can have stuff like that.
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.640]   You can see you see XP and Vista as a choice.
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:37.320]   And if we had to support-- now, here's
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.840]   how to do it if you've got system six.
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:43.000]   Here's how-- if you've got Mac OS 9.2.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   But the Mac log is pretty much the same for the last eight
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:46.560]   or 10 years.
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:47.920]   I mean, you open it up.
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:48.400]   I like this.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.520]   It says, click on the airport icon in the toolbar.
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:53.040]   Select turn airport on.
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.040]   Probably not necessary.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:58.280]   So they even have an extra step that you probably don't need.
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:00.720]   Select McDonald's free Wi-Fi from the list
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:03.240]   of available Wi-Fi networks.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.240]   Open your browser.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:10.160]   So two of those three are probably kind of unnecessary.
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.720]   Boy, that's pretty funny.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:14.240]   The worst case is pretty damn bad on Windows.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:17.840]   Often, I will also say that most of the time when you--
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:20.020]   anyone who's used both systems knows that you should
[00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:22.120]   will leave if you have a new Windows machine.
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:25.000]   You can make it just about as simple as it is to do what
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.040]   Apple used to call the airport, but it was now called Wi-Fi
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:29.040]   in line.
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:29.480]   But--
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:29.880]   Oh, really?
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:31.040]   Is that true?
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:32.360]   Yeah, if it's no longer called airport.
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.000]   I didn't notice that.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.400]   Turn Wi-Fi on.
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:37.040]   Turn Wi-Fi off.
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:38.240]   I didn't notice that.
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:39.960]   That's very interesting.
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:40.920]   Wow, we got a lot of--
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:43.400]   the great thing about the Mac community
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:47.000]   is that line is like a brand new Pixar movie where people will
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.240]   first use it, then enjoy it.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:50.600]   Then they have to find out every single Easter egg
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:52.680]   and every single time the little thing that doesn't really
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.440]   use one of them.
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:53.920]   Anything.
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.280]   That's just a cool thing to know.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.600]   So now is the whole word.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:58.440]   I didn't even notice that it's not called airport anymore.
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:47:59.480]   OK, interesting.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:01.000]   Wi-Fi.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.520]   Here's another cool thing.
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:06.920]   Try holding your finger down on any alphanumeric character.
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:07.920]   OK.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:08.320]   Right now.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:09.120]   OK, any alphan--
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:09.760]   I am.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.680]   Any-- any-- any-- any--
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:12.400]   a through z.
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.280]   OK.
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.760]   Notice what does not happen anymore.
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:15.600]   It does not repeat.
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:17.080]   Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.000]   Does it not repeat at all anymore?
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.120]   It doesn't repeat.
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:23.400]   They change the behavior so that if you hold on the letter
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.480]   A, for instance, you won't get a.
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:28.120]   What will happen is that it'll pop up a list of every single
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:31.840]   accented character that could possibly fit over an A.
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:33.920]   And sorry, you could simply clip mouse over and get that
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:33.920]   accented.
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:35.960]   That's very IOS-vick-ick.
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:36.920]   Look at that.
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:39.200]   That is very IOS-y.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.380]   - Actually, I don't think he called iOS
[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:42.280]   see so much as slick.
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.460]   That's much better.
[00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:45.100]   - Yeah, I know.
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:47.000]   - And Auto repeat, who used Auto repeat please.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.040]   And you can still auto repeat punctuation
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:50.480]   and dashes and things like that.
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:52.800]   Just realize that nobody ever needs to,
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.400]   unless you need to prove that you're so drunk
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:56.280]   you fell asleep with your head on the keyboard.
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:57.480]   That's just not important anymore.
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:59.040]   - Well, and I've just learned something.
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:00.840]   There are no diocritical remarks for B
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:02.180]   'cause I think Bup's up.
[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:04.620]   Yee's got a lot of 'em.
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:06.140]   See, this used to be a hard thing to do.
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:07.360]   You'd have to know it was optional.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:11.200]   'Cause I use my real name as an oxonte gue over the E,
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.400]   a cute accent over the E.
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:16.000]   So I would type option EE and you had to know that.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:16.920]   You don't have to know that anymore.
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:17.760]   I think that's fantastic.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.240]   - Can you get all the option key,
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:21.200]   or can you get all the symbols to pop up?
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.040]   - I don't know.
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:22.960]   - If you hold on to the three,
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.200]   you won't get all the different--
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:25.880]   - Oh, that's too good.
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:27.280]   - It's just for accent.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:29.240]   - Well, that's a nice Easter egg.
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:31.080]   We're gonna have to do Easter egg hunting.
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:32.320]   This is good.
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:33.160]   Look at that.
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:34.000]   - That's awesome.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.920]   - You ever wonder where the oom-lout went?
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:37.080]   - There it is.
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:40.360]   Now, if I press two, how do I--
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:42.480]   - You won't get the trademark sign or something like that.
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:45.160]   - No, but I mean, how do I select this oom-lout?
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:46.520]   Do I do two now?
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:47.920]   Yes, I got it.
[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:49.920]   So you press that, you'll get those numbers,
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:53.120]   and if I want o with a tilde, I press eight,
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:54.720]   and then it gives me that.
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:56.680]   Oh.
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:59.560]   You see, that's why I continue to love Apple.
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:01.520]   They always keep thinking.
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.680]   Now, they might occasionally be drunk on the day
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:05.920]   when they have the meeting about what to do with the scroll.
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:07.680]   - Yeah, every other day out of the year.
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:08.520]   Here's another one.
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:09.360]   Here's another one.
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:13.120]   If you hold down the option key while clicking the airport icon,
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.160]   you get all of this interesting information
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:17.800]   about the airport, you're on.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:21.240]   The, ah, I'm on channel 40.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:22.160]   What kind of security?
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:25.520]   RSSI is minus 59, transmit rate 270.
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:26.360]   Look at this.
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:29.160]   This is a diagnostic information by holding down the option key.
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:30.080]   That was from the chat room.
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.280]   Thank you, chat room.
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:32.120]   - That's great.
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:35.360]   - And you know that the product manager
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:36.400]   probably was almost the last product.
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.240]   - Oh, that's not new.
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:38.080]   Oh, well.
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:38.920]   - This was, yeah.
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.240]   - Oh, never mind.
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:41.880]   (laughing)
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.400]   - I didn't know that.
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:44.240]   - Did you know that?
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:45.760]   - I did not know that.
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:46.600]   I didn't, I got him in.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:47.440]   I didn't know that.
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:50.360]   - Yeah, apparently it's been there at least since Snow Leopard.
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:52.080]   - And there are a lot of features in Safari
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:54.200]   that are not line specific.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:56.760]   They're like, they're just built into the new version of Safari.
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:57.600]   - Right.
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:58.720]   Safari's nice.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:01.880]   But I'm still using Chrome.
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:04.240]   Are you a full-time Safari user?
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:05.840]   - Yeah, I've never found a reason.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:09.600]   I see what's so great about Firefox
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.000]   and see what's so great about Chrome.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.680]   I've never seen anything that was so compelling
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:13.960]   to make me switch out of the default.
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:14.800]   - Right.
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:17.040]   - Although I think the latest version of Safari
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:19.000]   was the first one where I could really say,
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.960]   I'm using Safari, not out of inertia,
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.680]   but because it truly has features
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:25.440]   that I prefer to Chrome and Firefox.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:28.760]   - Now, the one of the uses,
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:33.080]   I kind of go, I'm a half and half between Firefox and Safari.
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:35.160]   And one of the important features is if a quick time
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:38.040]   movie opened in Safari, you can't save it to the desktop.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:39.680]   - I know, I hate that. - I hate that.
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:42.960]   - You open it up in Firefox and you just go,
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:44.720]   oh yeah, and I can just download it immediately.
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:45.560]   So it works pretty on.
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:46.560]   - Yeah, it works with everything too.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:50.640]   MP3, even though it's not like you're looking at a page
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.000]   that has an embedded MP3,
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.880]   you actually have the URL ends with file name.mp3.
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:57.640]   You just have a quick time player.
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:59.840]   It will only allow you to save it as a web archive
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:03.040]   or as the original page source, which is duh.
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.200]   - Two simple dumb, that's what dumb it is.
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.000]   - I was talking to a client and I was like,
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.080]   "Well, the movie's up there, you can just download it."
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:11.920]   You know, it's on a URL just right click.
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.080]   And they said, "Well, when I right click, I can't download it."
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:15.680]   And I thought, "Oh, you must be on a PC anymore."
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:19.000]   I'm on a Mac and I was like, "Oh, what browser you're using?"
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.640]   - HTC has said, "Uncle."
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:24.600]   They said, "Okay, okay, we'll negotiate."
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:28.320]   Apple remember sued HTC, saying, "Androids,
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:31.080]   the operating system on the HTC Smartphones
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:32.800]   was infringing on iPhone.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:35.440]   The International Trade Commission ruled that,
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:38.680]   "Yes, HTC had violated two patents owned by Apple,
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:42.240]   which really put them HTC in a position
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:44.600]   to be blocked from US sales."
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:46.600]   I'm sure that would be the next step Apple asking
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:47.760]   for an injunction.
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:54.480]   So in the latest news, the Chief Financial Officer of HTC
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:58.520]   told Bloomberg today his company is willing to negotiate
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:02.480]   with Apple and settle their respective disputes out of court
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:03.680]   with a licensing agreement.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.040]   In other words, "Uncle."
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.080]   - Yeah.
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:08.040]   - What do you want Apple?
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:09.400]   - Well, and the same thing's happening in Samsung.
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:10.240]   I mean, and once you--
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:11.320]   - That's gonna happen everywhere.
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.160]   - Once those two cave, it'll be, you know,
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:17.480]   so basically Apple will be making money on every smartphone.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:18.840]   - Isn't that amazing? - Made in the world.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:21.240]   - Yeah, because this is HTC's version of Android,
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:24.600]   but then potentially you go against LG and Motorola
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:25.300]   and all the other Android-- - You really have
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:26.480]   Apple's in position of making money
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:29.720]   on every single smartphone made.
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:32.640]   - One analyst says a victory for Apple could set
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:35.600]   a high royalty precedent for Android devices,
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:38.040]   similar to the $5 per unit.
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:40.640]   Microsoft collects from HTC already.
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.360]   - And remember, those are multiplying factors,
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.760]   so that when it's only $5, it may increase the end--
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:48.440]   - By 20. - By 20 or 30 dollars.
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:52.480]   - Well, as we know, the real money in smartphones
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:57.080]   is the monthly data charge, not the phone itself.
[00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:58.920]   So there's a lot of money to be made, I think.
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:01.840]   When you have a $2,000 phone, there's probably,
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:03.480]   you know, 20 bucks there for everybody.
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:04.680]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:05.480]   - I wanna sue.
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:08.640]   I thought of the idea of a phone.
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:09.480]   Wouldn't it be nice?
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:14.480]   I have a video from 1995, which I held up a newton,
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:18.360]   and I said, "Some day, someday we'll have this
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:20.600]   "in a small form factor you can carry in your pocket
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:22.960]   "and you'll be able to get online anywhere you go someday
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:26.360]   "and you might even be able to make a phone call
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:28.240]   "and if I had only patented it at that point--
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:29.440]   - Before you sell it.
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:31.880]   - As soon as you say it out in public, it's--
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:33.760]   - You just gotta have that sort of forethought.
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:35.800]   I remember that I was in the room at Bell Labs,
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:36.640]   and they said, "You know what?
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.480]   "We're gonna have two new keys and this is the number,
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:41.080]   "so it's going to be a star and an ampersand."
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:43.960]   And I said, "Wait, let's spitball some ideas.
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:45.400]   "How about the tuktak tozine,
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:48.080]   "because it looks like the keyboard grid, doesn't it?"
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:51.280]   So if you've ever accessed a voicemail box,
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:52.120]   you're welcome.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:54.400]   - From now on, Andy, Mr. Hash--
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:55.560]   and not, wait a minute, that doesn't--
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:59.120]   - And I get $8 every time someone uses a dial phone,
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:00.960]   or to the touch tone phone.
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:02.520]   - Every time, not like for every one minute,
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:04.560]   every time someone uses it, I get $8.
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:06.320]   - You were talking about vulnerabilities
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:07.960]   that really nobody should worry about.
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:09.760]   How about this one?
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:13.120]   Safari Charlie, Charlie Miller, the guy who hacks the Mac
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:15.440]   every time and pwn to own, has found an exploit,
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:18.400]   which allows an accessor to gain access
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.540]   to your battery control.
[00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:23.160]   Apparently there are only two passwords,
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:28.000]   they're company-wide, unchanged, they're well-known now.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   And so if you write to the laptop's battery firmware,
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.520]   you could in fact put a virus in there,
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:38.180]   or you could make it explode.
[00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:41.280]   (laughing)
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:43.800]   - There's a mission impossible sequence there somewhere.
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:44.800]   - Do-dee-dee.
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:46.720]   - I'm gonna hack into it battery.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:51.320]   - It's all conjecture, but it is really cool.
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:54.120]   It basically comes up with an idea where you'd have to do,
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:55.240]   you'd have to do a lot of heavy lifting
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:58.280]   to make it happen, but you could sort of ship a battery
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:00.920]   that had infected code built into it.
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:03.560]   Find a way to when that battery is activated
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.960]   to send that code into the BIOS.
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:09.040]   And then a miracle happens,
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:10.360]   and then you have a hack system, but-
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:11.200]   - Profit.
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:12.200]   (laughing)
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:14.800]   - It's every single damped component,
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:16.040]   has its own sub-components.
[00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:19.960]   Like the run-of-service, had a separate brain,
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:21.680]   and its butt just to control the tail.
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:22.520]   - Is that true?
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:23.720]   - You have a computer that has about a thousand brains
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:24.560]   and a thousand butts.
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:25.400]   - Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:28.080]   - You tell me, Bronnoisseur's had butt brains?
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:31.400]   - According to the Golden Pop-Up book
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:33.400]   that I was given at age five, yes.
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:34.840]   (laughing)
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:36.560]   And you're gonna trust Wikipedia,
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:39.400]   or the Golden, the little Golden book
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:40.240]   of Pop-Up dinosaurs.
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:41.440]   - They're like the fire trucks,
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:42.880]   where they have a driver in the back.
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:43.720]   - Just so they-
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:45.240]   (laughing)
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:46.520]   - That's another H test.
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:48.440]   I just realized that the Bronnoisseur's doesn't exist anymore
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:50.040]   because it turns out that it was a big thing.
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:50.880]   - It turned out to be a big thing.
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:52.160]   - Or something, yeah.
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:54.400]   And I don't know how they would know.
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:57.120]   Diploresaurus, Diplosaurus?
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:57.960]   - Diplosaurus, I think.
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:59.520]   - Diplosaurus.
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:01.400]   - But I, and how would they know?
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:02.800]   I mean, all they got is bones.
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:04.960]   How would they know there was a brain in the butt?
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:07.240]   - Walkman headphones.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:09.400]   (laughing)
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:10.240]   - Departicous.
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:11.080]   - Departicous?
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:12.400]   - One suspicious.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.080]   - Or, oh, it's the Apatosaurus now.
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:16.680]   Or the Diplodocus.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:19.680]   Where did Bronnoisseur's go?
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:20.520]   Why did we take that away?
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:23.080]   - By the way, evolution has decreed
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:25.680]   that we no longer have brains in our butt, I believe.
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:28.920]   So it wasn't such a good adaptation.
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.840]   Where are they now, Mr. Buttbrain?
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:33.080]   - Where are you now?
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:36.680]   - Mr. Scalesau.
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:38.880]   (laughing)
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:40.520]   - I think the theory that the Golden Books
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:43.160]   were going by is that thing is so huge,
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:45.000]   they must have had a brain in its butt.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.120]   - Had a brain on both sides
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.480]   'cause the wires wouldn't go all the way through.
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:49.000]   - The nerve wires wouldn't get through that.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.520]   - This dinosaur was so big,
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:52.840]   yeah, the brain in its butt.
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:54.160]   - The big was the Charles Nelson rally.
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:55.160]   (laughing)
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:56.800]   - It had a butt brain.
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:59.160]   Let us take a break that we're coming back
[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:00.760]   with your picks of the week, gentlemen.
[00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:02.480]   Are you up for that?
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:03.320]   Before we do that though,
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:05.480]   I want to go to smilesoftaware.com.
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:07.560]   In fact, I urge you to do the same.
[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:11.680]   To take a look at PDF Pen and PDF Pen Pro,
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:14.560]   you know, it is school season's coming.
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:16.600]   And I know it know about you,
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:18.520]   but I've been filling out forms like crazy.
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:20.000]   And now the schools are pretty sophisticated.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:23.080]   They make them available under PDF.
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:24.400]   - Yes, but you have to fill them out somehow.
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:25.240]   - Well, and this was funny
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:28.760]   because Henry was in Europe last week,
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:30.680]   and the hotel said he's underage,
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:33.920]   you have to fax us a form.
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:35.800]   So they sent me a doc,
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:37.640]   and they said you could email us a fax,
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:40.920]   so we printed out the doc, filled out the form,
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:41.960]   and then faxed it back,
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:45.240]   and I thought, oh, PDF Pen and PDF Pen Pro
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:48.480]   from the great folks at smilesoftaware.com.
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:49.400]   - And some of these things,
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:51.120]   you know, if people have gone through the trouble
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:52.680]   and built the templates and everything else,
[00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:55.240]   you could theoretically use Acrobat Reader,
[00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:57.720]   but what PDF Pen gives you is all the tools,
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:59.040]   a lot of the tools that you would get
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:00.080]   in a much more expensive.
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:01.960]   - Well, yeah, if you want the full features,
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:04.600]   you'd have to buy the full blown Adobe thing,
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:05.680]   which is four, 500 bucks.
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:07.200]   - And it's a lot more complicated.
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.760]   I mean, I have it.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:10.360]   And it's much more complicated than--
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:11.200]   - I love it.
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:12.760]   - $59.95 for PDF Pen.
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:15.280]   $99.95 for PDF Pen Pro.
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:17.880]   You open your PDFs, you can annotate them,
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:20.000]   you can add text, images,
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.120]   you can have signatures.
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:22.080]   In fact, if I open my,
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:24.080]   I don't know if I have it on this machine.
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:26.920]   Yes, I do.
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:28.000]   Okay, so if you,
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.320]   I'll get the update later.
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:30.640]   But if I open a PDF,
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:32.640]   you'll notice I have this library file here.
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:33.600]   Here's my signature,
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:34.480]   here's my wife's signature,
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:35.800]   my wife's initials,
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:37.880]   my initials, and Henry,
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:39.640]   my son's signature.
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:41.200]   You know, I use that 'cause they make them sign
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:42.000]   all these forms, you know,
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.280]   like the agreement about how,
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:45.920]   you know, proper use of the internet,
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:47.560]   agreement not to burn the school down,
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:49.720]   agreement to return his books at the end of the year.
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:51.280]   Henry, why should he sign those?
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:52.920]   I just pasted his signature in.
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:54.960]   He doesn't need to know all that.
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:56.680]   All that minutiae.
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:57.520]   So I just--
[00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:58.880]   - I don't think you're supposed to say that on a Friday.
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.360]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.200]   - I think you--
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:04.120]   - Open up PDFs and modify and paste stuff in.
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:05.040]   Watch, I'll just, here,
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.680]   I'll just do something for fun.
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.720]   I'll open this manual here.
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.120]   And there's no,
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:10.960]   this isn't a form,
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.480]   oops, I'm gonna go back to it.
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.280]   This isn't a form,
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:16.320]   but I can just paste my signature
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.040]   and just by double clicking it.
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:19.080]   And there's my signature.
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:20.760]   I can resize it.
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:23.680]   I can put it anywhere in the form.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.560]   This is so great.
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:25.400]   I just love it.
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:27.040]   And you can make it behind the text.
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:27.880]   This is one of the things
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:29.720]   that's very important to have is that,
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:30.560]   actually, we're not,
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.400]   there's no text on this page,
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:32.400]   but if there were text,
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.240]   you don't want it,
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.560]   you want it to be above the text
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:37.200]   'cause you don't want it to obscure the lines.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.040]   If you want to trick people
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:39.440]   and think you actually signed it.
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.720]   Anyway, I could go on and on.
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.840]   This is absolutely fantastic.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.440]   Go paperless without optical character recognition.
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:46.960]   Make changes in your PDFs
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.640]   without going back to the original document.
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:49.960]   Edit PDFs.
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:52.320]   Add all of that text images signatures
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.880]   with your mouse and your keyboard.
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:55.720]   I just love it.
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.320]   You can even redact private information
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.800]   if you have a PDF with some personal stuff in there.
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.560]   Black it out and it works.
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:04.040]   Unlike the embarrassment some people had
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.360]   when they thought it was redacting,
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:06.400]   but in fact, it was just,
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.360]   it was still there that works with PDFs.
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.600]   - And it's so easy to install.
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.880]   - Well, I want you to try it for free
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:15.120]   for 30 days by going to smilesoftware.com.
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.920]   But to be honest, it's in the App Store.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:17.720]   So after you've tried it,
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.200]   if you want to buy it, you can buy it from the App Store.
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:21.560]   That makes it, that's probably what you should do.
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.120]   - I always check now.
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.480]   - Makes it so much easier to get the App Store.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:25.800]   - To get the App Store updates.
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.000]   - There's some software that I bought
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.800]   like I had to choose between a bunch of different software
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:30.160]   and I picked the one that was in the App Store
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.600]   because I was like, I don't want to.
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:32.960]   - Well, it was good folks.
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.520]   Gene and everybody at Smile Software,
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:37.080]   they know that and that's why they offer it both ways.
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:38.360]   You can download the free trial
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:43.160]   and buy it from the website, smilesoftware.com/macbreak
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.840]   or you can get it in the App Store as well.
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:47.760]   You know, there's some great videos here.
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:51.560]   I think that, I can't remember if these videos
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:55.120]   are with Don McAllister or not.
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:56.680]   I know he did some videos for them.
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:58.400]   Yep, looks like screencasts online.
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.120]   But anyway, some great stuff in here.
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:04.040]   PDF Pen or PDF Pen Pro for the professionals.
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:08.280]   smilesoftware.com/macbreakyou.
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:10.000]   In PDF Pen, see?
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:10.840]   We can expand.
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:12.720]   - And to the V-Dawn pages documents directly
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.120]   into PDF format, we see them.
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:17.840]   - I just create a new PDF, say this high school newsletter.
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.680]   - It doesn't matter what Don's talking about.
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:22.160]   You just want to listen to 'em, don't you?
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.960]   - He's just smarter, right?
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.840]   - What the, I was just gonna say,
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:30.280]   what the in a world guy is the movie trailers,
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.320]   Don is to screencast.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.880]   - Oh, he absolutely is.
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:35.320]   So we thank Smile Software for their support.
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:39.600]   Now, my friend, it is time for your picks of the week.
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.760]   Let's start with the man to my left.
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.400]   See what you can do at the right this time.
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:46.600]   The man to my left, Eni and I go!
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:47.960]   (laughing)
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:48.800]   - I am the man.
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:50.840]   - You the man, Leo, you the man.
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:52.200]   - No, you the man.
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:54.680]   - No, I'm gonna put a little tripod with a post
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:56.600]   that's saying that Leo is over here.
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:58.840]   - Yeah, you the, yeah.
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:01.040]   Yeah, don't distract Eileen.
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.560]   We're doing a thing here.
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:03.640]   Chad's talking to Eileen.
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:04.480]   Now do it.
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.600]   - You the man.
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:06.760]   - No, you the man.
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:07.760]   - No, you the man.
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:08.600]   You the man.
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:12.320]   No, how can I possibly be the man when you the man?
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:13.160]   - All right.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.480]   (laughing)
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:15.880]   - We do have fun, don't we?
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:17.640]   - We do fun with the toys.
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.640]   What's your pick of the week, Mr. Eye?
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:21.320]   - My pick of the week is a really good
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:25.160]   web browsing privacy plugin for Safari called Ghostery.
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:26.960]   It's a multi-platform plugin.
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.520]   Now you've heard of a lot of different plugins
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:31.520]   that will hide pop-up ads and disable ads.
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:34.000]   This one does something even kind of more important.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.040]   It will disable all the cookies from the 200
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:39.200]   different companies that try to profile you
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:42.920]   based on tracking cookies and where you go and what you do.
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.360]   There have been a whole bunch of really good articles
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:45.640]   on Wall Street Journal about,
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:47.800]   and especially late last year about
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:50.440]   the absolute profound depth of information
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.680]   that these incredible marketing companies
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:54.040]   are developing on you.
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.440]   They know exactly where you went.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.760]   They know exactly what you're interested in.
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:00.280]   They categorize you into a specific targeting demographic.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:03.720]   They use all kinds of overlapping and unlocking technologies
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:08.720]   to figure out a library website may not know who you are,
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:15.080]   but this marketing company has a cookie
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:16.600]   that's tracking that site.
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.360]   And because they can also check that cookie
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.720]   against this other cookie on Amazon
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:20.840]   and this other cookie that might,
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.960]   you might have logged in on as your identity,
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.200]   they will figure out that what your Facebook profile is
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.160]   based on this totally unrelated site.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:29.000]   And now that becomes another piece of information.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.040]   So what Ghostery does is,
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.120]   they install it, it's a free plugin,
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.680]   and it will automatically check to every time
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:38.200]   that a webpage loads looks for these companies
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.480]   that are looking for these cookies.
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:41.520]   And if someone tries to set or access a cookie,
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.080]   it will block that access.
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.960]   It will simply not be found.
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:47.120]   The only person who has access to those tracking cookies
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.760]   after you've installed Ghostery is you yourself.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.560]   So this has a whole bunch of really cool effects.
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:54.200]   Immediately, if you just simply install it and do nothing,
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:56.560]   it means that as far as the user
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.440]   can possibly control such things,
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:00.720]   you will be untrackable and untraceable
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.360]   by these marketing companies.
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.040]   The other cool thing, which is kind of scary,
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:06.760]   is that every time you access one of these sites,
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:09.400]   it will give you a little pop up in the upper corner of the screen
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:10.680]   that will hang around for five seconds,
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.960]   showing you all the different tracking cookies
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.960]   that tried to be accessed from the site.
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:17.120]   And maybe you'll go to someone's personal website
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:19.200]   and you'll see, okay, there's Google Analytics
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.760]   and okay, there's Amazon Associates, okay,
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:23.040]   that makes sense 'cause what people use their ads in there.
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.520]   But then there'll be like nine or 10 others saying
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.360]   freedompower.org.
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.800]   And here's another one from Liberty Info
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:33.720]   to com.glominfo.china.
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:37.160]   All I want is to look at this funny photo gallery
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:38.800]   of cats that fell into bathtubs.
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:41.200]   Why are 12 different companies wanting to track
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.800]   exactly how much time I spent there?
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:47.240]   And so you can always pick up this pop up later on
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.040]   'cause there's also a permanent button
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:52.080]   in your buttons bar inside Safari
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:53.880]   so that you can always get a report on
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:56.040]   not only all the different companies
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:58.280]   that might have tracking cookies associated with the site,
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:05:59.600]   but also you can click and find out
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:01.080]   what their privacy policies are.
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:02.920]   Most people know what Amazon is.
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:05.200]   Most people can probably trust Amazon,
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:07.440]   maybe as many people might even trust Google.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:09.280]   But if you've never heard of this company before,
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:10.120]   you can click on this link
[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.400]   and find out exactly what this company is all about.
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.960]   You can also go to their privacy page
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.680]   to find if there's a way to opt out.
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:18.240]   Now the last kicker from this, and this is kind of cool,
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.560]   you can also opt into a special service
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.880]   that anonymously, hopefully,
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:25.600]   anonymously reports on all these tracking cookies
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:28.760]   to a central service that then collates its information,
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:31.600]   then hands it off to the FTC and other companies
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:32.800]   so that they can get a good idea
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:34.800]   of what companies are involved in what.
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.960]   And so if at some future date, this company says,
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.560]   "Oh, we never, ever, ever check this information,"
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:42.280]   this company can say, "No, according to users of Ghostry,
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:44.040]   "we did this about 8 million times
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.680]   "the past 10 minutes alone,
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:47.400]   "do you care to revise this statement
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:50.480]   "before you haul up before the sign it served?"
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:52.040]   - So this is great.
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:54.480]   I've Steve Gibson mentioned this a while ago.
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.080]   I really like this a lot.
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:01.080]   Now I noticed it was purchased by Evadon.
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:03.560]   I don't know if this,
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:06.600]   it's a digital advertising assurance platform company.
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:10.040]   I'm not sure what that does to Ghostry.
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.760]   - They apparently make most of that money
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.200]   off of basically privacy concerns.
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:16.440]   - Great, God, that's good.
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:20.600]   - That would be even better if it were 100% open source
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:23.000]   owned by nobody and a totally community resource.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.280]   I do understand, I absolutely appreciate that.
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:27.320]   But it seems to do what it does, and it's so popular.
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:29.040]   I mean, there are millions of uploads of this thing.
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.320]   - This is actually a digital advertising
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:33.120]   self-regulatory group.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:34.320]   So that's good.
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:37.560]   This is them being transparent, which I like.
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:38.400]   - Yeah.
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:40.800]   - I mean, this organization is in the business
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:43.280]   of making sure that people who want private browsing
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.200]   can get private browsing.
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:46.160]   So it's not as though it's another ad company.
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:48.440]   Oh, well, looks like Andy Nastko is very interested
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:49.280]   in privacy.
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:50.120]   We'll add him to the people
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:52.440]   who are not interested in being advertised advertising group.
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:54.200]   That's a very bullish market.
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:57.840]   - I think it's just fascinating to see sites
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:00.720]   you might not expect, for instance, the Google page
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.720]   has nothing on it.
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:04.240]   You sure think that they would,
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.080]   but they don't even have Google Analytics.
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:07.360]   - They don't need to track you because everybody--
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:08.520]   - They don't have to.
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.280]   - Yes, they already are.
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:11.520]   - I was pretty surprised.
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.840]   I plugged in my own website and found out
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.520]   there was a cookie for Amazon Associates.
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:16.360]   That's fine.
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:17.200]   That makes sense.
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.040]   There's a lot of Associates links on my page.
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:19.880]   But there was also something
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:22.880]   for some sort of Adobe managed tracking system.
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:26.200]   And I'm like, oh, I know I've never installed any plug
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:28.800]   into my WordPress blog that supports that.
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.400]   Now I have to look at the three plugins
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:33.400]   that I've installed to find out what is hidden inside there.
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:35.440]   I don't know if there's anything nefarious about it,
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:39.960]   but it doesn't look like evilgeniusbastard.org
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.200]   or anything like that.
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:42.200]   But it's probably--
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:43.560]   - You could run this on your own site
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:45.080]   if you run a website.
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:45.920]   - And see it.
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:46.760]   - A lot of times you install stuff,
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.760]   especially if you're using some kind of template
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.000]   or something else that may have a lot of stuff built in.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:51.840]   - Right.
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:52.680]   That's one of the reasons for--
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:53.840]   - That's probably gonna be handy.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:58.080]   - At the Boston recently hosted the big WordPress
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.240]   convention, and of course,
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:00.600]   and one of the big things that came out
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:02.400]   of a couple different keynotes is that you should be
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:05.200]   a little bit suspicious of any free WordPress theme
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:07.560]   because a lot of it might have a whole lot of stuff
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.160]   built in that's supported by ad tracking cookies.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:11.720]   Now of course, most of the people who are giving these
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:12.800]   keynotes are people in the business
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.680]   of actually selling WordPress things,
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:16.280]   but still they have an excellent point
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:19.040]   that it's not just an HTML file
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:22.000]   and an animated GIF for your header
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.520]   when you download a WordPress theme.
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:26.680]   It is a very sophisticated piece of software
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:29.160]   that can have any kind of executable code inside it.
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:30.000]   - Wow, it's great to know.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000]   - So you should be a little bit suspicious.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.320]   - Yeah, that's great to know.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:34.160]   Alex Lindsay, your pick of the week?
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:36.120]   So I have a pick from my dreams
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:37.520]   and then a regular pick.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:38.880]   - So something you dreamt about?
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:40.800]   - No, no, it showed up.
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:42.720]   So I've been talking about this on, I think, Mac,
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:44.280]   Rake and on this week of photography.
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:46.880]   Did you see, I sent you a link.
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:49.600]   This is iCAM, this is a design, it's a design.
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.000]   It's not the final thing.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.720]   It's designed so well that you can see it,
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:56.000]   but to me this is the future of cameras.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:56.920]   - Wow.
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:00.000]   - And so what it is, is, and the reason I'm talking
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.840]   about it on Mac break and not on Twitch,
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:02.960]   oh, talk about it on Twitch too, but.
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:05.240]   - This isn't that one that's focused.
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:07.240]   - Like this, no, no, no, this is it.
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:09.360]   The design is, is that you'd have an iPhone
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:12.920]   slide into the camera and then be the brain of the camera.
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:15.320]   - But it's done so well.
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.160]   It's done so well.
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:20.200]   So this is a, it was part of a design,
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:23.200]   the Red Dot Design Concept Award,
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.400]   oh, that these guys won it.
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:27.400]   And anyway, so the idea is.
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:28.760]   - So is this real or?
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:29.600]   - No, it's not.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.520]   This is the one for my dream.
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:31.760]   - That's why it's for real one.
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:32.600]   - I got it, okay.
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:36.720]   - But it's on Gizmodo, it was on a couple days ago.
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.640]   So anyway, but it is.
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.120]   - So that, I got it.
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:43.360]   Someone needs to actually make that.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:45.240]   And in my opinion, Sigma needs to make it.
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.080]   And then I'll make it a pick.
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:47.160]   And then I'll show it off.
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:48.960]   - These can change everything.
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.600]   Again, a camera.
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:53.120]   - Which can be connected directly to an iPhone.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.040]   - The thing is, I don't want them to,
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:57.520]   I don't want camera manufacturers to make interfaces anymore.
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:59.480]   I don't want them to think about that anymore.
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:01.000]   What camera manufacturers should do
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.480]   is have a great sensor with a great connection.
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:05.120]   And then they should have an SDK.
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:06.600]   And if you had an SDK on that side
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.040]   and then you had iOS on the other side,
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:11.040]   you would have the best camera that you ever had ever made.
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:11.880]   - Right, you're right.
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:13.200]   - And then you'd have, you could have 500,
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.920]   this is the open sourcing the camera, essentially.
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:17.400]   You'd have, you know, all that Franken camera stuff
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:18.240]   that they were talking about,
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.080]   you don't need to do that.
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.560]   What you need to do is have a sensor with a great connection.
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:24.200]   And then what you basically have is let iPhone developers
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:26.080]   write a hundred different apps that specialize
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:28.120]   in time-lapse or specialized in whatever.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:30.720]   - But if you had a camera like the iFi,
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:33.880]   a camera with some maybe Bluetooth built into it
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:36.080]   and then an app on the iPad.
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:36.920]   - It's fine.
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:37.760]   I mean, that's all fine.
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:40.640]   - As a matter of fact, Olympus has that as an accessory,
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:43.520]   a really cheap accessory for their EP cameras
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:45.160]   by a Bluetooth one that automatically sends it
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:46.160]   to Android and iPhone.
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:47.240]   - But I think it's tempting, you know.
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:49.560]   - That's the best way to look so good.
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:52.600]   I love this idea of not being,
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:55.760]   even digital cameras are stuck behind the concept of
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.960]   you have a lens in front of something that's sensitive to light.
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:59.920]   You have a shutter between that, you open the shutter,
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:01.000]   the thing that's sensitive to light,
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.400]   get some electrons, boom, you've got a picture.
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:06.320]   With computing, we can actually turn that into a,
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:09.840]   no, we take a high definition video for as long as we want
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:11.960]   and then we use the differences between each one
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:14.040]   of those 200 pictures to assemble something
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:15.200]   that would not have been possible
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:17.440]   with an oatmeal box with a pinhole in it.
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:18.280]   - Yeah.
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.960]   - I love the, I agree with you 100% Alex.
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:21.640]   - But I think that's so interesting.
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:25.480]   - I think that the first company that builds
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:28.520]   a solid computer with a sensor and can, you know,
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:29.800]   takes Canon or Sigma lenses,
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:31.320]   I think the company that could do this is Sigma
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.400]   because they have, they sell, they have the Foveon sensor,
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:35.520]   they have the special sensor and they sell lots of lenses
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.400]   and they don't have as much to protect.
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:38.720]   I mean, no one's buying their SLR.
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:40.480]   I mean, not many people are buying their SLR.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:42.360]   So, the thing is, is the first company to do this,
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:43.600]   I think it's some millions of copies
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.960]   because I know I would ditch Canon.
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.480]   - Would Apple let them?
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:48.520]   What, would Apple let them?
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:50.800]   - Absolutely, that's just, that would be great for Apple.
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:51.640]   I mean, it would be, you know.
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:52.760]   - It would just be a dock, yeah.
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:54.640]   All I have to do is license the dock connector.
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:58.480]   It would be even a better idea if this thing came
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:00.480]   with interchangeable backs, it was like a hassle bled.
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:01.880]   So they could buy a different,
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:03.240]   if I had great from the iPhone 4,
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:05.120]   to the iPhone 5 and it's just different enough
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.960]   that I can't slip the iPhone 4 in.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:09.520]   I can just spend $40 for a new back
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:13.000]   and a new sled for the camera, excuse me,
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.920]   for the phone, instead of having to buy a new one
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.760]   every time that I upgrade my camera.
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:21.520]   - I mean, if someone gave me either a four thirds
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:24.480]   or APS or a full frame sensor that had this slide
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.560]   in capability, I have a ditch Canon and a heartbeat.
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.200]   I'd figure out what to do with my lenses.
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:29.520]   I'd be, you know, I'd be like done.
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:32.440]   You know, because it's just, it's a much, much better,
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:35.080]   you know, solution than trying to figure out
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:36.320]   how we're gonna wire it all in.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:37.920]   It just needs to be part of the piece.
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:40.640]   So anyway, that's my fantasy pick.
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:43.040]   My real pick is a little program called PhotoScan.
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:46.000]   And it's something that it's a little more geeky than that.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.120]   I know that that was kinda geeky, but this is,
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.440]   so PhotoScan, we do a lot of,
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:54.160]   we do what's called photogrammetry a lot in my business.
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:56.280]   And so, and this is a special effects,
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.600]   what you're trying to do is you wanna take a bunch
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.600]   of photos of an image.
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.000]   It's PhotoScan, all one word.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.760]   - I can, you have a mini display port.
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.160]   - I think I can just plug in.
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:07.800]   Yeah, let's see, you have to mirror your display.
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:09.960]   We've not done this live before.
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:10.960]   - Let's find out how this--
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:12.840]   - I don't think I have enough cable.
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:14.160]   - Oh, got it!
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:16.520]   - Almost got away.
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:17.560]   No, we don't have enough cable.
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:21.480]   - So I think you'll have to slide the thing over here.
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:22.880]   Let's see if we can do this.
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.840]   On the fly, look at that.
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:27.080]   This is how we get the video out.
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:31.120]   Now we have a mini display port to HDMI,
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:33.200]   and then HDMI to SDI converter.
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:37.400]   And we can get that right into the tricaster.
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:39.240]   By the way, we love this new tricaster.
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:40.080]   - It is awesome.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:42.760]   - Yeah, the 850, the top of the line.
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:44.560]   It's the tricaster extreme.
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.840]   - Yes.
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.800]   - Now we completely lost video.
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:48.960]   Well, there it is.
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:49.800]   - It's thinking about it.
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:51.160]   - It's thinking, it says,
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:54.120]   "I see there is something else attached."
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:55.480]   Are you in mirror?
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:56.560]   - I will find out.
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:00.280]   - What do you see, Ilina?
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:01.280]   - I see nothing.
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:02.920]   - She sees enough things.
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:04.840]   - Not enough things.
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:06.000]   - I see a black screen.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.320]   - Hold on.
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:09.600]   - This is what I see.
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.920]   - It's kind of a heavy...
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.160]   - There's a lot going on in this game.
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:14.000]   - A lot going on.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.960]   - Well, it's just that there's a...
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.000]   This scene is heavy.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:17.840]   It's too many hours of polygon.
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:19.160]   - Yeah, you pegged the CPU.
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:20.480]   I could see it from your menu, me.
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:23.920]   - So it wasn't really...
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.280]   So anyway, so here's what...
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:26.120]   - You would open it.
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:27.560]   How many pecs, bag of pixels?
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:28.400]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:30.000]   - No, no, it's the number of polygons.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.080]   It's not so much pixels.
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:32.080]   - Ah, there it is.
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:33.560]   - Oh, you're mirroring this on?
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:34.400]   It's just a...
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:35.880]   It's probably a resolution we can't pick up.
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:36.720]   - Yeah.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:40.120]   - You've got it at 720p.
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.800]   - Are you doing 1080 or 721?
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:42.880]   - Do 1080i.
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:44.760]   - 1080i?
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:45.600]   - Yeah.
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.480]   - See what happens there.
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:49.840]   - Yeah, Andy Hedrum.
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:53.000]   Start studying Andy.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:53.840]   - Can you see that?
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:54.680]   - I see this.
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:55.520]   - Hey!
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:56.360]   - Just look at this.
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:57.200]   - All right, there we go.
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:58.040]   - It's a miracle.
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:15:58.880]   - All right.
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:15:59.720]   - So you just said it said it's too low.
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:00.560]   - I know, I wasn't...
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:01.560]   I was underestimating.
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:03.240]   - You didn't know what the Tri-Caster could do.
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:04.080]   - So what you're looking at here...
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:04.920]   - So what is this?
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:06.240]   - This is my backyard.
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:08.440]   - What do you live in a graveyard?
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:09.440]   - No!
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:10.640]   - Or a bomb shelter.
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:11.800]   - Oh, that's the greenhouse.
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:12.800]   - Oh, that's the greenhouse.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:14.520]   - That's the greenhouse in my backyard.
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:16.560]   Okay, so what this is though,
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.640]   is if I turn on...
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:21.440]   It's kind of cool if I view my points.
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:23.200]   - We don't convert to S-Video, we convert to S-T-I.
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.080]   - Okay, and I pull back.
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.560]   What you're gonna see is those were all the photos.
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:27.400]   - Whoa!
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:28.240]   - So that's where I was standing.
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:29.080]   - These took lots of photos.
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:31.040]   - I took those photos.
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:32.240]   - And where are all the dots?
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:34.560]   - What it does is it looks at all these photos automatically.
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:37.080]   It turns away and it builds this point cloud.
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:38.560]   It is looking at what are all the same points.
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:41.080]   - So this is like Microsoft's photos synth a little bit, right?
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:42.600]   - It is, so here's the deal.
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:43.920]   Is this does what everyone,
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:46.200]   all of us want photosynt to do?
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:48.400]   So what we want photosynt to do is,
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.680]   not photosynt, but they're synth, yeah.
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:53.680]   We want the point clouds and Microsoft...
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:54.600]   - They won't release that.
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:56.080]   - No, no, they leave it open.
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:58.760]   If you're geek, they're not protecting it.
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:00.160]   They don't care if you do it,
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.520]   but they're not making a product out of it.
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:02.360]   These guys are...
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:03.720]   - So a point cloud is...
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:05.600]   - Is this point cloud is a 3D representation,
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:08.440]   so it's found 3D points in the scene.
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:10.680]   - And what information does it have for each point?
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:11.960]   Luminance color?
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.680]   - Yeah, luminance color and it has the...
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:16.320]   - It has obviously XYZ position.
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:18.680]   - It also has the exact position and rotation
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:20.120]   of all the cameras.
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:20.960]   - Right.
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:21.800]   - You know, so which is very useful if you're trying to...
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:22.640]   - How does it get that?
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:24.840]   Is there a GPS function?
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.240]   - Once it calculates that?
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:27.800]   - Yeah, once it figures out where all those points are,
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:28.640]   it reverse engineers.
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:29.480]   - Oh my goodness.
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:30.320]   - It pops back up.
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:31.640]   - Oh, you can't hear where all your cameras are.
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:33.640]   - So it calculates the exact positioning of your camera.
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:34.480]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:35.760]   And so... - And plane and everything.
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:37.120]   - That's Blade Runner.
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:37.960]   - Yeah, it is.
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:38.800]   - Well, and the thing is,
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:39.800]   if you're trying to figure out,
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:40.960]   if I want to do a visual effect shot,
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:41.800]   and I talk about my eye...
[01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:42.640]   - And I need to figure out...
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:43.480]   - And he knows.
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:44.320]   - Exactly where this camera is.
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.160]   - And hence.
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.000]   - Exactly.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:46.840]   - Hold it.
[01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:47.680]   Stop there.
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:48.520]   - Stop there.
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:49.440]   - Yeah.
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:51.920]   And so if you want to figure out exactly where this camera
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:54.840]   is to put like a little gremlin in there or something,
[01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:56.600]   and you want to get exactly in the right position
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.040]   so that it matches up,
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.480]   this is how you do that.
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:00.320]   - And then you can render this.
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.760]   - But you can also turn this into...
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.400]   Now I just did a rough one,
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:05.960]   but this is what you can do here is actually,
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:09.240]   if I go over and view and go down to shade it,
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:12.200]   that's actually the 3D representation.
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:13.040]   So it's actually...
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:14.240]   Now it built a little bit too much geometry.
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.040]   I haven't deleted it.
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:19.080]   So I have to delete those big black areas behind me,
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:21.400]   but yeah, see, that's the part that I have to get rid of.
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:22.240]   I haven't gotten rid of yet.
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:23.320]   - It made it a whole sphere.
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:24.600]   - It made a sphere behind it, yeah.
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:25.440]   But that's all...
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:26.280]   - This is an actual...
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:27.120]   - It's building a 3D...
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:27.960]   - It's 3D.
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:28.800]   - This may look really rough.
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.120]   - It's awesome.
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:31.480]   And you can get...
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:33.320]   I'm just running the demo here on this computer.
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:35.440]   - So we could do this with a studio, for instance.
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:37.280]   - And have a 3D, a beautiful 3D rendering.
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:38.120]   You're gonna do that?
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:38.960]   - I'm working on it.
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:39.800]   - It'll take a long time to do the studio.
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:40.640]   - No, of course.
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:41.480]   - You've just got a lot of details.
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:43.400]   - Brent By did a beautiful SketchUp rendering.
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:44.240]   - His is awesome.
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:45.520]   - Can you then apply this to the SketchUp
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:47.120]   as textures and so forth?
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:49.280]   - You could take pictures and apply those to the SketchUp.
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:50.120]   - That's true.
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:51.720]   - What this would allow you to do is really figure
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:52.720]   a lot of that data out,
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:54.800]   and especially if you already have a SketchUp model,
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:56.800]   it's one thing, but if you're trying to...
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.240]   - He put a lot of effort into...
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:18:59.080]   - I can take pictures of buildings on it.
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:01.680]   - Into drawing, and I mean, it took probably weeks to do that.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:04.000]   - This took me a couple minutes.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.920]   - This is from AGISOFT.ru.
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:08.760]   - Russian company.
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:11.400]   - Is the Russian programmers doing some great Russian work?
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:12.360]   - And how much is it?
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:13.360]   - I think that it's...
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:18.360]   I believe that non-GIS version is a couple hundred dollars.
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:19.600]   The GIS version is...
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:23.520]   So GIS is for engineering firms and mapping
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:24.360]   and everything else.
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:27.560]   They have a version for that that's like $3,000 or $4,000.
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:28.400]   But you don't need that.
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:29.640]   I don't need that.
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:30.800]   And so this one I think is...
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:31.800]   - Look how beautiful that is.
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:34.000]   - It looks like you're in the middle of $79.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.320]   - Or doom.
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:38.720]   - It looks like I'm about to be killed with...
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:40.120]   But you're sneaking behind me with a shovel.
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:40.960]   - Yeah.
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:41.800]   - That's how good it acts like.
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:45.000]   - This is from an episode of Dexter.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.760]   - No, I'm like I'm about to say,
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:49.360]   "Gun is there a lot of bloody FedEx uniforms around there?"
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:50.520]   - Yeah, that is.
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:51.360]   (laughing)
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:54.600]   - It's $179 at home, put it in the chat, thanks.
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:56.760]   - And then $34.99 for the full-
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:57.680]   - GIS, which I don't need.
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:00.080]   - And so the thing, $179 is fine,
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.720]   but you can download, here's the thing.
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:03.600]   Is this is just fun to do?
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:04.440]   Even if you're not gonna...
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:05.280]   - Try it free.
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:06.120]   - It's a free demo.
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:07.720]   Download the demo, go out and take some photos.
[01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:08.560]   - Is it time limit?
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:09.400]   - What is the...
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:10.240]   - It's fun to play with.
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:13.120]   I haven't found a time limit or any real feature limit,
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:14.960]   but I've just been playing with it up until now.
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:17.960]   And so, but I'm definitely gonna buy it
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:19.040]   'cause it's really cool.
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.400]   - I think you should buy the pro version
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:21.480]   and let me use it.
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:22.480]   - Yeah, there you go.
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.800]   (laughing)
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:25.080]   'Cause I'll use it once, right?
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:26.440]   I mean, I'll take the pictures and then...
[01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:27.280]   - Let's get the demo.
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:28.120]   You can get the demo.
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:28.960]   - Get the demo.
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:30.400]   But can you export it out in some way that you can use?
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:31.960]   - Yeah, you can export this out as LBJs.
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:32.800]   - Wow.
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:36.440]   - So you can export model and it will then...
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:37.280]   - Yeah, think about it.
[01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:40.120]   - That's it, Masa, Germany, HGISuff.ru.
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:44.240]   - These are all the data, all the objects that you would need.
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:46.640]   - Oh, so those are all standard formats.
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:49.600]   Very cool pick of the week.
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:52.080]   I'm not gonna do one, I'm just embarrassed.
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.120]   I was gonna pick Fluid App.
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:59.040]   And you have on your blog, really interesting way
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:03.320]   of making a standalone app using Automator and Safari.
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:07.600]   And people should go to www.cwob.com
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:10.640]   and it's like the third post down today,
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:13.720]   making standalone apps with Automator.
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:15.120]   But I've always liked this thing, Fluid.
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.200]   I think it was a recommendation.
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:19.520]   I'm pretty sure what it is, a pick many moons ago.
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:21.720]   But what's nice is it's lion aware.
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:26.120]   If you pay the $5 for the Fluid App Pro,
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:29.600]   you get the full screen, you get a lot of lion features.
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:32.880]   And I'm really loving this thing of full screening
[01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:36.560]   the browser and then using the swipe
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:39.000]   to three fingers swipe back and forth on the screen.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.600]   It's very iPad-like.
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:42.920]   I full screen my mail, I full screen my browser.
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:44.680]   Those are the two apps I use most of the time
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:47.600]   and I go from space to space just by going like that.
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:49.800]   And this Fluid App would be a really nice way
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:52.760]   to make your apps full screen, your web pages,
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:55.520]   like our Google Docs that we're always opening up full screen
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:59.360]   and have them be part of that with their own space though.
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:21:59.880]   So--
[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:01.520]   Now is Fluid App updated for Lion?
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:02.360]   It has.
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:05.800]   It has specific lion features, which I really like.
[01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:06.200]   Fluid--
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:10.040]   That's a great thing because my biggest confusion
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:14.080]   with the spaces is that if you have an app with more
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:16.680]   than one window open, sometimes it's very, very confusing
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:19.480]   as to what space has the window you're actually interested in.
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:21.400]   There are times when I want to drag something
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:22.680]   into a mail window.
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:24.560]   But I think that they're in the same space,
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:25.600]   but they're not.
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:26.800]   It's just such a hassle.
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:29.080]   With Fluid, you could just basically turn that one thing
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.520]   you want to do, that one Google Reader window
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:34.160]   into its own separate app that will get its own separate space
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:35.920]   apart from everything in the same way.
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:36.960]   So that's really cool.
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:38.640]   So and it's using Safari.
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:42.160]   If you pay the $5 for the Pro, separate cookie storage,
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:44.520]   you can pin Fluid Apps to the status bar.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:47.960]   You can use user scripts or user styles in your Fluid Apps
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:49.720]   and line full screen mode.
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:54.080]   So makes Fluid, which we've recommended before, even better
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:56.280]   if you're a lion user.
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:58.840]   I was playing with it before the show,
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.320]   and I thought I'd bought it.
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:02.040]   But I guess I either lost my license
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:02.920]   or didn't keep track of it.
[01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:05.320]   But for $5, buy it again.
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:07.120]   What the hell?
[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:08.960]   Annie and I go, is that the Celestial Waste
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:11.280]   to Band with www.cwob.com?
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:14.200]   You could also find him at the Chicago Sun Times,
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:16.920]   where he is adeptly writing pieces all the time.
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:18.280]   Your lion review was great.
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:20.040]   Thank you for doing that.
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:22.840]   Thank you for being here and putting up
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:24.480]   with our technical difficulties,
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:26.080]   because once again, we're in a brand new studio
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:28.520]   and we're still working out the kinks.
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:31.200]   But just having you sitting next to me like this.
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:32.000]   It's awesome.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.360]   It's so special.
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:37.680]   I just feel the closest to you and Leo and Alex and Eileen
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:39.520]   and everybody else there with that.
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:41.280]   I've always felt but never been able to see.
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:45.400]   So on this opportunity, I toast you and I celebrate you.
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:48.080]   And I hope that we raise that one more dollar
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:50.640]   so that we can fight whatever disease it is
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:51.520]   that you're being set up.
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:52.640]   Buy a brick.
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:53.520]   That's it.
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:54.040]   Exactly.
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:54.880]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:56.600]   The disease of insufficient bricks.
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.680]   They have insufficient funds.
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:01.040]   You should see my bank account.
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:03.600]   Thanks to Mr. Alex Lindsey, as always,
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:06.080]   for stepping across the hall and joining us.
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:09.640]   He's at pixelcore.com, the guild of multimedia artists
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:11.360]   who are learning how to use these tools
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:13.160]   and then getting work together.
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:15.720]   Pixelcore.kevTV for their podcasts.
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:17.240]   Any live streams coming up soon?
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:18.760]   We are streaming every Thursday.
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:21.000]   Now tomorrow we're going to actually be--
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.680]   or not tomorrow, but Thursday we'll be streaming
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:24.000]   Twip Live.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:24.800]   This week, a photo.
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.520]   We're going to do it out of my backyard.
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:28.160]   We've decided we're going to pull on a steady cam,
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:28.960]   jib.
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:29.800]   We're going to have some fun.
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:31.040]   So we're going to be shooting at--
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:32.360]   Soon you won't even have to bring cameras out.
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:34.120]   You just have a 3D model of your backyard
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:35.480]   and you could just put it on the screen.
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:36.640]   The thought head crossed my mind.
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:38.000]   I think that sounds pretty good.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:38.720]   Yeah.
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:40.840]   But every Thursday we're doing something.
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:42.480]   So Thursday at 6 o'clock.
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:44.600]   If we go to pixelcore.com and go--
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:45.400]   slash live.
[01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:45.960]   Slash live.
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:46.720]   We'll find it.
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:48.320]   All right, that's great.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:54.680]   And the naco is @naco, I-H-N-A-T-K-O on Twitter.
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:57.080]   Alex Lindsey is @AlexLindsey on Twitter.
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:59.640]   But I bet you both of you use Google+ most of the time
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:00.120]   these days.
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:01.880]   I see you a lot on Google+ Andy.
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:02.920]   I'm working on it.
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:03.440]   Great.
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:07.200]   I'm using Google+ as tweets that take more than 140
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:08.040]   characters.
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:09.800]   And also another blog is for real articles.
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:11.760]   Also a great place for your photos.
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:14.760]   I hope you put more photos up there because, by the way,
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:17.200]   I loved the rerun Dancing Dynamite.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:18.160]   That was awesome.
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:18.720]   I love that.
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:20.560]   Damn, that bad good dance.
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:23.280]   This is a real opportunity for photographers, I think,
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:24.920]   on Google+ to put their pictures up there.
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:27.520]   They just look fantastic.
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:30.400]   So I have to say, I haven't been back to Twitter much at all.
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:34.040]   Very little to Facebook almost all the time here on Google+.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.680]   So you're not using it at all?
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:37.240]   I'm using it a little, not much.
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:38.080]   But I'm working on it.
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:40.200]   I'm planning to.
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:41.040]   You know me.
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:42.680]   I get stuck in my ways.
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:45.080]   And so I'm always about a month and a half behind you.
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:48.560]   I have a feeling that your blog--
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:49.080]   what is it called?
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:49.840]   Lost Pank?
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:50.360]   It could really--
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:50.920]   Sank.
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:51.440]   Bautorsack.
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:54.400]   Bautorsack.com could really benefit, I think,
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.000]   from something like this.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.120]   Instead of the blog, that's what Kevin Rose did.
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:25:59.120]   He says, I'm not going to do the blog.
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:00.440]   You go to KevinRose.com.
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:01.800]   It's his Google+ account.
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:04.280]   And when he said that, when I watched that, I was like,
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:05.080]   "Kenaventrigging."
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:06.080]   I'm not even treaking.
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.240]   That might be a good idea.
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:08.560]   So I'm thinking about it.
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:09.600]   Fluid app.
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:12.280]   G+, I got my G+ app.
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:13.080]   I love it.
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:14.240]   Thanks, everybody, for being here.
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:15.400]   Thank you, Eileen Rivera.
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:16.280]   I did a great job.
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:16.720]   Didn't she?
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:17.720]   Yay, Eileen.
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:18.240]   Try it.
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:20.240]   Her first time running the board.
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:22.200]   I don't know what to do with my hands now.
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:24.560]   I'll try to keep them above the table.
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:26.720]   But it's really nice to have you, Eileen, on the board,
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:27.840]   producing the show all along.
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:30.600]   But now, actually, add master control.
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:31.240]   It's been fun.
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:33.560]   Pretty soon I'm going to do some funny wipes.
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:35.840]   Oh, do one funny wipe.
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:36.840]   Just one funny wipe for us.
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:37.680]   You want one right now?
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:39.200]   Give us a funny wipe.
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:41.040]   Ah, she blows up.
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:41.800]   Get back to work.
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:42.960]   Break time is over.
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:43.960]   Ah!
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:47.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:50.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:53.260]   (upbeat music)
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:54.260]   .
