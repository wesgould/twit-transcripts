[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, Renee, Andy and Alex are all here.
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.640]   Quite a debate coming up over this Bloomberg story.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.320]   Apple denies it, Amazon denies it.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.080]   I think there's some merit to it. Apparently I'm the only one.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.520]   It's coming up next.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.200]   Also 12.0.1 and what it fixes Mac Break Weekly is next.

[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.840]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we talk about the latest Apple news and there
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.360]   is some interesting stuff to talk about today.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.160]   Fortunately, the Mac Break team is fully assembled.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.960]   And battery's not included.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.640]   From imore.com, all the way from Montreal, Renee Richie.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.160]   Happy Thanksgiving, Renee.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.160]   Thank you so much, Leo.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.720]   So much news. It's felt like a month has passed already, but it's only been a week.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.160]   You just wanted to talk about this week.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.160]   I hope so much.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.160]   We'll get to it.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.160]   We have Turkey for Thanksgiving.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.160]   What are you doing?
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.280]   What do you Canadians do for Thanksgiving?
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.040]   So you basically just took our entire Thanksgiving and replicated it south of the border.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.520]   So I think the ham might be unique to you, but all the turkey and stuffing and stuff
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.520]   like that.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.920]   You don't do ham. Just Leo does ham.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.000]   Okay, Leo does ham.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.960]   So it's turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, sweet potatoes.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.320]   I don't think we put marshmallows on sweet potatoes.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.760]   That might not be a Canadian thing.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.520]   That's a disgusting thing.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.000]   If you're going to do that, might as well do the whole full walled earth.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.720]   Maybe green beans with almonds sliced, thinly sliced almonds.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.360]   We did Brussels sprouts and broccoli, but whatever.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.360]   Whatever green floats your boat.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.360]   Yeah.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.360]   Now I'm hungry.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.360]   Me too.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.360]   Yeah.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.360]   Happy Thanksgiving.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.120]   Also here, Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.680]   It seems very early to be talking about Thanksgiving, but that's the way we are.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.720]   We like to get way ahead of it.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.720]   The Canadians start making plans.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.720]   Start making plans.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.720]   Do it early.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.720]   Yeah, because it freezes here earlier.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.720]   It's colder there.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.720]   It's a harvest now.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.400]   Lindsey, we have to harvest now.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.800]   But I don't know if I agree with his contention that they gave us Thanksgiving.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.440]   It feels like it might have gone the other way.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.440]   I thought it.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.880]   We had a month head start, Leo.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.480]   We have pilgrims.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.480]   Squanto.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.640]   We crossed the land bridge and walked down first.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.480]   They get you a cold before that.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.480]   All right.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.480]   All right.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.480]   You got it there.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.360]   I'm saying that one.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.720]   Also joining us, Andy and that co from public radio in Boston, WGBH and notco.com.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.720]   Hey, Andrew.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.720]   Hello.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.040]   And yeah, now I wish we could delay for half an hour because I opted for the late breakfast
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.400]   as opposed to lunch today.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.120]   And now after having talked about Thanksgiving and ham and stuff.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.880]   Yeah, I had mentioned before the show that I'm ordering a 14 pound corn cob smoked Harrington's
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.280]   ham.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.040]   And I'm going to I cook it very slow.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.240]   I actually prefer that to Turkey.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.400]   That's fine.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.800]   It's not traditional though.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.000]   Renee, don't think we Americans do that normally.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   We keep it to the rescue.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.240]   It says that the first Thanksgiving in North America might have been as far north as Baffin
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.240]   Island.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.240]   Oh, please.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:10.520]   Baffin Island, my somebody, some wag probably Amber's beer said eternity is a ham and two
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.520]   people.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.080]   Oh, well, Google and its announcement today.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.720]   I don't know if there's anything to talk about on Mac break weekly.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.120]   There's a new Pixel three phone.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.400]   I will be getting it nine days.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.400]   It's roughly the same.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.780]   You know, it's a little less than an iPhone 10 S Google showed off a lot of interesting
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.280]   camera stuff though.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.680]   Of course they've they were the first I think to do this HDR plus thing where you take multiple
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.880]   images and you combine them in an interesting way to get to get a better image.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.000]   They say they can even do it for zooming.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.160]   That was super interesting with the optical image stabilization to pull multiple different
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.040]   bits of data and combine them all together to make a better because they don't have optical
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.040]   zoom.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.040]   They don't have multiple cameras.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.640]   Huawei has three and some of them have 12 now.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.880]   They still only have one.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.640]   So they're doing it with computational photography, which is super fascinating.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.920]   I thought that was very interesting.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.640]   They're also going to they have portrait mode, but you can also defocus the person.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.880]   I guess I would want to do that, but you could as well as bring the background focus
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.600]   back and forth.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.040]   They also have best picture.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.680]   I think Samsung has done that, but I was never impressed with Samsung's.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.680]   Pop shot.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.200]   Yeah, I expect Google to do a better job.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.400]   The idea is that as soon as you raise the camera, it's taking pictures and they had
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.840]   a great montage of pictures taken just a second too late.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.840]   That was really good.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.680]   So we'll keep our IP.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.680]   No pixel buds.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.800]   They're going to do a new slate, a new tablet.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.960]   And you know, there's a question there.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.960]   It's going to be 599.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:38.960]   Is it aimed at the iPad?
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.240]   Is it aimed at the surface?
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.960]   Or is it somewhere in between because it runs chromals?
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.000]   It's kind of an Intel processor, which was really serious to me.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.040]   Either way, from M3, I5 to I7, all core 8th generation.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:57.560]   Well, because without getting too heavy into it on an Apple podcast, so it already can
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.480]   run Chrome OS and Android apps.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.000]   And they've been working with developers to make sure the Android apps converted for
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.800]   the tablet sized Chromebook don't stink.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.000]   So that's two software libraries.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.440]   It can also run Linux.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.040]   Any package that's been compiled for Debian Linux.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.320]   You can just basically drag it onto the desktop, double click on it.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.000]   It will open and install.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.880]   And they have also been filing with Microsoft for certification for Windows 10 compatibility.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.720]   And there are lots of hooks and mentions of Windows 10 compatibility modes in developer
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.040]   betas that have been dropping.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.740]   So it could be interesting that that kind of would explain why they have versions like
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.320]   mobile style Intel processors for like 599 bucks and not a whole lot of storage for people
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.720]   who literally just want a Chromebook to people who once if all of this gets announced and
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:57.020]   it really works well, $1,600 or $1,000 or $1,200 or $1,500 for an I5 or an I7 CPU and
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.820]   256 gigs of storage.
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.140]   That might be a very interesting purchase for somebody who wants a Chromebook, but they
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.620]   also need to have like a regular notebook for times when they travel.
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.060]   And they've got that one thing that requires a Windows, like our actual Windows desktop
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.060]   app.
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.580]   It could be really interesting.
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.020]   Did they enter a move?
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.740]   The headphone jack just to fit the Intel Silicon inside there?
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:18.740]   Is there a story?
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.260]   No, they did it just to piss me off.
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.260]   I can't believe it.
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.060]   Do I have a new headphone jack on the yes?
[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.060]   No, but there's two USB.
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.100]   No, but that's stupid.
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.900]   I just tweeted this out.
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.820]   There's no possible.
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.660]   There's no really a good excuse.
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.660]   I don't like that.
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.660]   Did you hear the application they gave, Dieter?
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:37.660]   Because that was amazing.
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.300]   He asked on the video, "We believe that people have Bluetooth now.
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.300]   We want to go all in this.
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.300]   No, no.
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.620]   They're going kicking and screaming at least in some quarters."
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:52.660]   Well, I know it's like, I bet that if we check with Chinese, Chinese distributors, that
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:59.020]   headphone jack, the price of that headphone jack must be like $72 per 10,000 unit smell.
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.220]   Somebody's got the license on that.
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.380]   It's like why I just don't know why they're.
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:08.980]   It's even kind of insulting that they would say there was a rational reason why they decided
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.180]   to do it.
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:14.260]   It's like, no, I will still maintain that especially on a tablet or notebook, it's an
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.500]   anti-consumer move.
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.500]   I just can't do it.
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.500]   I agree with you.
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.500]   I agree with you.
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.260]   Of course, we got new iPads coming out later this month.
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.700]   Are you still at the opinion, Renee, that there will not be an event?
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.820]   No, I think there, so I've never said there won't be an event.
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.300]   I think when there is a new design, it behooves them to have an event because they do a way
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.100]   better job setting expectations and explaining the design.
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:38.780]   When they leave it to a bunch of overly busy journalists.
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:43.060]   This is going to be, I mean, they're going to do more rumors along the lines of they're
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:48.620]   going to do Face ID and Edge to Edge, 4K H2O.
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.620]   Yeah.
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.620]   USB C is interesting.
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:51.620]   I still find that.
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.420]   Please, please Apple, call it the number two pencil.
[00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:59.020]   I beg of you.
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:02.020]   Do you think they'll abandon the headphone jack and the iPad?
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.820]   Then Andy, just have a list of it.
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:09.020]   See, there's no space concerns in the iPad and a lot of pro audio users really love the
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.020]   headphone jack.
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.780]   One of the problems with the USB C is that a lot of people have to put it under the display
[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.100]   and then a lot of this stuff takes up space.
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.100]   But that's a phone, a millimeter concern and a phone and a tablet.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.940]   You have room for these giant speakers and stuff.
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.860]   So if they do it, I mean, I'll be sad, but it can't be for the same reason as they do
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:24.860]   it on a phone.
[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:25.860]   Yeah.
[00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.220]   Well, we'll find out.
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.620]   It'll be presumably in the next two or three weeks.
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.780]   Traditionally, it's been around the week of the 24th.
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.780]   You don't want it to be later, right?
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.380]   Because you want to get it in the stores before the end of the year.
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.380]   Yeah.
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.380]   And the orders and everything.
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.780]   The only thing that's weird this year is that you have the iPhone XR that's going live
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.580]   around the same time and last year, the iPhone X was later.
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.940]   So I don't have the timing is going to work out, but it'll be interesting.
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:51.940]   Yeah.
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.580]   Also, they like to say that Apple tends to shut down like early for the holidays.
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.900]   And so it is a it is part of the culture that we would rather not have people.
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:04.220]   We would not have something big in play that we need to keep following up on in terms of
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:09.260]   communications in terms of engineering, in terms of all what stuff as late as like December
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.740]   1st or second.
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:15.780]   One thing I did find interesting about the Google announcement was that now that Facebook,
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:23.100]   I guess yesterday talked about their screen, you know, their portal as well as which I
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:28.540]   think might have been a preemptive strike because Google's announcing today.
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:33.820]   And of course, you have Amazon Apple now this this leaves Apple behind again with a screen,
[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.940]   you know, where they don't have a screen, which I do think is is compelling.
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:43.740]   I think that we have an Amazon show in the kitchen and it's nice.
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.420]   And I have to admit, we mostly just talked to it.
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.420]   We don't really know.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.420]   Here's the interesting thing.
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:52.460]   This doesn't have a camera at the Google one, whereas obviously the Facebook one does.
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.700]   I think you got to be out of your mind at this point to put a Facebook camera.
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:00.780]   Not just a Facebook camera, a Facebook camera that's basically a pantilt zoom that can look
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:01.780]   anywhere in the room.
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:02.780]   A virtual pantilt zoom.
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:03.780]   Yeah.
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:04.780]   Yeah.
[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:06.620]   So it follows you can look around.
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.420]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:12.220]   But boy, that really would be great if you wanted to spy on people.
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.740]   I mean, it's just this curious timing because it's right after they disclosed hundreds of
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.420]   thousands of new data preaches.
[00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.380]   Well, of course, I bought two.
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:23.180]   And the only thing that great me is in order to buy them, I had to reactivate my Facebook
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.180]   account.
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.660]   You have to have a Facebook account to use it.
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:26.660]   Yeah.
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:27.660]   It's such a weird product too.
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:31.900]   It's because the Amazon product and the Google product that they've had the smart displays
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.580]   using the Google Assistant from third parties months ago.
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:40.780]   I've had one in my living room for two or three months.
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:44.100]   And those smart screens do really interesting active things.
[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:51.060]   It really is like a hands-free computer, whereas Facebook is a SELA plus Facebook messenger.
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:56.020]   This got a lot nice, but it's not really integrating with the screen as much.
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:03.900]   It's going to be a great gift because for all the stuff that we harangue about Facebook,
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:08.620]   it is the easiest way for an elderly aunt or an elderly parent or grandparent who talked
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.420]   to the grandkids because that's the standard that they can easily use if you buy one.
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.420]   What scares me?
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.420]   Yeah, I know.
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:20.020]   But I'm wondering how many grandmas there are who we're going to be able to use this.
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:26.060]   So, well, I guess the funniest page in this portal announcement, portal.facebook.com, private
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.180]   by design.
[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.820]   And the design is you can clip something over the camera.
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:35.940]   But that eventually, that essentially makes it the same as if you've already got a Google
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.020]   home or you're thinking about Amazon or whatever.
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.780]   Those are all the things.
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.340]   Can you do all the Echo show stuff?
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.220]   Like can I say I want to see my doorbell or can I...
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:49.300]   Doesn't it hand off like anything that the Facebook AI doesn't do specifically for Facebook
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.300]   and hands off to us?
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.300]   Hello to do?
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.300]   It was unclear.
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.300]   But it sounded like...
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.300]   Okay.
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:58.980]   I was talking to somebody over the weekend, excuse me, yesterday about it.
[00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:03.740]   And they didn't seem to think that it was doing as it would give you the full feature
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.620]   stack that you would get from an Amazon product.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.300]   That's the impression I got.
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.300]   Yeah.
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.620]   I did like the reading to you though.
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:12.620]   If you want to read...
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:13.620]   See, you might like this, Alex.
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:18.780]   If you want to read the kids, it has special stories.
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:26.380]   And you can become the Big Bad Wolf because it will put Wolf stuff on you when you do
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:27.380]   that part of it.
[00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:28.380]   That's kind of cool.
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.700]   Do you remember Mark Kazza's video when he had the Samsung speaker ask the Google speaker
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:33.700]   to do things?
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:34.700]   Oh boy.
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.340]   That's sort of what it reminds me of.
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:37.340]   Yeah.
[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:38.340]   Yeah.
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.820]   I think anybody who's smart is not going to trust this.
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:45.060]   It's going to be like, "Oh, we have this wonderful new Choose Your Own Adventure with your kids.
[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.220]   Here's a demo of it."
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:51.500]   And then the Big Bad Wolf decided to go and buy his favorite candy bar.
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.500]   Yeah.
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.740]   Did you just use your favorite candy bar, these stinkers bar?
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.100]   What was the street you grew up on plus your first pet's name?
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.100]   Yeah.
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.380]   Wurries me a little bit.
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.580]   Anyway, I ordered one because we got to look at it.
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:08.500]   I also ordered all the Google stuff and it's been expensive a couple of days.
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.500]   I can't order it.
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.500]   I keep adding it to the cart.
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.180]   When I go to the cart, it says your cart is empty.
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.500]   It's maddening over and over again.
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.500]   The portal?
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.500]   Maybe they don't offer the Google stuff.
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:16.500]   The Google stuff.
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:17.500]   The Google stuff.
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.500]   Yeah.
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.380]   Maybe they don't offer in Canada yet.
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.380]   They do.
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.380]   It's on the Canadian.
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.380]   I'm going to keep trying.
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.020]   Maybe they're just having Google having server problems just how you can tell it's a very
[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:27.580]   Google centric day.
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.940]   The one thing I was going to say about that was I think that what's interesting is that
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:34.700]   Apple's the last one to possibly do a screen if they ever do a screen.
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:38.620]   And they got their speaker that they're really excited about.
[00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.940]   But they're the one company that I would feel like, "Oh, I don't feel that bad about
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.900]   having the screen in my house because they're so privacy oriented."
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.220]   It's all private or not.
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:51.140]   The other ones you always feel like you're going to be, people are going to be looking
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.140]   at you.
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.860]   Well, let's talk about privacy because the big story of the week and I would love to
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:15:01.180]   get your take on this, the big hack from Bloomberg Business Week came out on Thursday
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:10.100]   claiming that China put a tiny chip on motherboards coming from Super Micro that are used everywhere.
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.740]   We use them because they were Amazon discovered.
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:13.740]   Yeah, Elemental, right.
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:17.620]   Before they bought the Elemental, they wanted it to check security.
[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:18.740]   According to Bloomberg.
[00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:22.540]   Again, everything we say will be according to Bloomberg Business Week.
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:29.660]   And these elementals are everywhere from the Mormon Church to the Department of Defense
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:30.660]   to...
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:31.660]   I own 20 of them.
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:32.660]   Yeah.
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.140]   Do you own any of the old Super Micro based?
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.780]   Because all of ours are, we traded that in for Amazon.
[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.780]   We got...
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:38.780]   I have some older ones.
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:39.780]   Bring in one and we'll take it apart.
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.780]   We'll see if we can find that chip.
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:42.780]   Seriously.
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.740]   Okay, so I'll complete the story.
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:52.860]   The next day Amazon, Apple, the Chinese government all say, "B-S, it didn't happen."
[00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.660]   Apple was very aggressive in its denial.
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:16:00.380]   Apple who barely ever answers press inquiries and answers them in the tercest way possible
[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.780]   when it does answer them put out pages of retort.
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:08.740]   Yeah, and here's the letter they wrote to the members of Congress who inquired about
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:09.740]   it.
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:14.300]   "The committee, the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee."
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:18.060]   We were struck by the fact that the gravity and magnitude of the claim seemed to be undermined
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.060]   by their uncertainty around key details.
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:25.820]   Nevertheless, we worked tirelessly to ascertain whether these claims were true or failing
[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.300]   that if anything even like them was true.
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:33.940]   In the end, our internal investigations directly contradict every consequential assertion made
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.300]   in the article, some of which we know were based on a single anonymous source.
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:42.500]   Although we should point out the article itself had 17 anonymous, synonymous sources.
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:47.900]   Well, that doesn't surprise me because if you knew this and you talked to Bloomberg Business
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:51.420]   Week, you're in the letter with a small room in the better way.
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:54.540]   You might have had an infosec at Apple, which is unusual too.
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:59.340]   Yeah, I mean, this, so one thing some people claimed is maybe the Apple PR department didn't
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:02.380]   know, but this guy would for sure know.
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.100]   People's never found malicious and
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:08.100]   They had a bruceul.
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:15.940]   For a publicly traded company to be so assertive puts themselves at incredible risk of lawsuits
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.100]   and SEC violations and everything else.
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.460]   For them to come out and a publicly traded company to come out and say this and have all
[00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.540]   of them say it is on the agenda.
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.780]   They're risking a lot to say that.
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:31.660]   Look at the Department of Homeland Security's Saturday announcement.
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:36.900]   We currently have no reason to doubt statements from companies that have denied this.
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.620]   Throw that one away.
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:45.900]   Well, I don't throw it away because to me, but that's them saying, well, okay, but we're
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.260]   not going to that's that's hedging.
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:53.900]   If there were that many super micro things that were sent in, because this has to be part
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:54.900]   of a fab.
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:55.900]   I agree.
[00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:59.660]   We will know sooner or later because you and others have these elemental motherboards.
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:03.460]   And I think that but the thing is, if I was Bloomberg, I would have found that first.
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:04.940]   Like I find one.
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.260]   You find one that lot of things.
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.780]   We're talking about thousands of processor, thousands of super micros that are floating
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.420]   around here with this infamous chip that they find.
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.060]   But then you've got to explain.
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.180]   I would I would not have made that I would not have created this.
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:22.140]   I would not have written this or at least not published it until I had a board, but but
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.940]   17 sources is a lot of sources when they're anonymous.
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:32.540]   And this is a Bloomberg Business Week is not a fly by night operation, but they've been
[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.340]   working on this for a year.
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:40.340]   And without one someone coming on the record, I have this issue and no board.
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.620]   No one first of all, no one is going to go on the record.
[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:43.620]   You'd be in jail.
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:44.620]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:45.620]   I swear to God.
[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.380]   No one's going to go on the record on this.
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.860]   No one is going to go on the record.
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:53.260]   What may happen and what I hope will happen and I expect will happen is somebody who has
[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.580]   one of these motherboards finds this chip.
[00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.260]   And by the way, this is not that chip.
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.260]   That's the wrong chip.
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.260]   This isn't the chip.
[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:04.580]   That's the that's another statement, by the way, by the one person, the one person who
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:11.100]   was quoted by name in it, a security researcher said, you know, this doesn't smell right because
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:17.660]   I talked to Jordan Robertson, one of the journalists who wrote this story.
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:24.340]   And a lot of the stuff that he that I told him was I last year was regurgitated word
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.100]   for word.
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:32.940]   He said this is a security expert named Joe Fitzpatrick said, I would never do it this
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:33.940]   way.
[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.500]   Frankly, a hard way and plants too easy to discover.
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:41.460]   It's much simpler just to do, you know, firmware modifications and so forth.
[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:44.620]   He also said that he doesn't work for a nation state and would be highly unlikely a nation
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:48.500]   state would implement something the exact same way that he sort of off the cuff explained
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.140]   to a reporter how it might work.
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.980]   No, I don't find that convincing either.
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:54.820]   So I there that remains.
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.900]   I think the question remains is Bloomberg lying, Alex?
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.980]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.380]   Or is it sloppy reporting?
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.900]   I think it's sloppy reporting.
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.220]   I think that I think that I think that they're going to this is going to damage their brand
[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:08.060]   and I think people are going to lose their jobs.
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.620]   You know, like it's it is it is not going to because it is true.
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:13.700]   They should have waited until they had evidence.
[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.740]   You know, they should have waited until they had a board.
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:19.420]   If there's thousands of these boards around, I mean, I if if one of these boards exists,
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:23.340]   I bought Super Micros in the timeframe that they're talking many of them.
[00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:24.340]   2015.
[00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:25.340]   So do you have?
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.740]   I have one of the super micro based elementals from 2014 2015.
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:29.740]   Absolutely.
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.820]   Well, I think you owe us.
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:32.820]   I'll bring I'll bring one.
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.820]   I'll send it to I fix it.
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.660]   I'll send I'll send an elemental.
[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.660]   I fix is pretty good at identifying chips.
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:42.220]   But there's chip works actually it's chip works that often does the work.
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:43.940]   I have hard work for I happy with.
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:47.780]   So I you know, it's told seeing a lot of miles.
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.700]   I could I could send one to I fix it.
[00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:53.100]   If I if if if you give me somewhere to go, I'll send it out and they can look at it and
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:57.420]   see if they can imagine if this is the red team three episode of the net of the newsroom.
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.420]   Just play it out.
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:03.580]   It's hard to imagine the scenario here is is possible that the US government played Bloomberg
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:08.740]   because of course the US government, which I might point out is doing exactly this thing
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:09.940]   to others.
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.300]   Everybody's doing it to everybody.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:16.820]   Like not installing it on to the on to the board is well, you know, where this.
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:17.820]   Okay.
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:23.060]   So I talked to somebody who knows a little bit about this where this sometimes most often
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:29.260]   happens is not in the super micro factory, but after it shipped and the and the box goes
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:33.940]   through a depot in, you know, Bethesda.
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:39.300]   Somebody opens the box, modifies the motherboard and sends it on that we know that happens.
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:40.860]   We that that actually has happened.
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.100]   We know that happens.
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.140]   It happens from us.
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.300]   Happens from China happens in happens in many countries.
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.020]   We know we know that happens Israel.
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.020]   We know that happens.
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:51.660]   So that's not a surprise.
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:56.300]   I mean, I guess the the the hot potato here is did site super micro do this themselves.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:01.700]   Yeah, the thing is, is that it's it's generally just not not something you want to go back
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:05.460]   to the factory where it's going to back to the assembler where it's going to go through
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.180]   a system of checks and everything else before it goes out.
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.420]   You want to do it after that when it's on the way so you know where you're where it's
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:15.660]   going and who you and who you want to spy on because sending out too many places makes
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:20.300]   it easier to put it in the part that seems very improbable is putting into the manufacturing
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.300]   process.
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:26.100]   You know, it just seems like if it was, if they put it in the manufacturing process,
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.380]   that is a lot of computers out there.
[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:28.380]   I mean, elemental and cell.
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:32.780]   The only thing that we're just that you then disagree with, not that it doesn't happen
[00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:37.420]   doesn't happen all the time, but that super micro got caught doing it there.
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.140]   By the way, they're based in San Jose.
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:42.860]   They're not their US company, although run by a Chinese national.
[00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.620]   For me, the thing is the denials.
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.420]   I mean, like Apple and Amazon could conceivably just said, look, we're looking into this.
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.420]   We don't know what's happened.
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.420]   There's no customer data that's been taken.
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.420]   We're going to report back to you.
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:53.420]   And it would have been fine.
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.260]   Like it would have been annoying, but it would have been fine.
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.700]   We would have gotten over it and onto the next controversy by Tuesday.
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:22:59.700]   But it's the denials now.
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:00.700]   It's like, it's never the cover up.
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:01.700]   It's just right.
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:02.700]   It's never the crime.
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.580]   It's always the cover up to have Bloomberg double down on their sources and to have Apple
[00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:06.580]   and Amazon goes.
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:12.180]   So I've never, ever seen these companies go so wholeheartedly on these denials.
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.980]   Any party in this could have deescalated earlier on and saved a ton of face.
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:19.060]   Now there is so much at stake that you have to believe that there were a couple of people
[00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:24.180]   at Amazon and Apple that know this that didn't even tell anybody who they would have to tell
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:28.540]   during the normal course of business at their company, including the IT and Infosec chains
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:29.860]   and the legal chains.
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:34.180]   And it's just them sitting there talking to national security and this one reporter happened
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:38.380]   to find out or someone managed to bamboozle a reporter or steer them in the wrong way
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.780]   to the extent that Bloomberg was willing to.
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:40.780]   They would have to be seven.
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:41.780]   And neither makes sense.
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:43.180]   That has to be seventeen someone.
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:47.620]   But he might have seventeen things saying like, like he like oftentimes you get in for
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:51.500]   like, you can tell the quality of a journalist not by the sources they get but by the narrative
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.500]   they extract from them and sell them to reporters state facts.
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:59.140]   More often than not reporters and their editors construct elaborate narratives around facts.
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:00.660]   And that's when they tend to make mistakes.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:05.100]   It's not just reporting the things that they hear is trying to turn that into a story.
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:08.540]   And they've done something more often than not, we've seen that, especially with Apple,
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.620]   we've seen that with things like iPhone 10 sales where you get a little bit of data and
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.420]   you make this whole iPhone 10 is not selling narrative.
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.260]   It turns out to be completely wrong.
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.660]   That is always a danger in journalism.
[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.460]   And that's where there's potential exposure here.
[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:20.020]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:21.300]   I want to talk some more about this.
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.300]   I have a theory, but we'll talk in a bit.
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.100]   I think Andy might be up because he couldn't.
[00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.100]   And then we didn't hear anything from Andy.
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:30.740]   I kept trying to say things with people who are talking to me.
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.460]   I decided to let you boys talk.
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:37.180]   Hang on, we'll give you a chance, Andy, right after I talk about my toilet.
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:41.620]   And that sounds like I know, see, you can't talk about the toilets without people giggling.
[00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.860]   No, this is the best sponsor ever.
[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:44.860]   It is.
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:45.860]   So best.
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.900]   When do we get our samples?
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:51.100]   It was you, Alex Lindsay, who turned me on to the total washlet.
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.180]   You were the one who said you've got to get this toilet.
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:54.580]   And I was the one who pooped it.
[00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.580]   So, well, not literally, but I was.
[00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:57.580]   I was.
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:58.580]   And I was really bummed.
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.780]   There's going to be a lot of puns, folks.
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:03.580]   I was the one who said, Oh, come on, a toilet washes your butt.
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:04.580]   You don't.
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:05.580]   That's that's.
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:08.580]   I could see that big in Japan, we know that this is like these Japanese toys.
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:11.500]   Well, totas of Japanese companies, these tap Japanese.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:16.820]   But I don't know why somehow I guess you you won me over and I bought one.
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.540]   And Lisa was very skeptical.
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.980]   I don't know if you remember.
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:23.020]   Then Lisa said, I love this.
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:27.020]   I said, yeah, I said, Alex, you were right.
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.740]   And then do you want do you want got me into it?
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:30.740]   What?
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:37.420]   There was a NPR story about dealing with a waste flow, you know, in emerging world countries
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.580]   and they're talking to this expert.
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:43.060]   And of course, they get to the end and they go, we got to ask you, like, what do you use,
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.460]   you know, as a for a toilet?
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:48.780]   And she goes, Oh, she goes, I use one of those Japanese toilets.
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:53.500]   And as you said, because I don't just wash my dishes with the paper towel.
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:57.180]   Oh, and I was like, Oh, and then that's true.
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.860]   That's how I got started.
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.420]   Plus, and this is I think with why the Japanese use it.
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.420]   It's touchless, right?
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:07.340]   You're not touching anything except the remote control.
[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:12.620]   You go into the commode, the toilet seat raises to welcome you.
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.980]   The seat is warm.
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:15.980]   You might want to live there.
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.740]   It's very comfortable.
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.420]   Now, there are a variety of different.
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:26.020]   You can you can have one simple one that just replaces your your lid and seat.
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.020]   You can get a whole toilet.
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.020]   We got the whole toilet.
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.460]   There's a variety of different with different capabilities.
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:35.460]   So some of the things may vary depending on with the touch of a button.
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.340]   And by the way, you can have different programs.
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:42.340]   So I have one program, Lisa has another, a wand extends from under the seat and it's
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:44.500]   the water is warm.
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:45.900]   It shiverses you clean.
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.540]   It feels great.
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:54.780]   There ours has a fan and automatic deodorizer that that filters the air to neutralize odors.
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.380]   It is pretty darn awesome.
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:59.660]   We like it so much.
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:01.780]   Anytime somebody came over to the house, we'd mention it.
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:05.660]   They'd say they go into our bedroom, our master bath and use it.
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.300]   So finally, we got one for the guest bathroom.
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:08.300]   Lisa said, you know what?
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.740]   We're getting more of these because which is funny because she was the skeptic.
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:15.140]   So we got one for the master bath and Michael said, I went about me.
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:18.420]   I want them so we have three of these in our house.
[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:23.620]   And I tell you what, the hardest thing about traveling for me is leaving my toto behind.
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:24.620]   I love the-
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:25.620]   Unless you're going to Japan.
[00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:29.900]   In Japan, it was funny because you know, when you're with other people and they go
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:33.140]   and they use the Japanese toilet at a restaurant or something, they come out and they have
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.180]   the funniest look on their face.
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.020]   But you secretly, I think they really like it.
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.020]   I really do.
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.020]   It's awesome.
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:42.740]   And once you're hooked on it, life changes for you.
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:46.820]   There's other features you can get like there's nightlights, remote controls on demand water
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:47.820]   heating.
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.700]   So you just can keep running the water.
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:53.340]   Run in the water until the cows come home.
[00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:55.580]   It will impress your friends.
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:59.380]   I think it's going to be the most popular small home appliance in coming years.
[00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:02.180]   We are the last country in the world that still uses toilet paper, you know?
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:03.580]   I mean, this is a very-
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:05.220]   Oh, well, a lot of countries-
[00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:06.220]   A lot of countries are the country.
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.220]   Well, filthy.
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:08.220]   Yeah, no, it's true.
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.060]   And you go to the other countries, but the other bidets, I don't make any sense.
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.060]   No.
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.060]   I don't make any sense.
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.060]   When we were in Barcelona-
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.060]   Hose.
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:21.260]   They have a hose next to the toilet with a knob and you turn on, it's cold and you've
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:23.540]   got to aim it right or you're going to spray all over you.
[00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:26.180]   And just wait until you go to an airport in all those countries.
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.180]   It's not good.
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.700]   It's like an animal, exactly, Renee.
[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.180]   Get yourself a Toto Washlet.
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:32.460]   They are amazing.

[00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.820]   It's a civilized way to live in a complex world.
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:01.820]   It's a way of life.
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:02.820]   We love our Toto's.
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:04.500]   You will too.
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:11.540]   Here's the way you experience clean waifair.com/macbreak and in the promo code Macbreak at checkout.
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:16.340]   Alex and I both are so thrilled to have Toto as a sponsor of this show.
[00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:20.860]   It's like when I walked in, he said, and Toto's like, "Toto, there are so exciting."
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.420]   It was like, "Toto, Toto, Toto, Toto."
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.100]   All right, I want to hear from everybody.
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.460]   Andy, what's your opinion on this whole thing?
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.940]   I'm skeptical.
[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:34.140]   I don't- I- there's too many problems with this story.
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.700]   There's a lot to digest.
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:39.700]   So I had- I think everybody- everybody had to like spend the whole weekend.
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:43.660]   So I'm going to do this famous Columbus State Barbecues, just reading, reading, reading,
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.100]   reading and talking to people.
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:52.940]   At this point, I just- I just don't believe it because it's- the writing itself is vague.
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:30:01.820]   States, facts that aren't really follow-upable of- I absolutely side with Renee, that Apple
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:08.940]   really expended a lot of resources in putting out the word that they- they see no intersection
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:12.180]   between this article and their knowledge of reality.
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:16.100]   That was not- that- again, that took energy and that took resources.
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:20.420]   That's not something that they would do if they were either unaware of what was going
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:26.540]   on or if they were trying to cover up something or if they were being told that you're not
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.540]   allowed to reveal X, Y, and Z.
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:33.820]   Apple actually said, "No, we are under no kind of government gag order about this thing."
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.580]   That's suspicious as well.
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:41.780]   The other thing that's pretty suspicious is that usually after a big, big news story like
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.860]   this, that loosens a lot of people's tongues.
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:48.580]   People who have seen things but didn't put things together or people who didn't want
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:52.340]   to stick their neck out and be the person to blow the whistle on something.
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:56.380]   And now they're- but they're two years away from this job that they could have gotten
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:57.380]   fired from.
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:58.580]   That's when they start talking.
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:03.660]   I would have expected other journalists to be able to find at least the end of a new
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:08.220]   thread to pull on for this and nobody has been able to do that.
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:12.580]   Then you get to the actual technical problems of the sort of hack that they're talking about
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:18.900]   where they're talking about doing something at monumental scale.
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:23.660]   They're mentioning the article claim that the chip was developed by a Chinese military
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:24.660]   unit.
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:32.580]   As you said earlier, this is when this sort of infiltration happens, it doesn't happen
[00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:33.580]   at the factory level.
[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:37.660]   It happens at the- we're going to take these 500 units that we know are due to be shipped
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:38.660]   to there.
[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:43.020]   We're going to use techniques to unseal them, make the changes we need and seal them back
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.340]   up again and then ship them on.
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:50.420]   How do you design one of these chips and insert them, hide them effectively and do it
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:54.620]   at the kind of manufacturing scale we're talking about there?
[00:31:54.620 --> 00:32:02.740]   I'm not saying that it's impossible that they've got- it's impossible to the story as true
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:04.220]   as they're presenting it.
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:08.260]   But the fact that there's so many shortcuts made, including here is the component that
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:14.180]   we're illustrating, could have been it, and it's clearly not it, the saying here's where
[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:19.380]   it would have been inserted and that is kind of a cut and paste from a bunch of security
[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:23.940]   talks that I think that the correspondent gave last year, one of their other sources.
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:30.340]   He said that this chip specifically was a chip- he- a picture, an image of this.
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:35.020]   Yeah, as I was- I mean, I came across like of his old slide deck when I was on Friday
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:38.820]   or Saturday when I started trying to learn about this and that he actually originally
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:40.380]   made me think, "Oh, well, you know what?
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:41.380]   Here's a guy."
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:45.780]   They actually pointed out where it would be and now I've gotten like a sort of an education
[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:48.020]   saying that that would be a good place to put that.
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:51.540]   So maybe they did have good evidence, but then you keep reading and keep learning that,
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.980]   "Oh, actually, maybe they actually got it from this guy."
[00:32:53.980 --> 00:33:00.180]   So I'm just saying that there's too much about this that is unknown, unproven, not
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:07.020]   underscored by a third party and all of the legally actionable stuff that Apple and other
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:12.560]   companies have said about this means that I have to be very skeptical that this is actually
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:17.420]   true, which is not to say that this sort of operation isn't happening today, but this
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.940]   particular story I don't think we need to worry about.
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:26.340]   And I think that the issue is that Apple has put an incredible amount at risk.
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:29.340]   All they had to do if this wasn't the truth was saying, "We don't know anything about
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:32.620]   this," or they could have sent it out something small.
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:33.620]   No one's going to trust them again.
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:39.740]   If they are this certain and this outspoken and it turns out that it actually did happen,
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:43.100]   it's a huge risk for Apple that Apple has to take into account.
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:53.060]   And so I think that there is a, it just seems outlandish that all of these companies would
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:57.940]   in unison say it isn't there and we don't have a board.
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:00.340]   We don't have a board of something that was made of by the other companies.
[00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:02.700]   There's 30, they haven't named any other company.
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:06.300]   I don't worry quite so much that they haven't found it.
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.500]   This was a real op.
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:12.820]   They would probably have hidden it inside a fake capacitor or a fake resistor.
[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:17.860]   You'd only find it by really imaging every single component on that board and getting
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:22.420]   the active help of the designer of that board to spot what should be there, what isn't there,
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:25.780]   what amounts to a revision, what amounts to not a revision.
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:27.340]   You'd have to really crack it open and see it.
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:32.100]   You can't just simply say, "Oh, this component here doesn't look like it belongs because
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:37.980]   the amount of a higgly, higgly that engineers have to apply to a board both because of a
[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:42.260]   design that failed early on and they just basically patched it to, we're putting some
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:48.140]   sort of a copy protection package into this thing to make sure that someone tries to copy
[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:51.780]   the board but forgets to get this component here or doesn't understand it.
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:52.780]   It's not going to work.
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:53.780]   We will define it.
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:56.140]   Apple did cut off Super Microth two years ago.
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:58.580]   They used it by Super Micro Mother Wars.
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.500]   They claim it was for other reasons.
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:05.340]   That's part of what really turned me around on it.
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:13.820]   I believe that, sorry, I'm choosing my words carefully and legally, it seems to fit in
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:21.020]   my mind the results of what happens when you come to a conclusion as a journalist and
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:25.740]   are looking for facts that buttress, the conclusion that you've made as opposed to looking at
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:30.700]   that big wobbly pile of facts you put together and see what it tells you.
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:36.060]   Once you have convinced yourself that, wow, we've got a blockbuster news story here about
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:42.260]   China as an intelligence state infiltrating things in the supply chain.
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:43.260]   You know what?
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:47.100]   Apple used to use this product but they mysteriously stuff.
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:50.940]   They didn't have a press release announcing why they had stopped using this server product.
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:52.420]   That's kind of interesting, isn't it?
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:57.580]   Well, no, unless you have someone at Apple who will tell you on the record that this
[00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:58.580]   is exactly what they found.
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:02.060]   On the record thing, you've been doing this long enough to know that a lot of sources
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:03.060]   are not on the record.
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.060]   And that doesn't mean you're not valuable.
[00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:08.780]   And you're never going to get anybody on the record from any of these companies saying
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:14.380]   anything because honestly, their liability is much higher for that.
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:15.780]   That was a slip of the tongue.
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:20.080]   But I'm saying that you have to have someone who will tell you specifically that when it
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.420]   comes out every time you don't know as well.
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:24.580]   People told them to sell you something on background.
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:25.580]   You don't know what they do.
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:28.740]   They decide as, I'm going to keep talking here.
[00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:32.940]   If someone tells you something on background, what you're taught from an early age of the
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:37.140]   journalist is that assume that at some point you're going to have to reveal this source
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:42.900]   to a lawyer that is deposing you or reveal the tone of the source.
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:46.380]   So you're not going to, even if you're not going to be able to use this person's name,
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.700]   you have to report as though you're using this name and everybody's going to check up on
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:50.700]   this.
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:54.220]   So it's suspicious that there is no backup for this.
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:59.220]   And because you're a journalist, you do not have to reveal that source.
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:00.220]   There's not.
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:04.260]   But you still have to, you have to, you have to be able to prove the veracity of what you're
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:05.260]   saying.
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:07.540]   All you have to do is produce your reporter's notebook and say, here it is.
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:10.540]   These are my notes and you'll never hear, you're never going to know where I got them
[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:12.460]   because that's my source.
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:13.660]   That's normal.
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:14.660]   All of this is normal.
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:19.740]   I find it very hard to believe the Bloomberg Business Week would fail this badly.
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.420]   Now, something's not right here.
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:27.540]   I don't find it hard at all to believe that Amazon and Apple would lie at all because
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:31.940]   the, again, the liability on this is so vast.
[00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:37.780]   Here's the, here's the only thing that anybody's going to can debate on is this, that the micro
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:42.020]   chips were inserted at the factory that supplied super micro right here.
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:46.420]   Because we all know that everything else in this story happens all the time.
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:51.460]   The only thing is did super, you know, did the, did the Chinese company that made those
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.700]   motherboards in certain, I think that's the biggest part of the story.
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:54.700]   That's the fact.
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:57.180]   Well, so I don't think I said the way around though, I think the liability to Apple and
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:00.580]   Amazon was minimal here because there are so many stories of so many exploits all the
[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:04.460]   time and our attention span for them has been reduced to almost nil and they could have
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:08.340]   very easily yadda yadda their way through this and, you know, really wouldn't have been
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:09.340]   a story of the net.
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:10.780]   Yeah, it wouldn't have been a story of the next week.
[00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:11.780]   Really?
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.900]   By going on, yeah, by going on record, I think they've made it the story.
[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:17.180]   The story to me is not the hack at all.
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:20.940]   The story to me is Apple and Amazon putting their credibility at the line now.
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:24.540]   And I think for Bloomberg though, I mean, if you listen to the podcast from the gentleman
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:28.300]   who brought out the source, these authors have had problems with previous stories.
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:29.380]   There was a pipeline explosion.
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:31.660]   They blamed on hacking that was contradicted.
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:32.660]   They've had another story.
[00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:36.380]   I forget what the New York Times and I think the Washington Post both took down and said
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:37.580]   was completely inaccurate.
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:40.620]   So this is, you think it's Jordan Robertson and Michael Riley?
[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:44.740]   I think there are, I think there's a higher likelihood that they got it wrong or they
[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:50.180]   got played than that Apple and Amazon would risk the SEC and ungodly amounts of shareholder
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:51.180]   loss.
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:52.180]   It's by now by lying about it.
[00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:56.740]   And speaking of shareholders, a lot of the market took a pretty good tech dive after
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:57.820]   this story.
[00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:04.900]   I'm also kind of wondering if we go to the, if we start to think about if these reporters
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:10.020]   were played, if someone decides that we know that a certain, a certain story that's going
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:14.060]   to be bad for the entire tech market is going to drop on Thursday, if we can engineer that
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:19.020]   to happen on a certain day, we can make some moves to anticipate that and make that happen.
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:21.460]   So there's, there's a lot to, there's a lot to wonder about.
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:26.300]   I think people have to watch Super Micro stock and if there's any major buyers sooner,
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:30.260]   you know, like, you know, because it, you know, maybe, you know, it's, but I think that it's,
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.700]   here's what I think is very unlikely.
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:32.700]   I think you're right.
[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:38.460]   I think that Jordan Robertson and Michael Riley probably got the story wrong or put the,
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:42.380]   put the sources together in ways that actually are incorrect.
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:47.780]   But what no one can deny and Brian Krebs writes about it today and Krebs on security is
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:50.260]   that this is a problem.
[00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:56.820]   Supply chain security is not certain and these things are happening all the time.
[00:39:56.820 --> 00:40:00.620]   You can, you can, we can go back and forth about did Apple know that Amazon know it is
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:06.540]   Super Micro know, but that's kind of not really the, the issue.
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.060]   This is what Brian writes like it or not.
[00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:10.420]   The vast majority of electronics are made in China.
[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:13.220]   This is unlikely to change anytime soon.
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.980]   The central issue is we don't have any other choice right now.
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:20.740]   The reason is that by nearly all accounts, it would be punishingly expensive to replicate
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:23.340]   that process here in the United States.
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:26.140]   And by the way, other countries wouldn't trust us electronics anymore.
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:27.780]   We trust the electronics of other countries.
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:32.140]   And in fact, I think there's strong evidence that we do the same thing in the other direction.
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:36.580]   Now how it happens, whether it happens at the, on the factory floor or after the fact,
[00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:39.540]   in a, in a, in a, in a UPS jackpot.
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:40.540]   Yeah.
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:41.540]   Yeah.
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:45.500]   I don't know if that's, I mean, I mean, the issue for super, super, super, super, super,
[00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:46.500]   micro is big, obviously.
[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:47.500]   If I'm super micro.
[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:52.500]   The thing with this is at some point, if there is an investigation, it will become publicly
[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:55.220]   because we have freedom of information request or it'll be declassified.
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.340]   At some point, we'll know and that damage will be done.
[00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:00.220]   But to your point, this is a huge problem.
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.180]   Hardware, there's a whole bunch of software exploits.
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:05.700]   Hardware exploits are getting not easier, but they're getting easier for nation state
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:10.940]   level actors, definitely to presume, to perpetrate and moving them to the factory is the next
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:13.380]   logical step for them.
[00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:18.940]   The other interesting point on this is that you can have machines with secure boot and
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:22.180]   they can boot up and say, "Yep, my operating system's unchanged."
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:28.500]   But if you can put something like this on a motherboard that can modify it after boot,
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.340]   there is a reason to do that, right?
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:32.300]   Because it's not less detectable.
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:37.700]   Well, and I think that one of the things that what I would do, if I was trying to do
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:42.060]   something, whether it does it all now or not, is I would build something like a T2-2 or
[00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:43.060]   a T1 chip.
[00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:50.220]   I think that is something that I can completely control that is constantly checking its own
[00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:52.180]   hardware.
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:57.740]   It also is why you would do something like make it difficult to fix things or to change
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:01.620]   things other than what you had configured.
[00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:05.900]   There are things that we can do that can do that stuff.
[00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:06.900]   It's not going to be guaranteed.
[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:10.420]   I think it's good for us to start thinking about the fact that we're not private.
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:13.980]   When we have all these electronics around us, we do have to think about that.
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:14.980]   I think that...
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.460]   Cribs, Cribs, right.
[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:21.060]   The US government is not eager to admit it, but there has long been an unofficial inventory
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:25.700]   of tech components and vendors that are forbidden to buy from if you're in charge of procurement
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.540]   on behalf of the US government.
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:29.540]   That's our history.
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:33.300]   More than a decade ago, when I was a reporter at The Washington Post, I heard from an extremely
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:38.940]   well-placed source that one Chinese tech company had made it onto that list because they sold
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:43.100]   a custom hardware component for internet-enabled printers that secretly made a copy of every
[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:48.700]   document or image sent to the printer and then sent that document to the hackers aligned
[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:49.940]   with the Chinese government.
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:51.940]   That was 10 years ago.
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:53.500]   Well, this stuff had...
[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:54.860]   It's still happening all the time.
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:55.860]   We did lose all of it.
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:58.900]   I remember all those frames that you used to get that you could put your...
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:42:59.900]   You were having a hard time.
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:00.900]   They were all talking.
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:01.900]   They were all calling home.
[00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:03.700]   They were all calling home.
[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:13.180]   They became a big issue and unless you flash your FPGAs, they're probably calling home too.
[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:17.500]   There's a lot going on that area and you can't trust it.
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:21.460]   I guess that's my point is we can debate the merits of this article, the details of the
[00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:27.940]   article, but I think the gist of it, which is that these hacks are happening, is not
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:28.940]   inaccurate.
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:34.420]   Obviously, Apple, Amazon, and Super Micro care a lot about the...
[00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:38.020]   Luckily, we're all spending a fortune in real serious about cybersecurity.
[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:39.020]   Sorry, Andy.
[00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:44.140]   The scary thing is not that World War III is going to be fought with servers and networks
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:45.740]   and computers and devices.
[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:48.340]   The scary thing is that it's already being fought right now.
[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:50.340]   We just don't see the effects.
[00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:51.340]   We've already had...
[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:54.940]   Basically, we have invasion fleets have already infiltrated.
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:58.980]   We have all the weapons that are locked and loaded and ready to go.
[00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:03.380]   On all sides, not just talking about US being victims of other countries, I'm talking about
[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:09.500]   US enforcing attacks in other countries, it really is at this point waiting for someone
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:14.260]   to send the command that, "Okay, lighting grid in Paris, just shut it down right now."
[00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:22.020]   I'm sure that maybe not quite as dramatic as that, but these weapons of various levels
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:26.620]   of destruction are ready to go and there are teams that are trying really hard to make
[00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:29.220]   them even more destructive and more widespread.
[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.420]   I think that if we understood what...
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:36.100]   And I'm not talking about just cyber, I'm talking about what we do all over the world,
[00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:37.660]   what happens all over the world.
[00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:42.900]   As Americans, and I think a lot of Western countries, we're kind of left in a nice little
[00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:46.300]   hum that we feel safe and everything feels fine, but there's an enormous amount of work
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:49.460]   being done all the time.
[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:51.580]   There was no stop to any kind of war.
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:57.220]   I mean, people are fighting this all over the world all the time, and that's just always
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:58.220]   happening.
[00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:02.900]   And so, the fact that we don't see it just means that we don't see it, but it's whether
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:08.140]   it's cyber, whether it's military, all of those things are being expressed all the time.
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:18.100]   Yeah, here's one story from Apple and Cider's quoting a security expert working for a major
[00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:23.140]   telecom firm whose name cannot be revealed.
[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:28.900]   This is a Cepio Systems Chief, Josie Applebaum, who says, "The telecom company's server was
[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:34.220]   modified in the factory, which was produced with Western intelligence contacts of Vising.
[00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:37.220]   It was made at Super Micro-Subcontractor in Guangzhou."
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:41.300]   This is completely separate from the Bloomberg report.
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:45.860]   The telecom's facility allegedly has a large number of Super Micro- servers.
[00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:49.500]   Technicians could not say what kind of data is moving through the infected server.
[00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:53.460]   It is also unknown if FBI was informed by the client.
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:58.740]   AT&T says, "Those devices are not part of our network, and we are not affected."
[00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:04.100]   Did not deny the story, in other words.
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:09.060]   This is completely unrelated, and yet it's a similar story.
[00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:11.500]   So I think you're going to hear more of these stories.
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:18.380]   I think that Apple and Amazon, I understand why they're saying, "Those specifics didn't
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:24.500]   happen, but I think they're not doing us a favor by implying somehow, "Oh, no, no.
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:26.900]   We're magically secure.
[00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:28.420]   There's nothing going on here.
[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:30.180]   Pay no attention to that."
[00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:33.700]   And I think that if you read between the lines, they're not saying that.
[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:38.380]   They're just addressing this report.
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:43.100]   I feel like the gist of this is actually accurate and is a warning call.
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:44.380]   And nobody's been paying attention.
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:49.580]   This has been going on for a decade, at least.
[00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:55.140]   And nobody wants to pay attention to it because there's no reasonable fix for it.
[00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:58.780]   And the US government would very much like people to believe that it's all coming from
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:04.620]   China because at this point, we're at a trade war with China and they'd like to shut down.
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:08.060]   Don't you think our government would love all these manufacturers to move to the United
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:09.060]   States?
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:13.460]   Yeah, but how can they enforce that?
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:18.820]   They can only enforce that by convincing consumers to spend $1,400 or phone their use
[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:20.620]   to spending $500 on port.
[00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:23.740]   What's the first shot in that war?
[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:25.900]   I don't know.
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:26.900]   Scare people.
[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:32.780]   See, the environment will take out all this technology and we'll be safe.
[00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:36.900]   I really would like to know more about this.
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:37.900]   And I think we will.
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:40.060]   I don't think this is over.
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:43.780]   And honestly, I think if Apple had ignored it and Amazon ignored it, it would not have
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:45.780]   gone away.
[00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:47.900]   I think we're going to see a lot more of this.
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:53.420]   The problem is the average public, the public probably isn't that interested.
[00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:57.620]   The public, just like everybody else would just like to say, I'm not going to worry
[00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:58.620]   about that.
[00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:01.540]   It's too hard to figure it out, too hard to solve it.
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:05.020]   Well, it's also something that you just can't control.
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:09.380]   Just like you got to drive your car, you got to cross the street, you can't control whether
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:14.860]   or not there is going to be an idiot on their phone or drunk or both, barreling into you
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:16.620]   at any given moment.
[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:19.420]   You can keep your eyes out, but you're just going to have to decide that this is part
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:22.740]   of the, this is part of why life on earth tends to suck.
[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:27.580]   And part of the problem is what we do to protect ourselves as part of what gets into
[00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:28.580]   this.
[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:31.500]   If you look at Stuxnet, if you look at a lot of the stuff that's shut down half of Europe,
[00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:33.100]   those are all stuff we made.
[00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:35.060]   We made that, it got out.
[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:38.860]   And then, and now it's, you know, it's a, you know, we, so this stuff is, there's a
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:42.820]   lot of, a lot of the technology is stuff that we're building because we're trying to
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:43.820]   figure this all out.
[00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:45.860]   This reminds me of that Sean Connery movie.
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:49.860]   I mentioned this before the Anderson tapes where the entire apartment building is robbed
[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:53.380]   and every three letter agency has been snooping on their various members.
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:56.940]   They could put the whole story together, but the last thing they want anybody to know
[00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:58.460]   is what they've been up to.
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:03.160]   So the end of the movie is all those tapes being erased one after the other while the
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:09.140]   guy, Sean Connery, who masterminded the theft is enjoying a cigar and have been on the beach
[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:15.940]   because even though the perfect picture of this crime exists, nobody wants to admit this
[00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:16.940]   is going on.
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:21.340]   And I feel like that's really the real story here is everybody involved.
[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:23.100]   We just prefer this just goes away.
[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:26.220]   Well, and there's, you know, there's a whole, the whole issue of sources and methods where
[00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:30.740]   you make a decision about, you know, there, you know, our government may know all kinds
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:34.980]   of things about how why certain crimes may have occurred in other parts of the world.
[00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:39.900]   And they may know stuff about what's occurring to ours, but if we, if we actually prosecute
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:43.660]   that, then we show how, what we know, we show how deep the rabbit hole goes, you know,
[00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:48.140]   and, and so I think there's just a lot of decisions made, like we can't fix that problem,
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:51.140]   you know, because we can't, we can't do this because we don't.
[00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:53.980]   Yeah, we're all fat, jolly and selling a lot of iPhones and a lot of stuff.
[00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:54.980]   Oh, it's more than that though.
[00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:58.500]   And we're all everybody's happy here's let's just not rock the boat.
[00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:01.580]   Well, I think it's mostly making sure that people still leave their house.
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:04.740]   No, I can't.
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:05.740]   It's just that in the house.
[00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:06.740]   I got a Facebook camera.
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:07.740]   I got an Amazon camera.
[00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:08.740]   I got a Google camera.
[00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:11.700]   But I mean, beyond that, I mean, I think that if people knew how deep the risks were,
[00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:14.980]   they, oh dear, you know, like it's so I think that it's, it's not, you know, they're, they
[00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:17.980]   just want to make sure everyone still feels like it's okay to go outside.
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:19.580]   Because it is.
[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:20.580]   It's safer than such.
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:21.580]   Keep shopping, everybody.
[00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:22.580]   Keep shopping.
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:23.580]   Just just keep shopping.
[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:24.580]   Taking a little.
[00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:25.580]   It's.
[00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:30.220]   Wow, this is, this is taking a bad turn.
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:31.220]   Yeah.
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:32.900]   We go back to talking about tote toe.
[00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:35.500]   Yeah, everybody should buy a nice Japanese toilet.
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:37.500]   At least you'll have a clean, but.
[00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:38.500]   Yeah.
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:43.260]   And by the way, you can control in this life and there's no incentive to hack your toilet,
[00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:44.260]   right?
[00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:45.260]   What would be the pay?
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.660]   Don't get many ideas.
[00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:52.860]   Most of this, by the way, most of this isn't, I think is not maybe cyber warfare, but I
[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:54.740]   think a lot of this is just industrial espionage.
[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:57.660]   I mean, why would you, why would you want all the printouts from a company?
[00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:01.540]   Well, because you'd like to get their plans and, and, and their patents and all that
[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:02.540]   stuff, right?
[00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:05.020]   It's mostly, I would guess mostly industrial, maybe not.
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:06.020]   Is it?
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:07.020]   I don't know.
[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:08.020]   Hard to separate the two in some countries.
[00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:12.620]   Well, we know, and we do know that World War three is coming and it really is cyber.
[00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:14.380]   Hey, in a way, it's not so bad.
[00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:16.020]   It'll be a cyber warfare.
[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:17.580]   Cyber.
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:19.740]   Even if the power goes out, it's not like getting shot.
[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:22.660]   Well, the question is, is that when we start, when all of our cars are driving for us and
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:25.260]   they all get hacked at the same time, it wouldn't be bad.
[00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:26.260]   It's not really great.
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:28.860]   I will say that war is war.
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:33.900]   There's nothing good about it, but at least in a cyber war, the rich people suck.
[00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:37.020]   It's not going to just be the, it's not just going to be the, the poor people who have
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:39.180]   to like go out and fight and get killed.
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:42.580]   I think that there are going to be teenage rich people who are also going to say, my
[00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:44.380]   Tesla won't start.
[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:49.700]   Actually, that's really, that's another strong motivation for just saying, don't work
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:55.420]   No, no, no, no, it's none of that because as we move towards an AI world where we're
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:52:01.060]   letting the machines do more and more of everything, then we really are more vulnerable.
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:03.980]   That's a nightmare scenario where we're all getting in self-driving cars.
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:04.980]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:09.220]   Oh, it's, it's, there's a lot to, you know, but it's 20, you know, how many tens of thousands
[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:11.860]   of people die because other than humans.
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:12.860]   It's humans.
[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:16.260]   But I mean, like it'll be a different risk.
[00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:19.460]   It doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be more of a risk than it is.
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:23.540]   But there is the, the, the, the, the axum, you know, that we always have to remember is
[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:26.740]   that to air as human, but to really screw things up requires a computer.
[00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:27.740]   Yeah.
[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:28.740]   Yeah.
[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:29.740]   Yeah.
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:30.740]   Funny Lindsey.
[00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:32.300]   Do you want to play a game?
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:34.140]   You are so funny.
[00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:36.060]   Please see me in my office.
[00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:41.020]   Think about, think about, think about what happens if like someone can hack into forget
[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:42.660]   self-driving cars.
[00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:48.220]   Imagine like a reusable rocket and someone manages to say, by the way, you know, I, you're
[00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:53.460]   supposed to be, you're supposed to land on the floating landing pad in the middle of
[00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:54.460]   the ocean.
[00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:57.660]   Let me tell you the exact coordinates of where that pad is.
[00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:59.940]   It's, it's surprisingly enough.
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:05.740]   It's actually 80 miles inland from Boston over this highly populated area, but definitely
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:09.220]   through this definitely land right there in what looks like a parking lot, but totally
[00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:10.220]   isn't a parking lot.
[00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:11.220]   Yeah.
[00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:12.940]   There's a lot of things you could.
[00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:17.180]   If you're writing, if you're writing a modern spy novel, there's a lot of ways you're, you're,
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:21.260]   blowfeld could cause a lot of disruption that weren't available in 1967.
[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:26.260]   Have you ever like, they're, it's okay.
[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:30.900]   We're, we're, we're, we're, we're bumming each other.
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:34.700]   Oh, no, we just wanted to come, can we talk about Pokemon go again or fancy.
[00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:35.700]   Yeah.
[00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:36.780]   I got something shiny.
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:40.940]   The iPhone XS and XS Max review from Anand tech.
[00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:41.940]   Yeah.
[00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:47.380]   You always wait for a non-text take on the, on like the deep silicon and all that stuff.
[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:48.900]   They finally have a mobile editor again.
[00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:52.660]   I mean, Andre is there now, but there was a break when Joshua whole left, and then we
[00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:54.580]   didn't get an iPhone review last year from them.
[00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:55.580]   Well, another back.
[00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:56.580]   Yeah.
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:54:02.580]   His, I mean, the, to me, the top line is the process is so fast and this thing is basically
[00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:04.020]   desktop class.
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:06.220]   It's ludicrous.
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:12.380]   Way beyond anything that you're seeing in any other device that Apple really, I mean,
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:17.380]   this is a seven nanometer TSM seat chip.
[00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:26.780]   Incredibly powerful, two new CPU cores running at 2.5 gigahertz.
[00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:28.980]   Apple's claims that it's, you know, much faster.
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:32.300]   He seems to say are, are absolutely true.
[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:34.740]   There's also besides the two, they're underselling it.
[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:35.740]   They're underselling.
[00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:36.740]   They're underselling.
[00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:37.740]   They're underselling.
[00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:42.900]   The two vortex cores have are also supported by smaller, four smaller high efficiency cores
[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:45.580]   called Mistral.
[00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:50.100]   And that's where you get the, you know, the battery sipping power and, you know, the
[00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:57.020]   power when you need it, but, but low power usage when you, most of the time.
[00:54:57.020 --> 00:55:03.460]   The Apple says the GPU is 50% higher, but he says, yeah, it's, it's even, it's even
[00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:04.460]   better than that.
[00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:05.820]   It's even memory compressing before.
[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:08.620]   It's like they just added that and got a huge boost and it makes you wonder how they
[00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:10.260]   were getting that performance before.
[00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:12.700]   Right.
[00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:17.500]   Anything else from this that we should, this is the first commercial seven nanometer
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:18.500]   silicon.
[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.260]   This is something India could not do.
[00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:22.740]   The news here is just that Apple can afford to do this.
[00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:27.660]   I mean, like Qualcomm is a merchant, silicon merchant, but that's expensive and other companies
[00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:29.700]   either use, you know, Samsung makes some of their chips.
[00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:31.820]   They use some Qualcomm chips, but it's incredibly expensive.
[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:35.700]   When Apple is paying for first access to a seven millimeter, seven nanometer, sorry,
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:38.840]   fab, and they don't take profit and loss on the chipset.
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:40.860]   They do not need to keep it on itself.
[00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:42.380]   These are, need to sell it or margin.
[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:43.860]   Another phone maker will do it.
[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:47.020]   They can subsidize the price of that chip by the overall price of the phone.
[00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:49.980]   They've managed to get some of the best talent in the world and they are happy to let them
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:53.300]   run and not walk, not crawl, not, can you keep this on the market?
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:54.300]   Another year or two.
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:56.260]   So we can really get some profit out of this.
[00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:59.700]   It's just make the best thing you can make and we'll stick it in this phone and see what
[00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:00.700]   we can do with this.
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:02.540]   Damn impressive.
[00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:06.860]   And things that are just, you know, underneath the hood that only somebody like Andre's,
[00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:12.420]   he can even notice like better improvement in cash performance.
[00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:14.860]   He did the spec mark on it.
[00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:19.780]   He says it's been a while since we attempted spec on an iOS device.
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:29.700]   And so he's got the full 2006 harness back to work and was able to do a bunch of evaluations
[00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:33.460]   and this is energy and performance.
[00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:34.460]   Yeah.
[00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:36.660]   And I don't know what this all means.
[00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:40.780]   It's two to three times more performance efficient, which I think is Qualcomm language.
[00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:43.100]   It really smells like Qualcomm language to me.
[00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:46.580]   Performance efficient performance for what or something like that.
[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:47.580]   Yes.
[00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:50.620]   Well, the speed with which it can get back to zero state.
[00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:51.620]   Right.
[00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:52.620]   Yeah.
[00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:58.500]   I'm just trying to extract.
[00:56:58.500 --> 00:56:59.500]   This is very geeky.
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:00.500]   Yeah.
[00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:03.500]   I highly encourage anybody who's interested in this stuff.
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:06.420]   I'm just trying to extract the top line.
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:09.740]   The camera, I mean, he said, you know what?
[00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:11.660]   We're getting a lot of mixed reviews with the cameras.
[00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:13.740]   But we're getting mixed reviews about what is the best camera in the world.
[00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:15.300]   Not whether it's a good or bad camera.
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:16.300]   Right.
[00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:17.540]   And I think I forget what he said.
[00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:21.420]   I think he probably put it a little bit below the pixel, but he liked that too.
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:24.700]   And the battery, I mean, all the tests he did were phenomenal.
[00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:31.580]   The A12 outperforms a moderately clocked skylake CPU, a desktop CPU and single threaded performance.
[00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:33.340]   Okay.
[00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:34.780]   That's interesting.
[00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:35.780]   Yeah.
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:43.820]   You just, I mean, it's just, here's the speedometer 2.0 OS view.
[00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:45.980]   This down here is a pixel XL.
[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:48.460]   This up here is an iPhone XS.
[00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:49.900]   Yeah.
[00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:50.900]   That's a lot faster.
[00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:52.540]   Very iPhone heavy at the top.
[00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:54.860]   S9 plus years right in the middle.
[00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:56.580]   That's the latest Samsung.
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:58.580]   Well, almost the latest Samsung.
[00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:02.100]   There's been a lot of misunderstanding here too, and that a lot of people said, like,
[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:03.340]   you know, but I don't see the difference.
[00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:05.780]   You know, I use my phone and I don't see the difference, but one of the biggest differences
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:08.620]   is that less this phone have an incredibly long, useful life.
[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:12.060]   The phone has got massive amounts of overhead and you can test those limits doing really
[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:14.980]   complex AR or computational photography.
[00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:18.980]   Madras says you can push that chip right now, but it means that that phone will still be
[00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:22.220]   useful when it's getting updates for two years, three years, four years.
[00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:25.540]   That's why an iPhone 5S can run iOS 12.
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:29.500]   So it really is something that you want headroom on so you do have the longevity of your purchase.
[00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:35.180]   So this is a JavaScript benchmark, for instance, and the closest non-Apple phone is less than
[00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:36.740]   half the performance.
[00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:39.060]   That's the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S.
[00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:42.860]   Less than half the performance of the iPhone X.
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:46.620]   It is getting hard now though because there are so many dedicated units like there's decoders
[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:49.780]   and encoders and JavaScript accelerators that you never know what's hitting the processor
[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:50.780]   and what's getting dedicated.
[00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:53.380]   And he says that this is tough to test.
[00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:55.140]   It really is tough to test.
[00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:58.700]   And I'm not a big fan of benchmarks, but it's fascinating to read.
[00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:04.420]   I mean, exactly as you say, this is talking about painting the inside of the fence.
[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:10.500]   This is like stuff that, you know, the wonderful thing about reading these kind of reviews
[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:17.380]   is with Apple, you know that they're building a phone not to run iOS 12.
[00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:21.100]   They've already got iOS 14, they're looking at those features.
[00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:23.900]   They know exactly what the code has to do.
[00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:27.940]   And so the fact of the past three, four, five years, I can't think of an iPhone that has
[00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:33.260]   not been grotesquely overpowered for the features of the operating system that they released
[00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:34.980]   alongside the phone.
[00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:35.980]   And well, I'll be darned.
[00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:38.180]   It turns out the next year they're doing augmented reality.
[00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:39.180]   I'll be darned.
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:43.020]   Turns out next year they're doing a camera that takes up a jillion pictures like with
[00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:47.900]   one press in a split second, which is something that they used to have to, okay, hold the
[00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:52.420]   camera steady because we're going to take three pictures in sequence right now.
[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:53.420]   That's it.
[00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:58.820]   We're well beyond the point where you can tell the speed of a phone by how fast it feels
[00:59:58.820 --> 00:59:59.940]   in your hand.
[00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:05.020]   We now tell the speed of a phone by the magical things that now happen with one tap, one button
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:10.660]   press, one swipe because you have no idea how much math, how many pixels are being shifted
[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:14.380]   just to make a transition from one app to another feel good.
[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:16.780]   Apple said the GPU is 50% faster.
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:21.940]   He's actually testing it 75% faster than the iPhone 10.
[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:25.700]   Maybe Apple thought if we said that, nobody would believe us.
[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:28.060]   It's read all read all about it.
[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:31.620]   And he's one of the few people who really understands it can do benchmarks.
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:33.820]   He's not just downloading an app and pressing a button.
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:34.820]   Yeah.
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:35.820]   Yeah.
[01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:36.820]   Right.
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:37.820]   And it's hard to do, especially on mobile.
[01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:39.660]   It's so much custom code and so much time.
[01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:40.660]   Yeah.
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:46.180]   And it's so tight into the hardware that you don't know if it's not doing the job on math.
[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:48.780]   Well, that's because they found a different solution to do the kind of math that they
[01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:50.580]   need to do for various things.
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:54.340]   So that's why you don't go for the downloaded stuff.
[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:57.740]   It really is what features do you like and how does it feel in the hand?
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:01.340]   Basically, he's doing what somebody disassembling source code is doing.
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:03.660]   He's trying to understand what Apple's doing.
[01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:07.220]   But only Apple really knows what their goals were with these chips and why they're making
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:09.900]   these chips perform this way.
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:13.700]   And he's kind of, you know, the best thing you can say is he probably didn't get everything
[01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:17.140]   right, but he probably made the platform technology engineer super happy.
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:18.140]   Yeah.
[01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:22.540]   And he also says he looks forward to testing the 10R.
[01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:26.420]   He says, I think it's going to be an incredibly attractive alternative to those models.
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:30.540]   And that's because the 10R is inside the same, right?
[01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:31.540]   The chip is the same.
[01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:33.620]   There's far fewer pixels to push around.
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:34.620]   So it should fly.
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:37.420]   It might be like the SEL over again.
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:38.420]   Yeah.
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:39.420]   Yeah.
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:42.900]   And these really are, I mean, we're now to the point where these truly are just computers.
[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:43.900]   They're just a lot smaller.
[01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.340]   So we think of them as phones, right?
[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:47.780]   But they're computers that happen to take phone calls.
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:52.420]   But they are now reaching that point where they're competitive with many of the laptops
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:55.020]   that we have and everything else.
[01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:58.860]   And it would be really interesting to see what the next iPad looks like and how it performs
[01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:00.060]   and what it can do.
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:03.220]   And I don't think one of the big problems that Apple has with upgrades with the iPad
[01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:07.780]   is that I don't think developers take enough advantage of what the hardware can do.
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:12.540]   And I think that's something Apple almost has to do because they're not really these
[01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:14.980]   iPads will do an enormous amount of things.
[01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:19.740]   And then we do really, really simple, make simple products because that's what's easier
[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:21.900]   to build for $399.
[01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:22.900]   Lots of people complaining.
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:28.420]   I talked about last week about Wi-Fi issues, LTE issues and charging issues with their
[01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:29.420]   10S.
[01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:34.980]   We actually were about to take it back thinking we had a lemon.
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:41.900]   A lot of problems with her, a 10S Max, losing internet basically, whether at home or on
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:44.060]   the road, whether it's Wi-Fi or LTE.
[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:45.980]   She's on T-Mobile.
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:46.980]   Interesting.
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:51.820]   As MI, I have a identical phone on an identical carrier and I don't have the problems.
[01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:58.900]   However, Apple did release yesterday 12.0.1, which they say does fix a Wi-Fi bug and a
[01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:01.380]   charging issue.
[01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:08.180]   So I told Lisa, let's defer calling Apple, trading the phone until you see if it's better.
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:11.060]   She's had to reboot multiple times.
[01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:15.940]   Megan had the charging issue where you sometimes plug in a lightning charger to your iPhone
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:18.220]   and it wouldn't see it.
[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:25.460]   But all of these things should be fixed with 12.0.1.
[01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:30.140]   Apple says that the Wi-Fi bug was some iPhone 10S devices.
[01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:36.100]   Try to join a 2.4 GHz network rather than a 5 GHz network.
[01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:37.540]   So that will be fixed.
[01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:41.100]   There's a reorientation of the 1.2.3 number key on the iPad.
[01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:43.220]   Yeah, that was hard.
[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:45.820]   I finally screwed that one off.
[01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:50.260]   Emoji issue or something like that.
[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:52.260]   You can't mess with people's emoji muscle memory.
[01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:53.260]   You just can't do that.
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:55.700]   Don't mess with my emoji.
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:56.700]   My emoji.
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:58.340]   Don't mess with them.
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:01.580]   So you think this is fixing those problems?
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:03.080]   Yeah, it does.
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.660]   As far as we can tell it, they identified the issue.
[01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:07.260]   They did their tests.
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:10.260]   They put it out in the beta a couple of days early just in case people would scream about
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:11.900]   another problem that it caused.
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:15.740]   And then instead of waiting until 12.1, they released it with 12.0.1, which meant people
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:16.740]   got it immediately.
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:20.440]   So if you're on 12.1, if you're on the beta channel, public beta channel, you should
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.440]   have this fix already.
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.440]   Yes.
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:23.440]   Yeah.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.440]   Okay.
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:28.620]   Apparently, there's a daylight savings bug.
[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:29.620]   Saving.
[01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:30.620]   Sorry, John.
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:31.620]   Saving.
[01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:32.620]   Australia.
[01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:34.620]   There's only one.
[01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:37.260]   The latest watch is crashing and rebooting.
[01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:40.580]   Yeah, time is tough.
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:46.860]   Australians the first to be affected because they just moved to standard time.
[01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:49.540]   I think all of daylight savings time is a bug.
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:52.000]   And that's why they did the feeders in California.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   Did you see that?
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   Prop seven.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.960]   It's on the ballot that we would just stay in daylight saving time.
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.240]   Oh, please, I'll go to the world.
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.240]   I would do it.
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:00.240]   Like if you guys could please start that.
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.240]   It would be California.
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:04.840]   What's weird is, you know, when we get the ballot, we get these pro and con arguments.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:08.000]   There's some state senators saying there's a terrible idea.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.520]   And her main argument is, do you know it'll still be dark at 7.30 in the morning on Christmas
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:13.520]   day?
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:14.520]   Oh my gosh.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:15.520]   That's her argument against it.
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:17.920]   What about the people who have to wind my clocks every twice a year?
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:18.920]   What about their jobs?
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:22.380]   How will we know when to change the batteries and I'll smoke the data?
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:23.380]   Lovey.
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:27.460]   I just want whatever whatever poison we take.
[01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:32.460]   I just want us all to take the same poison because if I have to the number of times that
[01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:38.860]   I've been thrown off like, Oh, I did not know that you were 30 minutes ahead of everybody
[01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:39.860]   else.
[01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:40.860]   Okay.
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:45.620]   And so now if I now if I have to remember that all the West Coast is three hours ahead, except
[01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:50.260]   for California, which is on Greenwich meantime, that's a good point.
[01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:55.580]   I must admit, Andy, we got to convince everybody to stay fine without I'm fine with California
[01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:57.620]   leading the pack and then everyone else following.
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:00.140]   I'm fine to do whatever it takes to get rid of this stupid idea.
[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:01.140]   It is terrible.
[01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:02.140]   I agree.
[01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:09.620]   I'm with I'm with you, but it's only screws me up like twice a year as opposed to again,
[01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:11.940]   the Indiana part of it.
[01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:12.940]   Is it Indiana?
[01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:13.940]   Where part of it is?
[01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:19.220]   Or thing part of it isn't doing the ends like Arizona is that when I don't know, Arizona
[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:20.740]   is already sane.
[01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:22.740]   It's already, you know, it's already sane.
[01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:31.300]   So apparently this first cropped up in Australia, which has moved to daylight saving time because
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:33.060]   they're in the summer.
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:36.100]   And they so they had they went sprung forward yesterday.
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:40.380]   And apparently in the series for watch, it gets stuck in a reboot loop.
[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:45.340]   Now one fix is just to wait till tomorrow.
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:48.780]   I just want to thank everyone on Australia for doing this beta testing.
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:55.220]   Yeah, apparently has something to do with a bug in the infograph activity complication.
[01:06:55.220 --> 01:07:00.820]   So another solution might be to remove that complication, which I use, by the way, I like
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:03.980]   remove that from your watch face.
[01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:07.980]   The day you could do that on the phone just for the day.
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:08.980]   Yeah.
[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:12.420]   So it's only hour by hour data on calories burn exercise time and how many times you
[01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:19.460]   stood up in the 24 hour period, apparently the missing hour is confusing it.
[01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:20.940]   What happened?
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:24.420]   There's there's no two in hours.
[01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:25.740]   Only Apple was headquartered in Melbourne.
[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:27.220]   This would never have ever happened.
[01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:29.260]   Europe goes off DST at the end of the month.
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:31.900]   They're going to fall fall back at the end of the month.
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:35.620]   We changed November 4th here in North America.
[01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:42.540]   So I presume Apple will fix this, but if they don't, just remove the activity complication
[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:47.940]   from your infograph and you won't get the boot loop.
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:50.140]   Someone listening to the show who didn't know what this was, we just think we're making
[01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:52.420]   up words at this point.
[01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:59.580]   At the end of the article on the Verge, Tom Warren, I love you, he says, "Maybe this is
[01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:04.260]   Apple's subtle way of telling the world that daylight saving time is hot garbage."
[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:05.260]   It is.
[01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:06.260]   It is a tremendous amount.
[01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:09.460]   Maybe we will in just a few weeks.
[01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:13.500]   What if they pull the same sort of strategy that they use for the headphone jack?
[01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:15.180]   They just simply say, "We're Apple.
[01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:18.020]   We're just going to drop support for this and everybody else is just going to have to
[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:19.020]   deal with it."
[01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:23.500]   So if they say our phones, none of our devices can handle daylight savings time, if you don't
[01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:24.740]   like it, call your Congress person.
[01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:27.300]   Oh my gosh, that would be great.
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:33.860]   This is a typical confusing California proposition, by the way, because if you read the proposition,
[01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:35.900]   you'll have no idea what you're voting for.
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:44.820]   It's the Uniform Time Act, which, let me see if I can, let me, oh, actually this is
[01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:49.380]   good, conforms daylight saving time to federal law, allows legislature to change daylight
[01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:55.220]   saving time period, legislative statute, establishes the time zone designated by federal law as
[01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:59.460]   Pacific Standard Time as the standard time within California, provides a California
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:03.060]   daylight saving time begins at 2 a.m. and the second Sunday of March ends at 2 a.m.
[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:07.020]   and the first Sunday of November, consistent with federal law, permits the legislature
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:11.300]   by two thirds vote to make future changes on California's daylight saving time period,
[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:12.300]   including its year.
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:13.300]   I don't understand why.
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:14.940]   Would you vote yes on that?
[01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:16.300]   I don't even care now.
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:17.300]   I just want to die.
[01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:22.020]   No, no, that's why you have to go somewhere like Ballapedia, which says a yes vote means
[01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:25.140]   we can have permanent year-round daylight saving time.
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:26.140]   Okay.
[01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:30.940]   But the state legislature has to approve it by a two thirds vote.
[01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:34.660]   That reminds me of my one absolute critical part.
[01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:38.300]   I don't know what daylight savings time means.
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.940]   I don't know if it's because are we saving things?
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:41.940]   Are we not?
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:42.940]   No, no, no, no, I know.
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:43.940]   I know.
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:44.940]   I'm being serious.
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:48.900]   I mean that does it mean that, oh, we're in daylight, because sometimes when you set
[01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:52.020]   things up, say, oh, are we in daylight savings time or not?
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:54.380]   I say, well, no, that's right.
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:56.900]   I did set the clocks backward.
[01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:57.900]   So we saved.
[01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:00.940]   Well, no, that also works if I set the clocks forward.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:08.060]   It's like, it makes me mad that I have to Google, are we in daylight savings time right
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:10.540]   now to know whether which one is which?
[01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:12.020]   See, I don't say anything.
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:15.940]   When I talk to people, you're constantly making a meeting, since you have to agree
[01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:19.620]   on what time in what time zone we're talking about.
[01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:20.620]   It's, of course, standard time.
[01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:21.620]   I just take out the ES.
[01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:23.620]   I just go ET, PT, MT.
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:25.100]   Let you figure it out.
[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:28.220]   I'm not going to even get into that conversation, because all I know is it's stupid.
[01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:33.100]   So ballot, PDS scores ballot propositions on readability and this is ridiculous.
[01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:40.940]   12th grade level on the flesh, Kincaid grade level and 17 on the flesh reading ease level,
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:43.260]   which basically means no one could read this in possibly.
[01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:44.820]   Can we normalize this with an I fix?
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:45.820]   It scales.
[01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:46.820]   I only have to keep track of it.
[01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:50.300]   Yes, on a scale of zero to 10, it's a zero.
[01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:52.220]   And then the arguments against are so funny.
[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:56.180]   It seems to be just just two members of the assembly.
[01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:59.900]   Please vote no on Proposition seven.
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:03.140]   We've tried this before and it was a disaster.
[01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:05.060]   Daylight, this is a good one.
[01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:09.100]   Daylight saving time does not create more hours of daylight.
[01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:12.980]   I like what?
[01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:16.580]   It just changes when those hours occur.
[01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:21.500]   You will not be receiving rollover daylight hours that you can use on a next on a on a
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:22.500]   subsequent day.
[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:23.500]   What do you do?
[01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:27.140]   Actually, when you when you when you fall backwards, you actually get an hour.
[01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:30.660]   You gain an hour and everybody knows that one Sunday is awesome.
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:33.380]   But what if I like happened to like sleep until three?
[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:34.940]   Because I'm not experiencing the day.
[01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:39.940]   I get those six daylight hours and attach them to like a beach day in August.
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:41.620]   Here's the arguments against.
[01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:46.220]   What will it mean to have permanent daylight saving time?
[01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:49.700]   The sun will rise an hour later than if we were on standard time.
[01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:55.220]   If you live in Eureka, it would still be dark at eight AM on New Year Day, New Year's Day.
[01:11:55.220 --> 01:12:01.020]   The sun won't rise in Los Angeles until seven 30 year or later from November to February.
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:06.900]   Those who like to wake up with the sun will wake up in the dark.
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:12.580]   I just I just want to point out to the folks living in districts 19 and 55.
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:14.140]   These are your representatives.
[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:19.660]   You voted them in just to say they're both Democrat and Republican.
[01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:20.660]   So I don't have to take a side there.
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:23.060]   But you just yeah, it's bipartisan.
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:24.060]   It's bipartisan stupidity.
[01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:25.060]   Yeah.
[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:30.140]   Last something the Congress can we can agree on.
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:32.380]   We can all agree on.
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:39.140]   Are you going to get the new Nike plus watch new face and reflective?
[01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:40.140]   I have one.
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:41.540]   Of course you do.
[01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:42.700]   You have to have one of it.
[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:44.100]   I have it.
[01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:45.100]   Yawn.
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:47.700]   Speaking of yawns.
[01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:50.020]   They disconnect.
[01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:51.020]   There it is.
[01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:52.020]   That's the new face.
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:53.500]   The Nike's got a swoosh on it.
[01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:57.820]   They discontinued Minecraft for Apple TV due to lack of interest.
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:59.380]   It's hard to play.
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:02.500]   It was just it was just hard to play.
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:03.500]   I'm interested.
[01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:04.700]   I never tried it on the TV.
[01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:05.700]   It's boring.
[01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:06.700]   Is it boring?
[01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:07.700]   I was much better on.
[01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:10.900]   I mean, once you have you have access to the iPad or the or the I just like it on the
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:11.900]   computer.
[01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:12.900]   PC the PC is the Xbox.
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:13.900]   Yeah.
[01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:16.740]   It just was like perfect on the PC with that little controller and unless you really decided
[01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:19.220]   you're going to get like a controller for it, everything else it was not worth it.
[01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:23.540]   It's announced at Apple's October 2016 keynote.
[01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:27.540]   You could build new worlds in your Apple TV said Tim Cook and play with your friends
[01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:30.460]   using iPhones and iPads except they're not playing.
[01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:31.460]   No.
[01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:32.460]   And officially for my son.
[01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:33.980]   He was my 10 year old son.
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:35.780]   I was just like, well, that's the thing.
[01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:36.940]   You had a game tester.
[01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:37.940]   You knew.
[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:42.260]   He plays it on everything and surprise that in Roblox and let's take a break.
[01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:44.260]   And then I want to talk about Intel's announcements.
[01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:46.060]   New Intel chips.
[01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:51.180]   And what that might mean for Mac and Tush's is is is is is is is they named them are these
[01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:55.500]   lake lakes we finally down to the afterwards left there just no more no more lakes.
[01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:56.500]   They're all lakes.
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:57.500]   It's lakes all the way down.
[01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:03.100]   I showed they brought to you by WordPress.com the place to create your website.
[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:04.940]   It's where mine is Leo LePorte.com.
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.100]   I love WordPress.
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:10.100]   I've been using WordPress since practically since the day Matt Mullen like put it out in
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:11.100]   the early 2000s.
[01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:17.620]   It's a great platform for the first few years I was hosting it myself and paying for a server
[01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:19.620]   doing all the updates doing the security patches.
[01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:21.060]   I liked that because I learned how it worked.
[01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:22.060]   It was great.
[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:27.060]   I made my own template my own designs that I found out about wordpress.com where for less
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:30.500]   money than I was paying for my own server.
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:31.780]   They take care of the hosting.
[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:33.820]   They take care of the security the software updates.
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:38.380]   They offer hundreds and hundreds of templates.
[01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:40.140]   You can still design your own if you want.
[01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:41.140]   Man, why?
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:46.580]   I mean, they're beautiful templates with all the design and engineering you'd ever want.
[01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:51.260]   You can upload images, video and audio and more and you're uploading it to your server,
[01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:55.820]   your WordPress.com site and easy to get stuff into and out of it.
[01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:57.260]   Yeah, you don't control the server.
[01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:58.900]   But did you ever really control the server?
[01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:04.060]   Was I going to go down to SoftLayer in Dallas, Texas and say, "I like my hard drive, please."
[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:05.060]   No.
[01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:06.060]   You never.
[01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:08.780]   Even if you're doing self-hosting, it's the same thing.
[01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:09.780]   It's the business.com.
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:10.780]   Let them do it.
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:14.620]   You're never stuck at WordPress, but that is your home on the internet.
[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:19.580]   Every single person, every single business needs that site that's theirs.
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:20.580]   It's all theirs.
[01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:24.140]   Not your Facebook page, not your Twitter account, but yours.
[01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:29.340]   By the way, when I was traveling, I blogged a bunch from the trip, put all my postcards
[01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:30.340]   up there.
[01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:32.180]   I did it all on the iPhone and iPad.
[01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:33.180]   It was so easy.
[01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:34.900]   The WordPress app is so good.
[01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:39.380]   It makes it really easy to post, to moderate comments, to keep an eye on things, even get
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:43.980]   great stats, so you know which of your posts was popular, which wasn't.
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:47.900]   You can launch your website with confidence knowing you can get help from a 24/7 support
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:49.740]   team whenever you need it.
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:50.900]   Man, is it affordable?
[01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:54.340]   WordPress plans started just $4 a month.
[01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:59.060]   I'm a WordPress fanatic, and I love WordPress.com/Macbreak.
[01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:02.940]   If you go there right now, you'll get 15% off any new plan purchase.
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:09.980]   If you're a business owner, man, you just have to have your own website.
[01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:12.060]   You've got to do it.
[01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:13.060]   It's so easy.
[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:15.780]   They've built an SEO social linking, which is great.
[01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:21.460]   It means your readers can link to your site on their Facebook and Twitter and help you
[01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:22.940]   generate traffic.
[01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:28.860]   WordPress.com/Macbreak, 15% off your brand new site.
[01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:35.860]   Zion W370 3175X is an eight core processor.
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:43.860]   Did I say eight?
[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:44.860]   Pardon me.
[01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:46.660]   28 core.
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:49.500]   That's the Mac Pro right there, isn't it?
[01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:51.940]   That's what they've been waiting for.
[01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:53.980]   I feel like there's a lot work on the iMac Pro, right?
[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:54.980]   It's too hot.
[01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:55.980]   Yeah.
[01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:56.980]   Oh, God.
[01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:58.580]   I've put Zions in the Mac Pro.
[01:16:58.580 --> 01:16:59.580]   They told me about these ones.
[01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:03.980]   I think they said the wattage was like 375 or something like that.
[01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:05.780]   Well, you know.
[01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:07.300]   What are you going to do?
[01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:10.940]   It's a Skylake Cascade Lake micro architecture.
[01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:14.220]   Works on the LGA 3647 socket.
[01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:19.140]   The CPU is run at 3.1 gigahertz stock, but can be increased to 4.3.
[01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:26.060]   Six channel DDR4 memory, 512 gigabytes, 38.5 megabyte cache.
[01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:29.980]   It is a new socket, so you'd have to design a new system.
[01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:32.020]   And no, yeah, 265 watts.
[01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:33.020]   No, 265 watts.
[01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:34.020]   Power draw.
[01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:35.020]   Wow.
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:36.020]   Wow.
[01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:40.220]   At some point, you're almost going to say, I need a 40 amp circuit for my computer.
[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:41.220]   Yeah.
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:42.220]   That could be my new big point.
[01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:43.220]   That's a funny little plug.
[01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:45.620]   It's no longer standard Edison.
[01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:47.500]   That would be that.
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:51.620]   So I feel like Apple has been just like tapping, like drumming their fingers in the table,
[01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:57.500]   looking over there at Intel saying, oh, no, no chip.
[01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:00.780]   They also announced the ninth generation core CPU.
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:02.740]   This is the one maybe, I don't know.
[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:03.740]   These aren't the U chips.
[01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:06.020]   These aren't the mobile chips, but an eight core.
[01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:07.540]   That's the one I was talking about.
[01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:12.940]   I nine, I seven, I five.
[01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:14.340]   These are coffee lake.
[01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:16.620]   No, I'm confused.
[01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:17.620]   Night there.
[01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:19.100]   I don't know.
[01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:20.740]   Do you know what generation?
[01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:21.740]   I don't know.
[01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:22.740]   Ninth generation.
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:23.740]   Coffee Lake was eighth generation.
[01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:24.740]   So this is a new life.
[01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:29.860]   I don't know if it's whiskey lake or ice lake or cobalt lake or.
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:32.060]   It sounds like he's joking kids, but he's not.
[01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:34.260]   No, I go to sleep and I wake up and there's a new lake.
[01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:36.300]   It's a serious problem in this industry.
[01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:38.100]   It's crazy.
[01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:44.940]   So given this, you know, rush of announcements from Intel, it sounds to me like it's getting
[01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:46.860]   the look a lot like Christmas.
[01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:51.460]   No, it's a huge problem, Leo, because they are still having trouble getting to 10 nanometer
[01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:54.860]   and let alone seven nanometer and yes, those are marketing names, but they're important
[01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:59.340]   because they let them put more transistors in a smaller dye space and then get more performance
[01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:00.700]   at cooler temperatures.
[01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:01.980]   They're throwing cores in it again.
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:04.980]   And that's when you start hitting thermal limits of these machines.
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:07.340]   And as much as people say, just make the machines as big as you want.
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:14.220]   Nobody wants a 12 pound laptop or a 90 pound desktop and just 28 core is fine, but like
[01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:15.940]   shrink them.
[01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:18.140]   Yeah, they can't get down.
[01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:19.980]   So these are still 14 nanometer parts.
[01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:24.060]   This is according to this chart, a coffee lake refresh.
[01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:25.060]   Yeah.
[01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:28.060]   And we saw a cable lake refresh earlier in the gym.
[01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:29.060]   Right.
[01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:30.540]   So ice like is sometime maybe next year.
[01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:31.980]   He thought I was joking, right?
[01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:37.420]   Ace Lake, Cascade Lake, Copper Lake, Cooper Lake and Cannon Lake, which is supposed to be
[01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:42.420]   the next generation processor was supposed to follow the original Sky Lake is still not
[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:43.420]   on here.
[01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:48.740]   So what do you think?
[01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:52.300]   Will we see new laptops this year?
[01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:56.820]   Maybe and you know, they could announce the Mac Pro for release in March or something like
[01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:57.820]   I hope they don't.
[01:19:57.820 --> 01:19:59.620]   Like I think that they've learned now that pre announced.
[01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:00.900]   I mean, they've already said they're making it.
[01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:03.900]   I think, you know, it manages expectations.
[01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:08.020]   Do not power do not air power anything else in the near future.
[01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:12.380]   But like we should get the whatever replaces the Macbook air at the entry level Macbook,
[01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:15.660]   the iMac and the iMac Pro haven't been updated to coffee lake yet.
[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:16.660]   So there's that.
[01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:21.980]   There's also, if they're going to do the non touch bar MacBook or the 12 inch, please
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:23.980]   get it off core M Macbook.
[01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:27.700]   There's a lot of things that can still get spec bumps this year and the new Mac mini,
[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:29.380]   the new Mac mini on the way.
[01:20:29.380 --> 01:20:30.380]   Yeah.
[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:33.340]   If there's an upside to all these delays, it means that it gives them a chance to effectively
[01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:34.900]   reset.
[01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:39.140]   If there if people have already been sort of resigned to the fact that we're just going
[01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:43.460]   to have to wait to get the new Mac mini or the new Mac Pro and the new Macbooks until
[01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:47.380]   they actually arrive, it gives them a delaying it.
[01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:51.620]   Excuse me, choosing to release it when they feel as though they've got an entire game plan
[01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:52.820]   ready to roll.
[01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:57.660]   They don't really lose anything if it ships in if they announced it in March as opposed
[01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:02.300]   to in December or if they announced it at WWDC instead of in March.
[01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:05.300]   The important thing is that once they get this thing off the ground, it continues to
[01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:06.300]   fly.
[01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:11.060]   I would love to see if I would love to see them wait until they've got a plan for they
[01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:16.060]   went they were they're ready to release the new Mac Pro because they know they have a timeline
[01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:19.060]   for the next version of the Mac Pro that is going to work.
[01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:23.500]   They're going to wait for a replacement for the Macbook Air because they know that whatever
[01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:27.060]   they replace it with, they've got the next three year strategy to make sure they're at
[01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:34.940]   least if not necessarily timely updates, at least regular predictable updates to it.
[01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:39.820]   How about Macbook or Macbook Air in October November?
[01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:41.740]   Yeah, I can see a refresh.
[01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:43.460]   I don't think we see a design change.
[01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:44.540]   I think we just see it.
[01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:49.180]   Maybe these I guess these aren't you chips so they couldn't put the new chips in.
[01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:51.740]   I think we see a new Macbook nothing.
[01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:53.060]   I'm not sure what we'll see.
[01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:56.300]   I think that the Macbook Air is end of life at this point.
[01:21:56.300 --> 01:22:01.500]   I can't I don't see why they would update this hardware when they could do an entire
[01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:06.260]   new redesign actually an entirely new product that takes the role of the Macbook Air.
[01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:07.940]   I think the thing I'm most excited already.
[01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:11.700]   I still have some loans probably 20 or 30 Mac minis.
[01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:13.660]   I am most excited about Mac.
[01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:15.140]   You're going to see a new Mac mini.
[01:22:15.140 --> 01:22:16.140]   Oh yeah.
[01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:17.140]   Yeah, I have dreams.
[01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:19.460]   I dream about a new Mac.
[01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:22.420]   The big thing I want to see is just something that is really built for the way we use them,
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:24.500]   which is they're all get they all get racked somewhere.
[01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:26.300]   I mean, I think that's why a lot of these are getting used.
[01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:29.300]   So half rack, you know, and really built to be half rack.
[01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:32.540]   And right now to like restart it, you have this funny little mechanical thing that's
[01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:34.820]   on it makes that you push and pushes in the thing.
[01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:39.220]   You're just like, why don't we just have it be a like built for that.
[01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:44.020]   There'd be it'd be interesting to see a Mac mini that was like half half one you and really
[01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:49.580]   built to just know that we're going to do half one use and a little mini server.
[01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:53.220]   I'm taking a picture view with the new halide 1.10.
[01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:57.700]   So good with smart raw.
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:59.380]   I feel smarter already.
[01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:01.300]   You look smarter.
[01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:06.540]   So this is this is if you had a halide, which of course I did, you'll get the update automatically.
[01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:10.180]   See how smart there's how smart that's that's JPG.
[01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:18.220]   But when I hit into the smart raw, it's a little bit different.
[01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:23.420]   We talked last week and I highly recommend everybody read the blog posting about this
[01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:25.940]   and the challenge and so forth.
[01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:28.260]   But a halide is now out.
[01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:31.140]   The smart raw that he was talking about is now out.
[01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:34.740]   Also I might mention complications for dark sky.
[01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:40.740]   The little mini complications for Infograph dark sky and fantastic.
[01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:43.780]   Al media updated those very happy about that.
[01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:46.540]   And I went and got my watch for you Leo.
[01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:49.260]   Ooh, the Nike swoosh watch.
[01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:51.220]   Yeah, it's like so many colors.
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:53.380]   There are so many colors on these faces now.
[01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:56.740]   I love that intense color background.
[01:23:56.740 --> 01:24:00.980]   I think it sets off the new watch so well with that larger display.
[01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:02.420]   Yeah, it's so hot.
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:04.460]   And you also get the updated Nike app.
[01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:08.300]   There's also a new updated Nike trainer app that if you don't want to just run, you get
[01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:12.260]   I think it's like 180 different kinds of exercises on your wrist.
[01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:13.460]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:15.460]   Yeah.
[01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:18.700]   My recommendation is if you're going to get an aluminum watch and you don't care about
[01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:23.340]   gold because Nike plus don't gold, you're thinking of getting the steel, the black.
[01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:28.660]   Sorry, the space, space gray or the silver, then get the Nike one because you get everything
[01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:31.380]   you get in the regular one plus all the special Nike stuff.
[01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:34.100]   So whether you use it or not, you, yeah, I think they're the same price.
[01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:35.820]   I don't think there's a Nike surcharge.
[01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:36.820]   I also get the new band.
[01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:38.940]   They have an option for a band that is reflective.
[01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:43.420]   So if you ever do go jogging or walking at night, at least your wrist won't get hit.
[01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:44.420]   Cool.
[01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:46.900]   Best buy has them.
[01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:47.900]   Cool.
[01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:49.660]   Maybe I should have.
[01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:50.660]   Maybe I should.
[01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:55.100]   The biggest advice I can give is if you are even considering getting a Nike watch or any
[01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:59.980]   Apple watch for a relative for the holidays, order now because they are in high.
[01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:02.860]   I think the demand is still rapidly exceeding the supply.
[01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:06.860]   I got them for everyone I care about because I want them to have the series for fall detection
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:08.940]   and the heart rate monitor and everything.
[01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:12.260]   And if they're hard to come by already, so don't wait till the last minute because you
[01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:14.220]   might not find them in stock.
[01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:15.940]   This year by early, this is forever.
[01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:17.020]   You can return this.
[01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:19.940]   You can return that within two weeks if it turns out when you when it arrives, you don't
[01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:23.540]   need it or put it or put it on eBay for people who did not order a head.
[01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:24.540]   Yeah.
[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:26.420]   Well, actually you're thinking not cool.
[01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:30.620]   So three nine, like you know, I'm a musician.
[01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:35.740]   Three ninety nine for the 40 millimeter for 29 for the 44 millimeter.
[01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:42.260]   Yeah, it's an aluminum case aluminum and it has an ion exchange front, but all of them
[01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:45.180]   now have the new sapphire and black ceramic back with them.
[01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:46.420]   So that was a theory.
[01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:49.180]   Some people who said, Oh, no, I'm going to get the stainless steel because that one doesn't
[01:25:49.180 --> 01:25:51.340]   scratch as much.
[01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:52.500]   They're the same now.
[01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:53.500]   Same glass in both.
[01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:54.900]   No, the back is the same.
[01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:58.500]   The front is the eye on exchange on the aluminum and sapphire on the steel.
[01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:02.580]   So the glass is still the crystal is actually better on the steel still on the front.
[01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:03.580]   Okay.
[01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:04.980]   So I took a chance.
[01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:08.540]   I got the aluminum because I figure well now that I'm getting them every year.
[01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:11.580]   Yes, I might as well spend as little as possible.
[01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:13.020]   So I'll I'll approach that.
[01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:14.020]   That's interesting.
[01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:15.020]   I wonder we'll see if it scratches.
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:16.020]   I don't think I'll scratch.
[01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:17.020]   I think it'll be all right.
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:18.020]   We'll see.
[01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:21.180]   Break then your picks, my friends are showed.
[01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:23.940]   They brought to you by quick and loans, best lender in the country.
[01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:28.940]   Number one in customer satisfaction, eight years in a row according to JD power.
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:34.380]   And I think we know, especially in a service business like this, you want to cut a company
[01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:36.340]   that's customer focused and quick and loans.
[01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:37.340]   Absolutely is.
[01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:40.820]   That's why they created rocket mortgage in the first place and entirely online mortgage
[01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:43.700]   approval process is fast and easy.
[01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:44.980]   No visit to the bank.
[01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:49.340]   No visit to the addict to get paperwork or calls to your former employer.
[01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:50.780]   That's embarrassing for pay stubs.
[01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:52.020]   No, they get it all for you.
[01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:53.020]   They do it all.
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:54.340]   It's easy.
[01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:56.100]   They call it the power buying process.
[01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:57.740]   You do it right now if you want it.
[01:26:57.740 --> 01:26:59.500]   Rocket mortgage.com/macbreak.
[01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:01.300]   You can go on your phone.
[01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:05.180]   You'll answer a few simple questions and within just a few minutes they'll check your
[01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:07.420]   credit and give you pre-qualified approval.
[01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:09.580]   That happens right away.
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:15.460]   Then within 24 hours, they will verify your income assets and credit.
[01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:19.380]   They'll do this all without any intervention on your part in most cases and give you a
[01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:20.580]   verified approval.
[01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:21.980]   Now you got a letter.
[01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:25.220]   You could show the seller of your house and say, "They're good for it.
[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:27.700]   It's put you right up at the front of the line like a cash buyer.
[01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:30.500]   That's really good stuff."
[01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:35.620]   But the best part kicks in then is once you're verified, you qualify for their all new exclusive
[01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:37.260]   rate shield approval.
[01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:40.820]   So you quick and loans notice interest rates are starting to ratchet up and no one needs
[01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:45.420]   that kind of anxiety when you're making the most important purchase of your life.
[01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:50.180]   It's challenging enough to say one-car garage, two-car garage, but to worry that maybe interest
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:53.700]   rates will go up and this house is going to cost you tens of thousands of dollars more
[01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:55.100]   by the end of the loan.
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:56.580]   That's no good.
[01:27:56.580 --> 01:28:00.820]   So rate shield approval locks your rate for up to three months while you shop up to 90
[01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:02.060]   days.
[01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:05.660]   If rates go up and you know what, chances are it depends how long you take but they probably
[01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:08.100]   are going to go up.
[01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:10.340]   Your rate locks, it doesn't go up.
[01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:12.980]   If rates go down, your rate will go down.
[01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:14.060]   So you win either way.
[01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:15.060]   It's great.
[01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:19.380]   Exactly what I mean when I say they're customer focused and that's why they're America's largest
[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:21.180]   mortgage lender now.
[01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:23.700]   Rocketmortgage.com/macbreak.

[01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:33.340]   to public data records.
[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:36.980]   Rocketmortgage is an equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer

[01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:54.460]   Andy and Akko, your pick of the week.
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:58.340]   One of my favorite photo apps got a nice upgrade just this week.
[01:28:58.340 --> 01:29:07.620]   Aurora HDR of the 2019 edition has just been released and it is an amazing app.
[01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:15.220]   As you can guess, an app that assembles HDR images, but it kicks it up another notch by
[01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:16.220]   applying...
[01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:21.060]   I hate to use the word because it's such a buzzword, but smart intelligence to understand
[01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:25.420]   what this scene is, understanding that if you're going to do a landscape with a vibrant
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:28.180]   sunset, there's a way to process it via HDR.
[01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:36.140]   So it does not look like a really horrible Las Vegas strip type of HDR thing.
[01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:41.060]   The results are much, much more natural, preserving details, preserving color.
[01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:44.500]   If you want to go all wacky, it will let you do that.
[01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:51.740]   But the ability to take two, three, five, seven, however many frames or shots you took
[01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:55.540]   and combine them into something that is way, way bigger and better than the sum of its
[01:29:55.540 --> 01:29:58.820]   parts and also control the final look.
[01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:00.660]   It's just really wonderful.
[01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:04.100]   And the other thing is that even when you're talking about...
[01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:05.460]   It's not just...
[01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:11.700]   People think HDR is just for people who have a camera on a tripod and take multiple exposures.
[01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:13.220]   That's not true for a couple of reasons.
[01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:16.220]   Number one, because you no longer really need a tripod.
[01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:23.300]   A tripod is optimal, but an app like Aurora HDR can automatically align these images so
[01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:27.300]   well that it doesn't look funny or weird or in any way.
[01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:28.300]   That's reason not one.
[01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:31.580]   But reason number two is even when you just feed it one picture, like one picture you
[01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:37.700]   took off of your phone, it's such an easy and direct way to explore the tone and the
[01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:42.580]   details that are hidden inside that picture and get a custom look that looks way, way
[01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:45.100]   better than the original JPEG.
[01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:47.580]   It's such an interesting tool to play with.
[01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:54.020]   It can really take processing it with Aurora HDR can basically take what would have been
[01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:58.940]   maybe a half hour in Lightroom or Photoshop, adjusting all these little tone sliders and
[01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:03.940]   just say, "Well, we basically faked an underexposed version and faked an overexposed version and
[01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:06.260]   we've combined all three of those and how does that look?"
[01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:08.820]   And you have to say, "That looks wonderful.
[01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:09.820]   Thank you very much.
[01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:13.420]   Please spit that out as a JPEG that I can put onto Instagram now.
[01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:14.420]   It's not cheap.
[01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:15.660]   It's a hundred bucks.
[01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:22.860]   But when it comes to advanced tools like this, I tend to think of it as whereas in a previous
[01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:28.820]   era, if I wanted to take better pictures or do some things I wasn't able to do before,
[01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:32.380]   I might automatically think, "Oh, I'm going to buy a new lens or I'm going to buy a new
[01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:34.940]   shutter release or cable release."
[01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:39.260]   Really the money that you can spend on just a really good piece of software, 99 bucks,
[01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:46.100]   will give you so much more experience and so much more results for your photography than
[01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:51.140]   even a $200, $300, maybe even $400 or rather, excuse me, it'll give you the same sort of
[01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:52.140]   experience.
[01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:56.020]   So it's not really a lot of money when you think about what you'll be able to do, not
[01:31:56.020 --> 01:31:59.580]   just with the pictures that you'll take after you buy it, but returning to pictures that
[01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:02.660]   you took a year ago or even five or 10 years ago.
[01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:04.380]   So very high recommendation.
[01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:11.500]   I bought last year's version, I've been using the new version in demo mode for free, I'm
[01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:17.340]   going to probably pay the upgrade fee because the results over last year really are noticeable
[01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:19.580]   and very, very much appreciated.
[01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:22.500]   This is one Trey Rackliff worked with them on.
[01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:24.220]   So you think it's worth the...
[01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:26.700]   That's really my question because I too own it.
[01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:28.620]   $59 for me for upgrading.
[01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:30.780]   Do you think it's worth it?
[01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:36.860]   I think it's worth it because not only because this, particularly this year, I've sort of
[01:32:36.860 --> 01:32:41.140]   set a challenge for myself to do more fine art, let's print this.
[01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:44.660]   Let's get a really nice studio print made and see how well it looks.
[01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:48.540]   But also because I've been taking lots of what I hope to be interesting pictures for
[01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:58.980]   years and it's fun and interesting to reapply new algorithms to old pictures.
[01:32:58.980 --> 01:33:04.180]   And for me, I think it is worth the $59 for a new user who's never had an app like this.
[01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:06.260]   I think it's definitely worth the $100.
[01:33:06.260 --> 01:33:13.860]   As your net, the next time you think you've got some money to spend to amplify your toolkit,
[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:15.100]   I think it's very much worth it.
[01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:20.220]   I have noticed much nicer results after upgrading than before.
[01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:22.220]   Unfortunately, I'm liking it too much.
[01:33:22.220 --> 01:33:27.540]   So I might wait a month before I upgrade, because I'm probably going to be writing some
[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:31.420]   checks to Google this month for new hardware, but I'm definitely going to upgrade.
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:32.860]   Yeah, I love it.
[01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:33.860]   I use it all the time.
[01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:35.100]   And it's got a Lightroom plugin.
[01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:38.740]   If you're a Lightroom user, I think a little bit easier, probably a little bit better than
[01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:40.420]   Photoshop as your HDR.
[01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:41.420]   It's a must to have.
[01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:42.420]   Yeah.
[01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:44.660]   I mean, if you're doing photography and you're doing anything with landscapes, then you
[01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:47.660]   look like this is from skilom, SKYLUM.com.
[01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:48.940]   It's the old Mac fun.
[01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:51.900]   They rebranded when they make Windows versions.
[01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:54.660]   Their Lumen are supposed to have a digital asset management feature.
[01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:55.660]   It's coming.
[01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:57.660]   Yeah, they've been coming all year.
[01:33:57.660 --> 01:34:00.460]   Well, you're going to get 1.0 of a feature.
[01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:01.460]   They have to get it right.
[01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:02.460]   It can't suck.
[01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:03.460]   Yeah, that's 2.0.
[01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:08.780]   2.0 can suck because they've already produced a good 1.0 and though people will give them
[01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:14.460]   six months time to fix it, but 1.0 it has to be, it has to say why you're not going
[01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:16.940]   to use Lightroom if you're going to be raising an asset management.
[01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:20.380]   And when you're doing asset management, losing people's photos is very serious.
[01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:21.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:23.300]   It's not a place to screw up.
[01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:24.940]   It's what we would call fishable material.
[01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:27.380]   Skylom is SKYLUM.com.
[01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:28.900]   Alex Lindsey.
[01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:36.300]   So a long time ago, before Apple had an iPad, I had this idea of a metabolite that you put
[01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:37.300]   in your kitchen.
[01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:38.300]   Yeah.
[01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:41.340]   Because all I was interested in was I like to cook and I like to explore cooking.
[01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:44.260]   Like it's not, I don't cook because I'm not like a cook cook.
[01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:48.060]   Like I like the technology of cooking in the process and learning how to cut and do the
[01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:49.060]   things that I do.
[01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:51.460]   And so it gives me something to do that I don't have to think about technology.
[01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:54.820]   But I like using the technology as people have seen.
[01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:58.140]   So, but I always thought it would be great if you could just follow these great instructions.
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:01.540]   Like you have a complex thing you have to cook and they're just going to give me a list
[01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:04.780]   of what to go by, then show me how to do it.
[01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:07.820]   And then of course the next step was and talk to the pan.
[01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:09.340]   Tell the pan what temperature it should be.
[01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:12.340]   Like, you know, just sort that out so that I can figure it out.
[01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:13.580]   Not talk to the hand.
[01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:15.140]   No, talk to the pan.
[01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:16.140]   Talk to the pan.
[01:35:16.140 --> 01:35:20.220]   And so I was like, wouldn't it be great if you could have a pan that would be really
[01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:21.220]   hard?
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:28.740]   Well, it turns out that Heston, who's in Napa, these guys are like actually local, Heston
[01:35:28.740 --> 01:35:34.980]   has this thing called the Heston Q. And I actually posted in the notes a picture of me cooking
[01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:36.220]   with it.
[01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:38.020]   So that's actually hard to the pan.
[01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:40.220]   So the, so here's the deal.
[01:35:40.220 --> 01:35:45.580]   The iPad, this iPad actually, will it connects to the pan.
[01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:47.740]   It gets the temperature from the pan.
[01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:52.800]   So your following number one is the video, the videos on how to do this are the best videos
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:53.800]   I've ever seen.
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:55.380]   I mean, really well done.
[01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:59.500]   They are exactly, if I had done them, it's exactly the way I would do them.
[01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:02.340]   They're short, they're concise, they're exactly what you need to know about how to do it.
[01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:05.100]   Oh, you need to use their special burner, the induction burner.
[01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:06.700]   Yeah, yeah, you have to use them.
[01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:07.700]   So it's not just a pan.
[01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:10.940]   Well, it comes, I don't know, it's a stove and a pan separately.
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:13.260]   I think you bought a few palpitational entrees.
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:15.100]   Is that where we're at anyway?
[01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:20.100]   So anyway, but it, it, it, it, you know, you go buy the stuff.
[01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:21.100]   Oh, God.
[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:23.980]   And then, yeah, this is a very, this is going to be expensive show.
[01:36:23.980 --> 01:36:24.980]   300 minutes.
[01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:26.300]   So it is, it is so awesome.
[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:29.140]   So anyway, so it's great instructions.
[01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:32.420]   It is, and, and you just literally just push the little thing and it just shows you what
[01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:33.420]   to do next.
[01:36:33.420 --> 01:36:35.940]   And even if I know how to cook, I was like, oh, I know how to cut onions.
[01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:38.820]   I was like, well, how are they having to cut and then I cut it that way and I'd follow
[01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:41.900]   along and then they show you how to chop the thing, the different pieces.
[01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:45.060]   Then they just say, just connect your pan and it just starts, it preheats.
[01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:49.300]   It's the pan while you're doing that the, and then you just throw the stuff in.
[01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:52.260]   Does it keep like the oil from ever burning and things like that?
[01:36:52.260 --> 01:36:53.260]   Is it smart enough?
[01:36:53.260 --> 01:36:56.620]   I, I know it was like, it, I followed the instructions and it was a great meal.
[01:36:56.620 --> 01:36:57.940]   Like it was like, that's great.
[01:36:57.940 --> 01:37:01.380]   It's like, it's like blue apron on steroids, you know, and, and because you're just going
[01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:04.980]   to Whole Foods and picking up or, or Safeway or whatever and picking up the food that,
[01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:11.060]   that is in the list, you, and what I like about it is that it's not just a, because I,
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:13.820]   I lean on Suvi a lot.
[01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:15.700]   And it even has a whole Suvi section by the way.
[01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:16.700]   Oh, nice.
[01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:20.460]   So it's like, if you want to do this with Suvi, here's the, the section on how to cook meals
[01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:23.020]   with Suvi and the pan.
[01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:28.180]   But it, it just takes out, I find that there's a huge, even if you follow in instructions,
[01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:32.020]   the temperature of the pan or the temperature of the pot is one of the big things that is
[01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:36.460]   really hard to manage and it makes a huge difference in how things cook.
[01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:40.260]   It turns out it's like the, I, I think it's the missing piece, you know, to, to figuring
[01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:41.260]   out.
[01:37:41.260 --> 01:37:42.260]   Now it doesn't mean that I always want to do it this way.
[01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:43.820]   And I, I definitely want to use regular pans.
[01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:47.940]   I've got, you know, but, but the, what I love is that, okay, just take that variable out
[01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:51.380]   of the situation, show me exactly what I'm supposed to do so that I can create, so I
[01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:56.860]   can explore, I can go wander out and make, I made chicken, um, let's say, cat tutorial,
[01:37:56.860 --> 01:37:59.020]   whatever, but I, it was like, I don't know how to make that.
[01:37:59.020 --> 01:38:00.780]   And there's a lot of, you don't even know what it's called.
[01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:04.940]   I don't, I was like, I was like, you know, I was like, but I don't know what it was,
[01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:05.940]   but it was good.
[01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:06.940]   Yeah.
[01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:10.060]   It was, but, but all I, what I mean is I love chicken, I would love to make chicken
[01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:11.060]   cutches, right?
[01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:13.620]   Yeah, it was, but the thing was, is that I didn't know all the, all the little bits
[01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:15.020]   and pieces and where to put it.
[01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:17.580]   And it just showed, showed you exactly how to do it.
[01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:20.900]   And, and it, and it just came out and I didn't have to think about, no, it didn't take a
[01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:24.740]   while to put it together, but it was, but the point was, is that I felt like I was on
[01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:25.740]   rails.
[01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:27.660]   Now I'll make it a couple of times, then I'm going to want to make it myself and then
[01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:29.100]   I'm going to want to change things.
[01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:31.220]   But it really, look at the, the angles are great.
[01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:32.820]   The production's really well done.
[01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:34.980]   It's, um, it was easy to follow.
[01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:38.660]   And it was just the thing that I thought would be great 10 years ago.
[01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:41.260]   I finally, you know, this is finally, so I'm actually doing it.
[01:38:41.260 --> 01:38:46.900]   So I, I felt like I, they, uh, you know, the full disclosure is they, they lent me one
[01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:52.000]   because I sent it, you know, I was doing that one on cooking at the last, uh, screen savers,
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.000]   the new screen savers.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000]   Yeah.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.380]   It didn't come in time to show it there, but, um, but then something Stacey Higginbotham
[01:38:57.380 --> 01:38:58.380]   doesn't have.
[01:38:58.380 --> 01:38:59.380]   Yeah.
[01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:02.900]   So, um, but I don't think I'm going to be able to let them have it.
[01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:07.100]   It's $500, you know, but it's, it's, it's just, it's just fun.
[01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:08.140]   - So trust me.
[01:39:08.140 --> 01:39:11.080]   - You steered me right with the toilet.
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:11.920]   Washes my butt.
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:13.400]   - And the subeed.
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:14.240]   - and the subeed.
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:14.640]   You steered me right in that.
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:15.800]   - To see.
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:17.920]   - So this is just another,
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:19.860]   - Talk about your End to End Solutions.
[01:39:19.860 --> 01:39:22.380]   (both laugh)
[01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:23.760]   - All right, there you have it.
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:28.720]   Hestinqhstanecue.com smart cooking system.
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:31.440]   Inductive burner included.
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:32.300]   - Yes.
[01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:33.120]   - It has to be.
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:33.960]   So they--
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:34.880]   - And they have the burner up in there.
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:35.680]   - They have a pot too
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:36.760]   that once you have the burner,
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:37.600]   they think you have to--
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:38.440]   - Oh, they get the pot too.
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:39.260]   - You get the pot.
[01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:40.440]   And then I don't have the pot.
[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:41.280]   - I don't have the pot too.
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:42.120]   - The pot sounds good.
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:42.960]   I have to go back here.
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:43.800]   I know the pot's coming because--
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:44.960]   - I'm gonna add the pot to my shopping.
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:45.800]   - Yes, there you go.
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:49.760]   'Cause I had the pan.
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:50.600]   I keep on seeing once.
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:51.440]   Now you can search.
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:53.040]   They only show me pan.
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:54.320]   Only show me pot so you don't have to look at them
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:55.160]   'cause I just kept on going,
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:57.560]   "Oh, they're not selling the pot yet."
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:59.840]   I don't see the pot on the site just the pan.
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:01.520]   I think it's in there somewhere, but.
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:03.360]   Anyway, it's--
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:05.560]   - I just want to say that I picked up
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:09.120]   like four or five pieces of almost new all-clad cook
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:11.760]   where at an estate sale of the weekend for $30.
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:12.600]   - So good.
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:13.440]   - For $30.
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:14.280]   - It's all I'd say.
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:15.120]   - It's broken in.
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:15.960]   - Already broken in.
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:19.280]   - It was somebody's cottage that they were only using
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:20.920]   like two months out of the year.
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:22.800]   And so I think they just basically,
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:24.400]   when they bought it like five years ago,
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:26.800]   they must have just like sat down Amazon saying,
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:27.840]   "I need pots, great.
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:28.680]   What's the best pot?
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:29.520]   Buy pots.
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:30.560]   Towels, I need towels."
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:32.760]   And then so I came in like a--
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:33.600]   - I love all-clots.
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:34.960]   - Like a scavenger pot.
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:35.800]   It's a--
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:36.640]   - Yeah, that's the cue.
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:38.120]   - I've been kind of, I've been looking forward
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:40.440]   to, I've been intending to buy all-clad
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:42.720]   for upgrade my cookware for a while now.
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:43.880]   - Oh, I have, I'm so happy.
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:44.880]   - So good.
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:45.720]   So good.
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:47.720]   - I have my, my arm--
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:48.560]   - I'm with the pan.
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:49.400]   - Is an all-clad.
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:51.360]   It's seven layer all-clad.
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:52.200]   And it's--
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:54.120]   - I'm not, and it's so, I'm not really killing
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:55.520]   like your recommendation.
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:41:00.520]   I'm saying that the first time you upgrade from like cookware
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:04.920]   that is perfectly fine or to the good stuff,
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:07.400]   when you, when you realize that I only use this,
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:10.280]   I only, I use this sauce pan,
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:12.600]   I use this sort of like frying pan.
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:14.320]   I've got other stuff, but that's the stuff that's like
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:16.520]   in the, in the, in the daily rotation.
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:17.360]   And you say, "You know what?
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:19.480]   I'm going to spend good money on a really good
[01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:21.360]   one of those sauce pans.
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:24.040]   And I'm going to spend some good money on a frying pan."
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:25.040]   And then you realize that,
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:27.520]   "Oh my God, it has no hot and cold spots."
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:28.360]   - No, that's--
[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:30.440]   - Well, it gets up so it holds a teeth really nicely.
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:32.600]   - What actually got me really sensitive to it was a laser,
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:33.440]   was a laser measure.
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:36.200]   And I realized that on some of my pans, it was, you know,
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:37.960]   they seemed really good, but I was like,
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:40.120]   couldn't figure out why I wasn't getting the right cooking,
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:42.400]   but it was, it was that there was a 200 degree difference
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:44.440]   between the center and the outer edge.
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:45.280]   I was like, "That's not gonna work."
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:47.720]   - I gotta tell you, when I saw your segment on Twit,
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:51.040]   I thought, "I should buy a laser temperature scanner
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:52.040]   because-- - $15.
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:52.880]   - $15?"
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:55.160]   - I should, I'm not gonna do that like right now,
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:56.280]   'cause I haven't done it.
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:59.480]   Just the idea of, I know, I cook like my mom,
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:02.280]   like I know from what the oil does on the pan,
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:05.800]   when the pan is, but my craft iron skillet is ready for eggs.
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:07.600]   And that's okay, that's certainly fine,
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:09.600]   but you kind of like empirical evidence,
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:11.600]   'cause sometimes you're in someone else's kitchen
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:14.200]   or you're using, you've got all burners going
[01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:15.400]   and you're using a pan you've never,
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:16.400]   you don't really use before
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:17.880]   'cause it's in the back of the shelf.
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:20.080]   So for $15, it seems like, yeah.
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:21.400]   - And when you sample it all the time,
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:22.640]   you get a sense of it.
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:24.640]   Like, I like to make crepes at 405 degrees.
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:26.680]   I like to make omelets at 340 degrees.
[01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:28.800]   I like, you know, like, and I know what that,
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:30.240]   I know what those all those temperatures are
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:31.640]   because I'm constantly sampling it going,
[01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:33.680]   you know, that burned or that went a little too fast
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:35.000]   or that went too slow.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.160]   And so it's that constant exploration of it,
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:39.000]   it makes it fun.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.600]   I literally, in DC we had an apartment,
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:43.480]   we have an apartment in DC so that I can,
[01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:44.960]   I don't know, the Bay hotels.
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:47.600]   And the first thing I got for it was a rumbler.
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:48.440]   (laughs)
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:49.560]   Like, laser the rumbler, I was like,
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:51.440]   I can't cook without this, I don't know.
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:55.480]   - Renee Ritchie, anything I should spend money on?
[01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:57.880]   - I chose something just to restore your smile, Leo.
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:00.360]   - After this, an incredibly hard show.
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:01.360]   They have a new bundle.
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:03.960]   There is a Pokemon Let's Go game coming out,
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:05.920]   which is Nintendo trying to get a little bit
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:08.760]   of the Pokemon Go fire back into the traditional
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:10.560]   franchise and platform.
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:12.920]   So basically you can bring in your Kanto Pokemon
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:14.240]   from Pokemon Let's Go.
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:16.580]   You can play with them on the Nintendo Switch.
[01:43:16.580 --> 01:43:19.160]   You can also get a Pokemon only available on the Switch game,
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:20.840]   which people think is gonna be Melton
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:23.920]   and bring that back to the Pokemon Go game.
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:26.120]   So if you don't have a Nintendo Switch yet,
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:29.360]   you can get a special Pikachu and EV bundle
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:32.880]   with controllers and branding and all that.
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:34.760]   If you do, you can just get the game.
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:37.040]   And if you wanna have a little bit of Pokemon
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:38.960]   sort of fun on a bigger platform,
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:40.680]   you can knock yourself out.
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:45.400]   There you go.
[01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:46.240]   - Thank you.
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:47.880]   (laughs)
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:50.600]   I bought a nice Apple Watch band.
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:51.760]   - It is nice.
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:52.600]   Which one is it?
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:53.880]   - I got the Nomad, have you seen it yet?
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:55.200]   - Ooh, yeah, I love Nomad.
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:56.120]   - Yeah, it's leather.
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:58.680]   It's a hornween leather.
[01:43:58.680 --> 01:43:59.520]   - Oh, nice.
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:03.280]   - That is a name that I actually, the longer,
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:06.080]   I've got a leather watch band on my watch
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:08.600]   from four years ago and I kind of mocked,
[01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:11.040]   oh, I got the horn and you know what?
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.960]   It looks really great.
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:15.480]   I would love to have a saddle or briefcase
[01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:18.400]   that looks as good as this four or five year old
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:19.640]   hornween leather watch band
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:20.960]   that I've been sweating in two for four years.
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:22.080]   - That's why you buy it, right?
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:25.320]   Because the leather, not how it looks when you first get it,
[01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:27.280]   'cause actually it's frankly very stiff.
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:28.840]   - Yeah, as time goes by.
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:30.960]   - It loosens up and it becomes like butter
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:32.560]   and it gets this patina on it.
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:33.920]   Without it, again, without the,
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:34.960]   I did say the word sweat,
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:36.720]   but I'm saying it's not letting your wrist ranks
[01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:38.160]   or anything like that, but it's--
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:40.760]   - This is a shell cord of in strap.
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:43.320]   You know, it takes them six months to take it.
[01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:44.160]   - To make it?
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:47.480]   - To make it, it takes them anyway.
[01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:49.480]   - Alex Lindsey version has a nine section steel
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:50.640]   whip chain hidden in such a--
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:53.200]   (laughing)
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:56.320]   - You're not supposed to talk about that on the show.
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:57.680]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:44:59.880]   We do this show every Tuesday about,
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:01.040]   well, right after Iowa State,
[01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:03.440]   usually about 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:06.560]   That'd be about 1,800 UTC if you wanna watch live.
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:08.040]   You can, a couple of ways you can watch live.
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:09.760]   You could be in studio.
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:11.640]   We had a halfway through the show.
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:12.800]   We gained a studio audience,
[01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:14.120]   Nylen Olivia from Mesa.
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:16.320]   Join us, hello guys, thank you.
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:18.400]   Nyl, did you drag Olivia here?
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:20.680]   Yeah, she's your teenage daughter.
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:21.520]   Yeah.
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:23.240]   Are you looking at colleges?
[01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:24.240]   No?
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:25.440]   Just, yeah?
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:27.400]   All right, poor Olivia.
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:32.120]   Hey, you didn't have to, you weren't here for the whole show.
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:34.000]   So there's a blessing there.
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.920]   Unless you're staying for security now.
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:38.320]   Oh dear, I'm so sorry.
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:39.920]   Anyway, if you wanna be here in the studio,
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:40.760]   we'd love to have you.
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:42.240]   Actually, we really like having studio audience.
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:44.680]   All you have to do is email tickets at twit.tv.
[01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:47.960]   It's free, but you do have to be in the Petaluma area.
[01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:50.240]   Make your way here and put a chair out for you.
