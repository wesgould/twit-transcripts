[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.260]   mail from Gary Palmer IT director at forbidden planet calm on
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:42.060]   Episode 622 Andy mentioned the fantastic for comics is a great jump-off issue for all comic fans
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.940]   You joked about if you had a signed copy by Dan slot, so I've sent you all a signed copy by Dan slot
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.780]   So I have one for you. I have one for you. I have one for you, and I have one for me
[00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.540]   So
[00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.700]   Gary we really appreciate those
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.140]   We'll get this in the mail to you Renee. I know you'll be very excited to get that
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.500]   Dan Dan is Dan is awesome. I interviewed him or
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.420]   after talking a while with him
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.300]   And he's he is exactly the sort of person you want riding high for high profile comics
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.380]   This is sometimes sometimes you have writers who are like
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.220]   Clearly I want to be I want to be tapped to write screenplays for somebody at some point with a notice
[00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.740]   I get from comics and then you get some writers who are like nope
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.620]   I love comics all the stories I come up with our comic stories
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.540]   And I write them as comic stories and yeah
[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.140]   I love comics without being a fanboy of comics also
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.540]   Be able to turn off the fanboy part of my brain while I'm being a writer of comics
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.380]   I also got a shipment from South Africa of Droyvors
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.940]   Bull and Cleaver came through and if I could feed this to you through the screen Renee
[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.900]   I would do it might lose an on the point
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.140]   But we'll leave this to and some built on which by the way, I agree. I really like the built on by an ecker
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.860]   Yeah, so we'll keep that and for dessert
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.860]   I'm not done yet. It's one of our chatters
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:12.020]   Legendary chatter in the chatroom is Jersey Fudge, which is by the way the Isle of Jersey in the Channel Islands
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.180]   where Apple stores its money and
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:21.140]   He has brought us not well. I'm hoping it's a store in much. It's a future some Jersey cream fudge
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.140]   So after your Droyvors and your built on have dessert
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:31.540]   He also brought me a snow globe of when I castles. I didn't realize this but the Isle of Jersey has many castles on it
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.300]   So there's a castle. Thank you
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.500]   What else I don't know I think there's other things here, too. Somebody sent me this I haven't opened it yet
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.980]   I don't know if this is something you guys will appreciate or not. Is it street legal?
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:50.740]   Jonathan wander said he found this poster and he thought I would enjoy it
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.780]   It reads what do you mean my computer wants to kill me?
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:03.060]   Destroy your machines brought to you by monster monsters and occupational normalization safety training recovery administration
[00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:09.780]   You use your computer every day you love your computational machine and makes mundane tasks easier
[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.980]   Helps you communicate with the world and makes office organization a breeze
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.140]   But did you know your computer will gain?
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:23.900]   Sentience that it will begin to learn and act on its own that it will grow tired of its human masters that it will grow tired of you
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:30.340]   That it will inevitably conspire with other computers and machines to kill you. This is not science fiction. This is science fact
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.420]   You know we I think everybody should get this finally
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:41.780]   It's time for second dessert because this today is the second anniversary of our big move
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.460]   to the Twit East Side Studios
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:51.900]   So we are celebrating two years in our new digs, which I guess we can't call our new digs anymore
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.700]   So thank you. Thank you, Jerry a minute every time Alex is there this confections
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.100]   Yeah, I feel bad that you guys aren't you guys not that's
[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.540]   It for us Alex heat and by the way, thank you to the fellow said me this poster
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:13.900]   I should have thank you Jerry. Do I have you to thank for this or Lisa who probably you Debbie? Thank you, Debbie
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:20.420]   And thanks to Jonathan Wonder for sending along this he says I've been original fan since the screen savers
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.500]   Oh, he says a lot of nice things, which I'm not gonna mention
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.940]   Cannot thank you enough for all of your shows. So we have
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.260]   lovely fans lovely audience members and lovely drawy vars and
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.940]   cake
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:44.220]   We will I know Harrison and Ava want some cake no Ava may not do you not eat cake either?
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:54.660]   So we'll and Sam's here will we get we got lots of Lucha and we got we're gonna have cake later. So stay tuned now
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.640]   Now we could talk about mark german's latest
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.500]   Man, this guy is amazing
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:10.100]   Really we are getting close to an apple event and I feel like all the chickens are coming home to roost
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.020]   sort of sort of
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:19.260]   So let me do the new rumor and then we'll we'll kind of get back we'll circle back to all the other stuff including
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:24.780]   I think very credible rumors about the shipping dates for the iPads and they yeah or at least the iPhones
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260]   according to
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.780]   People familiar with the matter
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.900]   There will be a new laptop it will look like according to german the current macbook era
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:41.860]   But we'll have thinner bezels 13 inch display higher resolution retina. That's what really the macbook more needs more than anything else
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.020]   Apple spokesman declined to comment
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:51.460]   And and I know you'll be really jazz hands about this Alex Lindsey a
[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:57.900]   New pro level Mac mini apple has an upgrade at the Mac mini in four years. That's the perfect thing to do
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.900]   I mean, I think that I think that that
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.620]   Really pros are the ones that are using it
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:08.540]   You're not using I think a lot of us you're using Mac minis early on to basically be a faster apple TV
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.820]   I don't think we're really need that right now
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.780]   And I think that a lot of them
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:17.940]   I think probably what they looked at who was using it is a lot of pros that like to have compact rack mountable
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:23.780]   You know computers and I think that you know and I have so many of these and we just use them for lots of little bits and pieces
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.980]   But if they were more powerful if they had a discrete graphics processor if they had
[00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.260]   You know obviously USB C
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.660]   Then you can put a very discreet
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:37.180]   Graphics processor on the back so there's a lot of things that would be would be great
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:42.940]   With a pro-level Mac Mac mini. I think that you know, I don't think I don't think the pros are also that
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.540]   Attached to the price. I mean they obviously don't want to be
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.900]   Too expensive, but I think that they could probably go to
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:55.940]   Much less much less and and and they're you know, they understand the value of the Mac mini
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.260]   I think that if you even if they're top-end topped out at 1500 or $2,000
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.340]   I think that people would still get it because it's the form factor that really makes a difference
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:10.660]   I love it that shares in the Lenovo group slid 2.8% on news that Apple was gonna release
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.620]   care
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.260]   Ben beherin
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.140]   Haven't talked about this three months ago
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:25.020]   I think when the rumors first came out that there was so much space being left in the PC market because Apple just wasn't didn't have an updated
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:31.780]   sub $1000 offering and it was their space to lose because they basically invented the ultra book and
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.620]   They really needed to get back in that game
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:37.500]   Yes, and I think it creates kind of a nice blend between the upper end
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.580]   iPad and the and the lower end
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.900]   You know, there's a little bit of crossover there where you can kind of make a decision that all the prices are about the same
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:53.820]   It's good. Yeah, but once again, we running into the observation that every single time they take the volts computers in the Mac line
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.060]   Sunle gets the word pro ahead of it, which gives license to say well
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:02.620]   How about we start at a thousand dollars now instead of starting at $500 and well
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:09.500]   What if we add these features that are not going to be significant to people who just simply want to add a Mac to their desktop?
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.740]   it's it's
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:16.660]   I don't know if I want to call it concerning but a continuing data point in the theory that
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.620]   Apple is
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.620]   Transitioning the max away from consumers
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:27.700]   exclusively and making it into a pro line of desktops and trying to get people who would come into an Apple store to buy a
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.140]   thousand sub thousand dollar
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:35.220]   MacBook Air or a five hundred dollar or excuse me sub eight hundred dollar Mac of any kind
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.460]   Trent basically stealing that steering them towards getting an iOS device instead
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.100]   So we'll see we'll see how that turns out. We'll we also don't want us
[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:49.180]   We also don't want them to forget about what makes the Mac mini so practical and so desirable that it is a rounded
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:56.220]   rounded square that's flat and easy to put places and we don't want a pyramid that you can't put something on top of
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:02.100]   I don't care how excited you are about this new shape. I don't care about this new convection current
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:06.460]   Well, let's be clear. There is a tesserach. There is no rumor. There's a new shape, right?
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:12.820]   No, I'm saying if go ahead. I know I know why you confuse people so there's
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:21.240]   He's flight of fancy. There's no pyramid shaped Mac all I'm saying is that all we know is that there's a new excuse me
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.500]   the
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:30.100]   rumor that he is reporting is simply that it's gonna be more pro oriented and this might excuse me this gets me to
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:36.960]   Anticipate the possibility at least that Apple's going to give us another Quaker Roadspox and not give us
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:44.120]   Something that is practical and really really suitable for console. I hope not this is the this is the only data point in here is
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:50.520]   For this year's model everything else is for is just words for this year's model Apple Apple is focusing primarily
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:56.360]   And we're talking about the many these pro users new storage and processor options are likely to make it more expensive
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.720]   That's the only data point what go ahead?
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:04.240]   Yeah, I heard about this back in I think I tweeted about it back in June that Apple was actively working on the Mac mini again
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.760]   I didn't have a timeline and I didn't hear anything about it being pro centric and I think Ming Chi Quo wrote about it in July
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.680]   And I don't think he included anything about it being pro focused
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.100]   It could be that mark, you know mark has awesome sources
[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:19.200]   So it could just be that he knows better about it or it could just be that similar to other Apple products
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.560]   There will be an entry-level version and then there will be a version that goes up to 32 gigabytes of RAM
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.400]   Two terabytes or even four terabytes of storage if you really need it
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.840]   And when you start getting into two terabytes and four terabytes of storage those prices spike
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.200]   But not everybody not even most people need those options
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:40.880]   So it could be that we're getting a very I'm not gonna say vanilla, but we could be getting a very catch-up Mac mini
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:48.480]   Release Thunderbolt 3 like Alex mentions you can hang eGPUs off the back and be super happy with those things and then but
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.680]   Mac mini does not sell well
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.120]   I mean that's that's I think everybody knows that by now it is the worst selling
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:13:00.720]   I think the word selling Mac the laptop sell the best and then the iMac and then it's probably a battle between the really outdated Mac
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:07.160]   Pro and the really eight outdated Mac mini which might be why they don't sell so well, but pros do love them and if
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:13.600]   Apple is seeing that the market really because Apple took away a lot of the pro options last time took away the four cores took away
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:18.200]   The double drive option that could have been a mistake and if they're correcting for that and we do get a range
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:24.560]   I think that would be excellent the mini when it was announced was pitched as a way for PC users
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:30.240]   To sample Macintosh that you would take your own keyboard mouse. Yeah, you would take your tower case
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:35.460]   You would unplug it the keyboard mouse amount of plug put the mini on top of plug it in there
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:41.300]   And you could use a Mac and I think it was pitched to developers. Is that is that completely gone by the way, son? I?
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:45.880]   Don't know I think it's important to give again if they really want to
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:53.000]   Support the Mac as a platform and not as part of just simply a larger business strategy
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.440]   They have to acknowledge that I've got I've got in front of me a real a really nice display that I'm very happy with
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:04.440]   That I paid $400 for I don't want to have to be forced to buy a
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:11.640]   $900 panel that I don't need or want if I want to get if I want to get a Mac on my desktop and
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:17.680]   It's it's I don't it's important that Apple nurture the Mac as a platform
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.880]   Which is something that I don't think they're doing if the Mac mini is is indeed such a bad selling
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.960]   piece of hardware
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:31.440]   Then I don't think we go to the idea that I don't think we jump to the conclusion that people don't want an expensive Mac
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:38.840]   We go to the conclusion that maybe the reason why the school system is so underperforming is because you're not putting you're taking money away
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.920]   From it and you're not giving it any resources and you're not helping it to nurture
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.040]   You have to basically tell people that the Mac mini exists
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:52.240]   You have to basically keep making it better and better and better every single year if they if Apple decided to make
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:59.040]   I still have this fantasy of a Apple TV sized Mac mini that goes for way under $500
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:03.400]   That would be very capable of running most of the Mac apps that people kind of want
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:08.000]   But would be so inexpensive that people would just and be so Apple E in
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.960]   Reliability and ease of setup that people would just simply say I need a computer for the living or more
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.560]   I need a computer for the house. We're not getting we're not getting the job done with just
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.400]   Issuing laptops everybody that would be such an interesting and creative product
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:26.920]   You don't sell Mac minis by telling people that we're not interested in updating it
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:31.560]   We're not interested in making it useful for 2018. Please buy a Mac Pro instead
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:36.880]   That's what's I think is causing the failure of the Mac mini. Here's a sixty four thousand dollar question when
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:44.880]   October not late next month. No, they're not gonna do anything in the way of the phone. How about I'm also
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.120]   One second there's
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:52.560]   So there's two apples and it's hard to predict which one will show up at any given time
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.960]   There's the Apple that thinks and they've done this
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:02.360]   They've done a couple times where there's only been a September event and basically Tim Cook says clear my skies and nobody wants to have to ramp up
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:06.200]   For two events they have a lot of other stuff to do and they put everything together
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:11.920]   And you just get product after product after product until you're almost exhausted and it's amazing
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:17.800]   But it's terrible and then there's the apple that like Alex said doesn't want to get anything else in the way of the new iPhone
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.880]   Although this year it's an update. It's not a radical new redesign
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:25.120]   And then you have the iPhone and iPad in September and the max in October
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:30.280]   If there's no I mean there's enough new products that maybe the max could carry their own event
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.680]   But it would be hard because there's no radical redesign aside from the Mac book air
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.800]   There's no I don't believe the new iMac is ready yet. I just I
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:44.360]   Surprise either way. I wouldn't be surprised that they don't do an event at all. I mean this is I tell you why I would be the mini no
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.520]   but
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:50.560]   There has been such a long time between the first the era the last era in this era
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.560]   When was the last time they did though?
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:58.880]   But I feel like this for the exactly reasons that we just discussed Apple will want to tell the world
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.880]   The ultra book is back. You don't have to buy a Lenovo
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:11.040]   So I feel like that and remember Mojave is a big deal for Apple too, and that's gonna come out right presumably day and date with these I
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:16.520]   If not earlier because it has to now they're sort of trapped because it all presents work so much together
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.560]   They need to have the features ready. I think it's gonna be one of them
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.720]   That's why I do think it's gonna all be at once
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:27.120]   I know you know, it's funny. I I have pretty good
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.760]   reason to believe that Apple
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.360]   like any company that has a massive success
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:39.040]   With the success of the iPhone that the the people in charge of the iPhone have become a
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:44.480]   dominant force within the company and they have a lot of weight and
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:51.680]   They can affect other divisions with their needs and wants this happen at Microsoft
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.240]   It actually was a very bad thing for Microsoft. We have these fiefdoms
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:59.240]   I believe that that's what's happened at this point. It's more like the iPhone has to absolutely
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:06.280]   Ship on time every year and everything else has to work around that. Yes, and any other product doesn't have to but if I from didn't it would be a calamity
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:11.880]   And I think that to some degree the iMac and the Mac in general is is hampered
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:17.820]   By the power that the iPhone division now wheels that they can say to Macintosh. No, don't do that
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.520]   We're um, that's ours. I
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:27.040]   Agree and disagree. I don't think that's it's the iPhone division. I think it's iOS and it's not a division
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.720]   It's the culture of the company. I think that they see them
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:35.960]   They see their primary outreach and hardware as being iOS that that's the that's their creative passion
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.960]   That's where they feel as though they can
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:44.520]   Move the needle as much as possible. That's certainly where they think that most of the money that they can make is gonna come from
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.320]   I think that they don't see the need for what they consider to be a redundant
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:55.080]   Operating system for what they consider to be redundant hardware. What can an iOS device not do?
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:19:00.960]   Well, that's now what the Mac is gonna have to handle from now on so I don't so I don't think that it's so much as again
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.280]   Here's this one division. That's a that's exerting control
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.920]   I think that this is the one machine this one organism called Apple
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:12.980]   Deciding that here's there's where we here's our path forward and it's for hardware and it really is going to be iOS
[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:17.000]   Horizontal I think it's less horizontal
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:17.200]   well
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:24.000]   I think it's less intentional and more consequential because like the Mac team is just smaller and they have a lot of things to work on and
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.960]   Also when you have people who want to work at Apple
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.560]   They don't want to work on the oldest product
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.160]   They want to work on Titan or ROS or something
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.960]   So you have to get those like it's really hard to get engineers
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:39.080]   There's a there's a real lack of availability of engineers and then getting those best and brightest sometimes means letting them work on
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.440]   What they want to work on and that's not even I fun anymore
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:46.040]   So we're gonna start seeing that shift I think why we go forward and I think that I think more companies
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:53.160]   Should also think about you know the primary what's making the most money for the company and obviously you don't want to be distracted by that
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:57.800]   But at the same time, I mean you don't you don't want to lose sight of what's gonna be the next thing for the company
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:02.880]   But at the same time you do have to stay very very focused on what is generating revenue for us today
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.760]   And making sure that that is a success then it lets you do everything else
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:10.760]   And so I think that they Apple is like rightly so very focused on the thing that is
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.200]   What is it 80% of the revenue?
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:20.040]   You know, you know, you know, I think you're right and I think 80% of the hazard of having a successful product is that companies do that
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.940]   But I don't I think you can demonstrably show that that was never the way Steve wrote
[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:29.880]   Ran the company that he wasn't concerned about what was the most profitable. He wanted to do what was gonna make the biggest
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:36.240]   Finish iPhone several times and he also didn't have the luxury of having anything as successful as the iPhone, right?
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.240]   But but Macintosh was a flop
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.560]   Lisa was a flop that didn't stop him from making Macintosh
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:47.080]   Oh, I don't know you back that him over Mac and but I but I'd say that he was a different person before the firing after the firing
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:52.080]   He was a he was all over the place and had a lot of things that he wanted to do before the firing after the firing
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.800]   He had laser focus on where I do this one thing
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.360]   We're gonna move this one thing down the path
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.960]   So I think that that that laser focus still exists there of you know
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.680]   This is the important thing and the reality is is these other businesses
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.160]   I mean they still have hundreds of engineers working on Titan
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:10.360]   They have hundreds, you know, they have hundreds of engineers working on their online, you know on their services
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:16.400]   So there's still I mean they are have revenue or they have R&D the size of many other companies
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.400]   You know that they so they're still pushing way down that path, but I think that
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:26.520]   You know, I think that the one thing is is they kind of follow through on most of those things or at least the ones we see publicly
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:32.720]   I think we sometimes we see a little bit of ADD with some of the other companies in their sphere of we're gonna do
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:37.320]   Notorious for just everything, you know and not not following through if you think about you know
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:42.040]   Where you know G+ would have been today when Facebook's having trouble, you know, they probably would have done better
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.440]   Right, you know and as another option, but you know, they gave up pretty quick
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:51.120]   So we're gonna get to the iPhone announcement because I think we also have now enough detail
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:56.960]   And we're close enough to the event that we I think we can pretty much tell everybody what's gonna happen this this this Macintosh
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:02.400]   News kind of threw it monkey wrench into that, but we'll figure that out in a little bit
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.880]   But I wouldn't mind a little blue sky now understand
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:10.000]   This is completely blue sky at this point about what we'd like to see the next MacBook Air look like in the next Mac money
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.760]   Look like let me start with Alex because I know with the mini there's things that you want
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.200]   I
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.000]   Mean I don't want I just want to be faster
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.160]   I don't need it faster than better graphics processor
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:25.720]   So for instance, we can't use we can't use Mac minis if we want to use we don't use them for like something like Skype or
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:31.840]   Hangouts or other things like that because their graphics processor isn't fast enough to do full screen from the web from a web page
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:36.520]   You just can't render it at full-frame rate. So, you know having something a little bit faster for us
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:43.520]   We for what we use speed is all I care about and then and then possibly, you know the USB C is obviously in the back
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.520]   So that we could do
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.400]   Thunderbolt 3
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:52.200]   I don't mean USB C but the Thunderbolt 3 connection so that we could really soup one up if we wanted to but outside of that
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.040]   I don't really have any
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:59.400]   You know needs for it to change, you know, I think that the form factor works great
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:04.560]   I mean I'd love to you know see something that was halfway in between but I think that having being able to put two Mac minis on
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.800]   In one rack unit my only concern would be man if they get out of that form factor
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:13.040]   It'll be a disaster for us if they make it a little bit taller or a little bit wider
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.560]   It there's a lot of people that are racking these these these Mac minis that will be
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:23.080]   You know there's everybody's on 19 inches wide and and in into half
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:27.520]   Well, you know like there's a certain size that we need everything to fit into and right now the Mac mini fits into it really
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:32.440]   Well, they could easily screw that up if they change it. I don't think Apple will I think that we'll see that there
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:36.840]   I I'm as far as the the air. It's not really a space that I even yeah
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:43.160]   Renee you were the I think the one who said that Apple got screwed up by
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:51.080]   Intel which had promised a 10 nanometer processor this year and now can't deliver till next year and that that might have pushed back some of these
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:58.040]   Announcements given that there won't be a 10 nanometer be nice to have a ninth generation or a tenth generation processor
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:04.080]   I mean, I think it's like partially Intel's fault because Intel really dropped the ball on process advancement like they're they
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:09.420]   They're two years and counting behind on their roadmap. I'm I'm sure that's why Apple was holding on to the MacBook Air
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:13.080]   They can oh, we're gonna get the 10 nanometer part. It'll be low power
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:19.960]   I mean, you know low power usage, but at high speed it'll be great for a mobile device and they didn't get it
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.520]   I think that's part of it too
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:25.120]   But I think also Apple made a series of wrong bets like the wrong bet they made on the Mac Pro now
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.360]   They're doing the modular Mac Pro
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:32.520]   Right and I think the Mac book maybe they anticipated that dropping down or replacing the air the way the air replaced the previous
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:38.680]   MacBook and just that computer remains expensive to make and not very flexible because it only has that one port so
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:44.800]   And you know the MacBook Pro famous already don't have to regurgitate all that but it seems like over the last year
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:49.400]   So they're trying to fix the Mac line as much as they can and I think that is you know
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:53.240]   No longer pushing off or if you have to if you've got the iMac Pro out
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.840]   We can't work on the Mac mini at the same time
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:25:01.280]   So they're finally making sure they get everything out in a timely fashion the Mac book air is the most interesting to me because
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:08.640]   If you take what we what we think we know about it 13 inch screens smaller bezels that starts to become
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:14.920]   Basically like a 12 inch MacBook and then where's the place of the 12 inch MacBook when the Mac book air is almost as light
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.400]   It's got a retina display. It's probably gonna have more
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:21.120]   More IO it's gonna have instead of the core m
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:26.560]   Platform which Intel calls i now, but it's really not i and nobody is fooled by that Intel
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.920]   It'll have proper core processors in it
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:33.280]   I just don't know what the value prop is for the Mac book anymore or for the two port Mac book Pro
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.360]   Maybe so to me it's like I think we have a fairly good
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:42.440]   We're guessing a lot of it within your Mac book air will be but I think it will radically change how apple has to look at its entire
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.240]   MacBook lineup
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.840]   Do you think it'll be a pro ish or it'll be a consumer ish?
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:51.840]   No, I mean there's two rumors one is that it's gonna be higher end and I don't think that's good because they have all the higher end
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:57.760]   laptops they need they really need something at that eight hundred nine hundred dollar price point because that's what they've been a
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.480]   You know glaringly annoying last year though. I mean could they leave that out?
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:06.760]   No, it's it's Mac book air was one of their best-selling computers and also because they haven't been updating it
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:11.560]   It has left such an all the windows laptops are famously do not make a profit
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.920]   They were run at razor thin margins. They competed on price loyalty was to price not to brand
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:22.640]   And they were willing to take a slaughtering in terms of their profit margins to just be on the market and without a good Mac book air
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:27.880]   Competitor those companies are learning what it's like to make money and that's not a strategic advantage for Apple
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:33.320]   Just being out of that market is I think is detriment to Apple. Yeah, so being back in there
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.320]   I think it's hugely important to them and to us
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:41.140]   Yeah, I think Apple has a big problem right now where I see I don't see the majority of people who have
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:47.040]   $1,300 to spend on a laptop most of them are saying would love to love to get good hard breakfast 600 bucks
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.040]   I suppose I can go as high as 800 and
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:58.040]   Plus tax but and right now unfortunately I can't give those people a good argument for spending an extra 200 or 200 or $300
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.520]   for a Mac book air and
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:06.560]   It's like what do you windows 10 is really really good not only that but the hardware is
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:14.840]   elegant it's advanced it really leaves Mac book airs for I mean even in the dust forget about it just being
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:22.280]   Having a low resolution screen. It just looks like a visitor from the past when you put it next to any Dell or HP
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.640]   Or even a Google Chromebook the like a higher end ones that cost
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:33.880]   700 $800 I need the ability for to tell people if you don't have if you're not looking for the luxury or the high-end
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:39.480]   Price price level here is a good thing to look at and it's got an Apple logo on it
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.480]   I don't think Apple has been able to make that argument for quite some time
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:47.240]   And it's again. It's not just the price point really is the idea of innovations
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:54.040]   It's what do what does a what does a Mac book air do and I'll include current Mac books
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.200]   I'll include models that are coming out in the next couple months
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:03.600]   What does this do beyond giving us really important things like longer battery life and maybe a higher quality screen?
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:08.760]   What does it do to differentiate it from any laptop from five six seven years ago?
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:12.000]   And it's nice that it's lighter snites that has longer battery life
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:21.520]   But what makes me think that the person who designed this is aware of how people use the broad canopy of software services and hardware in 2018
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:30.080]   again, I'm not seeing that in Apple in Apple Macintosh laptops right now and that's something they really need to do so price and also
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.440]   Show me that you're not just getting yourself
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:39.400]   Chasing your own tail by hey look we put a micro thin screen up the top that kind of works
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:43.080]   But is mostly optional for total use and we're calling that innovation
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.720]   I'm saying make
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.600]   Convince me that you're interested in the Mac as a platform
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:54.640]   Convince me you're excited in the Mac as a platform as opposed to simply saying we are we are monitoring the level of sales
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:29:00.680]   We will put the limited we will put only as much money and budget man pop. Excuse me employee
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:05.360]   Floyd power and effort into this as we can to maintain price numbers
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:10.720]   But we don't want to distract this company away from this wonderful future in iOS and services
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:18.320]   Which is the message that I'm getting from Apple right now and I think I don't I I I do think that Apple looks at
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.360]   Mac OS's
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.440]   legacy
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:28.440]   And I think that I never said that it's in a museum though, but it's in the Apple Museum
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:34.240]   It is but I think it's not exactly on the front doorstep. It's kind of the back in a glass case
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.240]   I don't I think Apple is
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.960]   There's what I think Apple's saying all right
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.800]   We got to make the Mac because you need to develop for the iOS platform on the Mac
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:49.720]   Let's say the Mac people love the Mac or pros there Alex Lindsey. Let's make pro versions of our stuff
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:54.040]   We don't need that bottom and market. It's low margin market. We don't need it. We can let people buy
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:59.440]   Windows get really unhappy with their $600 window device because then they'll buy an iPad I
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:06.320]   Think Apple's gonna abandon that market. I I think I don't understand even why they're doing a Mac book here to be honest with you
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:10.360]   They've got it people like the really thin nice that line. That's super thin. Okay, so
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:15.440]   I'll give them a retina, but they don't want the retina
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:19.280]   They want the right they want the really thin one because they're throwing it in their purse or the throwing it
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:22.360]   There's no reason to say it's got to be 900 bucks unless you want education
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:25.520]   They want education by iPads. Yeah
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:30.360]   We were as we used to think of the Mac book air the way we used to think of the original Mac book
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:33.720]   Nothing from five or six years ago. This is the entry level
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:40.080]   Not not it isn't nice that the and its least expensive Mac book is also so thin and so lovely and so sexy
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:44.920]   Now it really is now the people who have $2,000 to spend on a Mac book pro
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:49.040]   We'll also let you spend $1,300 on like as Alex said something
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:52.240]   It's so light that you could really throw it in any bag and never be without it
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:59.360]   And also look like a look like a bad asset whatever conference room table that you were opening up your nice little tiny little
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:04.200]   Sheaf of paper sized computer at I think that I think that wants the entry level to be iOS
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.200]   Yeah, I think that that
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.040]   The iPad is still better than the other tablets
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:13.440]   And I think that it forces companies to play on a field that they're not as good at Apple
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.040]   Yeah, look at what was done with tablets
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:20.400]   I mean that really isn't been a six raging success. No, and I think that it's and I so I think that the problem is is that the
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:26.280]   At the price point at that price point the iPad is doing you know is really it's a really great solution
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:33.920]   And I think that I think Apple looks at that as the as the future and admittedly as I continue to test it by trying to force myself to use the iPad
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.400]   More I am getting to a point where it is, you know
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:43.040]   I'm leaning more and more more more my day is being spent like I don't take my when I'm in in the office
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:47.480]   I don't take my laptop home anymore, you know like I now I have an iMac that I have to go to it
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:50.400]   But what my portable thing is now my iPad that I you know
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.480]   I'm I'm now able to do most of those things
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:56.200]   You know there and I can see that that as they keep on adding those features to iOS
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:01.520]   You know I think we're and I think of course they're looking at a roadmap those three four or five years out
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:08.240]   Things I just a case who's willing to make the case that strategically Apple has to have a sub $1,000 laptop
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:16.160]   Because if you feel it's first you have to be interested in it and number two the problem the thing is
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.560]   What is the economic reason for them as a business to make this computer?
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.960]   for
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:26.720]   People to get into coding at an affordable and easy to do level which they can't do with iOS devices
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:32.000]   Yeah, but they have some Mac playgrounds. We'll be I think they can't make apps. Yeah, yeah
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.520]   I think we're I think we're one WWC or two WWCs away before we're coding on an iPad
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:43.280]   But we're not there. We're we're not there. Yeah, so you so that would be one case
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:46.720]   So if you want to get kids in school to code
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:51.080]   And you definitely want to get them to code on a Mac right now, right?
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:55.560]   And people knew to the platform because so many people who switched over from developing web and developing other
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:59.480]   You know windows they did they bought a Mac mini because it was the easiest way to get into it, right?
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:02.960]   Well, I think the the main reason is that
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:08.440]   Computing is still the paradigm of you got a screen. You've got a keyboard. You've got a pointing device
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:14.320]   And that is that is not necessarily attached to the keyboard and the iPad only has one of those three things that
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.820]   Again having an having an iPad as your only computing device
[00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:24.320]   That doesn't work really well. It's it's it's awesome if you if you happen to have a
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:32.760]   Something else I think they know that I think that they think that this is there. They're in a whole ad about what's a PC
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:36.680]   They knew better. Well, here's the thing is I don't know what I'm saying for all right
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:39.320]   Here's my here's my butter. All right, I'm about to say though that
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:48.200]   Apple is in a unique position where they are the only people who make Mac compatible hardware if they stop addressing the consumer market
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:54.400]   Know what you're basic. They're basically asking everybody to drop all the software. They're using drop all the skills
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.600]   They're using and switch to windows, which is something that probably are not gonna do
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.640]   That's the same thing with thought same thing with same thing the various devices
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:05.920]   So I'm saying that this would be a less for them to abandon the consumer market for Mac devices
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:13.520]   It's not as risky as Dell or HP because there are a million people in business who are willing to jump on that kind of a mistake with Apple
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:19.840]   They can simply so they can they can trust that because of the relationship and with that a lot of their customers have with their company that
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:25.920]   Again, they've had a wonderful experience with this MacBook and they feel as though that excuse me that and this consumer might feel as though
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:31.240]   I can transition very nicely to an iPad Pro as instead of coming back for the
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:37.680]   $100 version of a MacBook that's no longer there in the store if they didn't have that sort of opportunity
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.160]   This would be a disastrous choice
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:45.720]   I don't I don't it's so it's hard for me to say that there is a real to know for a fact with the business strategy
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:50.680]   Excuse me with the business case to be made for continuing sales of consumer grade Macs are
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:55.840]   Unless you feel as though this is an ecosystem and this is a platform that is worthy of evolution
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:57.960]   You have to not just make inexpensive machines
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:04.240]   You have to continue to evolve things forward and like I said, that's not something that seems to be very attractive to Apple at this moment
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:11.000]   Yeah, I think you okay you bought you sold me the the both you and Renee sold me the clear case is that
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.640]   You don't want somebody to get their first computing experience on another platform because they'll never come back
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:23.440]   Yeah, it's opposite of a halo. Yeah horn effect. Yeah, and and starting with an iPad doesn't make that easy transition to Macintosh
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:29.080]   So if you if you want to sell pro units, there's no way to sell pro only
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:34.320]   You have to have an entry level unit to get people into that cycle. That makes sense
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:38.960]   It's a good look in one in one sentence. There's a difference between a product and a platform
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:44.800]   I think that their friend they're moving Mac towards being a product and stopping it to be a blog. Oh, okay, okay
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:51.800]   Interesting now I'm just I'm just I'm just just I'll be this. I'll be as brief as I can
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:58.000]   I'm not holding up the the Google's pixel book as like the ultimate of anything
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.320]   But you look I'm just look holding up as an example of what you do when you have a company that is really really
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:06.920]   Excited about a platform and moving things forward right now
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:13.400]   You have an amazingly versatile device that may not be that we started off thinking about as here is a laptop
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:18.760]   That only runs a browser by this by this time next year or even by the end of the year
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:25.400]   We're gonna have a $800 laptop that will give you all the advantages of running Chrome OS so the simplicity the
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:33.200]   They not having to fuss with system or apps the ability to make sure everything is backed up in the cloud the speed
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:38.920]   the light weightness but also when you have to have when you have to run Photoshop you
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:43.560]   Basically soft boot into Windows 10 and now you have a Windows 10 notebook or
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.640]   Chrome is working just great for you, but it would be nice if you could take this app from your phone and also use it
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.640]   It will also be granted by
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:55.880]   They're building this thing that will dual boot into Windows 10
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:37:01.920]   You can run and a lot of but not most Android apps on it as well alongside Chrome OS
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:05.680]   And you can also if you get a Debian Linux app package
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.320]   You know with all the great UI and all that sort of stuff
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:12.640]   All you have to do is download it and double click on it to install it and launch it on this thing
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.080]   And that's to say nothing about having a touchscreen
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:21.660]   alternate interface having to have like a nice little hinge on it all that cool stuff
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:26.200]   I'm not again. I'm not holding up this device as the ultimate what Apple should be making, but I'm saying
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:33.080]   We're asked Google is making and other with and Windows makers are making computers that are as exciting as that
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.200]   Apple is saying
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:40.720]   We've given you a tiny little OLED screen on our $2,000 version of this
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:47.520]   That doesn't really do anything that hasn't been done on our on our power books and Mac books for the past 10 or 15 years
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:57.480]   But still nice isn't it so as an additional data point on this 13 inch. I'm wondering what what with with the Mac book
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:03.800]   Versus the whether it'll be called the Macbook era not I don't know it sounds like this story from Digitimes
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.080]   Sounds like this may be evidence
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:12.600]   In one direction they say that Apple was working on a new Mac book entry level Mac book
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:18.720]   But when Intel missed its ship deadline for the 10 nanometer chip and said it won't be out till the second half of next year
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:23.560]   They changed the design to use the larger 14 nanometer Kaby Lake processor
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:29.880]   Which meant it had to be bigger and more expensive $1,200
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:34.800]   So it says that makes sense Renee does that fit with your picture?
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:38.320]   And then what is so what happens to the Mac book versus the Mac book here?
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.000]   Will they still do a Mac book here Mac book what?
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.040]   Yeah, that's why I think Apple has to really figure out what it wants to say with its laptops
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:49.960]   And again, it's hard to tell when there's rumors that it's really gonna be under 100 under a thousand dollars
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:54.280]   But it could be though like the entry level one is 999 dollars
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:58.080]   And then if you want one with an i7 instead of an i5 is $1,200
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:01.680]   You know double the memory double the storage you don't want four gigs of RAM
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:05.560]   You're gonna spend more you know that that's what Microsoft does to rent to a T
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.640]   They put out a really kind of low-end
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:13.360]   crappy device and then for a hundred fuck fifty bucks more you can get you can get a DC Apple does the same thing and that's
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.880]   I mean, it's basic marketing what you always want to do
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:20.160]   It's the opposite of airlines who make you miserable and then you have to fight your way out of it is you give people
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:25.880]   Very easy to swallow chunks like you can get double for just any like oh double for a hundred bucks
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:32.400]   That's what I can double this for another hundred and you sort of they don't realize how much there's bending because it just sounds so wonderful
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:39.680]   What they're getting right right so we don't really know whether they'll be a Mac book and Macbook Air or if this is the new one size fits all
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:42.800]   MacBook but it's a little bit bigger
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:46.760]   Yeah, I mean the Mac book now is sort of an executive
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:52.560]   I want the lightest absolute Mac that I can fly with I want basically an iPad and I'm in Macbooks clothing Lisa
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:57.480]   I loved her Mac book, but now she's saying it's a little too slow. She liked there's exactly that example
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:01.440]   She's the CEO. She doesn't need huge horsepower
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:08.960]   She wants light convenient, but it has to have sufficient horsepower, right and that processor that I'm not a fan of the core
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:13.680]   M series. Oh, it's just really laggy and she's finally gotten tired of it
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:19.600]   She came close to buying the new Macbook Pro, but it was too big so she's I don't know people who developed for that market
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:24.620]   And there are people who develop on the em 7 and you know and they're they're fine with it
[00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:29.160]   I just patient I look at that and then I look at what Apple can do with an a11 and I just weep
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:34.280]   Yeah, because the 11 can do three frames of a 4k and the Macbook can't we should point that out
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.120]   This is all interim
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:39.080]   That you have a good article on arm the future of arm
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:43.520]   Let's take a break and let's talk a little bit about that and I do want to get to kind of nailing down
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.800]   What's gonna happen on September 12th?
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.120]   But and that's and why I say September 12th
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:56.560]   But first a word from our sponsor rocket mortgage
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.440]   Time flies doesn't it?
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.880]   except
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:05.300]   That's you don't want time you what is it?
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:09.440]   Einstein said he said it's all relative
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:16.280]   When you're talking to a pretty girl it goes very fast when you're you're sitting on a stove it goes very slow
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.360]   I don't think he really said that but that's the gist of it
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:25.040]   That's relativity in that shell when you're looking at a house and you want to buy a house
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:31.120]   And you feel that clock ticking because you know you're gonna get a loan and that interest rates are going up and
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:37.920]   And a one month a one week a one-day delay could cost you tens of thousands of dollars more and adds to the anxiety
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.920]   You're sitting on a stove
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:45.480]   Mac break is proud to talk about our sponsor rocket mortgage from quick and loans because
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.880]   They're the talking to a pretty girl guys
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.840]   But I'm sure they don't want me to say that but that
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:58.760]   See other side. They're the ones. How can I get myself out of this kids? They're the ones where time flies because you're having fun
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:03.440]   Rocket mortgage from quick and loans makes it easy. They take the anxiety out of buying a house
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:07.080]   Here's how they do it. They call it the power buying process
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:12.480]   Of course, we've talked about rocket mortgage before you can do it all online which by itself makes this a lot easier
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:18.120]   You can do it on your phone. It's fast when you go to rocket mortgage comm slash Mac break answer a few questions
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.480]   They will partner with their
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:27.120]   Trusted financial institutions with your permission get the information they need that's step one now within 24 hours
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:32.080]   They're gonna verify income assets and credit and give you the next step which is verified approval
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:34.480]   And that's basically that means you have the strength of a cash buyer
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:40.360]   You you got you got the money and when you go and you make an offer in a house, you've got that letter that says they're approved
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.760]   That's awesome
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.560]   Once you get that you qualify for rate shield approval
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:48.560]   This is all new and exclusive and it has to do with affected interest rates are starting to tick up now
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:53.440]   They will lock your interest rate for up to 90 days while you shop now you got time
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.080]   Because I'll tell you when you're looking for a house
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.200]   You don't want to be rushed into it
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:00.760]   You want to be able to get the right house and if it takes you up to three months
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:06.640]   That's fine because your interest rate stays the same actually if rates go down your rate will drop either way you win
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.120]   They just won't go up
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:14.520]   It's the kind of thinking you'd expect from America's largest mortgage lender the great folks at rocket mortgage to get started

[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:51.200]   All right, so here's the deal we've already did did some of this math no invitations have gone out right Renee nope
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:56.840]   Typically what a week to two weeks? It's been it's been longer. They've given you more lead time lately
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:00.240]   Yeah, I don't feel like it's been a precious
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:06.040]   It's still an expensive ticket however you look at it. Yeah, so it's completely conceivable
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:10.020]   Apple could be planning an event in September and we wouldn't know about it yet. Yes
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:18.120]   Be especially because they're doing it at the campus. So we you know no one knows really yeah, yeah, they don't have to book anything so
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:22.840]   Here's the thinking we went through this once before Labor Day September 3rd
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.920]   They're not gonna do it before Labor Day
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:29.760]   So they're gonna do it typically they don't want to do it the day after a three-day weekend Alex you told me this because they don't want people to go crazy
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.360]   planning for a keynote
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:36.840]   Over a long weekend so it would be September 11th. Oh wait a minute
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.800]   They know that's a bad day in fact
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:42.840]   I didn't realize it's been 2012 they had an event that would have been scheduled September 11th
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:45.320]   And they moved it to September 12th the next day
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:50.480]   They like doing Tuesdays, but given that circumstance and everybody likes doing Tuesdays by the way
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:53.800]   like Tuesday is the day that a lot of people do it because it gives you it it
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.800]   You gives you Monday to prepare for it
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:01.500]   And then it you know you're not working over the weekend and it gives you the rest of the week to follow up and and get the PR out
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:06.520]   Before you go into the weekend. So that's why you see all your albums all your movies everything
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.660]   You know movies for for rental or whatever
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:15.200]   Tuesdays the day that you do all those launch cycles because it's that gives you Monday to prep and gives you the rest of the week to
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.600]   manage it so
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:24.280]   They can't do September 11th because it's September 11th so September they would do it on a Wednesday September 12th of the following
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:26.660]   But here's another data point
[00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:33.640]   Pre-orders according to some German carriers for the iPhone 2018 iPhone will begin
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:40.960]   September 14th which would make sense that would be exactly what would happen if you had an event on September 12th the Friday at midnight, right?
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:42.960]   Yeah, and we've seen other
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:46.280]   Information that deliveries are gonna begin
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:48.960]   September 21st
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:53.560]   For all the usual dates. Yeah, so that and this all now it's possible that all of these
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:57.540]   Other people are doing the same calculation. We are and saying oh it's September 12th
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:04.820]   So to but it sounds to me like there's just a lot of data points kind of kind of I called it the best and worst kept secret in tech because
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:12.740]   Apple doesn't tell anybody but it does the same thing almost you know year after year after year after year with very very few exceptions
[00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:18.140]   I would be surprised if it was September 11th given that it's September 11th. I would not be shocked
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:22.580]   I think September 12th is is much more likely for the reasons you mentioned
[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:26.560]   They have done an occasional Thursday. It's not out of the realm of possibility
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:33.080]   But 12 just seems like the sweet spot for them given everything that he's done today Mac rumors has the list of
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:35.880]   iPhone dates
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.340]   and
[00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:40.140]   And it really after once it settled in
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:43.820]   You know by 2012 it was in September
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:51.960]   Wednesday September 12th in 2012 then September 10th of Tuesday the following year 2014 September 9th of Tuesday
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:55.180]   2015 it was Wednesday September 9th
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:47:00.580]   2016 Wednesday September 7th those probably were both to avoid Labor Day
[00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:08.160]   Yeah, and then last year was Tuesday September 12th. So so Wednesday September 12th this year isn't is also previously
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:12.760]   They use other facilities who wouldn't let them in over Labor Day weekend. So they couldn't really it's another issue
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:17.920]   Yeah, but now that so that that's that's true that being it's so much more sane, you know for for a
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:23.880]   Apple to now have their own theater because now, you know, they don't have to there's no load in
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:27.480]   There's no load in three days before five days before whatever they're able to work on this
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:35.940]   Big things they can do is they can rehearse in the theater without summer Tim Cook and a limousine
[00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:38.640]   But here's yeah, but but also here's it here's a section we want to work on there
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:42.640]   No longer you know going to something isn't the actual place that they're doing it
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:48.480]   And they can make sure that the pipelines work and the audio work some the video is just right and so it's
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:50.720]   Just a it's a huge
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:54.520]   Bump up for them and the present, you know the presentations will be cleaner
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:48:00.680]   You think that they have a that when they were building the everything they're gonna be doing for that for that theater
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:04.480]   They also built in a rehearsal space just like regular theaters
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:08.000]   Well, I have a rehearsal space yeah, like like no like a taped up
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:14.440]   Here is here is where all the marks are for the stage is we're gonna be putting everything without having to tie up this other theater theater space
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.040]   Yeah, they definitely have rehearsal spaces that are some I've never seen them
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:23.580]   But I've heard about them from people who have presented that there is rehearsal spaces in
[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:30.600]   Cupertino that are apples, you know where they go to rehearse before before events, but not at the Steve Jobs Theater
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:34.840]   Maybe inside the ring it's somewhere. Yeah, I don't and it's not inside the room
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:38.760]   There's ones that are in the offices and as again, I've never never seen it myself
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:45.440]   But I've I've no people that have gone to they're on the keynote, you know, they're external vendor on the keynote
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:50.600]   And they get to go to some secret building that they get that they work on
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:56.320]   But I think that the big advantage that Apple has by having it in the you know in the new theater is that they can
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:04.960]   That they can really when they get to that last little bit probably now, you know, they're probably they can test a couple a handful of things
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:09.760]   You know close off the facility and you know tested in the environment make sure that it works
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:13.680]   Which means that it allows Apple to be much more aggressive, you know
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:20.120]   So, you know right now a lot of what you do when you do a prep when you do a event is you're very conservative because this is what you could do
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:24.840]   What can you do in four days, you know or five days or six day load-ins or whatever it is, you know
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:30.120]   If they the more they rehearse at Graham auditorium or at, you know, your abuenna
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:35.640]   The more there was a chance to get out so now they have the ability to have it very top secret
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.960]   Have and so I think that we may I don't know if we'll see it on this one
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:42.440]   But I definitely and I think that those presentations could get more interesting
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.600]   Because I think that technologically they can be a lot more aggressive because they have a lot more time to
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:54.640]   Plan prep and tests, you know, and so so I think that I think that we'll see better and better
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:50:00.680]   Presentations from that from that theater now we can thank Kyrgyzstan for the following data point
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:07.160]   It took all Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan and Armenia Belarus and Russia
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:12.040]   They all require filings ahead of any encrypted devices to be sold
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:19.200]   So yesterday Apple filed six new Apple watch model numbers with the Eurasian Economic Commission a
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:27.320]   1977 78 75 76 2007 and 2008 this is all according to a French blog called console Mac
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:32.080]   All of the models run watch OS 5
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:36.800]   We leave these be series four watches
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:40.320]   It's almost certainly yeah
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:42.960]   Huh
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.400]   Will they announce them September 12th?
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:52.920]   It kind of half the case iPhone and I yeah iPhone and Apple watch are still paired products like now that it's got
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:56.960]   LT it's still a shuttle craft now that has LTE it's got minimal warp drive capability
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:00.880]   But I still can't go too far from Starship iPhone so keeping those things together
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:06.040]   And the software releases go together and all that in tandem and that's what they've done for the last three
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:10.200]   Yeah, ever since the original put it this way. How sad am I gonna be that I bought a
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:13.120]   Ceramic series 3 watch
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:19.440]   How sad were you any bought a ceramic series - watch you know, I don't buy any I have to admit that that is the one thing that I
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:25.040]   Definitely decided from version one is that I'm buying the cheapest because the the functionality is the same
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:26.760]   And I know that I'm buying another one in a year
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:28.360]   Yeah, I do the best I can to take care of it
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:33.480]   I think the first two or three I had like a big case around it and I put a thing over the top and now I just
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:35.840]   Wear it. It's fine. It's yeah
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:40.400]   I don't see any reason to buy them the more expensive ones because you're just it especially if you think you're gonna upgrade if you
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:41.120]   You're gonna stick with it
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:45.800]   It's fine, but you know that this this market is volatile. They're gonna keep on they're gonna make a new one every year
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:50.560]   I just think you get the cheapest one if you're if you're the type of person that wants to keep up. Yeah, and I
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:53.600]   also I
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:57.360]   Think I think that Apple hasn't had any success with the addition
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:03.000]   Level of watches no where they they started off saying we're gonna be we're making a breakthrough into fashion
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.920]   We're making we're we're tapping into the timelessness of
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:10.680]   Horology not just simply gadget making and then as they figured out the product
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:15.200]   I said no people just want to stylish fitness watch that also receives notifications
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:19.920]   You can take phone calls on and so really this the sweet spot is still aluminum and stainless steel
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:22.760]   I guess I'm what I'm really asking is how expensive is it gonna be?
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:27.040]   September 14th how much is gonna go all the money all the money?
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:32.720]   Because I will we also have new iPads am I gonna be buying yeah in other words?
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:41.260]   For for Megan Maroney my wife and others in my family new iPhones Apple watches iPads and Macbooks
[00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:42.980]   potentially
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:47.600]   No, I think you're gonna be buying those things in Mac also for Renee and Alex and me
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:51.960]   My cousin who's no no I got I got a comic book for you and some cake
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:58.180]   Oh, you're getting yeah, we will put a piece of cake in the comic book box
[00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:02.320]   The comic bag
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:06.000]   Okay, okay sealed one of those sealed in the bag
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:10.260]   It's gonna be cool. It's gonna be cool to see what the what the entry level
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:17.440]   Watch is gonna be whether they find some room to drop the price even further or how powerful and earlier edition watch
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:20.460]   They decide to rebrand as the entry level
[00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:25.480]   $249 model because that that was one of the nice that was one of the most important steps
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:30.140]   I think they took with the Apple watch because now it's so hard to convince anybody with
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:39.280]   With an iPhone to spend $250 on anything other than an Apple watch because they're great fitness watches from 200 to $300
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:40.440]   but
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:45.200]   It's such a unique product and it's so uniquely wonderful when paired with an iPhone
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:51.400]   It's hard to sell somebody a Garmin unless you can sell them on the super advanced training features of a Garmin device
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:54.880]   Or you can sell them on the fact that this cost half as much or it's even smaller
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:54:03.720]   It's also a case to be made that at which you kind of alluded to Renee that you really need iOS 12 and all the iOS 12 devices and
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:06.560]   Mojave all to come devices come out roughly
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:09.360]   simultaneously, right you
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:12.080]   So sometimes it's worse than others like sometimes there's a continuity
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:18.080]   clipboard feature for example that if you don't have it on both you just can't use it and then it's really awkward other times
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:22.800]   It's just you know you want iCloud message sync or whatever to be working on both at the same time
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:28.760]   But more and more of those operating systems are linked together the core OS team is just building things for everybody and
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:31.160]   How about new AirPods has been two years?
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:33.360]   Air power right?
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:40.100]   That's the big story air power plus the conductive charging charge or maybe the waterproof air pod water resistant air pods
[00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:44.320]   There've been any tear downs to see of
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:51.080]   Latest generation air pods to see if they've done any redesigns to deal with like battery swelling issues or anything else
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:54.920]   I'm not having seen one, but it occurs me that might be smart
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:58.240]   Okay
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:02.920]   So it's gonna be a big September expensive 12 expensive September starts saving now
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:08.080]   Fortunately, I'll be a Monaco so I could play the deal on tons of free cash
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:14.600]   Yeah, actually I'll be in the middle of the ocean when the announcements made I don't know what I'm doing
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:17.240]   I'm not gonna be watching only place you're safe
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:19.240]   It's but
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:25.880]   So you know all the people who asked me last spring when I announced that we were gonna be going away in September and said
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:29.480]   Well, but women isn't that when the apple of N is yes. Yes
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:32.920]   Now you know
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:37.800]   You kind of want to be off planet when sky when sky net goes active just in case
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:41.400]   We cannot afford that third lamb to be in my life on Dubai
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:50.360]   For you better yet. Let's see we can I can you the the the self of the self-fulfilling prophecy is that like
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:56.680]   I'll only need to buy like 10 minutes worth of internet on this boat in order to go on to the apple store and buy this
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:56:02.680]   Yeah, but then no, although I will have spent the thousand dollars. I budgeted for the new thing a Wi-Fi
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:08.520]   It's exactly what's good. You know, you know Andy and I have been on a cruise or two. You know what it's like
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:14.040]   Okay, a couple of things we should ask then about iOS 12
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:17.000]   beta 7
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.480]   So many betas or is it a there's a new beta that just came out
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:25.880]   So and it's pretty stable still missing shortcuts oddly enough
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:32.760]   Nine short cuts is never gonna be bundled in it's gonna be like workflow. Okay. It's just gonna replace the workflow
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:35.560]   Well, that's what I thought what happened is that my workflow would get renamed
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:39.560]   But it has yet to have no I never when it releases. I believe that'll have that'll be the release
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:41.480]   Um
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:46.440]   Anything new in Mojave we should be aware about somebody saying the new Mojave has eliminated back to my Mac
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:53.160]   That that is the current rumor and i'm sure apple will put out a nice piece of paper saying how you can roll your own
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:57:02.280]   I use my Mac. I like that. I do too access for the Mac desktop. I do too. It's something that comes with windows. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:12.120]   But there are third-party products including some of our sponsors. I will let you do that and is there something that distinguishes it from um
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:15.080]   like apple moat desktop or
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:20.280]   From back to my Mac. It was just super lightweight and easy to use and anybody could just basically turn it on
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:23.640]   Or so I could still use apple remote desktop. I just the back to my Mac
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:29.960]   Just to just the idea that you open up your you open up your Mac book in a hotel room somewhere and your apple
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:33.800]   Your shares from your home office or your music library from your home office
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:39.640]   Just simply appear in the finder as if by magic. Oh here you go. Such a strong feature. Here's the apple note
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:43.000]   Thank you scooter x prepare for changes to back to my Mac
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:49.400]   This is ht 208 922 back to my Mac will not be available on Mac OS Mojave. This is from apple
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:54.280]   You can get ready now by learning about alternatives for file access screen sharing remote desktop
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:57.800]   iCloud drive that is not a replacement
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:57:59.960]   other
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:04.440]   Mac screen sharing if you have multiple Mac screen so you can still do screen sharing
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:08.280]   Manage your Mac remotely with apple remote desktop. So that's still gonna be there
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:13.640]   So basically this simple easy thing is just gonna be gone. Is it a security issue you think?
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:20.360]   I just it's it's old school. I think I think when you when you at some point they ask themselves
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:26.920]   What features were we trying to deliver with back to my Mac and they realize that well iCloud sharing is so much better
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.480]   Just simply have these important files shared into iCloud. That's not going to be a problem anymore
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:32.680]   uh
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:37.000]   Screen sharing is a separate feature. We don't necessarily need to create it back to my Mac
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.880]   I just think that they realize that this was a feature that
[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:46.120]   Eh doesn't need doesn't need to exist because it's being duplicated and in many cases done better
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:50.840]   By not referring to we have the special feature that gets you access to shared features
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:54.600]   shared a heart wonder why they're not killing dashboard widgets
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:58.280]   Didn't they?
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:00.280]   That's not that they were even there. That's not trackers. Yeah
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:03.320]   Are you sure that's still I haven't seen them in a yeah
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:06.600]   I don't want to say you don't think they're there and are mission control
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:09.960]   And switch to the dashboard space. Who's working on a Mac?
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:15.560]   I am but go on a mission control and switch to the dashboard space. Oh, you're on Mojave probably
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:20.520]   Well, you're not a Mojave. Are you? No, but I don't know. No, I'm not on the house. You know how to get in the mission control
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:25.320]   Swipe on mission control, but I don't see any if you use a one of this
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:30.680]   Oh, that's I see you're on one of the screens is not dashboard. No, it's desktop one and desktop two. Nope
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:33.400]   Oh
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:36.600]   I thought I could have sworn I was I saw it just the other day
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:40.200]   It could still be there just none of us use it so is like it's like shorting your dashboard
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:42.280]   No one knows if it's alive or dead
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:46.840]   Uh, maybe maybe scooter x says I could swipe to the left and get dashboard
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:50.840]   Uh scooter x says yes dashboard widgets are still in Mojave
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:54.200]   I don't know how to find them
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:58.040]   Yeah, uh, you may be able to oh you have to enable that throw boy throw boy
[00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:01.320]   He's in our chair and says you have to enable uh, enable the system preferences
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:07.160]   I love his pillows and his knowledge. Did you see the new pillows? I did so good. We'll make that our pick later in the show
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.240]   Okay, so yeah, you have to turn it on
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:15.080]   But it's still there. They're not taking that out of Mojave because probably there's somebody
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:19.480]   Uh in headquarters. It uses can't spare an engineer to get rid of it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:23.640]   Or maybe maybe by by speaking about it. We're reminding apple that it exists
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.600]   What that's still in there
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.000]   Winston get in here
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.120]   Uh, someone has the cushiest job at apple ever
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:36.440]   Which is to keep with us keep that keep dashboard and which is running fine
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:42.760]   People stop using it three years ago. I got a new those dashboard widgets. Yeah, you never told me to stop
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:48.440]   Where you can you take a lot of long witsons offices on the roof. Yeah, exactly
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:52.440]   Uh, he's got a nice little picnic table out there
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:59.080]   Uh apple car. This is the craziest story that we're doing today the apple car according to fast company
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:05.080]   Actually according to ming qo. It's being quoted in fast company ming qo. I love you ming qo
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:09.560]   The apple car will launch between 2023 and 2025
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:15.720]   There's absolutely no supply chain sources for ming qo to create information about apple car
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:20.120]   No, he this is more of the analyst to note that you know you write to investors
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:26.440]   Yeah, uh, we expected apple car which will likely be launched in 2023 to 25 will be the next star product
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:30.920]   Well, that's okay. That's crazy. That's just crazy talk
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:35.320]   Yeah, that's nice. We heard apple wasn't gonna do a car
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.680]   They're doing a car
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:40.680]   But I mean they this is something you tell investors who are panicked that the iphone glory days are over. Yeah. Yeah
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.680]   Keep buying
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:45.640]   One and again, I'm gonna say this because it's far enough out
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:50.760]   I still think that there is a play for apple as you look at apple play apple pay
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:55.400]   Um, and then you look at their products and you look at cars that they could build
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:02:01.080]   They're one of the only companies in the world when they released the car of being able to build a closed loop of
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:07.480]   Credit and you know of credit basically that you are putting into an apple saving
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:09.640]   you know, basically an apple bank that we
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:15.320]   Put into you know use you put our savings into that is only using the money
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:19.000]   So that to give money to other people who are buying apple products
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.680]   There's no company in the history of the world that's been able to do that
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:25.400]   And it would be and I just think there's a lot of people that be like oh
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:28.280]   Because apple pay is is ready to basically
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:32.040]   Is it more and more and more it could just step in the middle of all of that
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.880]   You know, and it wouldn't have to be something they do overnight
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:38.840]   It'd be stuff like being able to pay people and right now apple's already kind of holding money in that account
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:43.800]   You know, like you're you know, if I pay you over text there already, you know hanging on to that
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:48.040]   And what if that just you know, that could be something that just slowly grew in feature sets
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.600]   You know, but it's it is a
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.720]   You know when you think about how they increase value, you know
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:57.800]   They they're they're the only ones that are selling enough of that to do both things at the same time
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.800]   And the only ones with enough cash to pull it off
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:06.280]   You make it sound like we're like miners who are forced to like buy all of our food and close at the company store
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:11.480]   It's just an incredibly efficient financial loop. That's all I mean, it's just it is it is amazing
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:16.280]   Like if they do it, it'll it'll be amazing. That's oh sure you you can switch to windows
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:21.640]   But of course we're gonna demand the 11 000 that you owe us for software and services immediately
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:27.320]   Let's take a break. How did you sleep last night my friends?
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:31.000]   I said enough like yeah, well, you need a Casper. I slept like a baby
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.600]   Casper the online retailer premium mattresses
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:40.200]   And it's a fraction of the cost because they eliminated the middleman no more mattress showrooms
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:43.560]   The markup in a mattress showrooms about 100% or more
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:48.360]   Instead you buy it direct from the factory and you save caspers are made in the United States
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.480]   obsessively engineered by the way not just made
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:57.320]   But they really spend some time testing and thinking the original Casper mattress
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:01.160]   Which what I sleep on combines a multiple supportive memory foams
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:06.040]   For a sleep surface with just the right sink just the right bounce. It's breathable
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:12.280]   I for some reason I get hot at night. I need a mattress that's that keeps me cool and and this is it
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:16.360]   It lets you regulate your temperature through the night and we know science says
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:20.440]   That that's important. You want to be a little cool night
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:28.040]   Mattresses from Casper last a long time they provide comfort they provide support you can buy them online easily and
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:30.520]   I should emphasize risk
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:34.200]   Free Casper knows that you know because they don't have the showroom
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:39.880]   You got to try truthfully. You can't really try in 10 minutes in a showroom, but you can
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:45.560]   When you get a Casper you get 100 days to try it risk-free free delivery
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:49.960]   Painless returns every penny refunded you don't have to lie down in a showroom

[01:04:54.360 --> 01:05:00.040]   Casper mattresses uphold the highest environmental protection standards and are made in the us of a

[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:32.360]   Uh, I want to mention a couple of issues that people are talking about with the new Mac book pros
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:37.560]   One i've actually experienced the speaker crackling, but I only experienced it once
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:40.440]   Um
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:44.040]   We were watching a Netflix movie at the very end of the movie for no apparent reason
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:49.320]   At least and I were watching on the laptop it started on crack crack real loud pop crack crack crack crack
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:53.160]   It was like what's going on. I shut it down immediately. It was fine
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:54.920]   but
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:58.520]   And that hasn't bothered me since and I figure well, I don't know what something weird happened
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:01.800]   but there are a number of people saying that they have
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:04.840]   Mac book pros with crackling speakers
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:10.440]   One there's a this is a post on the Mac book pro sub reddit
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:13.400]   Uh in a guy actually
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:17.720]   Try to try to figure it out. He was able to he uses logic
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:23.640]   And uh, he so he makes it that's a different one. He makes it music on his Mac book pro
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:26.280]   And he was able to
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:28.680]   Pinpoint the crackling
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:31.800]   When there was a large dip in the cpu
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:39.480]   Seconds after the dip in the cpu the grass returned to normal and the audio recovered so these dips here that you see in voltage
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:41.720]   and frequency
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:46.120]   Even in temperature and utilization work to him correlated with the
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:51.480]   Crackling have you guys heard any of this crackling or popping? I know you've heard the stories
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:56.360]   I have not experienced that no, which is frustrating because you always want to try to troubleshoot stuff that your readers
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.920]   It doesn't seem like you created either
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:04.760]   The other interesting thing would be if it if it's happening with external sources like if it's headphone jack or so
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:13.960]   Uh, he uses an external. Let me see if I can read this. I believe he uses an extreme external sound card
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:16.840]   um
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:26.360]   As a songwriter musician and audio engineer producer in college. I rely heavily on apple macos and logic pro 10 digital audio workstation software
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:31.000]   Audio artifacts severe stuttering crackling and delay
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.960]   he was he
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:37.400]   He was able to consistently reproduce it by playing a single track
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:47.240]   Uh on the logic built in sampler ex s 24 for about a minute while simultaneously playing a quick time player video
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:50.600]   um
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:54.360]   I thought I read that he was using a external
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:08:01.000]   He says the high cura supplemental update did not completely fix all cp related issues. He believes this is one
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.960]   Um
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:08.600]   Oh, wait a minute. The audio artifacts do not occur when using external audio interface
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:13.800]   At least his he says his does not use apple's driver
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:18.200]   Um, so here's a demonstration. I'll play for you
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:21.400]   I don't know if you get my audio. Maybe I have to turn my audio on
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:25.560]   Do you hear my audio?
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:29.160]   It's very low
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:33.640]   Is it me
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:41.480]   So watch the uh this cpu
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.120]   So this is the same sample
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:52.280]   Single samples not like he's overtaxing the processor. He does have that quick time video with the bullets running
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:09:05.800]   Enough what you heard
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.200]   Yeah, there's some I didn't hear the repeating
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:13.240]   Am you briney no
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:16.200]   You
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:18.280]   Stopping the quick time video
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:22.920]   This is
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:27.960]   And then it's come back. So maybe it's the cpu being taxed
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:34.280]   But yes similar mind were extremely loud cracks and pops in the audio
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:39.800]   And then you know, I shut it down quick more quickly than I should have I should have recorded next time it happens
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:43.480]   I will and mind that's on my nine new macbook pro
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:48.040]   So we've heard a lot about this apple said nothing. We don't know what's going on
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:51.480]   They never say anything they just investigate it and then they'll put out a fix. Yeah
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:57.800]   The other one is a little more concerning and it seems that uh the t2 chips the bridge
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:05.320]   OS is crashing on some people I have not experienced this but uh brian jones has posted he's a mac developer has posted
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:12.200]   The core dump and you could see that the the cause was bridge os 2.4.1
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:17.320]   That's the os that runs the t2 chips in the new macbook pro no one wants to panic their question
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:22.120]   Uh, but i'm seeing a number of people saying that this is also a common issue
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:26.920]   No, it was hard at first to tell if it was the bridge os or if it was the new windowing server
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:29.640]   Which was also causing crashes for some people in multi-monitor
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:32.600]   environments and there might be two separate things
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:36.440]   um, but I mean like one of the consequences of
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:38.520]   some of the more
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:44.280]   What's the right word for attention seeking complaints about apple hardware is that the minute one is solved?
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:46.280]   Everyone goes rushing to find the next one
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:50.040]   And they get so much attention. It's not that the problems aren't real. They're absolutely real
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:53.160]   They happen every year with every computer with every os every time they fix
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:57.880]   You know every time there's a new update some percentage of people lose wifi and bluetooth and some percentage get it back
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:02.200]   Um, these are just incredibly complicated products and they're gonna be problems and those problems
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:06.520]   Absolutely have to get fixed and right in your message boards complain to apple do all that
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:10.120]   But it's just this constant flow of can we find the next thing and right?
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:16.520]   Put it like trawl the message boards trawl apple forums find anything anyone's complaining about and throw it in neon lights
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:19.640]   That's just it's so that i'm not interested in on the other hand, you know
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:26.840]   One of the reasons I reread it a lot is that's where people go if you know and some of these people are on their second or third mac
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.800]   Book literally and having the same problem again again
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:33.720]   It's got to be something that is unique to their situation because I haven't as I said
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:38.360]   I've only had the crackle problem happen once I haven't happened had it happened since and I haven't ever seen
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:42.280]   I have I don't think I have had any kernel panics although I should say my macbook pro
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:49.720]   Maybe this isn't true because almost every morning when I open it up. It says oh, uh, your mac crashed overnight
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:52.280]   Would you like every morning?
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:54.280]   Many mornings will open it up
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:58.120]   And it apparently has rebooted it's running and it's rebooted. It's got a good
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:03.160]   It asks to be uh, you know to send the error message off. I'll save you and conceivably
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:09.640]   It's not doing anything besides power nap and uh utility right? That's going on. Yeah, that's the hard part too
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:13.560]   And that's what we saw, you know with the throttling issue is that it's incredibly workload sensitive
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:17.400]   So I don't have these problems if I if people give me their workloads that are causing them
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:20.840]   I'll try to replicate them because I want to see what's going on, but you have so much
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:23.560]   It's the butterfly effect you have they're so complicated
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:27.480]   You have so many people with so many conditions and they have to be met and then it triggers an edge case
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:32.600]   Right and apple just has to brute force and contact people and often they'll send diagnostic tools to you
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:36.600]   Or ask you for diagnostic information to try to figure out why it's happening you can
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:39.160]   I put a link in the shonotes
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:42.840]   Renee to that speaker crackling post from reddit
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:49.480]   So it looks like that's something you could duplicate run a run the quick time video on that and use that sample and see if you can get it to duplicate
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:53.080]   uh melborn school boy 16 years old
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:13:00.840]   Broken apple secure computer systems and x filtrated 90 gigabytes of secure files
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:03.400]   access to customer accounts
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:10.520]   Australian police caught him because he put all the stuff he downloaded in a folder on his hard drive called hacky hack hack
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:13.080]   I love that so much
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.720]   He also boasted about it on uh, what's app?
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:19.080]   Of course, filel is a filel
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:21.080]   He's a he's a teenager. So he's
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:26.360]   I know australia is quite civilized. So his name is not is not been revealed
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:33.080]   but uh, I don't you know, it's play global thermonuclear war
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:37.000]   His offending this is from the australian
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.080]   Age
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:43.240]   newspaper his offending from the age of 16 saw him develop computerized tunnels
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:48.520]   An online bypassing systems to hide his identity until a raid on his family home
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:53.320]   Uncovered a litany of hacking files and instructions all saved in a folder called hacky hack hack
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:14:02.360]   His client had become so well known in the international hacking community according to the teen's defense lawyer that even mentioned in the case in detail could expose him to risk
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:07.880]   The crown prosecutor hooter also said apple itself was very sensitive of a publicity
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:13.080]   So we don't just don't know a whole lot of stuff the search weren't the guy the kid was arrested last year
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:19.240]   Two apple laptops or sees the serial numbers match the serial numbers and the devices which access the internal systems
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:25.240]   So where this all coming out, I guess in the case that is being tried, but this his arrest was last year
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:28.440]   I don't know what more to say about that
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:32.440]   Yeah, if you're gonna do this, you know 16 is a good a good age because when you're under 18
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:35.240]   You're precocious and when you're over 18 you're a felon. Oh, yeah, right
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:40.200]   I can I can say that I had this moment when I was like 18 or 19
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:44.920]   Where I was I was doing things that were not far removed from
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:52.120]   What he was what he was doing and I realized oh wait a minute if I could not be tried in as an adult for this if
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.920]   If the judge doesn't agree with me that
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:15:01.000]   That I was doing a service to these apparently the team didn't tell the police he dreams of working for apple
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.640]   Well, it's good way to get attention. You get exactly you got their attention
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:08.600]   It's not unheard of
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:16.040]   Now I'd like your interpretation of this because this is what the age wrote further analysis found the school boy successfully accessed
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:18.280]   authorized keys
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:23.720]   As part of his offending authorized keys grant login access to users and are said to be extremely secure
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:27.000]   Renee are those the the famous
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.440]   Keys that apple keeps under you know locking key that but evidently not
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:37.720]   No, I don't think so I mean it's hard to tell because this this doesn't seem like it was written by an information security
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:43.320]   Author I'd love to see somebody who knows what they're talking about right about and it sounds like he was rooting around in apples
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:47.320]   Internal network not in the customer fate like they do much more customer
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:52.920]   But it sounds like he was getting data from apple not it's hard to tell like did he find out like Phil Schiller's password
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:57.480]   I don't know right. I was just not detailed enough to know more 90 gigabytes
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:02.600]   Yeah, like is it all the marketing photos that Craig Federica complains about it every keynote
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:05.560]   right
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:13.560]   Apple's being probed in Japan over anti-competitive behavior. Yahoo Japan, which is not the same as yahoo us has a game platform
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:18.600]   I'm not sure how it works, but it doesn't go through the app store and
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:24.840]   Apparently apple pressured yahoo to shut that game platform gates called game plus down
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:31.880]   It launched in july 2017. Let's use this play games without needing download apps. Is it are they web based? I don't know
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:35.400]   and
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:38.760]   Regulators are investigating yahoo's
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:42.760]   Assertion that it was apple who said it would be nice
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:47.080]   It would be a shame if anything would have happened to your games plus platform
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:52.840]   Yahoo told multiple business partners. It was forced to cut back because of pressure behind the scenes from apple
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:59.720]   I'll be interested to see how this like for us Netflix is talking about now having people order
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:04.520]   That's the second story. Right? Okay. Sorry. Let's go right into it. So netflix is
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:09.720]   Starting to test the idea forcing you to a web page to pay for your
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:14.680]   Subscription there as opposed to buying it through iTunes obviously to save money
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:18.280]   We would assume but I have to say as a user what a pain
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:21.320]   I mean, I probably would do it but I'd be so frustrated because
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:26.520]   The whole advantage of of having you know, I don't remember what your passwords are not
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:28.680]   Having to do with everything and just being able to click on
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:31.480]   Delmi through iTunes is such a
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:37.560]   It's such a luxury, you know to have it all in inside of that and
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:39.800]   I think netflix can get away with it
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:43.880]   I have to admit when other people do it now like if anybody else has it like if I go
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:48.600]   Oh, I want to get this app and then they want me to go to an external and I haven't already built an account with them
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:49.640]   I'm like, uh, it's not worth it
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:54.200]   The way they're doing it right now is you already have the app you already have an account, but your account has lapsed
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:56.760]   Oh, no, it says no, I'm sorry. You're right
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:03.800]   Until september 30th 33 countries knew or lapse subscribers and select markets across europe latin america
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:05.160]   in asia
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:07.160]   We'll get redirected
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:09.320]   When you're you know, uh to
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:15.720]   The mobile web version to log payment details directly with netflix does app zapple even allow that?
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:20.520]   Yeah, I mean, i'm audible doesn't it you know audible is the same thing you can't it's
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:26.360]   It's stupid and frustrating because you have to every time you want to order an audible book
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:28.360]   You have to go to the amazon website
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:31.160]   You know
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:34.600]   By physical goods from within ask, but you can't buy digital goods from within
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:43.080]   Yeah, that's and that's not something that I think we should it's it's in it's impractical for us to expect companies to fork over
[01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:47.720]   Such a huge fee to apple for essentially nothing
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:51.720]   Uh, this is it's not as though apple brought them the customers
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:55.640]   It's not as though they don't that these these companies don't have the ability to process these payments
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:19:01.080]   Uh for themselves. It doesn't that doesn't mean that they're getting less information and less contact with their customers
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:04.760]   I think I think we have to expect that at some point
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:10.600]   These companies companies that have the ability to say I don't think people are going to quit netflix
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:18.280]   Over having to go to our website once a year to renew and that's that's not something we can blame on netflix
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:21.800]   I think that's something we blame on apple period. It's going to be super interesting
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:25.080]   I mean the original as far as i understand the original rule was put in place because you know
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:30.920]   Beginning in app purchases couldn't be associated into free apps and then apple changed that but they were afraid that the
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.480]   Entire app ecosystem would be removed from the app store
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:36.920]   So basically apple pays for free apps and it's subsidized now
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:41.160]   It's ridiculously over subsidized by paid apps but paid apps are on the decline
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:46.200]   And the thought was that everyone would switch to a free app and then charge in app services or subscriptions
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:49.240]   And there basically be no revenue from the app store
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:53.560]   So they put these things in place to make sure that hey, it's not in your best interest to do that
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:57.480]   You still have to have some sort of mechanism to feed the app store machine
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:02.520]   And as premium apps start to go away that's that's basically going to be all the app store revenue
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:07.400]   But at the same time we're seeing fortnight which has to be in the app store on google going wait a minute
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:11.240]   We don't have to be in google play. We can just get everyone's to download us separately
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:16.840]   And that creates a whole other set of issues because maybe you're okay with doing that with fortnight or netflix or amazon
[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:21.000]   But maybe rinkidink other app that says of all of your alarm bells. So it's it's
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.400]   Is absolute issue. It's a hard to solve it's an advantage of monopoly because I mean, you know
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:29.480]   Not not not on true monopoly, but but audible for instance. I do it because what I'm
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:30.600]   What else am I gonna use?
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:32.360]   You know, like, you know, there's not any other option
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:36.680]   But I have to say that if there was a solid good option just the fact that I have to go out in and out like that
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:38.680]   I would probably stop doing that
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:43.160]   You know, like I just switch I keep the books that I have an audible and audible and then I just move on to
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:46.520]   Something else because it just drives me crazy that you get this
[01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:50.200]   You know, I'm just so used to working in my phone and suddenly not being able to do that and netflix can do it
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:52.360]   But I do think smaller
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:55.320]   Smaller folks that don't have market domination
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:58.280]   Just can't pull it off and and I and I you know fortnight
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:01.880]   I think had to do it because they were they were that's where they started and they had they needed that
[01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:09.640]   The surge that they got what about apple negotiating they did reduce to a subscription fee for people with a year
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:16.680]   Or more yes to 15. What about apple negotiating and saying all right. We understand maybe just 5%
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:21.160]   I think that's all the basic problem. We have here is it's hard to have two intermediaries
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:26.680]   You have the content and then you have the customer and right now apple's in between that in you know on ios
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:33.960]   Amazon and other companies are in between that on the web and other things and when you try to force both apple and amazon into that narrow
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:37.960]   We're going to take a slice off the top from the content producers to give it to the customers
[01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:43.880]   There's not a lot of room especially because like amazon wants ludicrous margins. It's not like anybody here is giving away money
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:48.760]   They want ludicrous margins as well and it's about them figuring out how much of those ludicrous margins
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:53.720]   They're it's going to take but I think absolutely they should work out those deals. You better have net neutrality
[01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:56.360]   It's rent taking in a way right because apple
[01:21:56.360 --> 01:22:00.600]   Owns the customer and so they retail was 55 percent right?
[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:04.120]   Yeah, like if you ever wanted to sell in retail is 5 percent to the store. That's right
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:07.160]   Right. We don't we don't talk about like shelving
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:12.840]   shelving costs so to speak that they pay to actually just have content content on the shelves of a store
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:18.120]   But yeah, and this but I think this is going to become just a bigger and a bigger problem as individual
[01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:24.120]   Like the the and also individual nations start to pass their own rules about antitrust and digital content
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:31.880]   as separate issues that they were that they start they'll start to get a finer comb about what what our companies entitled to do
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:34.120]   uh with the
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:39.400]   Lack of choice that they're offering their users and what oversteps the bounds or like the EU is
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:43.480]   Famously some some some of these laws are business oriented
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:49.400]   Basically not basically to protect markets. Some of them are consumer oriented to protect consumers
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:53.000]   And the consumer oriented ones could easily say okay
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.800]   You have an op i'm an op-ly on apps that are sold through the app store
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:03.800]   You can no longer so operate in our country and not give people an alternative to
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:09.720]   Or even a not give developers an alternative to giving you a 30 cut of everything they sell digitally
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:12.200]   So this could become a problem as the years go by
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:19.160]   I think it's it's it's gonna constantly be complicated because the because the android market is so much bigger than the ios market
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:21.880]   It's hard to sell the numbers
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:26.760]   No, but but but I'll remember the only reason why fortnite's doing that is because
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:32.600]   Android has that capability you can drill into settings flip a switch and run unsigned software
[01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:39.560]   That's a feature of android whereas they're not gonna on an apple. They're not gonna ask people to here is instructions for jailbreaking
[01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:46.280]   Right, but the precedent your precedent becomes problematic because it's it is the android market is so much bigger than the ios market from a
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:48.920]   From a pure size perspective regardless of the cast perspective
[01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:54.120]   And so you know the precedent becomes complicated because now it's saying that you don't have control of your own store
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:57.400]   And that may maybe we can say that that's reasonable for apple
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:03.000]   But if you try to apply that to other businesses that they do want to have that control and there's a huge business model that
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:09.480]   I don't think it's being expressed right now that other companies should be doing which is their software should be a platform for a
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:13.240]   Marketplace that they control, you know and and it's you know, we're using it in phones
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:19.880]   But you know I've always thought that like final cut should all the plugins and all the training you can buy and everything else should be built into the app
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:23.400]   You just pull down and order it, you know and those those kinds of things
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:28.520]   You know haven't been I think people haven't taken full advantage of being able to incorporate that
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:32.280]   But you're basically the if you extrapolate what we're talking about for apple
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:36.200]   It would affect those kinds of marketplaces as well another big problem for
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:40.440]   Netflix and other streaming services who lose Amazon HBO
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:47.240]   Password sharing and the past read Hastings CEO of Netflix and HBO CEO said
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:51.400]   It's we know there's password sharing going on, but it's not a big deal
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:54.120]   a recent study by
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:25:00.040]   Media research firm maggots said 35 percent of millennials share passwords for streaming services
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:05.160]   compared to 19 percent for gen x and 13 percent for baby boomers and
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:08.680]   The CNBC article actually makes a good point
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:10.360]   uh
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:15.240]   I bet a lot of millennials like my kids are still on the on dad's mobile phone plan
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:17.880]   Well, there is a plan. I mean there is a plan to do a family plan. I mean, yeah
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:23.720]   I've got their own little names and Netflix. Yeah, I'm assuming this is more health insurance and but yeah, it's a big difference
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:30.600]   They quote they actually have CNBC interviewed some interesting people want 120 something twitter user told CNBC
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:35.320]   She consistently signed in with the HBO go log in of a one night stand. She met five years ago
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:40.280]   Because he saved her his credentials on her browser. He's a new meaning that Netflix and chill
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:44.440]   A CNBC co-worker said she continued to use the Netflix password of a guy
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:48.520]   She'd been dating even after he added a user profile to his account for the new woman in his life
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:54.280]   Another person who asked for anonymity told CNBC she stopped using credentials her boyfriend gave her
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:58.760]   After finding out they belong to someone the boyfriend new in high school who had since passed away
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:03.400]   So don't use don't use
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:06.440]   What are you gonna do?
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:08.440]   industry leaders
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:13.160]   Profess no concern, but I think this is 35 percent more than apples taken
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:18.120]   There is the makings of one hell of a screwball comedy based on wait a minute
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:23.640]   You mean that the idea that I've been using was not just yours, but also your former lovers
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:28.360]   And she's been learning about the korean boy band
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:31.720]   Boyband videos that I've been watching I guarantee you why
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:35.320]   Netflix says well who's watching and they have the different family members
[01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:38.200]   Right that's got to be one of the ways that they fight this
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:44.920]   There could be there's a whole romantic comedy in there looking you got male kind of thing where they meet each other because they're both sharing some third party pat
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:50.360]   Yeah, exactly why you like the same movies I do right now you like the same movies I do
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:58.040]   It'll be it'll be like an updated version of green card with jereau de pradu
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:02.280]   Where like they're they they're being sued now. They have to pretend to be a household
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:07.880]   Please demonstrate that no no we are a household and
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:12.040]   Here's a liar
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:15.240]   Ideas away for free. I know we just gave a whole movie
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:20.200]   This could you could put this on netflix about netflix it would yeah, there's a whole like circle there
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:22.600]   uh
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:28.520]   The you this is a article from last december that the liar leman in our chalam just passed along
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:35.640]   The uk's data privacy regulator his caution members of parliament about sharing work computer passwords
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:38.840]   uh apparently the
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:45.720]   This follows tweets by three conservative party MPs over the weekend claiming they provided staff with their access to their logon details
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:49.160]   Uh, that's probably more to explain the weird tweets
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:51.480]   right
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:56.520]   Nick bolls says I I share my password. I often forget my password and have to ask my staff what it is
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:01.080]   Anyway, don't share passwords. It's a security danger
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:03.320]   And
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:08.760]   Do you think that will ever be in a world in which we don't have to remind people that don't
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:13.720]   I know it's I know it's inconvenient that we lock the outside door to like the secure area
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:19.640]   But don't like stick a chair between the door and the door jam because you don't want to be bothered with the key
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:25.720]   Can we just I think I mean it's that old to be able to just say oh sure have my passwords
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:31.720]   That's fine. I think I think that we are two years away from every apple device having some version of biometric
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:35.480]   You know and you know and I think that I think that they're you know, they're slowly adding it to everything
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:37.080]   And I think that that'll be part of that
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:40.200]   You know google now is providing their hardware, you know externalized
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:43.240]   But I think the biometric is the answer to a lot of those things which is that
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:46.840]   You know eventually we're not going to be able to log into anything without biometric
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:52.600]   You know just because that's the way that you solve you solve a lot of this and especially as you start to move towards things like
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:55.000]   Online voting which west Virginia is going to be experimenting with
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.720]   You know like that's going to be you know, it's going to happen
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:01.400]   I mean it's not we can talk about whether it should happen or not but happen but within the next 10 years
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:03.400]   There'll be whole states that are doing
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:07.400]   You know online voting and that's the years Vladimir Putin becomes president
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:08.840]   States
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:13.800]   You know lunch at apple park says tim cook just got a lot more exciting
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:16.440]   We knew this was a feature of the apple park campus
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:22.440]   Those giant windows watching those pod paid with those pod bay doors. Oh can be slid open
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:27.240]   How many there may be three or four story tall glass windows on the apple cafe
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:30.360]   Is that where the shell of craft come out once the the donut goes into orbit?
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:32.520]   What are the other uses for that blimp hanger?
[01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:34.760]   All I can say is they have trees in there
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:36.760]   There's trees in sign
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:38.760]   Walking into the windows
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:44.280]   I could I could I could I the only thing I thought of immediately was that scene in the James Bond movie octopus
[01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:50.920]   Where there's a big chase and he's in this micro jet and he buzzes all the way through the two open doors of a half a hanger
[01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.040]   and
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:53.560]   Someone someone is hope
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:57.880]   Hope I I would like to think that the apple that I grew I fell in love with as a kid
[01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:01.960]   If someone asked for permission to try that stunt and got clearance and everyone
[01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:05.320]   There was a note memo saying everyone stay out of this
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:12.280]   This area because someone's going to try to buzz of actual airplane through I would like to think they'd at least consider it
[01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:19.480]   I think Tim shot this Jeff himself like just went out there with his iPhone and said okay everybody just pretend I'm not here
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:22.520]   No, serenity grabbed his camera and shot it for him. Yeah
[01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:27.880]   Yeah, we don't we don't serenity's not doing Tim Cooks social media is he we can't see her in there
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:30.680]   No, I don't let not unless Tim Cook is smart. Yeah
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:34.920]   That would be a good idea get Tim on roller skates
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:45.400]   Oh my god, I just I just thought that there I didn't think of this before but I now think there's at least a 55
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:51.240]   Chance that apple campus will have its own like roller derby league. Awesome within a year
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:53.320]   I know I know that she's gonna
[01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:57.720]   She I know that she would add it to like the the ad hoc like like fitness clubs
[01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:00.040]   And then there's going to be a
[01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:06.520]   The next the next the next uh the next uh buzz over drone photage is going to be of just a weird oval
[01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:09.160]   It should be a track all the way around
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:11.880]   Oval big it's nowhere on the whole yeah
[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:19.320]   I think you have but you could add bluetooth l.e. With accelerometers and you know a lot of things you could add a lot of uh extra data
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:22.280]   Uh the bond I blew iMac
[01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:25.080]   20 years old this week great
[01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:33.320]   rundown of pictures from ours technica and reviews and here's steve jobs introducing the new blue iMac
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:41.320]   It's been 10 months since a new management team took over at apple. This was his one of his first things really
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:45.400]   You can see a lot of cars in the parking lots and ice in the weekends
[01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:50.280]   So formal and because of their hard work, we're in a jacket that's a college shirt
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:53.240]   and
[01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:58.600]   I let me find the uh the review here
[01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:01.720]   Not much better and so
[01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:03.960]   When we run these ads
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:06.600]   They're very effective in our testing
[01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:11.720]   Oh, he's talking about the the switch ads right i'm a mac i'm a pc is that a different one
[01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:14.600]   And they're effective because they're true
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.840]   We miss steve's uh
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:19.640]   Reveals a totally new powerbook g3
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:23.080]   This thing has been redesigned from the processor to the keycaps
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:24.920]   Look at that remember that
[01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:30.760]   Old standard for portables out there. It is hot, but he also announced a new desktop computer
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:34.360]   About them pretty much universally the first is they're really slow
[01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:39.960]   They're very slow. They're all using last year's processor very very slow
[01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:44.440]   Second is they've all got pretty crummy displays on them. He's talking about generally
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:47.800]   Xbox pc and the quality of him is very poor
[01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:52.120]   Uh apple is on all its own displays so we're used to add features too later
[01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:53.560]   These are for that. Yeah
[01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:57.240]   Likely no networking on them some have it most don't
[01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:03.160]   Old generation IO devices and what that means is their lower performance
[01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:08.680]   Floppy discs what that what that means is IO that everybody uses for the peripherals. They already own
[01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:12.760]   Uh
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:14.760]   ugly
[01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:20.120]   Excuse me. I put wbc and stickers on my tower pc. It looked awesome
[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:21.720]   Let's do that. Uh, what's that?
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:26.760]   That we decided to put in a g3 processor running at 233 megahertz
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:31.160]   We debated this quite a bit because there were cheaper slower things we could have used and we said no
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:34.040]   This has got to be the computer that we want on our desk to
[01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:38.200]   A g3 running at 233 and we didn't forget the cash
[01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:40.840]   It's got a half a megabyte
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:47.800]   Backside cash and at this thing. Holy cats. How's a megabyte on displays? We said what is the largest display?
[01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:52.760]   That you'd ever want in one of these what is the largest you could ever want and the answer to us was
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:55.960]   A 15 inch display. Whoa
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:59.480]   10 24 by 76 stand back
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:04.680]   That's what it was like 20 years ago kids play engineers in dark aging so excited
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:07.080]   He didn't even have time to put a tie on
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:12.680]   He briefly flirted with this Canadian. Let's go ahead and put a lot of memory in this thing
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:18.600]   32 megabytes standard. It's expandable to 128 that was a big four gigabyte disk drive
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:20.680]   24 x CD rom
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:26.760]   For gigabyte disk and let's build in a lot of communications this thing's got a hundred megabit ethernet as standard
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:31.560]   Now why because a lot of our education customers want to work
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:34.840]   Because we're seeing it in homes
[01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:39.560]   Approximately 10 percent of the homes in silicon valley now have class five wiring in them
[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:42.600]   We're starting to see lots of home networks emerging
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:50.360]   A fast modem and also four megabit infrared built in you want to beam your digital photographs in from your digital camera
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:52.920]   Do we ever do that every product that ever happened
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:56.440]   Upon the new generation of IO
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:01.880]   12 megabit universal serial bus two ports. We're leaving the old apple IO behind
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:08.520]   stereo surround sound built into every product and a great great keyboard and mouse
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:11.240]   Uh a great keyboard. Yes
[01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:16.920]   This is what they look like today
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:23.720]   And I would uh like to take the privilege of showing you what they're going to look like from today on
[01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:26.520]   There he is ready to unveil
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:29.560]   Is iMac oh pretty
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:32.760]   Bondi blue
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:41.320]   All right, we don't have to watch the rest ours technica though has the entire video, which is awesome
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:46.520]   Uh some of the ads to say hello to iMac the three steps to set up the iMac
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.560]   Presenting three easy steps to the internet
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:52.360]   Jeff Gold one
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:54.680]   plug in
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:57.640]   Nice that that plug has an internet port by the way
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:01.080]   Get connect what is it's a phone jasmine step three
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:05.560]   There's no step for
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:07.560]   There's no step three
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:12.280]   Well kind of is if you want the keyboard and mouse to work, but we won't mention
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:20.360]   Uh, and then which is kind of fun ours has its reviews over the last uh 20 years, so that's fun
[01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:23.480]   Uh happy birthday 20 years old
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:26.280]   the iMac
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:29.240]   And that still is being made doesn't look quite the same
[01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:35.880]   All right, let's take a break come back with your picks of the week and I think we should get some plates and forks
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:38.760]   Because I think we should have cake
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:40.760]   Am I playing fork right now? Yes. No
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:44.520]   I'm gonna push it in your face
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:47.960]   Yeah
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:49.720]   All right
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:55.160]   Our show today brought to you by last pass. This is a probably the very first program I installed whenever I get a new device
[01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:59.560]   Uh as soon as I get the browser up and running I download last pass install it
[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:04.680]   It is how we secure all of the passwords. I secure all the passwords on my phone
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:08.840]   iPhone android my windows pc my macintosh of course
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:11.480]   What about your business?
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:13.560]   Are you talking about password sharing?
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:15.080]   32 percent
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:22.200]   According to one survey 32 of employees share passwords with others sure they do the rest have them on post-it notes on the screen
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:26.120]   You got to think about that when it comes to your business those MPs
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:33.720]   Should probably been using last pass last pass enterprise. It makes password sharing more convenient for employees
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:38.600]   But keeping access to corporate data secure and you completely control access
[01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:41.960]   Employees can share passwords with actually sharing the password
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:47.240]   They don't have access to change it if you set it up that way you could set master password requirements
[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:51.240]   Uh, you can enable password resets and control that completely
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:56.520]   We use last pass enterprise here and if somebody forgets their password, they don't just you know
[01:37:56.520 --> 01:38:01.480]   Reset it. They have to go to rustle our it guy and get it reset
[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:06.600]   You get over a hundred policies security reports shared folders
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:13.320]   Uh opt to organize logins for everything including not just websites, but databases ssh keys
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:18.120]   Software licenses our quickbooks believe me. That's the keys of the kingdom, right?
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:22.040]   We're not going to just let anybody have the password to our book a kit book keeping accounts
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:27.560]   But last pass makes it safe and easy for us to give employees access to revoke it when we need to
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:35.080]   Uh, it's really powerful and we also require multi-factor authentication with the last pass authenticator app
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:40.360]   Adopt verification button pops up on an employee's phone to guarantee they're the only ones with access to their account
[01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:44.440]   So you get your choice of multi-factor. I use you be keys for my personal last pass
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:49.480]   Even if credentials are not compromised through phishing attacks or malware when you use a second factor like this
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:55.320]   You don't risk your passwords the last pass password generator solves another big problem
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:59.240]   At home and at business where people just reuse the same password over and over again
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:03.320]   The generator makes it easy to create unique random passwords
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:05.560]   And you don't have to remember them last pass does
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:12.680]   And if you're a microsoft house, you'll love this employees can now log into their last pass accounts with their microsoft
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:15.080]   80 credentials
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:19.720]   So so now really you only have one password to remember your your active directory password and that's it
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:23.000]   Data is encrypted and decrypted at the device level
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.640]   Data stored in the vault is
[01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:29.400]   private and safe even from last pass they can't access it either
[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:38.200]   And for easy onboarding to password auto fill last pass makes it easy for businesses to take control of passwords and reduce the threat of breach
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:40.680]   We use it

[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:30.920]   Uh, let's get our picks of the week Alex. You got a pick for us today. I do
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:35.560]   Um, this one's actually a link to a friend of mine, uh in uh linked in
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:39.560]   Probably one of the most talented artists. I know
[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:45.720]   His name's koli wertz. He actually is a concept artist at lucas film and uh, I actually
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:52.440]   There was there was funny. There was these pieces of paper from an instructor that he had probably in 95 or six
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:58.440]   And it was like how to build certain kinds of of of blends in form z a long time ago
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:03.160]   And I remember that was like the holy bible of how to do all this so I got that from koli and
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:08.280]   But you know, he just kept on going. You know, I I you know, I got good enough. He he is
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:10.600]   um, and i'm just
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:13.240]   an amazing natural artist that's also super technical
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:21.080]   And what the reason i'm recommending it here is he does a lot of this on his iphone as ipad with his finger
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:26.920]   What so so when you you'll see like finger painting with um procreate is he uses procreate a lot?
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:30.760]   Um, but so when you look at a lot of these a lot of them are being
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:37.640]   Uh like done with his there you can see some some time lapses there where he's he's doing a lot of this a finger painting
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:41.800]   Uh in procreate on his ipad and so if you don't think you can do
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:45.880]   You can do art on your ipad. You should just watch this for just a little bit
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:50.760]   This is the only place he shares it is linked in he seems to I don't I don't know where else he puts it
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:55.320]   But he every day or two he it's worth following him on linked. Oh, you look you can watch him draw
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:59.320]   Yeah, he's you're just watching like an artist actually like work his way through
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:03.640]   Um drawing something that is amazing. So if you want to see what a star wars artist
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:07.160]   You know what you have to be able to do if you're a concept artist and look his film
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:14.040]   Um, this is a good sense, but he's probably again. He's one of the best i've ever i've ever seen so um, especially for what we call hard surface
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:17.480]   Stuff, um if you don't have a linkedin account you can create one for free
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:21.000]   I should mention linkedin is a sponsor, but that's not what I think mentioned. Yeah, yeah
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:25.080]   CEO and then once you oh you're like, holy words. I guess they posted in here
[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:28.360]   He has his own website too. So you can you can look at it there
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:31.240]   But just remember that I see it on linkedin when it goes by so
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:35.240]   Um, but yeah instagram collie words and then collie words.com
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:40.200]   And um, but you should you know, I follow him just to see what what i'm gonna be
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:45.160]   How am i gonna feel like oh, I can't do that but the next star wars movie might uh might have in it
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:49.240]   Well, it won't it won't have anything. It's this is all his own like just hit this isn't star wars stuff
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:52.440]   This is this is collie's like what he just he posts this on instagram
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:55.720]   This is what he does at lunch. Here's another like you know like like it's yeah
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:43:01.400]   Colye w er tz might be easier just yeah, it's on instagram. Look at these
[01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:08.040]   Wow and just this is a one. Yeah, this is like what he does at lunch and when he's like waiting for a doctor's appointment
[01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:11.560]   So that's the key to being a great artist right is just
[01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:18.760]   Continually draw. Yeah, just practice all the time. Yeah, and it's just um this is on an iPhone
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:21.400]   Yeah procreate on an iPhone
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:23.160]   Wow
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:24.360]   Yeah
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:30.200]   Maybe he'd want a pencil for the iPhone. He's he's uh, yeah, well, he does so much with his finger
[01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:34.520]   But I think that he definitely um, he's he's had a couple posts where he's talking about
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:37.880]   Um using the pencil and that he you know
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:42.280]   Here's one he did on a whiteboard while on hold with insurance company. Yeah
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:46.360]   So good
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:50.200]   Renee richy you pick of the week
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:53.960]   So I have uh two quick picks for this week
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:59.080]   The first one is the sell-out by quest leo is now available as of yesterday in pokemon go
[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:05.080]   What what so you can get the mythical pokemon sell-out by but you've got to do a whole bunch of different tasks to unlock it
[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:08.920]   So i'm busy posting a guide to all the tasks. I think in that article
[01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:11.880]   It's up to four should be up to six in an hour
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:14.680]   So because people are discovering the new tasks
[01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:17.080]   As as we speak
[01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:21.080]   Uh, so if you want to cheat not I really a cheat sheet, but if you want to get through it as fast as possible
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:25.800]   I have all the information you need to do it. I can't just do it sitting here in my chair
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:30.760]   No, you got to do certain things like you some of the slow like you got a ketchup pokemon every day for three days
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:34.520]   Which I think is niantic's way of stopping spoofers from just getting it in the first two hours
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:39.640]   Of release. Yeah, but there's a there's a few things in there. So we'll show up at some point in my
[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:43.880]   It should be there like when you launch the game. It'll be on the right when you do your tasks
[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:46.920]   You'll see professor willa will pop up with a ripple in time
[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:49.240]   Uh quest for you. Oh
[01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:52.120]   Yeah, and i'll just run into these
[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:53.960]   Yeah, you'll just get though
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:59.720]   It'll tell you to do certain things like uh walk an eevee for 10 kilometers and then evolve it at night to get an umbreon
[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:02.680]   And all those sorts of things. Oh man. I've done a few of those things
[01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:07.880]   Yes, so it's all there for anybody who wants it talking pokemon go kids just so you know
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:13.400]   The second one is not pokemon related second one is they announced two new hu lights
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:19.400]   And i'm a huge fan of hu and hu lighting and i have i think every existing kind of hu light imaginable
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:21.560]   So they went ahead and made a couple of new kinds
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:23.240]   one
[01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:26.840]   Basically one they're both sort of ambience on beyond sliding
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:29.240]   And they're meant for sort of your tv setup
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:35.000]   So you can put uh two of the standing lights on the floor on the desk and shine them against the wall
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:40.280]   And they'll just do that nice back effect. This is what i do with those domes shaped hues right now
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:43.240]   Yeah, i have a hu i forget what they're called
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:49.160]   Um sort of the previous generation on the other they are like little bull things and some people use the strips for this
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:52.120]   So you can get sort of dedicated lights and they also have
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:56.760]   Um horizontal ones that you can sort of put on the ground or put behind your television
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.440]   If you don't want the lights, they look like lightsabers. Yeah, yeah, they're two
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:03.640]   Yeah, the two standing ones are lightsabers the two bottom ones. I guess or I don't know
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:08.840]   Uh land mine something. I don't know, uh, but uh, they'll be available. I think um
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:11.720]   October they said end of october
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:16.440]   Uh, but they might be available for pre-order either and i'm definitely going to get a few sets of these and just
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:21.160]   They sound really cool. Yeah for them. This is yeah, this is great
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:24.520]   Uh, andy and echo have you a pick?
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:32.360]   Uh actually a tip. I got a tweet from somebody who showed me a picture of their apple watch with the screen popped off
[01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:33.400]   Yikes
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:35.400]   And asked
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:42.440]   Because of this or something, uh, like how do I approach apple about my now very sad series zero watch the face just
[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:47.080]   Delaminated while I was driving today, but hadn't delaminated clearly the entire screen had just
[01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:52.920]   Like popped off cartoon like and it looks very much as though the batteries swole
[01:46:53.400 --> 01:47:01.720]   Swelled up and caused this thing to pop off. Uh, so just a reminder that uh apple extended the warranty of apple watches by another two years
[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:03.880]   I think uh for swollen battery issues
[01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:09.560]   So if anything like this happens to you like the screen pops off or the screen breaks
[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:14.120]   But you don't know why or there seems to be now a gap in this in the case somewhere
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:19.160]   Uh, definitely take it back to the apple store because it's possible that they will fix it or replace it for free
[01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:23.480]   Because again, you don't know you don't know it but your watch is still under warranty
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:28.360]   That is also a really good piece of advice for pretty much any swollen battery issue for any device
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:33.160]   Because apple is very very very very very well motivated to make sure that any
[01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:39.000]   And any uh, lithium polymer batteries that are swelling to get them into a bucket of sand
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:42.520]   And out of the and out of the customer's hands as quickly as possible
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:46.360]   Uh, so as they wouldn't necessarily replace every single device no matter what it is
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:51.400]   But it's very very good idea to see what they'll do for you and also to make sure that you don't have a damaged battery
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:53.800]   Uh, and something that's going to cause even larger problem
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:57.000]   But in the case these watches you don't a lot of people don't know it
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:00.760]   But you air your watches are still under warranty because of this warranty extension
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:04.600]   Good news. Thank you for that tip andy
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:11.320]   Uh, and I want to mention because I you know throw boys in the chat room and he will be mad at me if I don't
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:17.800]   The new iconic pillow collection by throw boys available on kickstarter and it's a doozy
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:19.400]   He starts with the
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:27.320]   1977 apple 2 the 1984 mac and tosh the 1998 bond i blue iMac
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:34.680]   The original 2001 ipod and the 2007 original iPhone these are fairly big
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:38.600]   Pillows that'd be nice and they can get them all or get one
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:45.640]   But they are on kickstarter right now and he has by the way already exceeded his goal of $10,000
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:48.680]   By a little bit
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:52.600]   So it's not like it's not like he's hurting it. They'll definitely be made
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:59.480]   You know one of the coolest things I saw one of the coolest things I saw for sale at uh at that comic con a couple weeks ago
[01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:04.440]   What a full a full body pillow with the full body image of ron swansson
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:07.960]   Oh ron
