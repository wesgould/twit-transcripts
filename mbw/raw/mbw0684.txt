[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.600]   Apple. I am Mike Asargent, not Leo Laport, and Leo Laport is on vacation, but you know who's not on
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.120]   vacation. It's Renee Ritchie all the way from the Wiles of Canada, our pal from imore.com, as well as
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:53.520]   Vector, which you can find at imore.com/vector, which is a podcast and a video production and

[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.480]   Ritchie. Hi, Mike, and you made my original logo animation for me. Thank you so much again.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.440]   Oh, I was happy to do it. And those are Vector Orange headphones, aren't they?
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.800]   Yeah, and I've got a Vector Orange Pixel phone, so I'm all in today. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.280]   hold on. Now, when I signed up for this show, I thought this was about like Apple stuff. What's
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.800]   that Pixel doing in your head? No, I figured because Leo's not here, there's not going to be a surface,
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.440]   and there's not going to be at least 17 Android phones. So I have to do my part to make it up for
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.480]   speaking up. I don't have it with me, but I have started to become Captain two phones myself. I've
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.200]   got a one plus seven pro that I carry with me along with my iPhone. Nice. Yeah, so I've changed,
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.000]   Mike, I know I've changed what is going on. In fact, accusing me of changing is managing editor of
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.720]   iMore. It's Laurie, the awesome, possum, Gill. How you doing, Laurie? Hi, Mike. Oh, this is exciting.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.000]   I remember you when you were all Apple. I don't even know you anymore.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.040]   I remember you when we did the iMore show together, and this is feeling very iMore showy, and I'm
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.880]   loving it. I'm loving it. Yeah, me too. Let's throw back. It really is. We have a guest. No, no,
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:20.240]   wait, we're not doing the iMore show, so it's not a guest. WGBH Boston's Andy Anotko, Anotko.com.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:27.360]   Hello, Mr. Anotko. How are you today? Well, I'm not quite as my alum has been dampened somewhat to
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:34.000]   think that I've been sort of like demoted into guest mode. That's fine. I mean, it's
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I was going to compliment you on your lovely shirt and matching pocket square,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   and I wasn't even going to assume that you'd bought both of them as a set. It's because you're
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.840]   such a dapper Dan, I would have imagined that perhaps you bought the shirt like the shirt so
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.760]   much you went out and combed Alibaba or whatever to find a pocket square to match it, or even like
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.920]   just took the shirt to a tailor and say, could you cut a pocket square out of the back and I'll
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.120]   only wear it with blazers? Yes, see, that's why yeah, I got to keep the blazer on. I don't want to
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.920]   see you figured out my secret. Now, Andy, they put you right next to me so that I could do this
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.720]   as I make jokes about you being a guest or hug him or show. But then afterward, yeah, I get to go,
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:21.760]   oh, I'm sorry. I adore you and I am frankly the guest today and so honored to be joining you on
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:29.920]   Macbreak Weekly here today to talk about everything Apple. And you know, I started the day talking
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.000]   about iOS that we're going to get into that as well. There's there's so much to talk about. So
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.160]   why don't we go ahead and dig into it? In fact, this is a this is a news story that has been
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.200]   sort of front of mind for me recently. I've got I talked about this a little bit on
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.720]   Techno's Weekly, but I've got a couple of friends who are from mainland China originally have moved
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:00.640]   to the United States work here. And a friend who has has spent most of his life in in Hong Kong and
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.640]   considers himself, you know, citizen of Hong Kong and hearing the perspectives on those stories
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:15.440]   and seeing some of the American companies that are waiting pretty dog on deep into the
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:24.480]   um, appeasement of certain entities and the the censorship and things like that that are happening.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:31.200]   Uh, this this is getting interesting. And now we've got lawmakers who are saying Apple.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:38.880]   Uh, there's some censorship going on here that you're doing with with apps for the sake of of
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.600]   the Chinese government. And so I wanted to kick this off because I'm curious, you know,
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:50.800]   sort of the take from within as it were and hearing that in comparison to the perspective
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:57.600]   that I've had of folks who now live in the US but have the perspectives of both mainland China
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.720]   and Hong Kong and where that comes in. So Renee, what is what's going on here in terms of lawmakers
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:11.520]   talking about app censorship by that the behest of the Chinese government is the it's the quote.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.600]   Yeah, I'm I mean, I think it's important and obviously it weighs in because Apple is an American
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.800]   company and it has to do business under the regulatory influence of America. Um, but this is
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:29.280]   the same government that a couple of years ago wanted backdoor access into into iPhone. So I
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.800]   try to keep the politicians out of it as much as possible because I think they're just going to
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:40.320]   politic. Um, and I think the bigger concern for everyone is just how much influence China is able
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:47.360]   to exert over companies that are not in China and not by going through a regulatory process like in
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:53.680]   the US or in the EU. And I disagree with a lot of the EU decisions. Um, you know, and I think they
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.920]   they are trying to legislate well beyond their borders as well. But at least we have the semblance
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:04.000]   of of some sort of mechanism that we can participate in and try to influence. And with China,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.880]   there's none of that we just get, uh, you know, an article from an anonymous person in a state
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.920]   run newspaper that says, I, and you heard our feelings and the biggest companies in the world
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:19.040]   wheel about and dance. Um, and I think that's hugely concerning. And I'm not going to completely
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:24.960]   steal something that Andy Naco has been saying for years, but a lot of this stuff is like,
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.120]   there's some of the stuff is ludicrous. It's done in public. Like being upset at the NBA
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.440]   creates a Streisand effect. It's, it's theater. It's ridiculous. But it makes you wonder what's
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.720]   going on behind the scenes. And there are things I know just by virtue of having relationships with
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.720]   people in Apple and I can ask questions and get answers to them. But there's no public
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.920]   policy about, you know, what the U S government is asking for, what the Chinese government is
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:53.600]   asking for, what is the canary that tells us China is asking for backdoor access, like root access,
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.320]   or for security keys. Uh, you know, I like to think there are lines that aren't being crossed,
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.800]   but how do we know when those bridges are even being built? And that I think is the danger. I
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.400]   think there's a lot of hype because there's so many things happening in the news all at once,
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.480]   the NBA and Hong Kong and universities and all of this things are,
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.840]   to confluence of propel Apple into the news. But underneath that, I think are a lot of
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.960]   legitimate concerns that we just do not have very much insight into.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:29.040]   Yeah. And that, I mean, so, so Laurie, it seems like that is, is the, the reasonable approach to
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:35.200]   things to say that, you know, we, we don't quite have, especially this has been one of my concerns
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.920]   too, approaching this as an American and from my perspective and not having the inside track
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:45.520]   with the companies and things like that, where it's been very easy for me to sort of criticize
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:52.480]   things that I see as, as, you know, a right to, to free speech and all the things that are involved
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:59.520]   with that. It's just, I don't know how you feel about this, but when I see a company that, you know,
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.680]   it's very easy for me to sort of stand behind and say, Oh, look at the cool things that they're doing
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.600]   here, the products that they're making that I love, but also the, the things that they're doing for
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:13.440]   the environment and all of these positive things. And then to see this and see how it runs counter
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:19.760]   to what I think of a company and the people behind the company, that's where it's been kind of a
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:26.560]   bummer for me. Do you, do you feel that? What are your thoughts there? So yeah, so I, I think of this,
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.600]   what's happening currently with Hong Kong and with the Chinese government and, and all U.S. companies
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:37.840]   that are, they have, they're having issues with the whole subject. What I'm seeing, there's two
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:42.880]   things. First, there are that's the Chinese government that's trying to impose their rules and
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:48.080]   regulations within their own country. And I think global companies have to understand that and they
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:53.600]   have to do that. And this is something we definitely have zero understanding of, I don't own an
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.560]   international company. I don't know how that works and how to maintain the different laws and rules
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.880]   within each country. I know that they're trying to do that. All these countries are trying to do
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.320]   that. But where I see the fear coming in, and I've said this before, it's when the Chinese government
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:14.000]   is now trying to impose censorship here in the United States. That to me is the biggest,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.840]   the biggest thing for us to be afraid of right now. It's not whether or not, you know, an app is
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.880]   pulled from, from the app store in China because Chinese law says the app shouldn't be there.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:30.960]   It's when the Chinese government comes into the US and says, we don't like what you did here.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.720]   And so then the American companies apologize for it and change policies and do things differently
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:42.480]   because of it. This to me is where we're seeing the most frightening thing to come, which is
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.840]   censorship in the US because of finance, because we're allowing another country to tell us how
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:53.520]   we should or shouldn't do things. And that is a bigger beast, a demon than I think any other,
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.400]   what they do in their own country, we should impose or shouldn't impose our own views on that.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:03.920]   They are currently imposing their views on us right now by making these companies apologize
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:10.240]   for things that have been done or said against the Chinese government or in support of Hong Kong.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:19.440]   I think that's very well put. That's that these, it's sort of being brought to us, whether we,
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:26.000]   you know, kind of play a full role in it or not. And that's kind of been, again, my concern with this.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:34.480]   And we also have Tim Cook, it's a bit of an interesting tie in here. Tim Cook serving as the
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:45.440]   chairman at a Chinese business school. So I'm curious, Andy, like you are, you know, a full-on
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.640]   journalist and have that perspective. And I want to, well, I want to ask you, like,
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:57.920]   is this a matter of companies in the United States looking at optics and trying to do
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:05.680]   the right thing for their global business? Or is this sort of, it was just kind of a,
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:11.760]   at the wrong kind of time that Tim Cook announces or it's revealed that he's, you know,
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.200]   serving as chairman at this business school? Or is this like a piece, I mean, is this part of the
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:21.200]   appeasement? No, I would assume that this has been done sort of just, this is just the wrong time
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:27.440]   that it happened. It's, what I understand is that it's not like being named, like, it's not like
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.680]   being named CEO to the board of a company. It's not like being CEO of a company. This is something
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:38.960]   that this organization brings in CEOs for two or three year terms to, to advise, to advise the
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:44.160]   educational track to make sure the students are getting a global understanding of what the
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:50.880]   business markets are like. Whether that's, whether Tim has any real business doing that
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:58.640]   is up to debate. I don't see it as particularly harmful. However, it also underscores how, for me,
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:05.520]   it underscores how much, how many signs we have that Apple is willing to do what it, whatever it
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:11.360]   needs to do in order to keep its Chinese market happy, they are not giving outward signs of what
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:16.480]   they're willing to do to hunk off China. If they feel as though there's a line that they don't
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:23.120]   want to cross anymore. I mean, we're talking about, for now, the saving grace for Apple has been that
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:29.440]   every time that the Chinese government, the Chinese Communist Party has made a demand of Apple,
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:35.440]   they have made demands that only affect how Apple products behave within China and within what
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:41.040]   China believes as its immediate sphere of influence. So they can say, we can't have any
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:46.400]   VPN apps within that work within the Chinese App Store. And because they believe that
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:51.840]   their territories, their territories, they can also say, and you're not going to have a Taiwanese
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:58.880]   flag appear in emoji in these other two regions of the world. The problem happens when there,
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.920]   if you go into the App Store right now, you can get the voice of Tibet app, which is, which obviously
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:09.840]   China is going to have absolutely no part of and they would probably love to eradicate it if they
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:16.320]   could. What happens when China's, what happens if the Chinese government says that we are really,
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:22.960]   it really upsets us that you have this, you have this app that is so offensive, that is designed to
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:30.000]   be so offensive to everyone in China to remind us of the terrible, terrible history that has happened
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.360]   with this with this province. And so we would wonder why you would want to instigate us
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:42.320]   by having this app available to so many billions of iPhone users worldwide. What happens when that
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.960]   when that email happens when that editorial happens in a communist newspaper in China?
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:51.440]   Does Apple say, you're right, we're sorry, we're going to take that down. We feel, or are they
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:57.040]   going to point to, oh, well, we feel as though this is political speech and we say right here in our
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:02.640]   developer agreement, again, everybody, we're, we're not making a decision here. Our hands are tied.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:08.000]   We're using this. This is just developer guidelines that we're, we make everybody stick to whether
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.160]   it helps us preserve a $40 billion market or not. This is, this is what worries me. And I just,
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:19.360]   I don't, the clock is running out for Apple to make it really, really clear of what their role is
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:25.920]   on a global, on a global stage. And I'll just wind this up by saying that there is no more powerful
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:31.360]   tool for government to clamp the iron's tighter on its citizens than the phone that they voluntarily
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:36.240]   put in their pockets every single day. And all they have to, all the government has to do is simply say,
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:40.960]   we need to have this surveillance app that's created by the government that has to be installed,
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:48.080]   pre-installed on every phone you ship in our territory. And that's when that's when every
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:54.720]   single person gets tracked to a degree, even far, far beyond the ratio of a security camera,
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:00.480]   of video cameras to citizens in places like Shenzhen. This is the, we know what, but we know what
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.960]   their playbook is, particularly in China, particularly if you are a Muslim in China.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:11.920]   And you wonder if this is just practice for softening up the entire citizenry,
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:18.160]   for expecting that you are going to have to be, prove how trust, how trustworthy you are,
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:23.760]   and how harmonious you're going to be with the rest of our society here. And if you are,
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.200]   then of course we can give you extra benefits. If you're not, we're going to have to, well,
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.600]   we can't trust you, we can't trust you. That's the sort of stuff that could really, really easily
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:36.160]   be happened. But just by simply having a leader saying, by the way, here is the official app,
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.960]   is going to have to have it on every single phone. And by the way, Apple, by the way,
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.800]   every single other phone maker that wants to have an app store within our country,
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.880]   you have to be able to have, we don't care what your app development guidelines are,
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:53.680]   we have to have hardware permissions all the way down to the metal for everything we want to do
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:59.840]   with this phone. I just want some assurance that while Tim is saying all these positive things about
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:06.080]   being a global presence and being good for everybody, and also being good to our partners in China,
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:12.160]   that they are going to be good corporate citizens and not create chaos wherever they step.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.680]   >> That's my big concern.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.480]   >> Go ahead.
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.200]   >> I was going to say there's two things I think that are a couple of things that I think are
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:23.120]   worth elaborating on there. One is that, because of the current sensitivity, a lot of stuff that
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:27.680]   would just be normal course of business is getting amplified. I believe that university has a
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:33.120]   ton of US CEOs on it, and they all take turns being chairman. If I was Tim Cook right now, I'd say,
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:38.480]   "Oh, Zuckerberg, you can have this next three years. Call me in like six. Maybe I'll have time to
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:43.120]   throw this in." New iPhone launches. Can't do it right now. Really honored to be at.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:49.840]   But that was just his turn out of all the CEOs that are on that list. The other thing is that,
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:55.200]   China again is this super obvious one, but we've seen backdoor legislation passed in Australia.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.600]   France is asking for the same kind of data localization that China is asking for.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:04.640]   We've seen Cook try to engage with the Trump administration in a song and dance that might
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:10.720]   just be every bit as nimble as with some of the Chinese authorities. He has this relentless
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:15.760]   pursuit of engagement. And I've said before, my worry is that engagement eventually becomes
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:20.880]   a piece mint. But there are so many things going on on that stage that to me, it's not a China
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:26.720]   issue. If Apple is willing to fight over backdoor access in the US, that's got to be global. And
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:32.240]   if they're willing to withhold security keys from France and China, that's got to be global,
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.960]   because eventually everyone or places we don't even think about right now are going to ask for that.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:41.760]   And I'm old enough to remember when BlackBerry installed Squid Servers for Singapore and a bunch
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.160]   of other countries so that they could eavesdrop on everybody's BBM messages in Blackberry
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:53.120]   didn't leave the market. They just did it. So all this stuff keeps happening. And I agree with
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.920]   Andy completely, we need white papers to describe the technology. And then we need clear guidance
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.560]   on the policies. Otherwise, we'll never know what's happening.
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:07.840]   That's I mean, that's been my biggest concern with all of this is once you start making these
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:13.200]   changes, where does it continue to go? Because speaking specifically to something that Andy
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:19.360]   had mentioned earlier, one of the there was an app that helped protesters in Hong Kong track
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:28.240]   where police were last seen. And the app was criticized by the Chinese government for enabling
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:35.360]   violent protesters as the sort of party line is. And they said,
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:42.400]   by Apple being a part of that, by Apple providing this app store that happened to have this app in
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:50.400]   it, then maybe the company was complacent with violence. And so just through that recognition,
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:55.920]   it's guilt by association there that guilt, whether it's there in the first place at all.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:03.440]   And that's my concern is, like you said, then suddenly Apple making a device that has encryption
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:08.640]   that doesn't allow police to be able to get into a protesters phone.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.080]   Does that mean that they're complacent too? Does even how far does it go from there?
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.640]   >> And it's difficult when they this is why it really disappoints me when Apple again,
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:23.360]   there should be a version of the Apple logo available only in Cupertino, where it's just
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:29.120]   wrists that are bound with the Apple in a nice like Johnny Ive sort of handcuffs.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:34.880]   Ooh, look at that. We have app guidelines and we have no choice but to take this app down,
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:41.200]   because then I talked about that timing. Google finally added the feature. They bought
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.920]   Waze app a few years ago. They're finally adding one of its most useful features,
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:51.840]   which is, by the way, Johnny Law is about two miles up the road there. So if you might want to
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:57.040]   check your speed and not be caught in the speed trap, and of course law enforcement is really
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.960]   mad about this because they're saying, well, this is going to let people, drunk drivers will be
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:06.560]   able to avoid checkpoints and making really weird arguments about, well, if they know the cops are
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:11.600]   there, then they're going to ambush the cops and stuff like that. But now if you were in a
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:17.920]   particularly puckish mood and you're concerned about all this, you would basically want to say,
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:25.200]   oh, Apple, we're glad that you took down that Chinese app to protect Chinese people from these
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:30.240]   lawbreakers. Won't you do the same thing for us in America and take down the Waze app?
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:35.360]   I'm sure if you can have a long protracted fight with Google over this, nothing bad will happen.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.920]   And then see if they say, oh, well, I guess our handcuffs aren't that tight after all. We can
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:47.360]   sort of shimmy out of them because of this land of longitude or whatever. So this is why I really
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:58.320]   wish that they would have just like when Steve Jobs posted a public letter on an issue that was
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:04.560]   important to him, i.e. the defective antennas on the iPhone 4. It's okay to simply say, this is me
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:08.640]   in my own voice. We're not going to make this as a marketing thing. I'm just saying, here are the
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:14.160]   reasons why we do the things we do. Here's why we made this decision in this case. And it's
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:18.560]   sometimes you really do have to be honest about why you, a trillion-dollar business,
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:24.240]   have to do things that you as an individual, not a billionaire individual, but still as an
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:29.440]   individual may or may not agree with. So which is not to say that I'm still going to agree with
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:35.680]   what they do, but at least we know that they're not hiding behind. Oh, no, we know that these
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:43.920]   millions of people are just disappearing, but oh, gosh, you know, we would like to like not comply
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:50.400]   with the law that makes this government able to track people who have this letter sequence in
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:55.280]   their names. But again, we're just complying with local laws. Gosh, wish we could do something about
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:01.200]   that. You can, because you can decide not to, like Tony Stark, you can decide to no longer
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:06.400]   manufacture weaponry. That's always your choice to do. If you're not going to do that, if you're
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:11.520]   not going to fight this fight, it's okay for you to say that this issue is important to us, but it
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:18.880]   is not that important to us that we're willing to act upon it to interfere with this particular
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:27.920]   action. Now, do we have precedent there? Has anyone ever said that? Yes, this is a problem,
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:32.480]   but it's not enough of a problem that we're not going to keep making apps and continue to give
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.160]   the government there what they want. That doesn't seem like something that any company's
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:41.440]   going to do. Google obviously did it in 2011. They basically said not because
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:48.480]   not only was China asking for hooks into their search engine, but also they had recently been
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:55.360]   caught tampering with emails and industrial espionage. Google at that time in 2011 said,
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.040]   okay, guess what? We're not going to be part. Guess what? You don't get the Google search engine.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:03.760]   You don't get the Google Play Store. You don't get Google Maps, which is why there's some of
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:08.720]   their biggest competitors worldwide are now the services that sprung up in the absence of Google.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:14.480]   And I think that choice might have influenced what these other companies are doing because
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:19.680]   you're going to have to fight with these locally homegrown apps, these homegrown services that
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:25.600]   were created by Chinese citizens who grew up in the infrastructure and the system that they've
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:33.760]   grown up with. They understand the ins and the outs. It's a lot more subtle than I can possibly
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:38.560]   understand. It's not that, oh, well, gosh, those poor Chinese citizens under the yoke of tyranny.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:42.240]   It's like, no, they're things that you can do. They're things you can't do. They're things that
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:46.800]   that they don't officially approve of, but they're not going to chase after you unless you cross
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:51.680]   this line right here. So they have the ability to create these competing message services and
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:58.560]   search services and cloud services that can be absolutely have the four star rating from
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:06.240]   the Communist Party while still allowing these companies to create services for locals and
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:10.240]   having that knowledge in that market share makes it even more difficult now for Google to get back
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:15.360]   into there for message services to get back in their message message services that have been
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:21.040]   there forever now. They're having such a hard time competing because they don't know how to work
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:28.400]   into in this specific environment. So but so but and I also have to say even though I think that
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:33.360]   Google should be praised for making that decision in 2011 because even in 2011, it was understood
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.520]   exactly how big a market this was and what they were what they were turning down.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:44.720]   I'm not so sure that in 2019, if they had if they had the success of the Google services and
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:50.400]   store and search engines and they were had to face the sort of decision that Apple has to make,
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:55.120]   which is to not only turn off the taps of knowing exactly how many billions of dollars they're
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:02.320]   making every year, but also having to hugely disrupt their company and not being able to
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:06.560]   manufacture the risk that they're going to honk off the government so much that's going to become
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:12.400]   much much more difficult for them to manufacture in that country. And few companies are as few
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:18.240]   companies Apple scale are as dependent upon Chinese manufacturing at this point than Apple is. So
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:25.280]   I'm not suggesting this is simple stuff, but the basic the basic concept I think is very simple that
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:30.800]   there is right there is wrong. If you're going to be on the side of something that most people
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.960]   would consider to be ethically questionable, you have to own that you have to explain why
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:41.200]   I'm making this decision. And you also really can't open up your keynote by saying how much you love
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:46.080]   freedom. And isn't it too bad that Facebook and Google don't love freedom and privacy as much as
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:52.720]   you do because that's again question hello question question. Hi, Eddie, not go to WGVH Boston. I have a
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:59.440]   question. That's yeah, that's where you throw in that. Okay, let's take a look at that.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:06.240]   Totally fair. Well, I think we this is something that we're going to continue to be watching,
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:14.000]   frankly, because I think that we are can there's a list I saw a list I think is on Reddit of all of
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:21.600]   the American companies that have been making these different concessions. Yeah, if you notice
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:26.720]   movies, Michael, like you go to a movie and it says, and then and then Tom Cruise can't wear the
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:31.520]   Japanese or the Taiwanese flag on his back. Yep, yep. It's isn't that incredible? So that was
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:35.840]   another thing that I didn't know until that they compare the jackets of Tom Cruise's character and
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:40.000]   Top Gun in the original, which has a time when he's flagged in the back of it. And then the same
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.240]   thing that he wore for the for the for the sequel, which now does not is the supposed to be the same
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:50.080]   jacket, but it doesn't. And the reason why you have the reason why you have like Marvel makes a
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:56.240]   makes a Doctor Strange movie and suddenly the the ancient one is a white woman. Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:03.920]   Not that not that the the 30 year old white Jewish guy who wrote the character in the 60s
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:10.080]   was necessarily culturally accurate and sensitive, but it's like, that's an interesting choice.
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:15.040]   I'm sure it was character driven. And poor poor Winnie the Pooh as well.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:22.000]   Winnie the Pooh gets a lot of flack as well. So they yeah, there's there's a whole thing. We're
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.880]   gonna, like I said, I think we will continue to see American companies making moves there.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:34.240]   Let's go ahead and move on to digging into I wouldn't call this tea leaves per say. This is more
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:46.000]   unearthing rare treasures. This time, this time we unear the rare treasure of an icon that allegedly
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:57.440]   sorta kind of looks like it is a 16 inch MacBook Pro. And so this little icon in comparison to
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:04.800]   the standard 15 inch MacBook Pro has some changes to the keyboard maybe.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:12.720]   And the bezels. And of course, yes, of course, the bezels. The war on bezels continues. I saw an
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:17.760]   animated image on Twitter, which is what I call them so that no one can criticize me from my
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:25.920]   pronunciation of the sort of ifs. We love you, Micah. You're in a place of safety and love.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:30.080]   Well, then I'm gonna have to get happy here. You don't want to have what they're called, which is
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:36.080]   Jiffs. I thought they were. I think I have to chase my bliss, which is calling them Jiffs.
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:44.880]   But any point is, is this the 16 inch MacBook Pro that Leo is very sad was not announced before he
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:49.040]   took off on vacation so that he could have it with him on a. There are so many gadgets that he
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:53.280]   didn't get in time for his vacation. It's almost like they didn't care properly for his departure.
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.680]   Yeah, or he didn't prepare properly for his departure.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:02.240]   I think it's pixel in time, didn't get his MacBook on time. Yeah, isn't that bad? But what do
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:08.720]   what does this show that I mean, it doesn't show anything first of all, but there are just by
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:12.880]   looking very closely, you can see a slight indentation of an escape key, Micah. Don't take that away
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.480]   from me. You're right. You might have started. I know how important it is for you to be able to
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:20.720]   escape. I don't care. I don't care if it's a lie. It's a beautiful lie. And until it's released,
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:25.520]   and I, but I, this lie will give me so much property. I can't tell if the arrows are an inverted
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:33.360]   T that I need that as well. Where's let's see. Let's see. Zoom and hands. Hey, wait a minute. Hold it there.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:39.920]   No, I'm kidding. I mean, what do we know about this 16 inch MacBook Pro? What do we know?
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:48.240]   It's just play 15 inch chassis, new keyboards, scissor switches, supposedly has an inverted
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:53.680]   arrow inverted T arrow layout. It's almost like a reversion of the keyboard with a with a
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:58.880]   regression on Kube. Well, going back to older keyboards, we're going forward on more modern
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:05.600]   designs. Yeah, I'm the most interesting thing about that device for me on the rollout is just
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:12.960]   going to be, is Apple going to comment on a what would be a revolutionary change to the keyboard?
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.480]   Do they feel is that they don't need to rip open? They don't need to flage,
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.240]   lay themselves and rip open their shirts and where itchy will sweaters for the rest of their year.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:25.360]   But it'd be interesting if they say, yes, obviously, when they have that
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:31.360]   into that list of features that they've added, do they say, and we have a new scissor based keyboard
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:37.120]   comma you babies, or are they going to say, plus we have a revolutionary new low prop. We were able
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:42.720]   to take everything that was great about our super low profile keyboard and add the tactile
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:48.560]   field that everybody we feel as though this is the best keyboard that's ever been put in a laptop.
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:52.000]   Fine, you get a scissor switch. You want bumpers, you get a scissor switch.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.040]   Guess what? I don't think they say anything. I think we went on eBay,
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:02.160]   I'm a little bit over a bit. IBM Selectrick from 1971, we could, we gave you like a keyboard with
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:08.080]   like a two inch throw per key. And now the laptop is a foot deep and it weighs 90 pounds and you're
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:14.480]   going to rush out to buy it because that's all you ever wanted was it. We worked so hard on that,
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:20.480]   every part of it. So I think that if they're making, if they're going to have an event to
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:27.040]   announce the new MacBook Pro, they have to address a different keyboard in there. But if they just
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:31.200]   sort of roll out some press releases and we have to scramble to figure out what the heck is different,
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:36.560]   that's when we won't see any kind of announcement about it and we'll have to wait for, you know,
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:40.160]   I fix it to tear it down or something like that to find out for sure what kind of
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:46.560]   keyboard mechanism isn't in it because they definitely don't want to, you know, eat their hats or eat
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:56.400]   crow or whatever one of those old things. They don't want to, but I definitely think they can't
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:02.640]   avoid it when they're talking about it and they're talking about the changes to the new MacBook
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:09.360]   Pro. If there's a significant change to the keyboard, they can't just not say that. That's a big deal.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.440]   It was a big deal when they switched over.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:16.640]   If we look back at how they handled the Mac Pro, they didn't like go up on stage with the new
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:22.080]   Mac Pro and say all the problems with the previous Mac Pro, they handled that like two years earlier
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:27.760]   and like a low-key three-person tetta-tette in a cappuccino lab and that got all that out of the way.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:34.560]   And then they got to talk about like the brand new Mac Pro. And I'm guessing that if we don't,
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:39.040]   like there's no October event, but if we don't get even a small event later in the year, if it
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:43.920]   really is handled differently, I can't imagine them getting up on stage and talking about that
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:48.960]   keyboard, let alone for half an hour. So I can imagine a world where they're up on stage for half
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:53.600]   an hour talking about how bad the old keyboard was. No, but it's not addressing
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:34:00.800]   I think I don't think they'll miss an award of it. There's a difference between admitting that
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:05.600]   they were wrong about the old one, which I don't think they would do ever. But there is something
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:10.720]   to be said for what we're doing now with the keyboard is. And you know, it's not going to be
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:16.080]   just a complete back to the original keyboard mechanism. They've probably done some version
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:21.840]   of a hybrid and that's how they'll posit it is. This is a combination of the butterfly and this
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:27.440]   is your mechanism. And here's what's great about it this time is, and that way they're getting to
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:34.240]   tell us we've gone back to the previous keyboard mechanism without admitting defeat.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:41.360]   We have a new material for the keycap and we've precision engineered it to fit even better in
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:47.120]   the unibody design. And then they'll show the scissor. They'll show the scissor mechanism on the
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:50.640]   screen. Yeah, just like it's not a butterfly wings around it.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:58.000]   AR. If that's the graphic on the invites that's get sent out, then we'll know we've got
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.960]   the kind of confirmation. But yeah, they don't have to beat themselves up. They just have to fix
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:08.960]   the problem. And so I'm sure they're not going to say there's not going to be a big cardboard
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:13.840]   coffin in which they put a point five eight millimeter key travel keyboard in there.
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:19.040]   That said, it's I'm sure that part of what they're going to do is that a certain number of people
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:24.000]   that have been very, very well selected and targeted for their audiences are going to get like
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.960]   NDA briefings in which they do get the entire story from start to finish on background so that when
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:36.960]   they talk about this keyboard, they can put across the message on the download that they can't put
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:44.080]   front and center on an 8k screen behind them at an apple park. So it's just too bad.
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.080]   AR. One thing in her butterflies in early.
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:54.800]   It's too bad. I really, I think that Apple has a whole bunch of fascinating stories about
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:59.840]   engineering and design and bring the product to market and not bringing a product to market.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:05.440]   It's just too bad that you have to probably just be it in Apple University inside Apple to get those
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:10.560]   stories. There's so much that could be taught so much that people could learn and even just for
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:15.680]   the civilians, they're just buying their products. So entertaining to know that this is how much
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:19.760]   that they they don't just simply say, Hey, let's let's let's get everybody mad by giving them a
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:23.920]   terrible keyboard that is that many of them are going to find really hard to type on and it's going
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:29.760]   to cause a lot of them to fail. It was here is why we felt so strongly about this radically
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:35.120]   different design. And we had so much faith and so much confidence in it. And yes, there were and
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:40.160]   which is not to say that there wasn't fear there weren't fierce arguments inside about whether we
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:44.400]   should use this or not. I just it's too bad that none of those stories are coming out or if they
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.840]   come out it's going to be 10 years after certain people decide to leave Apple.
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:56.160]   Now, Renee, you we were just razzing you the other day due to a keyboard issue. And you said you
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:00.640]   were holding out instead of replacing the keyboard you were holding out. Is this going to be your
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:10.400]   go to this this 16 inch? Yeah, so I originally had a 17 inch MacBook Pro and back when I was working in
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:17.520]   enterprise design and it was great, but it was so heavy. I just left it. It was a pseudo desktop.
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:21.120]   And I quickly as I started doing trade shows and having to travel to events and things,
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:26.000]   I worked my way down to a 13 inch MacBook Air. And then when I had to start doing videos,
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.480]   I went to the 13 inch MacBook Pro and then that started being too slow and I went to the 15 inch
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:34.960]   MacBook Pro. But if they can get a 16 inch screen, like I'll take the biggest screen they can put
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:39.680]   in a device that I can still carry around for like on a trade show floor for like 18 hours and not
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:46.160]   want to kill myself. That's that would be ideal for me. I actually like I said before, I love this
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:51.120]   keyboard. It just it's failure rate is unacceptable. And it doesn't seem like they can actually fix
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:55.280]   this keyboard. So I'll take the new keyboard and I will not judge it until I've used it because I'm
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:38:00.080]   fairly flexible when it comes to keyboards. So that'll just be icing on a cake for me.
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.560]   Renee, that's one of the things that I wanted to talk to you about because this is something that
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:10.320]   you often bring up and it holds true for me. Our brains are plastic, not literally plastic,
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:15.520]   but they have the property of the plastic, meaning that they can they can change and adjust. And so
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:25.120]   we get used to new things and we can get re get used to old things. And I have work a MacBook Pro,
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:31.840]   15 inch MacBook Pro with touch bar, work on computer. I also have a 15 inch MacBook Pro from
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:38.800]   what 2015 or 2016, whenever. And the keyboards are very different between these two
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:45.200]   and your brain's a jerk about it, right? Yeah, it will get used to this new butterfly mechanism.
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:49.440]   And then I go back and I'm like, wow, these keys are really squishy. Yeah, on that. And then
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:54.080]   that feels normal. And you go back and the other one suddenly feels too tight. Precisely. And so I
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:39:00.320]   am not a clicky keyboard aficionado. I'm not, you know, I don't need cherry
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:08.320]   bomb switches with cream sickle accents and I don't know bubblegum switch tops and all that stuff.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:14.400]   I don't need that stuff. And so for me, whether I'm typing on this 15 inch MacBook Pro with touch
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:20.160]   bar or I'm typing on my iPad, pros, smart keyboard or whatever, it doesn't make much of a difference
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:27.280]   to me, except if a tiny little crumb underneath the this underneath the keyboard renders it useless.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:31.840]   That's the only thing that matters to me. Like the key travel doesn't. And so from my perspective,
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:36.560]   which again, I understand is not, you know, it's my perspective is not everyone's perspective.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:43.040]   But all I need is just a reliable, I think the reliable keyboard is what's important to me and
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:47.680]   where I understand the complaints that people have, they should be able to have a reliable
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:54.560]   keyboard to use and not have to worry about. Yeah, I had pro keyboard and it's great.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:59.200]   It's totally different, but I love it. And I can use different keyboards. They just have to work.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.720]   And that's super mushy. So mushy.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:08.640]   But I have a 2016 MacBook Pro, the very first one that they made with the touch bar,
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:14.960]   the very first one that they made with these mushy keys. And I years, years later, it was,
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:21.840]   I think maybe two, a year and a half ago, is when I started noticing that the keyboard was acting
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:26.800]   a little funny, and I put it off and put it off and put it off. And I eventually, just within the
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:30.880]   last few months took it in, I had to take it in twice because the first time they just blew it out
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:36.320]   with some air to see if that would fix it. And it didn't, I brought it back in,
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:43.600]   they fixed the problem. It went really smoothly. But the problem I had with it was not, it was great.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:48.000]   The service was great. They were really friendly, took care of it really quickly.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.200]   But what a pain in the butt it was for me to just make that appointment and go in and have it taken
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:58.960]   care of, even though it was quickly, it was done quickly. So I can see why people would be holding
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:04.640]   off on buying a MacBook Pro right now under the fear that they might have a keyboard that would
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:10.080]   mess up. Even though there's this great keyboard fix program that takes care of it,
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:16.240]   it's such a pain to just have to do it at all. I could see why people would hold off until,
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:22.320]   let's wait until there's a better keyboard mechanism that isn't going to just crumble under my crumbles,
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:29.040]   if you will. So yeah, it's really just no matter how easy they make it or how comfortable it is,
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:35.680]   or they do it for free and it lasts for so long, it's still just an issue of getting into that
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:40.240]   store with your keyboard, having them look at it, having them clean it out, having them replace
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:44.560]   the key, whatever they do, that's too much work. I don't want to do that. I want to buy my computer,
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:50.080]   take it home, open it up, and for the rest of my existence with it, it works. It doesn't fall apart
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:55.680]   three years later, it doesn't get something stuck under it, and then some genius says,
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:59.440]   "Well, it's because you're eating toast while you're using your computer while I'm going."
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:04.640]   Really, because I think that it's because there's something wrong with this keyboard that Apple
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:09.680]   doesn't want to admit to. I had a toast party on my old keyboard, okay? It was fine. I could set
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:15.760]   down one of those really crunchy granola bars on my old MacBook Pro. I had croutons. I had a
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:20.480]   mouse on its tap dans on it, and everything was still fine afterward. But this one,
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:26.480]   I can't even sneeze in its direction. Our target market for this laptop is for people who like to
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:36.400]   regard computers, especially 3,000-dollar ones, as static design objects. The deluxe version
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:40.800]   comes with a free $300 Chromebook for actually doing your writing and working on. That way,
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:45.520]   you don't get fingerprints on the nice one. Yeah, it sits to the side. You do your work there,
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.720]   then you can look back at this one every once in a while and go, "Oh, how lovely."
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:55.200]   Look at the bezels. Look at the chamfer on that edge. Not chamfer to edge, though.
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:43:04.080]   Oh, my goodness. Well, speaking of lovely, I am excited. Oh, thank you. Oh, yes. I am excited.
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:09.120]   I did trim my beard. I have my sideburns today. I'm glad you noticed. I was going to
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:14.240]   pick a thing about it, but one does like it. In the words of the immortal Kesha,
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:19.760]   I like your beard. I'm going to do... Kesha is a very nice person. Andy and not go,
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:27.120]   WGBH Boston, we are excited. Or I am excited. Not we. I am excited to be here hanging out with you.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:33.440]   But I'm also excited to tell you all about Hover. Hover is the place to go
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:40.480]   to register domains quickly and easily. And in fact, while we were talking, I went ahead
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:45.680]   and registered crowshat.com. That's right. Eat your crowshat at crowshat.com.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:51.520]   At some point, that will start forwarding to the Mac Break Weekly page on Twitch.
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:57.040]   But I went ahead and scooped up crowshat.com. Thank you, Laurie Gill. I'm sorry that I beat
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:04.880]   you to it. But that's how fast and easy Hover is. I was able to talk about all the keyboards
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:09.520]   and make jokes about sneezing in its way and still register a domain super fast. In fact,
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:17.200]   it's got Apple Pay folks. So it was easy to go in and make that order, type it in, find what I was
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:25.360]   looking for, and get that paid for in no time flat. In fact, Hover is a great way to service
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:29.520]   sort of a jumping off point for folks who are looking to start a new business for entrepreneurs.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:34.400]   It often starts with the name of a thing. So in this case, crowshat, which is going to be my bespoke
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:43.120]   bird hattery that I'm launching. And obviously crowshat.com is where I will be kicking that off.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:49.680]   But a domain is the best way to get started with a business because it shows everybody what you
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:57.040]   are trying to put out there. Hover has over 300 domain name extensions to choose from.
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:04.800]   So you don't just have to go with the traditional.com. You can go with .ca or .co, which is one of my
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:10.880]   favorites if you want to get clever, or .design. If you're a designer or a creative professional,
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:16.880]   .design is a great thing instead of .com or .biz or .org because it's telling you everyone exactly what
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:22.960]   you do. They know that, hey, you are some sort of creative professional, some sort of designer,
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:28.240]   and it's a fantastic way to sort of point things out without having to put it all on the first half
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:33.520]   of your website. It can be right there at the end.design. You're going to find excellent technical
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:38.720]   support available to answer your questions if you have any. So, you know, that I have really never
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:44.000]   had to contact Hover's technical support because they make it so easy to get signed up and make
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.800]   it so easy to plug in and get exactly what you want, whether it be forwarding or something like
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:53.360]   that. It's all there. It's all super simple and easy to use. But if you need it, they're there,
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:57.920]   and they're going to make sure that they're getting you the help that you need. Hover has free
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:02.880]   who is privacy protection. That is so important. You don't want to be able to have someone go
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:08.240]   and look at your domain and then be able to find out your address, find out your email,
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:12.560]   find out your phone number, find out those things. It's free. They're not upselling you on that
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:17.040]   privacy. They think that that is an important thing to have right off the jump. So, when I go
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:21.600]   and register crows, when I went and registered crows hat.com, I don't want people to know my address.
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:26.160]   I don't want people to know my email. That's all locked away for free. Whereas, some other
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:30.960]   domain name providers will charge you extra for that. It's a clean and easy to navigate
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:37.200]   you user interface and the user experience, like I said, is super simple. And they have sales all
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:43.040]   the time on popular top level domains. In fact, there was .online was an option for crows hat,
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:46.960]   which I went ahead and grabbed the .com version. But if I had wanted the .online, I think it was
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:52.240]   like $2.99 for a year. That's ridiculous. They've always got excellent prices.
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:57.200]   By ridiculous, I mean the good kind of ridiculous. That is ridiculous. It's not hard to see why
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:01.840]   hover is a popular choice for people, including me who has way too many domains that I don't use,
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:08.640]   including my horrible error of registering slofy.net and slofy.org spelled with a pH instead of an F,
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:15.920]   because I am a fool. So that's always there. But those were pretty inexpensive options that I was
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:20.480]   able to get quickly and easily. And it was a popular choice for me then and still a popular
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:26.800]   choice for me now. Keep your domain name separate from your hosting. You have a place where you go
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:31.840]   and you edit your site and you put it all together and you make it look pretty. But you want to keep
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:36.800]   that separate from your hosting so that way you have the flexibility. You can switch to a different
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:42.080]   platform very easily. If you decide one day I want it to point to my Tumblr site and the next day
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:47.760]   I want to launch a Squarespace website, then your domain is separate and easily transferred
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:54.160]   between the two. It's pretty great for that as well. Like I said, I've got several hover domains
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:58.640]   that get renewed every year. I always get the notifications right before. Think about three months,
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:03.200]   two months, one month, and then it comes through. I'm like, yeah, I think I'll keep the auto
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:07.440]   renewed turned on for those. And there have been a few times where I've let them lapse because they
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:12.240]   were not worth the joke anymore. But hover makes that super easy to do whether you want to have
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:15.920]   the auto renewed turned on or off. So they're not upselling you there either. You don't have to call
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:22.800]   and say, hey, I don't want this site anymore. Please. It's all right there in the UI. Simple to flip
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:28.320]   those switches. You can use a domain name that truly represents you and your passion by visiting
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:34.560]   hover.com/twit. And that's going to get you 10% off your first purchase of any domain name
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:43.040]   extension for the entire first year. That's hover.com/twit for 10% off your domain name extension for a
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:49.680]   full year. And of course, thank you to hover for your support and for the newly registered crowshat.com.
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:58.720]   We do appreciate it. Now that I have that, I can brag about it for the next two days. And then I
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:02.240]   will forget about it for a little while. And then hover will say, Hey, it's time to renew that domain.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:08.080]   I'll be like, that was a good joke. I had a good time with with Andy, Lori, and Renee that day.
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:16.720]   That's good. So this one of the things that I have been hearing a lot about because we've got the
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:26.240]   U1 chip in the iPhones, people are getting very into nerds at least are getting very into talking
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:31.920]   about what the U1 chip can provide for the future. And something that folks are talking a lot about
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:42.000]   is AR with a device that can sort of track between two points a precise location within like centimeters.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:48.640]   You have a much better AR experience for tracking, but also just for manipulation of the space for
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:57.600]   adding things or dropping things and anchoring them in. And so we could maybe see Apple's AR glasses
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:10.720]   in 2020. Interesting. Yeah. I keep. I don't exactly like that. I hope so. With Apple logos that
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:15.680]   maybe the leaves on the top of those two logos, they change color depending on your mood.
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:23.200]   Like you give like angry eyebrows. Yeah. I love that. You know, I'm fast. I'm fascinated by the
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:27.600]   story. I would have bet anything that we're not going to see Apple AR glasses the next couple of
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:34.000]   years. Because it's not because I have inside information or because I'm an industry. I'm such
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:40.400]   an incredible industry analyst that I can see. It's simply that I have an idea. I have an impression
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:47.600]   of what someone who is in the know would refer to as AR glasses. And I just don't know how Apple
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:56.480]   could make them given. I keep trying to one of my regular search things is display technology and
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:02.160]   just looking for academic papers on how to do it in such a way that you won't have the Google Glass
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:08.640]   effect of, Oh my God, I can't. I like having all this stuff available just by walking around and
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:12.960]   not using my phone. But I don't like the fact that everybody's like passing me with like eight feet
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:17.760]   on each side because I look like such a dork or like a surveillance surveillance wrong watching me
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:24.880]   right now. So so yeah, I mean, I'm I'm I think that if Apple does ship something like that next year,
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:29.440]   either a it'll be this wonderful display technology that'll come as a complete surprise, at least to
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:37.440]   me, or they will come up with a way of doing AR that is not linear. It's not what we're expecting
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:42.480]   it to happen. But it will be something that is eminently useful because Apple doesn't they're
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:47.840]   happy to be two or three years late late to the late to the ball. If they think that here is we
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:52.240]   don't have a good idea for this and we don't have a way that that completely works like they're not
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:58.000]   they're not going to do face unlock until they can ship a face unlock that doesn't work if the
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   person's eyes are closed. They don't want to do that in a later update. Whereas other companies,
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:09.840]   not so much. So so I'm fascinated by this. Now that we're seeing so many really interesting
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:15.440]   reports from people who have great track records. I'm glad to be I'm glad to have a guess that
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:21.680]   was completely wrong. And it's nice to it's nice to have an idea that in 2020, we know we're going
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:28.720]   to see Microsoft's idea of dual screen folding computers. But we've we've seen the demo we've had
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:34.160]   people who had who had the who had the demo so we know. But next we don't there's so that's the
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:37.920]   pack. That's the present we got to open on Christmas Eve. But there's still this other package under
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:41.840]   the tree from Apple that we're not going to be allowed to open not just Christmas day but until
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:46.880]   we get back from grandma's house. So we have to go to mass. We have to go to grandma's house for
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:52.240]   dinner. And so we did we know we've got this one big present waiting for us when we finally get home.
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:56.720]   Yeah. So that's going to be fun. What I still can't figure out is how they're able to keep that
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:02.720]   present closed without any tape showing anywhere. It's just a perfectly just a perfectly wrapped
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:07.280]   present with no crease. Well, does that as micro tack on the back of the Oh, is that
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:13.760]   do you ever wonder if that was one of the one of the things that went into the design of Apple
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:19.680]   Park, the idea of we want to have this completely secure and enclosed place where if we are going
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:25.440]   to test out a new phone or a new wearable or a new personal Zeppelin or whatever, we can do it
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:30.400]   without and say by the way, we're testing knowing that anybody who sees somebody using this,
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:34.160]   whether they're out in a jogging path, whether they're biking, whether they're just at a desk
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:38.960]   somewhere, they know that this person knows how badly they're going to be fired and sued and then
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:47.360]   they have their faces painted purple if this gets out because it's the thing the time when you know
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:53.440]   that something is finally taking the wraps off of is when they have no choice. They now absolutely
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:58.080]   have to let in people that they don't completely trust or they're going to have to let people
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:02.320]   ride the subway with this or because they can't have the first they can't have the first release
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:06.560]   marred by by the way. It's okay. So long as you're not in any sort of a moving vehicle, it's
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:13.040]   any gas fumes will render this completely completely useless. So it's great to think about that.
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:18.080]   So my problem with the glasses isn't so much technical. I think they'll start off very much
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:22.720]   slave to an iPhone the way the Apple Watch did and they'll have limited utility.
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:28.640]   And I think what Apple is struggling with too and which might be a bigger indicator of when
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:33.200]   they ship it or not is that killer feature because right now it's maps. It's like walking around
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:37.840]   and seeing which way to go, which is cool, but it's not really, oh, I have to rush out and buy
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:43.040]   this cool and there seems to me like there has to be like the watch arguably had too many features
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:49.200]   at launch. You mean like my heart rates and the ads of people? Well, yeah, but they eventually
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:54.560]   settled on things that were really compelling. And I think they sort of need to shape that.
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:59.680]   Like I try to figure out backwards like this is what the demo on stage at the keynote is going to be
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:04.240]   and then what does it take to get to that. And I think until they have those things they can put
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:08.880]   up on the slide, it doesn't matter how mature the technology is, it has to be that complete package.
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:12.080]   Yeah, this first part. You were about to say something.
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:16.880]   Well, what, you know, what if Apple is taking a page from Google and they're just saying like,
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:21.120]   you know what, we're going to just present this to you half baked and see what you think and then
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:26.240]   decide what you think is worth keeping and in the next iteration, we'll make it better. Like,
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:33.680]   you know, you have to give some credit to Google for just going for it and then eventually it gets
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:38.720]   better. So maybe, you know, maybe Apple is like, you know, it's if we did this exactly right,
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:44.880]   it'd be three years before we brought AR to to the to the public and we might lose out on it.
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:50.320]   So let's just put it out now. And if it's, if it's, you know, half baked and it doesn't work the way
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:55.680]   people expect it to, we'll know because we'll have a million people using, you know, AR glasses
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:59.840]   telling us what we should or shouldn't be doing. And then we'll have all that like, you know,
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:03.440]   market research out in the public, you know, maybe they're just shifting gears now.
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:09.120]   And the interesting thing for both with Apple and Google with this is that we're already seeing
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:15.440]   their AR software. They just they have the ability to create the software because they can just have
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:20.400]   it running on a phone where you're just obligated sometimes to look down on your phone or hold it up
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:25.440]   and just get a look at some of the buildings for the software to be able to give you that big
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:30.080]   stupid hour of saying this way, idiot, I can't believe we have to tell you which way to turn it,
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:34.880]   which way is right in the set of directions. And so we're seeing exactly what they want to do.
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:39.760]   All we're not seeing is that the hardware that until now they weren't able to make.
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:45.760]   And one of the nicest things about most interesting announcements that Google made at their event
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:52.080]   last week was their answer to to AirPods, the Pixel Buds, which is which and you're expecting,
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:56.560]   okay, well, now there's a crowded market of truly wireless earbuds. Of course, if Microsoft has to
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:01.600]   have their own set, then of course, Apple has to have their own set and and Amazon has to have
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:06.320]   their own set. But they're really promoting it not just as okay, yada yada. It's great. It's
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:10.560]   great. It's noise canceling and less long time blah, blah, blah. What they really want to say
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:14.640]   is that this allows you to use the Google Assistant completely untethered from any phone. You can
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:19.600]   even be, they say three rooms away from your phone and you can still make appointments, get access
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:24.560]   to information, get answers to things. And that's and the fact that it's that tiny that you that
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:30.080]   people won't really see it unless they're sort of looking for it. That makes this an even more
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:34.800]   interesting and compelling product to me. So I would even be as happy if Apple simply said,
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:40.320]   we've got this new version of the AirPods that is we got we got rid of the lollipop sticking out
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:46.480]   of your rear, but we're pretty much making sure that we can put slow mo anywhere you want to have
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:50.960]   access to it. And if you're running, if you've just got your if you're just washing the dishes,
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:56.720]   I think audio augmented reality is really a much, much bigger potential than anything else that
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:58:03.600]   I've seen so far. I agree with that. So whether it be the Pixel Buds or Apple or Amazon's Echo Buds,
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:11.920]   though the the one augmented reality situation there with audio is being able to wear the Echo Buds
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:17.440]   and go into a Whole Foods, which is owned by Amazon and say, what is are the bananas on? And
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:21.920]   then it says aisle three, and then you know, you can go to aisle three and find I think that's an
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:29.280]   incredible feature. And to be able to tie that in and in Homer Simpson's voice. Yes, exactly.
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:34.000]   Exactly. Yeah. Or if I want Samuel L. Jackson shouting at me about where the bananas are,
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:41.360]   then that was the bananas are down the aisle on the left. The wish is that I will five. Don't
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:47.920]   buy that kippy granola crap. That's good. Wow. Lori, you've got to do an impression now.
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:54.320]   I got nothing. I'm sorry. You can just you can do the Lori. I you know, Lori Gill's
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:57.840]   Amazon Echo voice. We don't got no bananas.
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:04.320]   Bananas. Are you are you trying me stranded? The bananas couldn't be found.
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:08.560]   Hey, man, I ain't gonna fall from a banana. My tailpipe.
[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:18.720]   Oh boy. Speaking of of augmented audio reality computing are a lot of buzzwords.
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:22.320]   A R R. A R R six.
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:33.040]   AirPods Pro are are are apparently in words. This is there's a rumor that it might have that
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:40.000]   these might have noise cancellation features that they could launch ahead of the holiday season
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:46.480]   that we might see them soon and maybe called AirPods Pro AirPods. They whoop to them in the
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:50.160]   firmware. It was not another one of the firmware whoopsies. Yeah, I think it was. Yeah. In fact,
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:53.680]   the photo on the right in the photo that we are showing for folks who are listening,
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:59.360]   you can click on the link to the nine to five Mac article. It's a little glyph basically that
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:04.160]   shows these like little hairdryers. Yeah. Yeah. Like little hairdryers. That's perfect.
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:14.080]   Or a little one. One I'd one I'd worm hiding inside of a tennis racket with a hole in the side of it.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:17.120]   Bath of Con nightmares. Now. Thank you, Micah. Yes. You're very
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.760]   soon to get taken out of one I'd worm as possible show title.
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:25.520]   Maybe in another world and in another life. No. The
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:32.080]   man's in China for sure. I'm excited about these. I really it took me a while to really
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:38.640]   like my AirPods and I think that the biggest issue there was working from home made me a very
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:45.680]   privileged individual in the sense that I could mostly just blast the music or audio that I wanted
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:53.200]   to blast into the air because it was just me and my dogs. But now I go places and if I'm at work,
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:58.320]   I've got one computer there and then I move to a different place and might have my iPad and then
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:02.480]   I move to a different place and might have a different computer whatever it happens to be.
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:08.320]   And to be able to switch between those without having to take out the you know headset that
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:13.200]   I'm wearing or switch to a phone that I want to I want to talk on or whatever whatever it happens
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:19.200]   to be to have that one device my AirPods that I have have been great for that. The problem is
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:24.400]   they're getting older and now one of them completely doesn't put out sound and the other one puts
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:30.480]   out sound at about 60% of what it once did. So I'm due for a new pair of AirPods and I'm really
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:38.480]   holding out for these because I like to have that in-ear experience versus the sort of sitting on
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:44.320]   the outside of my ear. I want it to be like a thing like a yeah exactly. Yeah. To have it sitting
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:48.240]   on the outside of my ear and sort of rocking around and stuff like that. But then the fact that I
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:55.040]   might have noise cancellation that's even more exciting to me because I don't typically get
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:58.320]   dizzy or have issues with how much battery life would you give up for it though because it doesn't
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:03.360]   look like they're physically that much bigger and active noise cancellation is a hungry hungry little
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:10.080]   devil. It sure is. Yeah you definitely wouldn't be able to just constantly use your AirPods Pro with
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:15.520]   noise canceling like all the time. You'd have to designate when you're going to use it because it
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:18.640]   certainly would use up a lot of battery life and those tiny little things.
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:22.320]   We're not going to be able to pass up on the pluralization you did there. That was
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:32.720]   AirPods Pro. Spoken like a true editor. Yeah AirPods Pro. No I dig it. And I think that for me I
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:38.400]   would use it in situations where ANC was required. If I am so for the other day. Airplane.
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:47.200]   On an airplane. But the other day when I was trying to have a conversation to plan a show and there
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:52.960]   was a lot of external noise that for the most part was pretty repetitive in the sense that ANC
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:57.840]   would help to sort of cut some of it out. I would use it there but yeah you know and in normal
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:01.920]   situation. I thought you were going to say with us right now. Yeah I would really like to ANC you
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:06.720]   out if I could and I'll just talk to myself. But I can't yet because I don't have these AirPods.
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:12.880]   But do we really I'm curious you know in looking into these rumors do you think this is something
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:18.880]   in your opinion that could be launched this year. I mean it makes sense as an offer before the
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:26.160]   holiday season particularly because AirPods the first and what second gen that just has like the
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:31.360]   new case they're pretty popular. In a second gen it would obvious them. They did didn't they.
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:36.160]   Well and the second gen don't get obviated but if they use the same pro placement that they've
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:40.160]   used previously they these would be introduced at a higher price point and the AirPods too would
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:44.320]   sit underneath them and those would look like the less expensive alternative and then the meme would
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:50.320]   be yo can you even pro or something like that but they could they would be it would be apple
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:54.080]   increasingly like they did with iPod you know and other things over time slowly increasing
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:57.680]   the amount of devices and then eventually like an over the years version would make a lot of sense.
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:03.600]   So I like that they're expanding the lineup. I didn't think about that this is not a situation
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:07.920]   where you are cutting out one of the products that live that one. They're not replacing it.
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:12.320]   No yeah two replaced one but the pros won't replace the two. Now I still have to argue some
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:20.320]   people like to say that AirPods are a stocking stuffer and I don't know where you're $250
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:28.320]   stockings. God yeah I mean I don't know where you come from but I where I come from $250 or
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:36.720]   $200 or $150 physically not financially. My mom and my dad would have ordered me to sleep in the car
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:43.680]   for the next three nights just to get an appreciation for how not entitled I am to a $250 stocking
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:50.960]   stuff. Stocking stuffer was always socks razor blades shaving cream and candy candy and orange
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:57.840]   hand lotions my great grandma she was avon to the max and so she would always buy us
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:02.560]   little hand lotions and chapsticks that tasted like candy canes and things like that and
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:08.960]   my younger siblings which now I'm putting them on blast here would have to be monitored around
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:15.360]   their chapsticks because they would eat their chapsticks. It tastes like chocolate. Listen Lori
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:24.000]   you're enabling you have to stop. So those are stocking stuffers not $200 not even $50 is not
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.560]   a stocking stuffer. I understand Renee what you were saying though it's in terms of size it feels
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:33.680]   like a stocking stuffer but no that that little thing gets wrapped up and tucked underneath the tree.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:42.000]   That's a full on present. In a giant box. In 18 giant boxes. Can I just speak to the design of
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:48.240]   the AirPods and how the AirPods Pro that is and how it's probably going to be just as uncomfortable
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:53.440]   for me as the current AirPods which is why I don't use them anymore even though I do like them.
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:57.760]   I find them to still hurt my ears and these look like they're going to be even worse for a cold.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:02.480]   What if there beats a PowerBeats Pro style though? Are those comfy for your ears?
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:09.520]   I'm wearing the PowerBeats Pro right now because they are very comfortable but I need that sort of
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:16.320]   soft flexible thing that goes in my ear because without it it just feels like somebody's got a
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:22.960]   rock inside my ear and it hurts after 30 minutes. So you know I like I love the idea of AirPods but
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:29.280]   I'm disappointed that they haven't found a way to execute it so that the comfort level can be a
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:34.800]   little bit better for me. I've been disappointed with the last two iterations of them and I do see
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:40.240]   in the in the glyph that there's it looks like there might be some sort of soft cushiony thing
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:46.480]   at the front of it and that might help with with the problem but I also see that the casing is
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:52.720]   still that large round and even slightly larger round plastic casing that would go that would be
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:57.440]   the part that I think would be in my ear canal which which is that's what starts to hurt.
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:03.440]   Before before we move off though can we also can we bring up the the fact that
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:08.800]   you're not the you're not the first one by by far to tell me about how oh well gosh I'm looking
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:15.760]   forward to the new AirPods because mine my broke after recently and I feel I feel like for hundreds
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:21.520]   for 170 dollars I really need something to last more than a couple of years. I really can't
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:27.680]   my fruit I'm not cheap but I'm frugal partly because again I'm a freelance journalist in a
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:34.560]   rapidly collapsing market but I it's I can't one of the things you I really associate with Apple is
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:39.840]   that you really get a lot of value for money that even when iPhones were a couple hundred bucks more
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:45.680]   expensive than a similarly powered or similarly featured Android phone in its kind of class it
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:51.440]   was worth the extra couple hundred bucks because you knew that it was built between the the CPU power
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:55.200]   between the way it's built between the software updates you know that you're going to get at
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:59.520]   least four or five years out of it so long as you managed to keep it out of it out of a toilet
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:06.640]   or keep it out of off of tile tile impacts but Micah didn't you didn't you walk didn't you
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:11.760]   drop yours and water didn't you wash them on accident. I washed mine yeah yeah so so Andy your
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:16.720]   your argument is totally right but you but Micah did accidentally wash his earfives. Yeah I washed
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:21.600]   mine they're fine that's that's fine that's uh well that's okay that that I didn't I missed that
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:26.960]   part but I know a lot of people that just because that they were they were wearing them while running
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:30.640]   and sweat got into them or they were simply wearing them on hot days and sweat got in them
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:37.360]   or for whatever reason it just stopped working that's I wish that Apple had like a better replacement
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:41.760]   policy I know you can go back into an Apple store just buy if it's our warranty you can buy
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:47.440]   a replacement bud but I really wish that there was at least at least you could there was one card
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:53.840]   metaphorically that you could play that said yeah it's been only 18 months and all the sound has
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:58.400]   gone off with the right one where they would either do you a solid and replace it for free or at least
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:04.160]   give you a subsidized price on replacement just let me do that once just to make sure that I get a
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:10.400]   few years out of it at least and if they if the price goes up to 250 I really really hope that they
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:15.600]   make a really really big case about yours we're not just using adhesive we're using plastic welds
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:21.840]   we're not just using seals we're using circuitry that in itself could work underwater if you had
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:27.280]   up to four feet deep in a swimming pool full of nothing but marathon or sweat and it will still
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:32.000]   work you don't want to see our test facility but we have video Andy let me double down on that because
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:38.800]   I so this this is a really good point I've had um I've seen a few folks talk about this specific
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:43.360]   this very thing where they are talking about how their their air pods are not making as much sound
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:46.960]   as they use to and so they end up getting a new pair they're waiting to get a new pair
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:52.800]   to go back to what Laurie was talking about I put mine through the washing machine one time by accident
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:10:00.000]   and they were fine after that the the whole issue with them going out came many many many months
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.720]   after I put them through the washing machine this was I'm sure an issue of a lot of people have an
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:11.280]   issue where after a while even if you do a good job of cleaning them earwax gets in there and
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:15.440]   things get messed up it's it's gross it is whatever it's that's how these things work and
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:21.680]   but because of that I'm with you I think that if I spend this amount of money on this product
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:27.920]   I took them I took my air pods into the apple store because one of them completely stopped
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:32.320]   playing sound I did all of the the troubleshooting features on my own I got a little like wax cleaner
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:37.360]   thingy and did everything still one of them was not working I took them into the apple store
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:45.200]   to see if it was you know some sort of issue that could be solved by that way and she listened
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:49.120]   to the one that wasn't working at all and tried you know the same troubleshooting steps that I did
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:54.720]   as they often do and it would not make any sound and then she listened to the other one and she said
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:59.120]   this is actually not playing at full volume even whenever it's turned up to full volume
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.720]   so I could have replaced the one that was completely not working but then it would have
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:07.440]   came in at a hundred percent volume whereas the one would have come in at like 60 percent volume
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:11.600]   and so it would have been better to just replace the whole thing and at that point I'm like
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:15.600]   I already spent this amount of money on it I don't feel like I should have to replace these at
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:20.400]   complete cost because of outside of warranty at this point or you know replacement I agree with you
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:27.120]   I think with that level of price if these things are designed to go in the ear and I'm doing
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.960]   my dog on best to make sure that they're clean and they're still
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:34.960]   caught they're still having these issues and I've seen so many other people's talk about the same
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:42.160]   I feel like that is something where a sort of get out of jail free card thing is an option where
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:47.120]   within a certain period of time I should be able to just get a subsidized at the very least replacement
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:51.760]   you know but particularly now that it's been a few years and anchor for instance it makes a
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:56.160]   really nice pair of like I think they're fifty dollars sixty dollars and no they're not as good
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:00.880]   as as the AirPods or as the top of the line bows but they're fifty or sixty bucks and they
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:06.880]   they work in the fact in the sense that you get stereo sound in both ears via Bluetooth and if
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:11.840]   you if they do stop working or if you do put one through the wash or if you do get home and realize
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:17.440]   that that horrible that horrible thing where you open up your charging case and you only find one
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:22.480]   earbud or no earbuds in there where you thought that you you don't know and now you absolutely
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:30.000]   no idea where these things went there there's people who people like me that find it really
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.480]   really hard to spend that kind of they've I've got a hundred seventy dollars I'm going to make
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:39.440]   another hundred seventy dollars really really quickly but I can't afford to like just lose a
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:44.160]   hundred seventy dollars on something that didn't really give me uh that enough time to actually
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:50.480]   enjoy them didn't give you the value of that hundred dollar value yeah yeah I'm with you there
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:55.840]   and in the chat as someone's pointing out if they don't last long and customers just buy another
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:00.720]   pair why would apple bother improving them that's a fair concern if I'm still because yeah for some
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:04.960]   reason I'm still going oh I'm excited to get these new ones even though these first ones sort of
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:14.400]   did me wrong uh per se I I get that and I think that's a fair concern I think um for me it's been
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:22.080]   the the functionality the way that it's it's integrated but also the size and and uh ease of
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:26.800]   use that that is involved with the size so I do have other bluetooth headphones I've got different
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:32.000]   kinds of them I've got wired headphones I've got all different kinds of headphones but nothing has
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:38.240]   been as simple in my sort of moving from place to place option that the air pods provide with the
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:42.720]   little microphone built in and all that kind of stuff so I'll say one thing that only just
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:48.320]   occurred to me like just about 10 minutes ago this does the success of the air pods does bode well for
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:55.920]   AR glasses that apple happens to make because uh it's it took me a long time to realize that the
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:04.480]   air pods they look almost objectively dorky because they just look so weird but there's sort of a
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:10.800]   well designed dorkiness about them that makes us not see the dorkiness of them because they're really
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:15.520]   they're they're an apple designed dorkiness and so if there's any company that could convince
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:20.240]   somebody to say yes uh you don't even wear glasses in your daily life but here are some goggles
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:24.880]   with a with blinking lights that shape like apple logos there's not gonna be like that so it was
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:29.280]   yeah we look like dorks but we look like dorks who can afford apple products so it's kind of okay
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:32.320]   you know well designed dorkiness is actually my aesthetic so
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:38.320]   it's perfect you look you look again I say that that's our chasm or irony I say without
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:42.640]   sarcasm or irony you look very very nice and if this is going to be your standard I'm going to have
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:48.160]   to up my game slightly I did I did even shave today I'm going to have to and be in laurie and I
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:54.000]   are coming in tuxes oh wow that's gonna be I that's gonna be awesome I'll have to bring a bow tie then
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:01.040]   oh a cracker of a bow tie that would be quite real has the fez I'm just saying that's true
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:07.680]   now I like this rumor I know we're still on the rumor thing but this is maybe the last one we'll
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:15.120]   do here this one has me excited because I have come to love my apple watch and the the tracking
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:20.640]   features that it provides and we've heard for a while now that apples may be working on some bands
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:28.480]   that offer their own bits of of data and power tracking or not power tracking but power delivery
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:38.880]   and data tracking this is something that I feel this is an area ripe for innovation I guess or at least
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:44.000]   an area ripe for claiming some more money from us is this a patent story because apple insider is
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.320]   one of those sites who never see patent in the headline and I get all excited I get one paragraph
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:54.640]   in and it says patent application it is again it is it is a patent put that in the title
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:00.000]   Renee this is something super exciting to talk about because and mica you might remember this too
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.840]   to me this is like heading down that path to us getting branded
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:13.840]   watch bands that come with a branded apple watch face that you can use with it for example a Mickey
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:18.960]   Mouse watch band that gives you special Mickey Mouse watch face that can only be worn with this
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:23.120]   Mickey Mouse watch band I'm excited and that also works as your passive Disney
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:31.520]   yes yes I'm excited about this like I want to talk about it rumor rumor or no patent or no
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:36.160]   to me this means that apples thinking they're thinking in the background they're going okay
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:41.920]   what can we do with watch bands that could make the apple watch itself be you know have more
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:47.760]   features watch bands expand to watch bands yes please because in the in the end what I want is
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:52.320]   a watch band that I go and buy that's from some brand that's my Star Wars watch band
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:57.920]   and it also gives me a Star Wars watch base that's all I want yeah when it plays a Star Wars music
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:05.120]   as you put it on yeah also also also too simple I mean I love that idea alone but I need it to
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:10.800]   also do something else and so what is that you would know because you practically have an address
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:15.840]   at Disney at this point Lori what's the thing that you can use and it's like it's a band that you
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:21.840]   are NFC or and you can go around it's actually it's it's only in Florida which is very frustrating
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:29.040]   for the Californians that I it's called I think it's just called the the FastPass band I might
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:33.680]   have that totally wrong and everybody that's a Disney fan in the in the chat is probably right
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:38.720]   now yeah they're they're calling me out on it but it's because I've never used it because in
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:44.480]   in California they don't have the band but yeah it's an NFC chip in a band that you can buy
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:49.200]   your own designs of them and take them home you know it's not something that you only use
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:53.360]   during the time that you're at the park and then you throw it in the garbage when it's done it's
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:59.360]   reusable so you have your own band and it has your you know annual pass information on it if
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:05.360]   you're a pass holder but you can take it back and forth to the park you can actually um uh get in
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:10.720]   line when you haven't even entered the park yet so from home you can say you know at two o'clock I
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:15.840]   want to go on star tours and then when you're there in the park you can go on star tours with it so
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:22.800]   yeah having that added to Apple Watch would be fantastic and frankly they've done a lot even in
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:29.920]   California to let you use your phone um as your fast pass and if they could just move that to
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:35.760]   Apple Watch to the app and not even needing a special band for it but they they there's they're
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:42.640]   just steps away from having an Apple Watch app for the Disneyland app which lets you use those
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:46.160]   fast passes so that you wouldn't even need to buy a separate band you could just use your Apple Watch
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:52.400]   yeah I think it would be great if Apple created just sort of a sanctified NFC strap because a
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:57.360]   lot of the a lot of the most interesting shortcuts that I've been seeing uh from here there are people
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:01.360]   who are just really excited about what they can do by putting an NFC just taking a sticker an
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:06.160]   NFC sticker and putting it on a band so if you could have something that was like on the side of the
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:10.240]   of the class but supposed to the watch side so it doesn't get triggered by so it doesn't interfere
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:15.360]   with the Apple Pay and the the ability to like sign yourself into and out of buildings or just
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:23.040]   the ability to tap it when I was when I when I caught that particular form of dementia uh on
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:27.600]   Android a few years ago it was like I've got I've got an NFC sticker at the doorway so all I got
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:32.960]   to do is tap my phone and there is to tell my tell my house okay I'm home okay I'm going away
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:38.720]   I had an NFC sticker like on the on the dashboard charger of the phone so it could automatically flip
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:44.400]   into like my my my car navigation app and stuff like that and so to have something like that that's
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:49.680]   embedded in a really fancy really nice looking Apple Apple Watch strap not only would it really be
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:54.640]   cool but it would also encourage people to do more things with NFC or maybe even encourage more
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:20:00.880]   developers to have to have NFC controls built into their NFC activated features built into their apps
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.880]   what are the new so yeah this is a lot cool things that you do with this
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:10.880]   what are the new oh yeah yeah yeah we're Pekachu me boes yes yes a watch band with an amoeba
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:15.520]   on it so that you could actually now I want to see your watch band every day or I want to sign
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:22.000]   in Belmont watch yeah I'm I'm thinking now you mentioned having Pikachu on your watch what if
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:28.960]   the Pokemon company and Apple paired up to make a Pikachu watch band that had
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:36.160]   that that whenever you used it you could use it like the the the little ball that you can buy
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:42.800]   the little throw ball plus so you could carry your Pokemon with you on your Apple watch and
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:48.880]   make it make noises like a touchy yes oh wait a minute so here so here's the idea right now we
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:53.920]   have the pulse rate warnings what if the band has enough charge that if it detects something
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:21:00.400]   really wrong with your heart it just yells out clear and then shocks you I'm sold I want an iED
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:06.480]   built into my Apple watch absolutely I got a you know I gotta say that when the concept of
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:10.640]   like branded watches watch bands came about I thought that you were going to be talking about
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:14.720]   like there's a little electrical current that will actually physically brand the Apple logo into
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:18.880]   your wrist so that even when you don't have your watch you can prove your fealty to the to the
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:24.720]   mothership don't you worry I'm part of the company it gives you a tattoo some people
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:30.640]   so they talk about like a camera built into the watch band I think that's foolish but maybe that's
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:37.600]   just me but I like the idea of if it offers more health tracking features if it gives you better
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:42.880]   heart rate tracking if it can give you more of a 3d perspective of the way that your heart rhythm is
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:50.000]   if it helps with glucose monitoring all these different features that we don't have right now
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:57.680]   that could be added via the watch band and could be added more frequently through a release of bands
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:04.560]   than you get with the yearly or so release of the watch I think those are pretty cool ideas of course
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:11.200]   as Renee points out once again we're looking at patents here and as we know patents do not always
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:20.000]   lead to actual you know technology in the future per se but it is a little it's a little glimpse into
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:26.080]   what the company's thinking about at least now before we move on you know we've gotten all worked
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:33.920]   up our heart rates are high we've got we've got our watches yelling clear but it's time to calm down
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:46.640]   open up calm that is the fantastic meditation and calming app mindfulness app that we love here
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:52.640]   at at wait in fact I use it every night whenever I am trying to fall asleep because I have these
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:58.960]   great stories that they'll read to you whenever you're trying to fall asleep if you're struggling
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:03.840]   with sleep if you're struggling with stress if you're struggling with anxiety well you're not alone
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:09.120]   in fact one in three us adults don't get enough sleep and if you're not sleeping enough it can
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:14.160]   affect your cognitive functions during the day so if you've got two shows back to back and you're
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:19.280]   not getting enough sleep for those shows well by golly then you're not doing it right and you need
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:23.280]   something like calm it's going to affect your learning your problem solving your decision making
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:28.880]   if you're not getting enough sleep if you download calm it's the number one app for sleep I think
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:33.280]   part of the reason for that is because there are so many different options within the app
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:42.960]   the app gives you access to many different sleep stories music in fact Leo and I just not too long
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:48.640]   ago on iOS today discovered that Sam Smith has released a special version of one of his songs
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:54.000]   on the call map that's like this song is like a three-minute song but it's stretched out super
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:00.240]   long and it is specifically made for the app above and beyond which is one of my favorite sort of
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:07.440]   easy listening in the background kind of bands or groups they've released an album on calm as well
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:15.360]   and it's all great for for for getting calm and getting more mindful sleep deficiency does
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:20.720]   serious damage trust me I did a podcast about sleep which is a thing i'm going to put on a business
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:28.960]   card but i in doing a show about sleep and researching sleep and looking at new health studies about
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:36.000]   sleep it is people talk about how important sleep is but you have no idea how important sleep is
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.440]   it goes to the next level of the importance of getting sleep and when you're not getting enough
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:46.080]   sleep it is so bad for your health it's not just bad for your brain but it's bad for your body as
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:52.560]   well because you're more prone to accidents you're more prone to depression and things like that

[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:05.440]   for your support of this show and now that we are back from our calming break let's kick it into
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:14.960]   high gear no I kid this this it's time to move on I think from the rumor mail basically is is where
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:19.040]   I think we have to go because we talked a lot about all the rumors that are out there but there's
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:25.440]   so much more that's going on including a story we touched a little bit on this morning for iOS
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:34.080]   today and it's about watch OS and it's about wearing your apple watch apple says here is the
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:40.640]   proper way to wear your apple watch now this is a cute headline apple thinks you're wearing your
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:48.160]   apple watch wrong but in out there in truth and in truth and in yeah exactly if I wanted
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:52.960]   around my ankle it's going around my ankle I think my shins look real cute with them you know what
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:58.400]   your shins do look real cute whenever you thank you watch there but this uh you know you read my
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:07.200]   instagram i'm a i am a subscriber the fact is you know that this support article is not about you
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:14.480]   wearing your apple watch wrong it is instructions and and guidance on the chemical composition of
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:19.280]   the apple watches letting you know about some certain allergens that are in the apple watch
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:26.640]   some of the adhesives that are made as part of the process and then people who are sensitive to
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:34.800]   certain materials this is a legit i feel support document that talks about all of the components
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:42.960]   and materials for different bands and what has nickel in it and what has acrolytes in them and
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:48.880]   also about this is the part that i think people sort of honed in on is the uh part about a better
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:53.680]   fit how you wear your apple watch makes a difference in terms of the readings that you get from the
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:28:03.680]   sensors i don't know about you all but i am happy being uh told the best way to utilize my devices
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:10.240]   i like to read the owner's manual for as many of the products i possibly can and learn exactly what
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:15.840]   i should do to get the best experience out of it and so if apple is saying hey you know if you wear
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:19.520]   the watch like this then you're going to get the most accurate heart rate tracking features as
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:24.080]   someone who landed in the hospital because of heart issues i want to make sure that it's tracking
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:29.680]   my heart correctly you know what i mean so i and then i think two folks who do have um
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:35.920]   issues where their skin can become inflamed due to certain materials it's also a good thing to know
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:41.040]   uh so how about i don't know do you all have apple watches if you're a worn apple watches
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:48.880]   are you wearing them correctly oh oh interesting oh dayon interesting now that's on the other side
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:54.080]   of your wrist isn't it yeah we uh rene and georgia dau and i talked about this on the i'm where i
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:29:00.640]   show in and uh i just thought it was such a funny idea and i agree with you mica it's important that
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:05.120]   we know how to use utilize these things especially they're expensive we want them to work the way
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:09.200]   they're supposed to work but so i've decided that i would start wearing it like a swatch watch
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:13.760]   from now on the side i've been i've been having fun with it on the inside the one thing i noticed
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:20.240]   is the um the lift to check does not work i you know it doesn't just turn on when i when i do the
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:25.680]   like wrist flipping which is very frustrating yeah i'm lifting it wrong i think i need to switch
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:31.360]   it to left-handed if i want it to actually make that flip but i'm not i'm not that dedicated to the
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:36.000]   idea of it so i think i'm just going to keep it like this because it's funny it is funny yeah when you
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:43.520]   held up your wrist and yeah it rhines that's how my grandpa would wear his swatch yeah yeah i'll say
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:49.760]   as an aside that i i kind of like the idea of i wish that i i'm sure someone's going to point this out
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:55.680]   to me they haven't seen it yet but i kind of am into the idea of the i of the apple watch as a pocket
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:30:01.120]   watch just as an alternative like if i want to just have it as in a in a case with a little chain and
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:07.360]   on a not not on a really you know ostentatious fob but there there are times where when i'm using
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:11.840]   it like as an mp excuse me as a music player particularly and as just a little like sort of
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:18.320]   gadgety sort of thing to enhance my but my daily my daily wear watch that i actually own is a casio
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:23.280]   g-shock partly because what sometimes i need a stopwatch and it's never when i put it to stopwatch
[01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:27.840]   mode it's never not a stopwatch it's never never not a timer but it'd be nice to have this other
[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:33.580]   little thing that I've just got in the the actual watch pocket of my jeans for when I need to have
[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:37.680]   something a little bit more digital, and when I'm not actually wearing it on a band, I would be so
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:41.580]   totally into that. You know what I'm thinking about getting a flavor of obviously. I was going to
[01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:49.280]   say that. Yes. Oh, I'm so sorry. On my neck. No, that's I and I pad. So when I pad case, Yes. And
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:53.460]   our former boss used to wear the BlackBerry playbook on a chain around his neck.
[01:30:55.320 --> 01:31:00.360]   You know, I'm going to let that one just slide on past because that's that's interesting.
[01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:08.080]   But yeah, no, it's it's it's it's funny that it's funny that Apple would go out of its way to
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:12.560]   explain this, particularly because one of the first really cool tips that came out of the Apple
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:17.120]   Watch after his release was people saying, what if you just it's okay if you put it on the band
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:21.760]   upside down, if you want to have the dial, if you want to have the the the scroll or like on the
[01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:26.560]   other side or on the or on the other another location. But it's good to it's good to know what like
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:30.800]   when Apple was designing this, when Apple designed how the sensors are going to contact with things,
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:36.840]   this is what they had in mind. And it's also it's it's also one of the other great things about
[01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:42.480]   buying Apple stuff is that if you go to the iBook store, there is an actual like very nicely written
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:47.680]   and professionally laid out and written and illustrated manual. Like here's how to use the iPhone on
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:55.440]   iOS 13.1. And I'm wrapping up my my my iPhone 11 review, which means that it's time for me to
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:32:01.520]   put the put the close the door on the things that I figured out on my own. And suddenly,
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:06.560]   now I got to read the manual to see when I missed. And usually there's a lot of things that like
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:11.040]   there there are things about like my iPad that I've been using for two years that I did not know I
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:15.520]   could do until actually downloaded and read Apple's manual for it. So if you just go to the I if
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:20.240]   you just go the books app and just do go to the library of the store and just do a search for
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:26.160]   your product, it's like, Oh, I mean, I could always like download this $30 book for free that
[01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:32.400]   shows me. And also I'm I'm glad because I'm an Apple user. I'm also glad because a few years ago,
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:37.680]   I did decide for myself that I'd no longer wanted to write like how to Apple books. So I'm not upset
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:43.920]   about them sure locking my entire like book writing career. Yeah. And I think again, oh, and by the
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:49.360]   way, I'm I'm wearing mine around my neck. Nice. There you go. See that, see that would make it
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:54.720]   would make a nice tie tack or even if you had like a bow tie with that like as the knot in the middle.
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:33:00.400]   Oh my goodness. Of course, you'd have people like touching your Adams Apple to make calculations
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:04.400]   and stuff like that. But I'm sure but Siri would still because we slow mo would still work.
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:08.160]   Yeah, with a raise to speak feature, I could probably say, Hey, slow mo,
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:14.080]   well, this actually looks kind of nice. Now that I'm serious again, not a trace of sarcasm,
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:17.440]   that actually looks pretty good. You have to patent pending patent pending patent pending.
[01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:22.560]   I'd say or I could even wear it. Choose a create a custom face for it that has a nice little image
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:27.440]   on it. Oh, yeah, one of those new like fire and ice faces or something. Yeah. Yeah. Well,
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:31.200]   I would have to turn off the lock, which means I'd have to take they're saying the chat except
[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:37.520]   it's always locked. I would have to take the Apple pay stuff off of it. But then it would,
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:41.760]   I think that I could take off the lock at that point and then I would be able to access it.
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:46.000]   But if I fastened it well enough, it would think it was against skin. And so I'd only have to type
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.720]   it in at the beginning of the day. And as long as it didn't lift off of the thing, then it would be
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:55.440]   right there. Okay. Well, like a dog callers, that sort of thing, they can still get like the
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:34:03.040]   pulse sort of stuff. The choker. Now we're talking. I love it. So you wear yours on your ankle.
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:06.960]   All wear mine as a bow tie knot. Renee, what are you going to do?
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:12.560]   Double double fist ring. Perfect. Yeah. I love it. Lori, what about you?
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:18.880]   I'm still going to just wait. Okay. I'm already doing it. We're going to be the, what is it?
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:24.880]   The Justice League, but I need an Apple watch. I don't know. I'm not good at, I'm not good at
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:29.840]   naming teams. Renee, I have to suggest if you're going to go that way, it's have like one Apple
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:35.600]   watch, one with a custom watch face with like the love emoji, the other one, the other press with
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:42.160]   the hate emoji. So it'd be a little tough. I like your idea better. A lot less painful than
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:47.200]   matching finger tattoos. I was hoping you were doing Captain Planet. So we've got love and earth
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:52.160]   and fire and I don't remember what all I said. No, no, I think I think at this point, the planet's
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:56.400]   pretty honked off at us and it's never going to be our friend ever again. So that's a lost cause.
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:02.720]   Captain Planet, I'm actually doing Thanos. I wanted to point out that I love that Andy keeps using
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:07.520]   honk when he's talking about, that is my favorite thing that you're starting to do now and I hope
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:12.720]   you keep doing it for as long as we live. Yes, which is not much longer because the earth is honked
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:19.520]   off at us. Well, because something, again, that's partly subroutine that says, can I say this word?
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:26.560]   I might not say honked off. That's not ex-urinationed off. Oh, yes.
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:36.240]   Let's talk about Apple Arcade because it launched and there were a lot of games that came out
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:44.480]   on at the get-go. But one of the things that was supposed to be the fun feature of Apple Arcade is
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:50.240]   that they would continue to bring out new games. And so we've got four new games, including
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:55.280]   something called Pac-Man Party Royale, which I'm ashamed to say I have not tried yet. But if that
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:36:00.880]   face of Pac-Man is any indication, which for those of you listening, it's basically the face of full
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:10.560]   dread, just the wide old-- It's hard. It is like the final scene of the shining,
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:15.280]   where Pac-Man is like the mom and the kid being chased by Jack. I'm not sure if I want that.
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:23.200]   Pac-Man is supposed to be Tack-a-turn stoic. He basically runs away from them. He runs towards
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:28.640]   them. That is his life. That is his job. I don't want to think that if I make the wrong move,
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:33.520]   I am instilling even greater terror and panic at a possible heart attack or stroke in this
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:38.800]   lovable yellow orb. Now, is it perfect? Is it purpose- I might be too impending.
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:46.240]   It looks kind of low quality. And I can't tell if they're doing that on purpose to be cute.
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:52.080]   I told Carsten that I didn't want to show my screen, so I didn't plug in the HDMI, so he's
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:55.920]   awesome and is making it possible. So you can see my screen. I apologize.
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:37:02.960]   Carsten is awesome. Yes. Yes, it is. So I'm launching Pac-Man Party Royale with the face of full dread.
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:07.040]   No, that's the one. Yeah, that's the one I want to use.
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:12.960]   Because I'm curious about this game now. Okay, yeah, I haven't launched this on my Mac before.
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:22.400]   Why is this not loading? But what I'm curious about, okay, so we'll call it an issue. Oh, no,
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:26.800]   now it's working. There we go. I'm curious if they're trying to do something cute,
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:31.600]   where they make it look a little bit low quality for making it feel a little bit more like.
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:36.720]   Give it that retro look. Yes, thank you. Yeah. Well, I don't know. It's kind of like,
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:42.960]   if Scrabble doesn't look like Scrabble, is it really Scrabble? And Pac-Man, you can't have,
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:49.440]   like, you can't make it like a doom layout. First person point of view, like, tunnel chaser.
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:53.840]   And it wouldn't be a bad game. It's just it's not Pac-Man. There's something about,
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:59.680]   you have to have, you have to be God looking down over these pitiful creatures that you control
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:06.640]   through your indifferent moves of left, right, up, down. Oh God, why does it move so slowly?
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:13.040]   This is a very, yeah. Yeah. I don't, that seems about the speed of Pac-Man.
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:18.240]   I just want to play classic Pac-Man to be. Yeah, exactly. No, exactly, exactly. That's how I feel too.
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:23.520]   This doesn't, yeah, you don't get that. Yeah, I'm kind of bummed at this game. I'm not going to be,
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:26.880]   I'm not going to lie. Oh, wait. Now I'm moving a little bit faster.
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:32.640]   And I can't tell if I'm supposed to be beating the, I don't know how this game is playing.
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:38.560]   I just want to play classic Pac-Man. Right. Anyway, that's a Pac-Man party royale. But
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:42.720]   this goes back to the original point, which is just the fact that I love that they're continuing
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:49.920]   to launch new games. I think that that's a fun thing that I can always count on with the subscription
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:57.360]   that I have, that there are new things to try out that are available and that we are seeing
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:02.560]   these companies be they, you know, individuals who are making games for Apple Arcade or bigger
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:08.960]   companies making games for our Apple Arcade. There may be something to this because they still
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:14.400]   continue to make games for it. So let's keep that rolling. Is my hope?
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:21.680]   Yeah, I just love being able to sample stuff. So I'm subscribed on in the iOS store. I'm also
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:27.120]   subscribed in the Google Play Store, their version of it, which is not so much commissioning new games,
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:31.520]   so much as taking games that are a couple of years old, like Monument Valley and making that
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:37.200]   iteration unlocked and free with all the in-game purchases purchased. And what really has got me
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:43.680]   out of gaming is that I just don't have it's it's hard for me to justify buying a game or investing
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:49.360]   the time. If I don't know if I'm gonna like it or not, or if the premise is so up to so I don't
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:53.280]   really get it. And usually the only games that I wind up getting are the ones that people recommend
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:57.520]   to me. But it's so cool when this this just sounds weird. And I've already paid the five bucks for
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:01.360]   it whether I use it or not. So I'm going to invest at least five or 10 minutes of it. And sometimes
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:07.120]   you wind up investing way, way more time on a deadline day than you intended to. So if it means
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:11.840]   it just like on just like on Netflix, just like on Apple Music, if it means that
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:19.360]   just an idle whim of gee, I wonder I've only have three Prince albums. Maybe I'm gonna what
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:23.840]   what did he do other than those three Prince albums? And then you've like, oh my god, what a fool I
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:28.960]   am that I have there's there like 11 D team different Prince albums that I've denied myself.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:33.040]   I've denied myself that kind of sexy pleasure. What am I done myself?
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:40.480]   You know, that's actually I actually canceled my Apple Apple arcade subscription.
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:47.600]   I don't worry. Hold on. I went ahead and paid through one extra month. So I have it through
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:52.880]   November 16th. I still currently have it because I think it's actually November 17th because I
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:57.200]   waited on purpose so that I can get it. I could pay for one extra month just to give it a little
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:01.680]   more time. But here's the thing. I'm not canceling because I don't love it because I absolutely love
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:08.480]   it. I'm canceling because I have a lot of other video games that I've spent a lot of money on
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:12.880]   that I haven't been playing because I've been playing these Apple arcade games.
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:17.440]   So here's here's what I'm balancing out for anybody who's in the same situation as me of
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:22.400]   trying to balance out all of the video games that they love to play. I'm canceling it for now
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:26.960]   so I can catch up on the $70 video games that I've bought and and new ones that are coming out that
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:33.920]   I'm going to buy. And then once I feel like I've I've done a lot of the console, the larger concept
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:39.920]   of me. After a sword and shield? Yes, exactly. And then I'll hop back into into the mobile gaming
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:45.520]   and use because I love having it. But it's also for the next six months for Seattle six months,
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:49.760]   I'm not going to be playing it. So that's a waste of the money that I would have spent on it.
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:55.680]   And and it also I'm I find myself more likely to just sit there using playing it on my iPad or
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:42:00.400]   iPhone than to go pick up the console. Not that playing on a console is like homework,
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:06.880]   but it's definitely hard to do. I love how much you're passionately like explaining yourself.
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:10.880]   It's as if there's the person that is in your head that is against you about this.
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:15.760]   It's like we have a guy's micro sergeant. It's those. I know I'm sorry. Look at my eyes. Look how
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:24.240]   judgy they are. Lori Gail. You fool. How could you? How dare? How dare Renee Richie?
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:30.640]   Yes. What is your favorite Apple arcade game right now? On the spot? Still, I have not had that
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:34.240]   much time to play because it's the height of crazy review season. But I've been playing the
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:40.160]   card game still. I can never remember the name of but it's just so moody and beautiful and where
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:43.840]   the cards fall. Is that right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Where the cards going to get the name wrong?
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:48.880]   Yeah. It's just so beautiful. So I just relax and play that. And I've gone through and I browse
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:52.480]   through a bunch of games and I like the sneaky Sasquatch and all of those. That's my favorite.
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:43:02.480]   So many reviews. Andy Anotko, what's your what is what's a if you have a favorite or if you have
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:09.680]   ones you've enjoyed playing on Apple Arcade? What is it? I'm with Renee. It is like daily new review
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:14.080]   of something interesting that requires a week of research. So I'm still trying to finish what the
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:21.840]   golf because it just makes me so happy. My life is between my gaming life is 100%
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:26.560]   bifurcated between what the golf I'm in front of my phone and I still haven't finished on title
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:32.240]   goose game, which I'm trying to. I feel I need to have the controller in front of me to figure
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:37.440]   that work. But yeah, it's it's a it's a great it's a great time for people for gaming for people who
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:42.640]   are not considered don't consider themselves like invested gamers because it's like oh,
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:46.800]   this is this is almost like an art piece I get to interact with as opposed to
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:50.560]   remember, okay, now remember we're doing squat eight. We're doing a button hook left. They're going to be
[01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:55.360]   are you loaded? Okay, what's your health? Give them health. Give them health magic. Miss
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:44:00.720]   a little bit over there over there. Yeah, it's like what's your what's your current defense score?
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:05.280]   Well, you got to raise that by seven points and also 399 in that purchase. If you want to get a new
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:12.240]   skin and do this dance. Renee, take down that tweet about Hong Kong. We can't make any risks.
[01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:19.440]   We're on the we're on the server now. Lori, what is your favorite game right now? Right now that
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:24.000]   you're you know about. Yeah, I know right. Right now I'm playing the enchanted world and that game
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:29.120]   is really fun. It's a nice little puzzle game that you know, like those old plastic,
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:38.400]   slidey puzzles where you had to slide these puzzles around like squares. Yeah, it's similar to that,
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:43.760]   which is kind of a fun it just kind of is very cathartic for me because it scratches that itch
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:48.400]   of like moving just moving tiles around. But you don't have to it's not a pictogram. You don't
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:51.680]   have to actually make an image out of it. You just have to make them line up a certain way so that
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:56.960]   you can walk down a path that's really cute. Yeah, I would have to say mine does fall between
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:02.000]   sneaky Sasquatch and what the golf what the golf is just a delight. Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:07.040]   It's it's it's like it's like a humor. It's like a magazine humor piece from the 1970s,
[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:13.600]   but done as a game. It's like every every new level is a new joke and a new oh, that's wonderful.
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:20.880]   Yeah, I need it. I needed that on a busy Tuesday. Thank you. I agree. I agree. Well, I have had to
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:27.120]   tell some folks, hey, now's the time if you are wanting to get rid of Apple Arcade.
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:34.800]   Now's the time to do it before you do get that charge. So there's your your PSA that is that
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:44.880]   is public service announcement not pumpkin spice. I say apple apple in spice apple. Yeah, so make
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:49.280]   sure that you that you cancel apple arcade if that's something you're not wanting to stick around with.
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:56.960]   But I'm enjoying it and we talk about different games on iOS today all the time. So I gotta
[01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:03.280]   gotta keep that around. Gotta keep talking about it. Apple TV. We have Apple TV plus. We've got a
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:07.200]   bunch of new shows that are going to be coming out soon. Apparently some people have gotten a CC
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:12.640]   before C is available for us to see. Is that true? Yeah, it's Game of Thrones violent, which
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:17.280]   apparently is a thing. It's it's Game of Thrones violent. Well, some people are saying there was
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:22.320]   an unimaginable amount of violence in the third episode for an apple show, which and then Apple
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:26.880]   someone at Apple said it was like their version of Game of Thrones. So okay, that's interesting.
[01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:36.160]   Okay, that's free. That's reassuring because I remember remember how Homer Simpson would describe
[01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:40.640]   Branson, Missouri. It's like it's like Las Vegas if it were run by Ned Flanders. I felt as though
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:44.640]   this is like this is what Netflix would be like if it were run by Ned Flanders ever hearing
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:49.280]   everything about Apple's meddling and saying, can we have more hugs? Can we have more?
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:55.040]   See, okay, growing up not growing up near Branson, but living near Branson,
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:47:01.920]   quite literally like 15 minutes from Branson for two or three years. That is such an accurate
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:08.240]   description of Branson. Ridiculous. But they lived in Springfield, which Homer is the Simpsons
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:12.800]   are apparently from all sorts of different Springfield. So is Cobra including Springfield, Missouri.
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:17.520]   Wait, Cobra is from Branson or Cobra is from Springfield. Springfield. Now which Cobra?
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:26.000]   Cobra, like Cobra Commander Cobra. Cobra. Yeah. Okay, cool. Well, there's that.
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:34.240]   Trivia. I forgot about Renee trivia. It's so nice to have some Renee trivia. That's where
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:44.240]   Cobra is from. Can we, this is, I saw this story this morning and I'm very confused about it.
[01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:52.960]   Google Photos is giving unlimited full quality photo storage to iPhone users, but not to Android
[01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:58.480]   users. What's going on? No, that's, that's, that's, so they're no longer provided.
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:02.000]   Originally when you bought a Pixel, you would get unlimited original photo
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:07.920]   storage for it, but they've discontinued that with the Pixel 4. Now you just get high quality and
[01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:14.080]   you can pay to get original quality. But because you can choose the high efficiency file format
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:18.880]   in Apple Photos, which essentially packs original quality into a smaller high quality size,
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:23.200]   I forget. I think Jonathan Morrison mentioned this first. You're essentially cheating the
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:27.840]   system. So if you're using an iPhone and you're choosing to save and hey, if you're uploading that
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:32.160]   to Google Photos, you're essentially getting original quality for the price of high quality.
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:38.640]   That's good. And Google had, was, was accessible to reporters. They said, don't worry. This is a bug.
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:45.360]   We'll be fixing it. No, no, no, especially because you're like, but wait a minute. The point is that
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:51.920]   HEIC is actually smaller than a JPEG. So we're actually doing you a favor by allowing you to store. So
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:57.680]   no, we, we just decided out of spite, we can't allow, we're not in the business of giving services
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:03.360]   away. Well, okay, we're giving all services away, but not the few that we've monetized.
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:08.320]   I was going to export a bunch of just the repeat photo of that one. It's a purple
[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:12.400]   AMP emoji that's got like a smiling face. I was going to export a bunch of those at high
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:16.160]   resolution and upload them to my Google Photos account. But now I can't because they're fixing it.
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:19.040]   That's too bad. We can do it before they fix it.
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:20.320]   That's right. Let me hop on that.
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:26.960]   Okay. So that makes sense now. Now I understand a little bit more what's going on there.
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:36.400]   Okay. Now Luna display is this thing that lets you connect between a Mac and an iPad and you
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:42.640]   could sort of use your iPad as an external display. And after Luna display introduced this feature,
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:48.320]   then Catalina came out with a feature that lets you use what was it called? Sidecar?
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:55.920]   Pass or buy? Yes. Sidecar. I don't want no scrubs. I think is also what it's called.
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:50:05.360]   Thank you, Laurie. So Sidecar lets you use your iPad as a secondary display for your Mac.
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:11.040]   But now Luna display is doing this thing where you can use older Macs that don't have Sidecar
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:19.120]   functionality to serve as secondary displays for your Mac. So they got Sherlock-ish, but then
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:21.840]   they're like, "You know what? We're not going to Sherlock. We're going to,
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:27.040]   I don't know, Burlock. I'm trying to think of something comes before S in the alphabet that
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:32.800]   sort of works because these are for older Macs. And so even though they can't sort of compete
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:37.840]   necessarily with the most modern things, they can say, "Well, you got another old Mac there that
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:43.680]   you might want to use as a secondary display. So here's this feature." I haven't actually used Sidecar
[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:51.440]   very often. Have any of you really dug into it or use it regularly or even Luna displays
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:57.440]   functionality? Do any of you use it pretty regularly? I use Luna display a lot, but I don't,
[01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:02.080]   I've never used Sidecar because I don't have a Mac that supports it. I have several Catalina
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:08.960]   Macs, but I don't have a modern enough Mac to do it. Fuey. Now Laurie, you were about to say
[01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:16.080]   that you... Yes, I've used them both. And they're both absolutely fantastic. We've even written
[01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:22.400]   about this on iMore. They are for different types of people. If you are the kind of person who has
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:28.320]   never really used a second screen for your computer, it's not really something that's important to
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:35.600]   you or a big deal. And now it's already on your Mac, then you want Sidecar because you never really
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:42.320]   needed it before, so why not? It's bare bones. It does what you need it to do and it does it really
[01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:48.800]   well, but it doesn't have any bigger additional features, whereas the Luna allows you to have
[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:55.920]   additional features for artists. So it allows you a lot more manipulation using your iPad screen
[01:51:55.920 --> 01:52:05.200]   than Sidecar does. They're now working toward adding it to Windows and now with Mac to Mac,
[01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:11.920]   so that you can use it on older Macs that Sidecar doesn't support, they wrote a blog a few weeks back
[01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:20.240]   about how... I think it was something like lessons we've learned as a company about what happens when
[01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:26.720]   Apple Sherlock's your big thing. And it was really insightful because a lot of it was...
[01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:33.360]   we did this really amazing, awesome thing and we felt honored and privileged that Apple was
[01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:38.800]   interested in looking at it and later realized that, oh, they just wanted to do their own version of
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:42.880]   this super awesome thing that we're already doing. And some of the mistakes they were saying they
[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:51.120]   made along the way was focusing so heavily on Apple-only products. And now they've got other
[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:56.640]   products in the pipeline, they've already started doing R&D to get them on track to not be so
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:53:06.960]   exclusive to Apple products. So Luna is definitely... it's weird to say better than a Sidecar but it
[01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:13.360]   really is. And it's because Sidecar is really for people who don't really need something like Sidecar
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:20.160]   whereas Luna display is for people who need more, they need for artists, for graphic designers and
[01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:25.760]   things like that. It's better suited for those kinds of things. But that's the same point.
[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:31.360]   If you're not a graphic designer, if you're not an artist, you probably were never going to get
[01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:36.880]   Luna display in the first place. So here you have Sidecar that just makes it so that your Mac and
[01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:41.600]   your MacBook Pro can talk to each other side by side or your MacBook Pro and your iPad can
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:48.880]   talk to each other side by side. So that's it. Okay. Well folks, break time is almost over but
[01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:57.120]   that doesn't mean the fun has to end. After this show, you can catch me and Jason Snell talking
[01:53:57.120 --> 01:54:06.320]   about everything iOS, watch OS, TVOS, iPadOS, all the OS's. It's iOS today. And this morning I had
[01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:14.000]   him on and in the studio and we talked about getting the most out of your... of the base photo
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:20.400]   features that are built into your iOS devices and your Mac as well. He's about to... he just
[01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:25.440]   finished up a book that goes into the Photos app in detail and talks about all the new stuff that's
[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:32.080]   come in iOS 13. So it's pretty interesting stuff there. And then of course I could not have him on
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:40.000]   and not talk about ultra wide band. I am fascinated with the U1 chip and the iPhone and Jason Snell
[01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:47.760]   got to talk to one of the other manufacturers of an ultra wide band chip. And so we got really
[01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:53.360]   excited. We waxed ecstatic about the future of ultra wide band. So for everything you need to
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:58.240]   know for your iPhones, your iPads and your Apple watches, be sure to check out iOS today.
[01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:03.120]   I'm also excited to tell you that this week's episode of Mac Break Weekly is brought to you by
[01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:08.240]   Zapier. By the way, this is the dance that I do for Zapier every time I talk about Zapier.
[01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:14.160]   Apparently the folks over at Zapier enjoy my little Zapier dance. Zapier can make you happier with
[01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:21.200]   these incredible automations and workflows. You know, growing a business is hard. You start with
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:25.840]   that domain name we told you about earlier. But you don't want to be wasting hours after that every
[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:31.840]   day moving data from emails to spreadsheets to your CRM to wherever it needs to go. Does it need to
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:36.240]   go in Slack? Do you need to send out messages? Do you need to post it to the internet? Wherever it
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:40.000]   needs to go, you don't want to waste time doing that. Shouldn't all that stuff just work for you?
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:47.440]   Well, that's where Zapier comes into play. So Zapier has over 1500 apps and is the easiest way
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:53.440]   to automate your work so that you can focus on what matters most. You get to connect all of your
[01:55:53.440 --> 01:56:00.320]   software together and make some magic happen. So I have talked before, bragged about using Zapier
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:05.520]   for all of its different functionality because I've used it here at Twit. One of the ways that
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:14.560]   we use it is on Thursdays part of our show involves a prompter. And we use a Google spreadsheet,
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:18.640]   which is where we sort of have the rundown available. And we have it set up so that the
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:25.280]   the plain text of the document is stored in one location. And we need to put this into a special
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:30.880]   folder and Dropbox in order for it to be pulled up on the prompter. So I've made it possible so that
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:39.040]   there with Zapier, it looks to a particular folder in my Google Drive. And anytime a document gets
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:43.360]   dropped into that Google folder, no matter what it is, if it's a text, if it's a PDF, if it's whatever,
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:49.280]   it converts that document to plain text and then takes that text document and shifts it over to
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:54.560]   Dropbox and drops it there so that it's right in that prompter script folder where it needs to be.
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:57:00.000]   All I have to do is copy some text, make a new document, and then I'm done. And I was just thinking
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.880]   on my literally on my way home from work the other day, I bet I could go even farther with that. And
[01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:10.960]   that's because Zapier has multi step zaps. So the possibilities are endless. You're not just doing
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:15.600]   one thing and then having it do, you know, one thing happens and then it's having it trigger
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:19.360]   another thing. You can have one thing happen that triggers one thing that does another thing
[01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:24.240]   and even get down into some conditional stuff. So only when this happens make this next thing
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:34.240]   happen. It's great for all sorts of automations. In fact, Leo uses it. He can go into his pinboard
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:40.240]   and save a document and then it automatically gets posted into a spreadsheet that the producer
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:44.720]   can check and see what stories he's been reading, what stories he wants to talk about. And I think
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:48.400]   that's something I'm going to need to set up too because it's a pretty neat feature there.
[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:52.560]   So you can build the solution that you need in minutes. There's no more wasting time on tasks
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:57.440]   that you know could be automated because that's exactly what Zapier was built to do. You go to
[01:57:57.440 --> 01:58:03.200]   Zapier dot com slash Mac break, you connect the apps you use most and let Zapier take it from there.
[01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:07.600]   Best of all, it's easy to build the exact solution you need in minutes without writing code or
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:12.960]   asking a developer for help. No more of that. The functionality is so simple. You just go in,
[01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:17.360]   you tell them the apps and in fact, they even have some suggestions for you, which I found fun.
[01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:22.560]   I was like, okay, so I connect my Google Drive and now suddenly there are six different projects
[01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:26.880]   that I realize I can work on. So I'm of course doing my Zapier dance, getting excited about the
[01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:32.480]   next big thing and on my way home from work thinking of new zaps I get to build. You can make more
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:38.080]   time to grow your business right now through November, try Zapier free by going to Zapier dot

[01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:53.680]   Once again, Zapier dot com slash Mac break. Head there, get inspired, make some zaps and be sure to
[01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:58.000]   tell me about them because I will get excited about those zaps and I'll be doing the Zapier dance.
[01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:04.800]   Thank you, Zapier for sponsoring this week's episode of Mac break weekly. Oh, how long I have
[01:59:04.800 --> 01:59:12.160]   watched Mac break weekly and wished I was part of the show to share my pick of the week. I'm so
[01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:17.440]   excited for this. Oh, this is this is this is fun. This is fun. Is it still magical now that you've
[01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:22.480]   seen inside the glitter factory? Yeah, because what happened is that I thought it was a glitter
[01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:27.120]   factory, but it's a sausage factory and that's just a whole different thing. But the fact is I do
[01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:32.720]   like sausage. So we're okay, you know, it's okay. We're good. I'm right here in Petaluma. I bet they
[01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:38.080]   make good chicken sausage here. Now that I think about it, Petaluma has, oh, I'm getting the thumbs
[01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:43.920]   up. They do make good sausage here and through it is telling me. So there you go. You know what?
[01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:51.040]   I don't want to go first. I think I want Lori to share her pick first. So Lori, tell us what you
[01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:58.160]   got for us. Yeah, so it's it's a little bit of a self promotion. If you will, I'm more and actually
[01:59:58.160 --> 02:00:04.880]   all of the future labs websites have turned on dark mode today. It's very exciting for me and
[02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:11.360]   very excited for us. Everybody's going dark right now and we finally have managed to get on board
[02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:20.000]   with it. So if your computer is already enabling, if it's already enabled in dark mode, as soon as
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:25.520]   you go to the site, you're just automatically in dark mode. Isn't that gorgeous? It's so pretty.
[02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:31.520]   And it looks like yellow looks good with the dark. It does. Yeah. And it was a lot of work in the
[02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:37.840]   back end. The team that built this and made this happen across all of the future lab sites. It was
[02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:43.200]   a lot of work in a labor of love. And I'm so glad we finally did it. So visit i'more.com with dark
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:49.360]   mode on your computer. Or you can manually enable it if you go up into our the menu bar in our top
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:53.440]   corner. That's another way that you can access dark mode to either turn it off or on depending on
[02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:58.320]   what your preference is. But if you're interested in seeing it, go there. That is an excellent pick.
[02:00:58.320 --> 02:01:04.960]   I love dark mode. Dark mode's fun. Me too. Yeah. Andy and Nato, I'm excited about your pick because
[02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:09.360]   this is something that I have shared with all of my family members as often as I possibly can. And
[02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:14.960]   my grandma loves this. She, yeah, her mailbox is a little bit farther away from her. And so
[02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:19.120]   she loves this. What is your pick? I don't want to give, I didn't want to spoil. Yeah. Well, I was
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:22.960]   talking earlier about like features that were in my iPad that I didn't know until I read the manual.
[02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:26.880]   Well, it turns out that the United States Postal Service is adding features to your
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:31.520]   physical inbox as well that you may not know about. I just found out about this a couple of weeks
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:36.640]   ago and it signed up for it. There's this service called informed delivery, which is a free service
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:42.640]   you go to informeddelivery.usps.com and sign up for free. You give them an email address. And then
[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:49.360]   from that point onward, every piece of every letter and every package that is headed to your address
[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:56.240]   if it's been scanned by an automated delivery system will just appear in this online dashboard.
[02:01:56.240 --> 02:02:04.480]   So if you've got a PO box that's a town over or if you just don't get your mail more than
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:09.120]   twice or three times a week, you can actually go to sign in, go to the website. It will show you
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:14.240]   pictures of every letter-sized piece of mail you've got coming. I'm not talking about tracking
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:18.240]   numbers I've talked about, but you will see actual images. So you know, oh, I'll be darned. That
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:22.480]   person that I've been pestering and invoicing for the past nine months actually sent me a check.
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:26.400]   I'm definitely going to go downstairs and pick that up now. Right. It's not just junk mail. I finally
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:32.400]   have to mail. Yeah, exactly. I mean, because that really is the thing. Like, I'm out of the habit of
[02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:36.960]   like, Oh, boy, here comes the mail person. Let's see if my package from Battle Creek, Michigan is here.
[02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:44.880]   My styrofoam airline from Cheerios boxtops. It's more like, Oh, great. Here's like 18 more offers
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:51.200]   from Capital One. You're 22 more offers from like capital capital, whatever, but I don't exactly
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:55.440]   is like there's like every single like letter size thing is like this piece of junk mail from
[02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:59.600]   this other company or whatever. But but you can see like, okay, actually, there is something down
[02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:04.240]   there that's worth actually coming down and collecting. There's a check or there's something like that
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:09.520]   looks like a bill that I don't know is coming and it doesn't look like a credit card offer. This
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:14.080]   design to trick me to thinking it's a bill and I should open it up. You also get free tracking of
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:20.880]   every package, whether it's been whether it has tracking the tracking charge applied to it or not.
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:25.600]   So if you if there's an eBay thing that's coming in or just something candy coming in from you,
[02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:29.920]   get because you're a great person and your family loves you, you'll just you can see that, Oh,
[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:33.680]   look, there's a package that's coming in. It should be here on Tuesday. And then for right there
[02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:36.800]   from the dashboard, you can say, you actually delivered on Wednesday or Thursday instead,
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:41.440]   because I'm not going to be home. I don't want to freeze or melt or have one of my neighbors steal it.
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:45.840]   And again, this is like completely free. It's not something that you have to have a special app for
[02:03:45.840 --> 02:03:51.920]   or that you have to be special like USPS Prime annual delivery. It's like just just the idea of
[02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:58.640]   like having a dashboard on my phone where I can see pictures of all my mail. That's just that's
[02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:04.480]   just fun. That's all that you have is exactly how I feel about it. It is it's just it's kind of a joy.
[02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:10.000]   And you're and again, if they're willing to give it to you for free and you're you can take it for fun.
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:14.880]   There you go. There you go. All right, Renee. What is your pick?
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:23.360]   So I'm wearing my pick on my head. It's the new Beats Solo Pro because everything is pro now.
[02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:29.840]   And they are the latest generation of the on ear, not around the ear, not in ear, not over the ear.
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:35.120]   These are just on the ear. They're not my favorite kind of headphone. I vastly prefer
[02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:40.320]   either in ear or over the ear headphones, but I know a lot of people like these as well.
[02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:46.160]   And what's new with them is first they have the Apple H1 chip. So they pair as elegantly as
[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:51.680]   second generation AirPods. And they also switch between your Apple devices just as easily.
[02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:58.080]   They will work as Bluetooth devices on everything else. But if you have iOS or Mac OS or watch OS,
[02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:03.360]   they'll give you that extra little bit of seamlessness. They pair as soon as as you open them,
[02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:08.800]   they're on when you close them, they're off. They also have what Apple's calling adaptive noise
[02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:13.440]   canceling. It's not just active noise canceling, but they try to model your ears. So if you have hair
[02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:18.560]   or earrings or they're a skew, they're not perfectly on your ear, they'll try to overcome that and
[02:05:18.560 --> 02:05:24.960]   still give you ideal noise canceling. They also have a transparency mode. So you can let some of
[02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:32.160]   the outside world in computationally. It's not the real outside world, but it's a filtered version of
[02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:38.400]   it. Or you can just turn ANC off and listen as you would a regular set of non-actively noise
[02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:43.520]   canceling on ear headphones. And they come in a nice range of colors. There's black, white,
[02:05:43.520 --> 02:05:50.080]   gray, and also some more matte versions, which are red, light, blue, and dark blue. They're pricey.
[02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:56.320]   They started, well, they are $300, which is a lot. But in the active noise canceling,
[02:05:56.320 --> 02:06:01.920]   big old stylish headphone space, that's a fairly active price. I don't think they're enough to
[02:06:01.920 --> 02:06:07.600]   tear anybody away from their lifelong love of bows or Sony if they're already ensconced in those.
[02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:13.680]   But if you love you some H1 chip steadiness and you like the beats, in the words of Lori
[02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:18.560]   Gill, they've sort of grown up. They're not quite as rebellious with the basses they used to be.
[02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:23.280]   They're sort of a little more mature with it now. So if you like those beats that beat sound,
[02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:28.720]   you want active noise cancellation, and you want all the latest and greatest pairing technology,
[02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:36.000]   then you have the Beats Solo Pro now. Excellent. Beats Solo Pro. And in that lovely color,
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.960]   I'm just a little disappointed they don't have a midnight green. That would be nice.
[02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:46.480]   Well, they have moss green. If they could release their headphones in the same colors as the Apple
[02:06:46.480 --> 02:06:52.000]   watches, that would be great. They don't ever line up with that though. Although the moss green
[02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:57.280]   power beats might be similar. Yes, I would say so. That's probably it. That's last year's model.
[02:06:57.280 --> 02:07:09.280]   Oh, so last year. Speaking of green, I am, first of all, you can't feel this because you can't
[02:07:09.280 --> 02:07:13.520]   smell this because we don't have smell-o-vision set up yet. Although I asked Leo to get on that.
[02:07:13.520 --> 02:07:19.760]   But right now there's this beautiful lovely aroma in the air. And that's not the Sonoma aroma,
[02:07:19.760 --> 02:07:25.760]   which is a very bad thing that nobody warned me about until I moved here. Thanks a lot. But this
[02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:34.160]   is a real actual good aroma. And it's the smell of fresh, well, not fresh leather, but the smell of
[02:07:34.160 --> 02:07:41.040]   real leather. All of the people out there who are like, that is a cow you're holding. I understand,
[02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:47.760]   but it does smell very good. This is a water field that's SF bags made in San Francisco. So right
[02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:57.200]   nearby, this beautiful leather bag, which you can already see it peeking out. Hello. Hello. Look at
[02:07:57.200 --> 02:08:03.760]   that beautiful green color. This bag is, let's see what it's called, it's called the Musetto or
[02:08:03.760 --> 02:08:09.680]   Mazzetto leather bag. It's a sling, which I know Renee, I know I'm not supposed to wear it on one
[02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:14.480]   shoulder. I know you can wear two. You can wear one on each side. This is this is true. And also
[02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:19.520]   with this, it's not big enough to where I would be loading it down with a whole lot of stuff. So
[02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:27.040]   I got the medium size, which is, I think it's big enough to hold the 13-ish inch laptop,
[02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:33.040]   but that's not something that I would put inside. Instead, inside I would put my phone,
[02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:38.880]   put some of my wallet and things like that. But it's got this beautiful padded pocket inside that
[02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:44.000]   has a nice place for my phone to slide in. And these pockets go all the way down to the bottom.
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:50.320]   The closure on it is magnetic, which is nice. So I can easily just flip it down and then we're done.
[02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:56.720]   It's got a zippered pocket on the inside where there's more storage space. And the inside is a
[02:08:56.720 --> 02:09:03.200]   beautiful orange color, which pairs well with the green exterior. And have I talked about the smell?
[02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:07.280]   Oh my God, it smells so good, which I'm sad because eventually that's another show title, please.
[02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:10.320]   Have I talked about the smell? Have I talked about the smell?
[02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:17.440]   So I'm very excited about using this and as I continue to use it and it wears down and it'll
[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:25.040]   only get better with age, as they say. So this is the Mizzetto leather bag from Waterfield, but
[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:33.440]   they also go by SF Bags. Now the small is 269. The medium is 289 and the large is 299. So it is an
[02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:42.160]   expensive thing, but real leather we've got going here and very well made right here in San Fran,
[02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:48.560]   Cisco. So yeah, I've had this in my home as I'm getting ready to start to load it down with
[02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:54.720]   stuff. I've got to switch out of my usual sling into this and any room I put it in is like an
[02:09:54.720 --> 02:10:02.000]   air fresher. And I'm with you, people might thinking, oh my God, there's so much money to spend on a bag.
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:08.480]   But I finally visited in person a bag that I've been a big fan of for like a few years now,
[02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:17.920]   because I was in New York City, the Filson Fieldbag. And it's expensive, but if it's something that
[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:26.000]   you are actually, I use a laptop bag or your basic everyday carry bag every single day of my life.
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:32.240]   And when I think about how great it is to have something that's built to last,
[02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:36.160]   that will actually weather with time and that 10 years later, it's not going to be like the
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:41.200]   third or fourth or fifth bag I'll have. It'll be the one bag that's been part of my life for the
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:47.120]   past 10 years. You forget, you buy it only when you can afford it, but after you bought it,
[02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:52.480]   you immediately forget about how much you paid for it because there's such a thing as a buy it
[02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:57.360]   for life transaction. And it's always a worthy thing when you do that right.
[02:10:57.360 --> 02:11:00.080]   I agree. Yeah, one bag to rule them all.
[02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:06.160]   Everyone's busy arguing about the Peter McKinnon bag right now, so we can buy that strategy.
[02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:12.160]   I, I, I, well, 300 bucks, but it's a one carry all or some things more than that, but whatever.
[02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:16.960]   I don't know about you, but I've run the calculations and I believe that brings us
[02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:24.640]   to the end of a, of another episode of Mac Break Weekly. Andy and not co, thank you so much for
[02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:29.520]   having me on the show. You were lovely. You were, I was just ripping. I was just
[02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:35.280]   drawing. It shows you how quick the rapport between us was formed that I found, nope,
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:39.760]   I knew that you weren't going to start crying that well, I tend that I could, you know,
[02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:45.520]   it's, it's lovely. This is going to be a lovely time having you here, taking care of the hosting
[02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:50.000]   duties for the next month. I'm looking forward to every single one of our hope we have a ice cream
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:53.600]   cake for you at the very last week. Of course, I can't arrange that myself, but that's something
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:58.720]   that cost and might want to consider. Uh, question. I'll put it. I'll put it five bucks.
[02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:04.000]   I'll sign the card. You write that down. It's got to be a dairy free one though. So, uh, you know,
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:09.200]   hop on that. Thank you. Well, you don't necessarily have to share it with you. So we could just for
[02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:13.440]   the rest of us, you can watch us eat it. We'll do that. It's dairy, but it won't be free.
[02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:22.160]   Uh, Andy and Akko, uh, if, if folks are, I don't know if, um,
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:29.280]   Yeah, no, I'm on a, yeah, I'm going to be on a GPH again this Friday. They're most Fridays.
[02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:33.760]   This time is going to be one 20 ish 20 minutes past one of the afternoon talking to my usual
[02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:39.040]   tech slot. We're also going to be at the Boston Public Library studio. So if you're in Boston,
[02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:43.600]   come on and buy, you can watch and get coffee and get a, getting peanut butter cookie at the, uh,
[02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:49.440]   at the coffee shop, uh, and watch the live version of the show, which I again gesture a lot with my
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:53.920]   hands, even though I'm on the radio. Actually, actually, I'm going to be, I'm going to be sure,
[02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:58.720]   as I sometimes feel the need to do, I'm going to be showing off something that's visual and
[02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:03.760]   trying to describe it in a theater of the era sort of thing because I, because I think that it's,
[02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:08.640]   it's a fun enough feature of the pixel for the live transcription that I really do want to talk
[02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:13.040]   about it a little bit. I heard you give great tours. So one of these times I need to come, uh,
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:16.480]   certainly, so the report was telling me you give great tours. So I need to come to Boston to get
[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:20.240]   a tour from you at some point. If you come to Boston, you will get a great tour from you. You'll,
[02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:24.000]   you'll get such a tour from me that you will wish that you hadn't. That's how good the tour you'll
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:31.280]   get away Shakespeare is meant to be. Lori dark mode Gil. Thank you for, for being here, for having

[02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:45.600]   on Twitter and at Lori Gill on the other social things. Is that how that goes?
[02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:50.720]   Yeah, you got it. You know me anything you want to, you want to plug throughout there?
[02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:55.120]   No, I'm still just headed to boot a con apparently a couple of weeks. That's it.

[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:12.560]   practically? You can find me at Renee Richie and all the socials and my latest video is one of my
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:19.200]   happiest. It's a collab with Lori Gill where she joined me to review the Beats solo pro because
[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:23.440]   she knows his music the way she can describe music like nobody's business. It was like I could,
[02:14:23.440 --> 02:14:29.120]   I could feel the music when she was talking about it. It was great. Please, yeah, check her out.
