[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.880]   This is Twit.

[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.080]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 11 for October 17, 2006.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.080]   I Phone Home.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:51.360]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, your weekly look
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.320]   into the world of Macintosh computers and phones.
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.840]   And with us today, the woman who was on the very first Mac
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.680]   Break Weekly-- we haven't seen her in 10 episodes,
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.760]   but we're glad she's back.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.320]   Amber Mac.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.080]   Hello there.
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.560]   She has to be on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.520]   She's got the name for it.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.720]   I do have a pretty good name.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.720]   It's a good name for someone who's a big Mac fan.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.920]   It is, yeah.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.280]   It's Amber MacArthur, but did you--
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.200]   like when you became a Mac person,
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.560]   did you shorten it, or were you always Amber Mac?
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.080]   Well, the truth is, is that I really
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.280]   wanted a short domain name, and Amber Mac seemed to work,
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.880]   and I was able to get that.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.080]   So it just ended up working out well
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.080]   in a lot of different ways.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.960]   She's so with it.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.880]   She changes her name to match her domain.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.280]   Merlin, man, we're going to call him 43 from now on.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.040]   Actually--
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.400]   My given name is Merlin XP at night.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.920]   That would be sad.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.840]   That would be-- so you'd have to change your name.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.400]   Merlin is 40, actually, so we can just turn 40.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.480]   Happy birthday.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.800]   Oh, then November.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.440]   Give me another month.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.760]   Oh, you're not there yet?
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.760]   I'm getting there very soon.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.240]   When's your birthday?
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.280]   I don't remember.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.400]   See, this is the problem.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.900]   Yeah.
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.600]   It's some time--
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.600]   Why not Wikipedia right now?
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.000]   Definitely on there, isn't it?
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.840]   You can start the entry, Amber.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.840]   You know, it's great, because I'm going to turn 50 in November.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.200]   I think you do real well.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.680]   For someone my age?
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.280]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.280]   Thank you.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.520]   You pretty much, yeah.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.040]   I get around still.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.080]   I got the Walker.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.960]   Scott Born is also here for my life zone.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.000]   I'm the newest member of the Twit family.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.880]   Scott's good to talk to you.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.360]   Thank you.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.680]   And having shoes older than all of you,
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.600]   I'm feeling quite--
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.080]   You're not that old, Scott.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.680]   Come on.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.360]   But you are the grandmaster here.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.440]   We've got 30, 40, 50, and Scott.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.160]   52, stop it.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.720]   I see you're not that old.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.240]   See what I'm saying?
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.880]   You're not in double ARP yet.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.360]   No, but I'm pretty darn close.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.960]   I am getting the special meals.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.800]   That's nice.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.760]   You know who is five years old,
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.240]   coming up on Monday, the iPod celebrating its birthday,
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.680]   October 23, 2001.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.080]   I still have a first generation iPod,
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.760]   and it looks pretty clunky next to the new ones I have to say.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.920]   Yeah, totally.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.600]   You remember your first iPod?
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.080]   Oh, God.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.160]   My first iPod, I think it was $7,000.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.760]   It had-- it helped 256K, if I remember.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.880]   And it weighed about 14 pounds.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.760]   Well, that was not including the battery pack.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.440]   Well, the battery pack you had to wear on your back.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.960]   Right.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.960]   Remember that?
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.960]   We strapped it on, yeah.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.960]   No, you're absolutely right.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.040]   It's incredible, especially looking at my wife's nano next to my original white iPod.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.000]   It's just unbelievable.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.360]   What was your first iPod, Amber?
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.360]   Do you remember?
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.960]   Yeah, I think I was actually with you on call for help.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.040]   And when I got the iPod mini.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.040]   The pink mini?
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.600]   That was your first one, huh?
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.520]   That was the first one that I got.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.720]   And yeah, I was a big fan of that for quite a while.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.680]   And I don't have a nano yet, but I'm going to get one because it's just so small and
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.680]   slick.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.840]   The new nanos are basically shrunk minis.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.600]   Yeah, they really are.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.600]   So they're just a lot better.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.960]   And I don't know if you remember, I took my iPod mini apart with the hair dryer.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.360]   It didn't change the battery.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.560]   And then it's never been the same.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.000]   I used the tweezers to open it up.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.360]   Is it kind of loose?
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.520]   Like the parts are just kind of rattly?
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.520]   It's quite loose.
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.080]   It looks kind of sick because the glue is kind of over the sides of the iPod.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.240]   Kind of like my power book when I took that apart as well.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.600]   So I think the reason Amber left call for help is because she just wanted some of her
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.080]   equipment to continue working.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.800]   She kept drilling holes and things and taking apart things and frying eggs.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.000]   Didn't you cook an egg with what was that with?
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.920]   Well, that was part of our sort of mythbusters thing where we were trying to see if we could
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.320]   cook an egg with two cell phones.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.320]   And it definitely doesn't work.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.800]   But for some reason, it seemed like a good idea to try it and do it as a segment.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.160]   You stay there a long, long time.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.520]   Now at City TV, so they don't make you do anything like that, do they?
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.680]   No, no eggs involved.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.280]   You just have to exchange emails with crazy Spanish guys working for Kim Yijang Yule.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.160]   Yes, that was bizarre, I have to say.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.720]   It was her story yesterday and it was really weird.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.080]   This guy from Spain is becoming like the chief propaganda minister on the internet for Korea,
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.080]   North Korea.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.800]   Yeah, he started running their site in the year 2000 and he's kept it up and he dresses
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.760]   up in military uniforms for North Korea.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.280]   So he's a bit of a fanboy.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.360]   I want a big hat.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.280]   I want the Banana Republic hat.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.880]   They have those big generals hats like Noriega hat.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.080]   Those are cool.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.000]   So the interesting article in MacRumors.com talking about the first iPod and I didn't
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.320]   know this, but Phil Schiller suggested the scroll wheel interface and also he was the
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.840]   one who said menus should go faster the longer the wheels turned.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.000]   I think those are the key inventions that make the iPod what it is today.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.200]   It works really good, Leo.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.800]   I'm somebody who bought one of the first ones and it still works.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.640]   Oh, yeah, my first gen is still working, although who wants a five gig iPod that weighs
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.960]   as much as a brick?
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.720]   I actually use it as a backup drive when I'm on the road.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.920]   That's a good idea.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.560]   There was a somewhere this week I got a quote that was attributed to jobs that whether or
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.080]   not it's true is a good quote.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.640]   Which is something along the lines of the design is more than about the way something looks.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.720]   It's about the way that it feels and the way that it works.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.000]   I think that's really true of the iPod.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   And now more than ever.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.520]   I guess I feel like again I'm still discovering little updates on my iPod.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.320]   That ability to fly through a list really fast and another letter shows up.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.480]   Little things like that.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.840]   It just seems to me that there are not to be a fanboy here, but it seems like they're
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.200]   really watching the way people use this stuff and finding those points where people hang
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.800]   up and then just lightly sanding off those edges a little bit at a time.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.800]   That's a new feature though.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.040]   That's the new iPod with the letters show up.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.040]   That's right.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.960]   I did a segment on that if you remember on copper help how to get the old iPod to be
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.960]   dead.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.280]   I know like three days before they put this out and it was a great segment because was
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.760]   it was that from life hacker?
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.760]   You create.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.640]   Yeah it's from life hacker where you got to make all the yeah I did that it was such
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.640]   a pain.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.640]   And then me too.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.040]   And then apple fixes it.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.920]   Well that's all right because that's just kind of in the grand tradition of call for
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.800]   help doing stuff that for it airs is now completely obsolete.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.400]   Like YouTube like YouTube.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.800]   Hey you discovered YouTube you get credit.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.800]   Yeah right.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.160]   Doesn't Steve Chen give you credit though for being the first TV show TV person to show
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.160]   YouTube on the air.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.160]   Yeah he might.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.560]   Man if that's possible yeah I have to say and he wrote me I wrote him the other day
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.680]   and he wrote me back an email and he said yeah things are great we're really excited
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.640]   you said how's life with you and I haven't written a back yet because I just can't compete.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.160]   Was it covered with money was it just like dripping dollar bills off of it as it came
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.160]   in the mail?
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.160]   I don't know.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.240]   Five billion house life.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.960]   Things are going pretty well here.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.520]   Yeah just sold the company for one point six five billion yeah.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.880]   Oh wait that was an understatement.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.800]   That's okay things are okay.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.720]   Jobs is on the cover of this week's Newsweek to celebrate the anniversary of the iPod.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.320]   The front has a picture of Steve holding up his iPod looking kind of scarily ominous as
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:02.360]   he looks over the top of it and the title headline is iPod therefore I am.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:08.240]   How does Newsweek get away with this kind of I mean I'm a fan boy but that's ridiculous.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.080]   Here's the best quote though.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.560]   They asked him about the zoom.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.840]   Steve says I've seen the demonstrations on the internet about how you can find another
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.640]   person using a zoom and give them a song that they can play three times.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.640]   It takes forever by the time you've gone through all that the girls got up and left.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.400]   You're much better off to take one of your earbuds out and put it in her ear.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.480]   Then you're connected with about two feet of headphone cable.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.480]   Oh creepy.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.840]   Steve Jobs pick up techniques.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.160]   Amber what do you think?
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.880]   Steve settles up to you and says here listen it gives you one of his earbuds.
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:40.880]   Put this in your ear.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.880]   Put this in your ear.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.600]   Yeah that's a little creepy even though I do like Steve Jobs.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.480]   If he licks it it's a wet willy isn't it?
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:54.120]   Oh no we could have gone all show without hearing that.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.000]   I would want to have some eye protection if I was going to put that in.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.560]   I don't want anybody putting an earbud in my ear that he's been using.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.320]   Yeah I guess maybe he has a way with women though you know he might get a little more
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:11.800]   slack because he has Steve Jobs and but I think it's pretty gross.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.080]   Steve Jobs pick up lines.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:20.320]   One bad story about the iPod this week in fact it just broke moments before we go to
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.480]   press.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:27.080]   It turns out that they've been shipping iPods with a Windows virus on it.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.080]   Did you see that?
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.080]   Yeah.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.440]   Yeah that's a little bit of an embarrassment and you know it's a really special feature
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.440]   that doesn't cost anything extra and you get to experience a little bit of that blue screen
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.440]   of death on your iPod.
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:42.920]   Now they say it's less than one percent but I mean that still could be hundreds of thousands.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:48.360]   And it's a if you're not using a Mac you're not susceptible to Windows virus.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.440]   The Windows Ravemon E.exe.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.880]   So does that kick in if you go over with your iPod into Parallels or Bootcamp?
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.680]   Yes absolutely.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.200]   You'd get it on your Parallels but not on your Mac.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.800]   Just another reason not to try that.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.440]   A small number less than one percent of the video iPods is not any of the others not
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:17.840]   the nano available for purchase after September 12th carried the Windows Ravemon E.exe virus.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:23.200]   So that means I guess that the Chinese manufacturer had the virus.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.360]   It appears the virus propagates to a PC when iPod connecting the virus is double clicked
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.760]   in Windows Explorer.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.760]   It's a worm it doesn't spread through the network though.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:41.880]   It looks like a Daring fireball group or link to a story where there's been 25 or fewer
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.480]   as he points out reports of this showing up out in the wild.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.960]   So maybe just something they're just not discovering them yet.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.680]   Well Windows users are notorious for not noticing they've got virus.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.560]   That's normal behavior they're a margin.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.560]   That's unkind.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:01.160]   As long as we're doing iPod stories I'm actually curious what you think about this I'm playing
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:06.760]   the video right now Liverpool street mobile clubbing.com flash mob.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.200]   I have it about five.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.840]   You know what is a flash mob?
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:15.720]   That's one of which people organize themselves either online or usually it is online and
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.240]   they meet somewhere kind of that's quite planned in advance and they get together and they
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.480]   do something crazy like for instance in Toronto they have flash mobs where people get together
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.200]   they have a giant pillow fight in front of City Hall.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.120]   I like that.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.280]   It's pretty neat and they just organize themselves and meet up somewhere and do something crazy.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.280]   They usually shoot it and put it online.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.080]   Well you can go to YouTube and see this one.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:44.320]   It's mobile clubbing mobile dash clubbing.com and they tell you bring your iPod show up
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:53.800]   at a locale in this case it was looks like the Liverpool streets tube station in London
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:12:01.800]   and as soon as the clock strikes 1924 724 in the evening everyone starts dancing.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:07.920]   And they say spread out so that you don't be considered a mob I guess.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.160]   Wow that's neat and I actually I've seen some video for that and it's pretty impressive
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.480]   and there's such interesting flash mobs all over the world that there's just people doing
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.480]   it constantly.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.200]   I think this is what people hate web bloggers.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.160]   Have you ever been part of a flash mob?
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.160]   Anybody?
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.160]   Are you asking me?
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.160]   Anybody.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.800]   I'm a lonely man with nothing to do with that.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.960]   I know you sit in your basement with your specialty.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.080]   Well you know as you know they are I live my family lives in a hobo camp just outside
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:37.560]   of town and our means are modest but we I don't know.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.960]   I mean that's kind of cute but that's I mean you know the thing is it was really hilarious
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.360]   the first time somebody did it and then it became this thing where people were anticipating
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.360]   it.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.960]   Well it's fun to be part of though don't you think?
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.080]   How about you Amber have you ever been around did you see a flash mob ever?
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.080]   I don't actually want to join one I just want people to keep doing them so I can watch
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.480]   them on YouTube.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.200]   Amber's seen every video on YouTube you know I every once in a while run across something
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.080]   on YouTube and I think oh I should send this to Amber and I think oh no she's good.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:07.400]   So I sent her one the other day so yeah I saw that and it's it just takes a fun out.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.600]   This is your job right?
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.640]   You know it's kind of interesting because I as I've been told my job is really monitoring
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.960]   the internet and it's pretty damn big.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.960]   It's big.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:22.480]   It's big and there's a lot going on and if I miss anything it's not a good thing so I've
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.200]   been you know working pretty long hours to keep track of everything.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.320]   It's hard to keep track of the internet.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.600]   On your last day which won't be for many years I'm sure but on your last day I want
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:35.800]   you to come on and say I reach the end there's no more internet it's over I've been to the
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.200]   end and I've seen it it's over.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.200]   Then I'll actually be living in North Korea.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.080]   Yeah you might be wearing a big hat.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.840]   Big hat exactly.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.120]   Marrying Alejandro the fanboy.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.600]   Yeah well he was a character it was a really interesting.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:54.240]   What you could do Amber is you could say you found the very last tube.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.800]   Ah that's it.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.520]   It's a series of tubes.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.760]   And I could invite a flash bomb to meet me there.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.280]   Yes you know it's scaring this.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.080]   I'll no blog it.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:09.400]   Yeah Mo blogs whatever happened to Mo blogs.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.960]   I just so last month.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.320]   Last month I think it's last century.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:19.940]   I actually I still have a Mo blog because Amber and I interviewed Nakama which is a Mo
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:20.940]   blog company.
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:26.480]   They're just starting up a new Mo blog company and I've the only one uploading to it me
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.120]   and some lonely guy.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.120]   It's kind of sad.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.400]   Is this the thing that you were using Amber?
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.600]   It's an easy photo posting kind of thing.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.400]   Yeah it's the heaven that you said.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.840]   And you're using it all you know.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.120]   She hasn't actually posted anything.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.680]   This is what Amber does she sucks me into these sites.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.320]   Then she moves on and I'm stuck there.
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.120]   I still have a Vox account.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.640]   We can joke about the stuff all we want but I think this is going to be a huge source
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.840]   of growth as more people get phones that can do this stuff.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.160]   I mean and I you know I kid but I mean I do this stuff all the time.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.760]   I have a Flickr account where I post junk all the time.
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.840]   I admit I have taken pictures of my half eaten dessert and posted it.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:09.640]   But that was a big thing for a while is when I'm eating for dinner.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.640]   Here's my food.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.000]   I remember when text America started that was it.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.240]   It was like pictures of people's dinner.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.520]   Blogging is going to get interesting when we see the other end of that.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.800]   What's the other end of that?
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.800]   I don't know.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.880]   No that's not exactly what he had in mind Leo.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.120]   But anyway I think it's going to be a huge piece of growth.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.080]   As the 3G stuff gets out and people this band with opens up.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:36.480]   I mean the ability to post I'm the first time I was able to post to it was actually Vox.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.280]   Leo where I know you're up.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.280]   I'm a regular Voxer.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.280]   Yeah you are.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.360]   Yeah and the first time I was able to post video from my phone I just thought that was
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.360]   about the coolest thing ever.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.880]   So I think this is something we're going to see a lot more of.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:52.840]   I agree and you know the new phones like the Nokia N93 which actually have very high
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:57.080]   quality video and Wi-Fi are going to make a great platform for that.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.080]   I look at what my son does.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:04.000]   I got him a chocolate which is the LG phone that no one can figure out how to use it except
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   people under 12.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.480]   Well he's got it down.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.120]   It's got weird buttons that disappear and stuff.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.920]   I mean literally it's got disappearing buttons on it.
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.040]   And he takes movies.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.240]   They're filming like a mini jackass.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.240]   I'm not kidding on his phone.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:25.160]   Did you catch the story about when the plane went into the building in New York and Fox
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:29.280]   was first on I don't you might want to fact check me on this but I think Fox the local
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:33.280]   Fox affiliate somebody from Fox was first on the scene and they were shooting with trios.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.880]   They've given all their round trios and I guess they have some kind of a proprietary
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.160]   network or something where they're either got some pretty fat tubes to send this stuff
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.400]   to the studio.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.680]   But I mean basically it's brilliant.
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:46.040]   So you look at all these bloggers that are kind of air sets journalists while at the same
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.240]   time all the journalists are picking up all these tricks of bloggers.
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.320]   And that's fascinating to me.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.800]   Like the idea of the trio could be out there reporting the news.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:57.440]   Amber did a story though and I see an eye last week.
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:01.360]   Yeah and the plane crash and just what bloggers were doing because it was interesting if you
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.160]   were actually watching the blogs just after the plane crash they were updating almost
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.160]   faster than a lot of the news sites and yeah I did a segment.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.640]   It was interesting to watch.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.560]   There was a blogs like the Gothamist I think was the one that almost broke a couple of
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.560]   different stories.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.400]   Beautiful and they had beautiful images.
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.560]   I mean they were very dramatic images.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.120]   You know anything about how they're doing that fat video Amber?
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:26.760]   How they're getting like high quality video out of a small unit like that?
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.920]   No but it's a fantastic idea and I'm going to go pitch it as my own tomorrow.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.200]   Well somebody like Citi I mean I think that's brilliant of Fox.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:40.480]   Especially once these N93s come out with these high quality camera phones.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.480]   That's natural for news gathering.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.480]   It's just out there.
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.720]   So they actually gave you more phones?
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.720]   Say again?
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.560]   They gave people phones.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:53.320]   I think they've actually I mean again Mr. Fact Check but I'm pretty sure this is a podcast.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.560]   We don't have to check our facts.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.120]   Oh god thank what a relief.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.400]   Then we should talk about iPhones later.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.400]   We are going to.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.000]   I'm just teasing Scott by putting his story on.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.840]   Come on come on.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.160]   It's like stay and we just like keep wanting to make coffee while he's staring at the
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.160]   present.
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:13.640]   Oh I'm getting eggs for everybody before you sit down to open your presents Scott.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:17.080]   I'm just sitting here rocking back and forth.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:20.880]   But I think they gave them to all their news people and said hey here's this trio I think
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:25.680]   700W and they I again I don't know the details on this because I never learned the details
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.680]   on anything.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:30.160]   But I think the 700W's are like wired up in such a way.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.320]   I'm telling Amber go talk get you know get they've only on this.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.480]   Find out what's going on.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.480]   You guys need these.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.080]   Yeah I think we do.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.480]   This is a guy who works at Citi we should explain.
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.840]   We're going to have a group full of Toronto references now.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.840]   Sorry.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.840]   I love it.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:45.840]   Sorry.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.840]   Sorry.
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.960]   You know speaking of Ted Stevens I may be moving to Toronto I just learned that he is
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.040]   third in line for succession of the to the presidency.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.040]   What?
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.040]   This is that would do it.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.040]   This is that would do it.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:04.120]   Listen who's in Lexington line of course vice president Cheney Dennis Haster as the speaker
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:09.240]   of the house and then as president pro tem in the Senate Ted Stevens.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:13.520]   So it's it's Cheney Haster Stevens.
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.440]   That's going to get a special tube that takes him right to the White House.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.160]   Conda Lisa Rice is like way down the list.
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.160]   I don't know why.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.160]   Scott Scott it's not a truck.
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.960]   It's not a truck.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.360]   The Internet is not a truck.
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.720]   It's a tube.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.120]   It's a series of tubes.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.560]   I have that sound somewhere.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.920]   I should play that.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.800]   We yeah we had fun with it on a twit some months ago.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.240]   We got a lot of mileage out of that Ted Stevens and that couple of people wrote me and said
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.480]   you know he's been great for Alaska.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.960]   Well it's true.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:44.960]   All right.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:45.960]   All right.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:46.960]   We're not going to tease Scott anymore.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.440]   Thank you.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.440]   The iPhone.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:55.320]   Wouldn't be a Mac break weekly without an iPhone story and we've got three of them
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.880]   this week.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.880]   I'm ready.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.880]   I'm ready.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:03.000]   Nobody will sell you a brand new iPhone for this money than Apple.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.880]   So what do you want to start with the trademark application in some strange Eastern European
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.160]   nation?
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:14.880]   Trademarks are a great place to start because we know that the Apple IP as in intellectual
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:19.880]   property lawyers try to hold off on that stuff to the very last minute and that's because
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:23.720]   it's off that will trigger rumor sites going crazy.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.240]   I'm here to make the first prediction Leo.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:31.400]   When you and I are sitting at the keynote in January at Mac world we will see the new
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.400]   iPhone.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.360]   And you get to punch me really hard in the arm if you're right.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.560]   It's just so it's just so great the moment I've been waiting for.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:48.600]   Okay so it's a September 15th trademark filing in a I'm sorry far Eastern trademark office
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:55.040]   describing the iPhone as quote handheld and mobile digital electronic devices with ascending
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.040]   and receiving of telephone calls.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.040]   Ooh.
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.280]   It sounds like a Newton with an antenna.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:09.360]   Taxes, electronic mail and other digital data, MP3 and other digital format audio players.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:13.760]   It may also consist of electronic handheld units for the wireless receipt and or transmission
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.640]   of data that enable the user to keep track of or manage personal information.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.640]   Hmm.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:24.440]   That doesn't just put a smile on your face.
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:30.000]   And also they also trademarked a standalone video game machine.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Hmm.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.280]   But now the plot thickens because that's not all an analyst today.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:44.080]   In the let's see here it is the international business times story.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.880]   According to who was this?
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:53.000]   All equities, Jesse Tortura based upon our recent checks.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.080]   We expect Apple to unveil get ready.
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.560]   This is Scott's moment to crow.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:03.520]   Two models of its widely anticipated cell phones in early 2007.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:10.040]   I'm if I had any children I would rename them to iPhone born.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.440]   You know what?
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.800]   This thing is going to come out.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.400]   Scott's going to buy like four and he's going to hate it.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.000]   It's going to be awful.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.480]   And then we have to listen to him bitch and moan about it for another five episodes.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.480]   We've learned one model will be a smartphone including integrated keyboard.
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:31.240]   Sounds like a tree out video and music capability.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.640]   The other will be a slimmer phone with music capability and at least one of the models
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.640]   will include Wi-Fi.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:40.720]   You know when the analysts start saying it though it sounds like there may be some credence
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.720]   to this.
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.720]   No, wait a minute.
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.840]   You didn't when I started saying it you ignored it.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.360]   So when the analysts start saying it that's when you believe.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.160]   Well you could be if you were are you an analyst?
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.160]   I can analyze things.
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:55.200]   I guess why do I give analysts any any cloud at all?
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.200]   I just because I went to college they're speaking for Prudential though, right?
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.560]   This is a stayed firm.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.160]   They're not going to just kind of go off the cuff.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.160]   Are they?
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.840]   Amber, would you like an iPhone?
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:07.840]   Oh, you.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.840]   That's enthusiast.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:14.800]   I had no I have to say I don't know what it is but I've never.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:19.560]   I've never really gotten into phones and to surfing the web and you putting songs on my
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.560]   phone.
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.600]   I really I just love my laptop.
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:26.840]   I love my Mac book and to me a phone is just something that you end up talking on and that's
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:27.840]   pretty much it.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.120]   You like your new Samsung.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.480]   You were very excited when you got that.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.920]   I was excited when I got it.
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.680]   I don't like it as much anymore and that's just because I'm having trouble actually sending
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.080]   photos and videos from it.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:45.760]   But yeah, I do like it but I still can't totally get into the handheld devices because I carry
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:46.760]   my Mac book everywhere.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:47.760]   That's part of it as well.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.920]   I know said on city TV you have it with you always.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.720]   Apple's getting a lot of plugs.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:55.200]   Yeah, it's not easy getting a Mac book in there either.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.240]   I'm impressed Apple that must be very happy.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:02.680]   Yeah, it's not good at a new job to sort of refuse to use the PC on air because it's
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.680]   not cool.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.200]   Oh really they want you to use their windows laptop?
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.680]   Well, they originally yeah they did and I had to sort of explain to them that I'm a
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.720]   Mac user and I needed to preserve that reputation and they were great about it after a while
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.920]   but I'm sure they think I'm pretty good for you.
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.840]   She's doing her part to keep the Apple out there.
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.920]   I have to say it sounds like when they describe it just another phone.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.560]   Why Scott do you think this will be so much better?
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:30.560]   Well we've covered this probably to death but because it's going to sink number one,
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:35.320]   number two it's going to look, feel, taste, smell and sound like Apple.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.360]   Number two and number three I just want one.
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:42.480]   Now here's the third and I think the most intriguing story.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:49.200]   T-Mobile gave a press conference on Friday their chief executive Robert Dotson.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:55.200]   According to ABC News discussed at some length about how Apple and T-Mobile's visions seem
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.720]   to be aligned.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:04.680]   Like out of the blue he starts talking about Apple and says I really liked Leopard.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.000]   So interesting and Leopard.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.560]   To me this is where as long as we're going to speculate we might as well really get interesting
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:11.560]   about it.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:17.640]   We also saw this week where there's some speculation about portable user accounts in Leopard.
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:22.120]   This is where it gets really interesting because I've got to admit I'm with Amber.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:27.000]   I like the little whizziness of a new device and playing with it but when I really need
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.840]   to get something done I tend to want to do it on my Mac but this whole idea of taking
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:41.920]   sync to the next level and being able to treat your phone like a really big USB thumb drive
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:42.920]   almost.
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:46.080]   So that ability for example, so I'm imagining even a fairly light version of this where I
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:50.520]   could sync up all my preferences and my keychain and stuff like that.
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.120]   That's potentially kind of powerful.
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.560]   There are a number of products like that now on the Windows side that are doing exactly
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:56.560]   that.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:00.600]   They put them on a USB drive and all your settings, all your preferences, all your applications
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.160]   are on the USB drive, you go somewhere like work where they won't let you install anything
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.320]   you can still run your desktop in effect.
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.760]   Well that's taken to an extreme in Linux now where you can just run Firefox, run the
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.520]   whole nine off and you walk into a store and plug it in.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:18.400]   I guess I think what's fascinating here is, I mean I like thumb drives but ultimately
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.680]   the thing that I'm always going to carry with me when I go out as my hate to admit it but
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.800]   it's going to be like my wallet and my phone.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:24.800]   You know what I mean?
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.520]   It's something I could have with me anywhere.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:32.960]   So it makes perfect sense especially if your iPod becomes part of that trio.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:38.160]   Your wallet, your phone and then your phone is your iPod, it's your camera, it's your
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.680]   day timer, it's all of that stuff in one.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:45.240]   I'm on my fourth phone that theoretically plays music and stuff.
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.120]   I mean I like this music a lot more than most people do.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.200]   A lot of people are ragging it but the sprint phone they're throwing around.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:55.920]   But I mean that I got a palm, I had that Samsung, they're all fine but as a music player they're
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.920]   just it's pointless.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.680]   I don't know how, to buy it as a music player, like forget it.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.960]   I have a Windows media player on my phone.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:06.320]   That is such an awful thing to have on your phone.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.320]   Ew, I have to come now.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.200]   Ew, I don't want to have anything to do with you.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:15.480]   I have podcasts on my phone so that's kind of cool.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.360]   And so I can listen to podcasts.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:23.640]   In fact that's the new thing is a lot of people approach me everywhere I go saying we'd like
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.360]   to put Twitter on a phone.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.040]   It seems to be a very popular concept.
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.400]   Do you think people will actually listen to podcasts on a phone, Leo?
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.400]   I don't know.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.400]   I always when they say that I go that's nice.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.400]   Go ahead.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.560]   I don't go crazy over the idea.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:42.800]   At Podcast Expo a woman said so here's what we're going to do.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:49.600]   You will SMS us that you want to podcast and then we'll send you via SMS back a link
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.360]   and you'll click that link and the podcast will play.
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:56.120]   And I said and meanwhile you're harvesting my phone number and I'm going to start getting
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.120]   junk mail from you.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:00.120]   She said well you could.
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.280]   You joke is such an ugly word.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.760]   Junk is such a nasty word.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.600]   I think people are sensitive to that kind of thing.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.600]   They're not going to say anything.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.720]   I actually think the podcast are a terrific use of that.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.720]   I mean as much as this I think I always call it I want to call it a music but it's the
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.720]   LG music.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.720]   I mean it's actually it's kind of cool in some ways.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:21.240]   I mean like for a second like my trio will sync with missing sync I can pull stuff over
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.240]   like that.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.240]   I don't know if I could stream it.
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:26.520]   I had a two gigabyte card in my phone and I listened to Audible Books.
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.320]   I listened to podcasts and actually it is a perfect especially because it's a lo-fi
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.320]   device.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:35.480]   Although explain to me why you can't listen to them in your earpiece.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:39.600]   This is the you know or the little sister of that problem which is it's still baffling
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.680]   to me that I mean just for Joe consumer that I have to have some kind of special super
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.520]   super skinny little Jack to go in there.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.520]   Oh it's crazy.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.520]   Everything I've got that has a headphone.
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.520]   I've got to have this little.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.640]   We finally got the idea that you can charge with a USB jack so now finally we can use
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.760]   our USB you know connectors on the newer phones.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.200]   What about the I agree with you?
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.200]   You got to have an earpiece standard earpiece.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.760]   Can I ask a question here though?
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:05.240]   Okay so we have spent I think it's been about 19 weeks talking about the iPhone.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:10.960]   And we all I know it's because Scott God bless him but we sit around and we drool about
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.160]   the stuff that I'm not doing.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.160]   I'm not that interested.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:17.000]   Well I want to ask I we didn't plan this we didn't talk about this but I want to toss
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   this out.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.920]   And if there were going to be an iPhone you smart people who understand business what
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.720]   are really so we've got all the speculation that we're cobbling together.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:29.320]   But what are the real markers in the business community that this is something that's coming.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:33.240]   Like as somebody who's just kind of like reading rumor sites and rolling their eyes from what
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:37.320]   you guys have seen in the past where do you really watch to see the indicators that something
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.600]   is actually going to go to market.
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.600]   No business we're Mac user.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.960]   But do you understand what I'm saying though I mean is there is there any way to take this
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:48.520]   beyond just the complete speculation angle and are there are there.
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.880]   Well I think now we're I mean I agree with Scott as soon as they start trademarking and
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.800]   you see analysts saying this I think they're getting close.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.320]   What are the analysts now.
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.320]   More than Scott does.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:03.240]   I don't know Scott you're the closest to somebody who has business acumen in this room.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.240]   What do you think.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.520]   Well thank you I did an IPO I know a little bit about this.
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:08.520]   I think that you you did.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:09.520]   You did pets.com.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.880]   Okay thanks that was good that was good.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.760]   I got a sign up with it's name with your name on it Scott.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.760]   Merlin there's a special place for you as a result of that comment.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.560]   Yeah I did my time buddy I was in the trenches in Menlo.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:25.920]   Okay I saw my buddies dying.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.400]   I saw the best minds of my generation go down San Hill Road.
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:34.720]   Historical naked driving down Menlo Avenue crying late until the night.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.800]   The business so Scott business.
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:42.800]   The business tip off is like Leo said the trademark people don't go out and spend money
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.960]   on trademarks just for shooting the breeze.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:50.800]   Secondly there are a lot of other pieces which we have discussed as you say for 19 weeks
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.040]   even though we've been on the air for 12.
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:58.000]   That talk about things like well we have one little piece of the puzzle where Apple did
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.560]   a deal with a cell phone company.
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:03.280]   Then we have another little patent on a design application.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:08.760]   We see all this stuff coming it's pretty obvious it's going to happen and frankly it's one
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:14.680]   of those spaces that Apple has not quite up to snuff with the Windows world.
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:19.480]   Leo mentioned that all of his stuff is already available on Windows phones.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:23.080]   So circumstantial evidence plus business insight.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.080]   Well here's the deal.
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.080]   It isn't like a big order.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:29.400]   I'm going to give you 30 more seconds to talk about this lame-ass story and then we're
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.400]   going to move on.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:35.320]   Merlin here's what you got to know I'm going to buy you one of these phones and then when
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:39.840]   you learn how to use it productively you can teach me that's all we need to say.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:43.080]   Scott I don't want you to squander your precious pets.com money.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:46.080]   I want you to hang on.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:49.440]   We're going to start a new website 43phones.com.
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.560]   Okay well I'm sorry for the rat hole.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:54.640]   No no no I don't blame you I blame born.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:59.480]   Listen we're going to rename this podcast the iPhone podcast.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:03.640]   Every week we're going to give you the latest and iPhone news right here.
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.960]   Hey latest thing we read on some sites.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.360]   I just want to quote.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.720]   Let me see if I can get this right here.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:21.560]   Der podcasting Yaren, Der person Der Yaren who said who said Istanka Apple for Alice.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:28.440]   Vazifu un skatan habbe habbe zagab un shon Beivossite often sproggensen.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.440]   Tastu lishinuschir my novel.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.880]   I have no idea what I said but I said it.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:40.320]   This is from a Swiss newspaper that's quoting me in German which is a strange experience
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:45.040]   but apparently as best I can make out this Swiss newspaper.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:52.080]   I'm told this is the biggest daily in Switzerland is taken up the netcast arm.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.840]   A challenge.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:33:02.800]   The last subtitle is Fue netcast is Eshon zus spot which sounds good to me.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:08.080]   Here's the problem when you mentioned netcast from the podium of your keynote.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.480]   Do you realize what happened?
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:15.440]   Every single human being with access to the internet at that moment registered every possible
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:22.080]   domain with the word netcast in it and our friend this week in law was sitting next to
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.120]   me and she goes well there goes every single netcast domain.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.280]   Well what the hell.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.280]   I mean you're right.
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:32.320]   In fact I checked and a number of them were registered exactly at that time.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:36.560]   It was exactly 9.12 am on September 29th.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.920]   The date that we'll live in.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:41.600]   I also mentioned that somebody should have a set up a website.
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:46.960]   I don't have an iPod.com where people could just go to find out how to listen to podcasts
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:50.400]   if you don't have an iPod and that was registered in 9.12 as well.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.160]   You're right I probably should learn.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:56.360]   I should know now after doing live TV for a few years you probably got to be careful about
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.360]   that kind of thing.
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:01.000]   Thank goodness for Amber that you didn't say something about Amber Mack before she went
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   to register her domain.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Wow.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.760]   It's a very good point.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:11.920]   So but the point is that I've done now interview yesterday in Mexico City an article in this
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:12.920]   Swiss Journal.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:17.400]   But internationally I think they're picking up on it more than they are in the US oddly
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.400]   enough.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.400]   I'm not sure why.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.400]   You're sticking with this?
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:23.160]   This is your line in the sand you're going with netcast.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.200]   Yeah everything your Twitter is.
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.640]   I've heard you guys do it.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:28.120]   I just I didn't know if it was.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:31.040]   I mean you're this is your you're sticking with this that was the point.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.560]   Well I wasn't going to but it's starting to take get some traction.
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:37.800]   I mean people are and I think people realize that there is a it's not that the podcast
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.840]   is going to go away.
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:44.280]   You know who's using netcast now CBS was using it NBC is now using it.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.880]   It's not that it's going to go away but I think we need to have another word that's
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:52.280]   also somewhat understood so that people like CBS and NBC who don't want to get kind of
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:59.760]   in apples jelly or or or Microsoft who's avoided the whole term podcast could have something
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:00.760]   else to use.
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:04.720]   Yeah you can't get a netcast or a podcast on a zoom though.
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:08.120]   No you can't get nothing on a zoom except Steve Jobs here wax.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:11.800]   Well Frank Barnico contacted me to daily and wants to know if we're going to go forward
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.520]   with this so Frank Barnico is interested it's a story.
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:18.480]   CBS market watch ladies and gentlemen I like this story in computer world.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:24.160]   Apple hired a French consultant always a good idea when you want to get something done
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:30.160]   hire a French consultant and make it friends internationally.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:37.880]   No I love them I kid because you love this guy over here they know that they did a study
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:42.760]   that proves 30 inch displays make employees more productive.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:46.960]   Oh that's I believe that it's true isn't it.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:51.640]   Yeah I like I usually have my two computers set up and I think I am definitely way more
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:52.640]   productive.
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.120]   30 inch display amber.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:58.960]   Yeah I think the bigger the monitor and the more screen space you have I think you would
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.320]   be able to do more you could multitask.
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:09.880]   Yep you save 13.63 seconds when moving files between folders 15.7 seconds compared to 29.3
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:15.080]   seconds on a 17 inch monitor that's a 46% increase in productivity.
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:20.600]   65% productivity game when dragging and dropping between images and cutting and pasting from
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:25.480]   Excel spreadsheets you save 51% of your time.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:29.800]   Yep yeah I mean there's no I mean this is you believe it started on this.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:30.800]   You believe it.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.320]   Oh this is well Scott did you look at those links I sent you about this stuff.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:39.560]   I did Merlin and I had an offline conversation about this Leo and I was asking Merlin did
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:44.800]   he think one 30 inch was better than two smaller screens and that's a good question.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:48.240]   I ended up solving the problem by buying three 23 inch.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.480]   I was going to say two 30 inches would be the way to go.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.960]   No I bought three 23 inch.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.680]   23 do you have room on your desk.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:01.120]   Yes yes and it's particularly good when you run pro tools to have three monitors.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:05.840]   You must have peripheral vision 180 degree peripheral vision.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.880]   So you have to have three video cards too.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:12.760]   The thing about this that I think it's probably might be patently obvious to people but the
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:18.040]   first way that you see a huge leap in productivity is what I would call not having to go through
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.560]   like a modal change right.
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:23.720]   So ordinarily you think back to the days of multifinder and having to move between applications
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:26.280]   and that has to be nice I agree.
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:30.400]   It hasn't actually gotten that much better today but now I mean that ability to actually
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.720]   see the two things that you're working on it sounds really stupid until you actually
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:37.680]   do it but once you're doing it you never want to go back the ability to see both applications
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.080]   or three applications or whatever that you're working on.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:43.520]   It's just that you never go back because you don't have to be flipping back and forth
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:47.280]   and you don't have to kind of consciously shift your attention to go pick up a piece
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.840]   of information in your brain from one other place.
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.360]   And it's huge and like I said to Scott I send him some links.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:55.720]   I think her name is Mary Zurwinski works on Microsoft.
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:58.840]   She's got a boatload of research on this stuff.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:03.120]   She's in the New York Times article that I was in a few months back and she's super
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:06.320]   smart and if you go just google her name we may put her in show notes.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.360]   She's got a lot of really interesting research on this.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:13.200]   So what's the conclusion one big screen or two two twenty fours?
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:17.000]   I would guess it depends on what it is that you're trying to do.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.080]   I think for most people I mean this is just gut check but I think for most people one
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.520]   huge screen is probably one.
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.480]   We're talking two thousand bucks here.
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.480]   Yeah exactly.
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.480]   Well I mean the...
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:29.720]   Or if you go with Dell it's only eighteen hundred dollars.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:32.880]   Yeah I mean I can see the two two twenty threes being a lot.
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:37.080]   I'm just thinking you know in terms of the trade off in terms of footprint unless you
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:41.520]   get one of those big things with all the pipes where you can do like six of them.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:42.520]   Yes.
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.160]   It looks like it looks like a control booth.
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.160]   They're for traders.
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.400]   They're for traders I think.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:51.440]   Well I want to ask Amber what she thinks because in these articles they mention that
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:55.080]   women tend to do better if the screen is wider.
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.520]   Do you have any feeling about that Amber?
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:00.960]   I don't know about the screen being wider.
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:04.160]   I actually like having two or three computers on my desk.
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:08.560]   I think it's really just a powerful thing to be able to jump between the computers.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.920]   I don't know why I've always been like that just because even at Call for Help I often
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.320]   had a PC and then a Mac.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:17.360]   I have so many pictures of Amber with computers arrayed in front of her.
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:20.120]   Yeah do you use a KVM for that?
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.120]   No.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.840]   No she uses a swivel stool.
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.280]   Yeah I use a swivel stool that's it.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.280]   It's just old school.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.040]   I don't know there's just something about it.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:31.000]   I think it's just because you know you're bouncing from computer to computer so I don't
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.680]   know maybe wider screen would be better but I haven't really had a chance to really be
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.040]   on a really wide screen.
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:42.360]   I love this 30 I have to say the only thing is it throws quite a bit of heat.
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:45.240]   So it's something to be aware of if you're on a hot day.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.240]   There's quite a bit of heat coming.
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.400]   Do you notice that Merlin?
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.400]   I haven't gotten too much heat.
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.440]   Have you guys experimented at all with that what do they call it?
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:55.080]   Monitor bias lighting the thing where you let your monitor from the back to make your
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.080]   eyes on your eyes.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.520]   Does that really work Scott?
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:04.480]   Absolutely works and the secret is to get a child's night light and put it right behind
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.480]   your monitor.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.000]   Oh my gosh what a difference.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.960]   You know that's funny because instinctively I've done that.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.160]   I have a light behind my monitor.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:16.240]   There's a glow around the periphery but it's true that your eyes need that.
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:19.800]   In fact they always said when you're watching TV you shouldn't turn off all the lights but
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.840]   have another light in the room.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:27.960]   If it's behind the monitor your eyes just adjust much better and it's way cool.
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:28.960]   Wow.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:29.960]   Really?
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:30.960]   Fascinating.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:31.960]   Hey Merlin.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:39.360]   Do you have trouble reading the text on the 30 inch Leo with your older eyes?
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:44.720]   Yeah but I make it bigger and you know what's really nice and I have to commend Apple for
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:45.720]   this.
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:46.720]   You know the new control.
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:47.720]   The new trick.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:48.720]   The new control scroll.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.720]   Oh that's just cool.
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:50.720]   That's cool.
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:51.720]   I love that.
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:56.400]   Isn't that fantastic and for TV it's really good because I'm sitting there demonstrating
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.960]   something and I want to zoom in on it.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.920]   I just move my mouse over it.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.920]   Of course you have to have a scroll wheel mouse.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:07.280]   Press the control key and then scroll in and scroll out and it's just really great and
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.240]   move the mouse around.
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.720]   Two cool little tricks you can do with that.
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.000]   One you probably already know is you know that zooming.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.840]   I think this works on actual Google Maps.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:19.560]   I know it works on Google Earth where you can actually zoom in using your scroll wheel.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:24.440]   And the other one is you can really quickly simulate a full screen mode by just scrolling
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:27.240]   in a tiny bit while you have a document filling your screen.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.240]   Right.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.240]   Oh that's a good idea.
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.240]   Oh I didn't think of that.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:36.400]   And of course if you hold the command key it increases the size of the text in your browser.
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.880]   So that's another useful.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:38.880]   Really?
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:39.880]   Control command?
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:40.880]   Control command.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:41.880]   No not control.
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:42.880]   Just command scroll in your browser.
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:43.880]   Wow.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.880]   Go ahead try it right now.
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:45.880]   I'll wait.
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:52.920]   I wish everything did that because that is very useful on a big screen monitor because
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:57.160]   it is true that sometimes especially some sites have tiny type and this way you can
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.160]   get it much bigger.
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.200]   I think the computers in our hobo camp don't have this yet.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:05.000]   Max have had this for ages.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.680]   That's older than the control scroll.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:11.720]   And by the way the control scroll works on the new MacBook Pros and MacBooks on the
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.480]   trackpad with the two fingers.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:14.920]   Oh that's nice.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.320]   In case you didn't know that.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:17.320]   I didn't know that.
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.320]   I did that.
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.000]   Actually now when I edit audio because people care.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.920]   When I edit audio I actually prefer to do it on the MacBook because of that trick.
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:25.760]   It's so much easier to zoom in and out and the two fingers.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:26.760]   Super fast.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:27.760]   Good idea.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.000]   Let's see what other stories.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.240]   Merlin and I are both working on...
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.000]   When's your judging for my dream app?
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.560]   Is that coming soon?
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:38.160]   My judging such as it was has already happened.
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:42.920]   I don't think I had a very positive influence because most of mine didn't make it.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.440]   I was excited about that.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:45.960]   Yeah my dream app...
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:46.960]   We haven't talked about that on here yet.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:47.960]   We haven't.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:48.960]   I want to give them a plug.
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:52.440]   It's mydreamapp.com and it's kind of a clever idea.
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:57.880]   I don't know who's responsible for it or how we thought it up but they asked...
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:01.960]   Philip Ryu is the guy I've been talking to.
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:02.960]   Is it his thing?
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.960]   I believe it is.
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:05.960]   It's beautifully done.
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.640]   It's a really nice website.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.960]   I don't think it's getting as much attention as it deserves.
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:16.480]   The idea is they got together I think what 24 developers...
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:20.720]   It's like American Idol for no-self Mac apps.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:21.720]   These aren't developers.
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:25.040]   The contestants are just people.
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.040]   That's right.
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:29.000]   They're all developers who will develop the winner.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.360]   They'll actually write the program and they've got really four good developers.
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:38.200]   Jason Harris who wrote Chicken of the VNC and Austin Sarnar from AppZapper and Martin
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:43.720]   Ott from Sabitha Edda and John Cassenta who did the I-Clip.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:47.840]   These guys kind of weigh in because they've got to write it but then they have every round.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:49.720]   They have celebrity judges.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:55.320]   Kevin Rose and I did the most recent round and a few other people.
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.080]   Amber are you involved in this too?
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:01.360]   No, I keep getting emails from them and I know that it's been going on for a while so
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:02.360]   I've kept my eye on it.
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:03.360]   It's really cool.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:04.360]   It's a fantastic idea.
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.160]   Yeah, it's very cool.
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:07.240]   It definitely makes sense.
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:14.120]   We're down I think the final five or six, final six.
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:20.480]   It looks like GTD kind of lost out in the last round of voting unfortunately.
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:23.800]   Yeah I was actually wasn't all that excited about that.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:24.800]   Not because I mean it's a neat idea.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.640]   We need it but it's very hard to implement.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.960]   I don't think he had any idea what to do.
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:31.920]   Yeah, it's all these kind of all in one Swiss Army knife.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:32.920]   I like this blossom.
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:33.920]   Did you like blossom?
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:34.920]   I love blossom.
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:39.360]   Blossom I think I did a quick glance at the latest round and I think blossom is one of
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:42.200]   the only ones that I really like that's still in.
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:43.400]   There's two I like that are still in.
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:46.640]   Blossom the idea is it's a great idea.
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:48.760]   It's a virtual plant.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.400]   I would think that you'd like this actually, Merlin.
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:52.480]   Amber you would probably like it too.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.880]   It's a virtual plant that doesn't respond to sunlight and water but to your productivity
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:58.080]   and you set what the parameters are.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:05.480]   So yeah, grows as you work hard and if you play too many games it withers.
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.160]   The devil's in the details with that one though.
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:11.120]   Like I said, do you say the email is good or email is bad?
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:14.280]   Well to me email is good if I get rid of it which takes time in the email app.
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:18.040]   I may be something like how often you check net newswire.
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:19.040]   That would be good.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.040]   How often you check your email?
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.040]   Yeah, that'd be good.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.040]   That's right.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.000]   Amber just wrote a good article for Calgary.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.440]   Was it Sun the Sun you're in?
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:26.920]   Yeah, the Calgary Sun.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:27.920]   And email addiction.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:31.600]   Oh yeah, I mentioned you Merlin.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:32.600]   Really?
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.360]   Yeah, in a good way.
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:40.840]   If there's anyone who has a problem it's that fellow Merlin.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:44.480]   Last time he comes to Canada.
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.480]   You're not invited back.
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.640]   You know the one I was really excited about that didn't make it was I style it.
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:50.840]   Did you see that one?
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:53.600]   That lost so early on I didn't get to review that myself.
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:54.960]   I style it's awesome.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:55.960]   It's like bring your chis.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:56.960]   It's wardrobe.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:57.960]   Let me read it to you.
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:58.960]   Very fair close.
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:00.160]   Like how fun is that?
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.680]   It's one of the few women by the way.
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:04.280]   If all the women have gotten knocked down.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.280]   Bring your wardrobe.
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:07.040]   Well there's see there's the problem right there.
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.600]   But there's no female judges I think I went on there.
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:13.960]   I was kind of upset because I thought wow they should have some female judges.
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:16.040]   They should have asked you.
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:19.840]   Yeah, me or someone else it doesn't matter but it just would have been nice to have.
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:22.480]   Because you would have had more apps that were a little more.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:24.120]   Yeah, well you might have liked this.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:25.120]   Oh, family.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.120]   I'm not sure what the problem is.
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:27.120]   But bring your wardrobe into your eye life.
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:28.120]   I like that.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.120]   I style it.
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:30.120]   I'm a guy.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.840]   Because you have a large t-shirt collection.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:32.840]   Shut up.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:34.360]   A virtual closet on your Mac.
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.000]   Shall I wear the Sloan t-shirt today?
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.840]   A virtual closet on your Mac.
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:40.400]   Pick your clothes with ease.
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:43.760]   Store and rate your favorite outfits and share them with your friends.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:44.760]   So that's it.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:45.760]   That's it.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:46.760]   That's it.
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:48.400]   I think it is a great application but I don't see any guy voting for that.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.880]   I think that's very short-sighted.
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:54.880]   I think if you live in San Francisco and had a way of going here's the kind of jacket
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:56.560]   you might want to go grab today.
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:58.720]   Or the way that I use delicious library.
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.920]   I use delicious library for exactly one thing.
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:04.120]   Which is to remember what box in the basement a book is in.
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:05.400]   And the same thing could go for your clothes.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:06.400]   You could have--
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:08.400]   It's kind of like a delicious library for clothes.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.400]   Professor Radholt tonight.
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:12.120]   But the idea of if I'm going to have my winter clothes stacked away somewhere and there's
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:13.400]   one sweater I want to find.
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.400]   If I had some way of knowing where that is.
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.640]   There's a lot of men that do this too.
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:21.360]   But a lot of people who put Polaroids on boxes that have what shoes or clothes are in
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:22.360]   it.
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:23.360]   Where is that new pornographer's tattoo?
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.360]   Wow.
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.360]   You're fine, dude.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:26.360]   You know what?
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:27.360]   It's more girly than I am.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:28.360]   Yes, you are.
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.760]   You guys are all dead to me.
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:31.760]   Dead.
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:32.760]   Listen, listen.
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:34.360]   I got to just get this on the record.
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:38.280]   Merlin is a guy who would rather have his computer put him to sleep and wake him up
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.200]   than a $2 alarm clock.
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:44.960]   He would rather have a fake plant software program than buying a stupid plant sticking
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:45.960]   in his room.
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:46.960]   There is a trend.
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:47.960]   There is a trend.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:49.960]   And he needs to have some special software.
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:50.960]   I get them.
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:55.360]   It's just to help him find his shoes whereas I just look down in my closet.
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:56.360]   Okay.
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:57.360]   Scott, you're a model.
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:58.360]   You're a model.
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:47:59.360]   Get ready, Scott, because...
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:00.360]   Frotic today.
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:01.360]   No.
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:02.360]   You know what?
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:03.360]   I'm just going to cry.
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:04.840]   I'm sure Merlin really liked this one.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.200]   This is one of my other favorite ones.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:10.400]   It's currently the number one application on MyDreamApp.com.
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:11.400]   Atmosphere.
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:15.440]   A virtual window to the outdoors for your desktop.
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:17.640]   It shows you the weather.
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:20.640]   I love this idea.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:21.640]   I like that.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:23.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:24.640]   It shows you...
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.640]   You should kind of forbid you would actually open the window.
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:27.640]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:28.640]   It's got these beautiful pictures.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:32.520]   And, you know, if it's snowing out, snow will come down on your screen.
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:35.840]   If it's raining, rain will come down, the moon will rise up.
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.240]   I think this is a wonderful idea.
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:38.440]   I hope it gets made.
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:40.360]   You guys are all living in second life.
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:41.360]   That's what's going on here.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.960]   I have second life all day today.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:43.960]   I just have to say.
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:44.960]   So I would...
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:45.960]   You're kidding.
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:47.200]   You spent the day in second life.
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.200]   Most of it, yeah.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.800]   You've got a wild job.
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:50.800]   I have to say.
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:51.800]   You guys aren't real.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:54.880]   I'm talking to second life characters here who only live life virtually.
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:55.880]   Yeah.
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:58.360]   They've called me "Prunfaise Spatula."
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:01.200]   One big opportunity, which is what...
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:06.320]   I would like to see a virtual developer where you could have a developer that you take care
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:11.960]   of online and you could bring him coffee and you could make apps for him.
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:12.960]   And you would never...
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:17.240]   You could basically just monitor yourself, just create an avatar that never has to leave
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:18.240]   the computer.
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:21.160]   Any amount of time really before the computer just writes the programs for you.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:26.400]   You just say, "Hey, computer, I'd like to have getting things done and you could do
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.400]   this, this, and this."
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:28.400]   And they'll say, "Okay."
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.560]   Also, just in terms of prior art, it's worth mentioning.
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:32.080]   I don't know if you guys remember Dunston Orchard.
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:35.280]   I think his site, he's not updating it much, but he used to actually do that weather thing
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:39.040]   really well at 1976 design numerals.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:40.040]   That's 1976 design.
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.240]   Was it a desktop thing?
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.240]   Or what was it?
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.240]   No, this is his web page.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:44.760]   And I think he works at Apple now.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:45.760]   I'm not sure where he works.
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:46.960]   I don't know his name.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:52.120]   But Dunston, yeah, the 1976 design, if it was block, he did a really cool thing where he
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:56.760]   basically came up with all these little drawings he did of what his...
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:57.760]   What outside his...
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.920]   Where he lived looked like, and then depending on the weather, it pulls up a different header
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:03.320]   for a web page, depending on what the weather is.
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:04.320]   Perfect.
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:06.800]   Which, I mean, it's pretty clever the way he did it.
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:07.800]   I love that idea.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.040]   And it shows what time of day it is and stuff like that.
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:12.080]   I think it's a wonderful idea.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:13.720]   I think it's a great idea.
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:15.120]   Oh, come on.
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:16.120]   Come on.
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:20.080]   I've met a merchant ivory movie and a half gallon of ice cream.
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:21.760]   And I'm just going to cry myself to sleep, Scott.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:22.760]   I hope you're happy.
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:24.760]   Listen, I got news for you.
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.440]   We're going to make you a new application.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.600]   It's a virtual napkin.
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:33.400]   And what you do is if you spill the ice cream on your shirt, you call up this virtual napkin.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:36.520]   Take a picture of yourself and erase the ice cream in the picture.
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:37.520]   How's that?
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:39.280]   I'm going to get you an eye chew toy.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:43.560]   Well, as long as we're talking applications and...
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:44.560]   Oh, no.
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:45.560]   It's true.
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:46.560]   It's true.
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:48.560]   You know what?
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:52.640]   At Merlin, I mocked Pizziz and then I bought it.
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:53.920]   They all mocked Pizziz.
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:54.920]   They all mocked Pizziz.
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.600]   I mocked it because it wasn't just you.
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:01.520]   A Randall Schwartz is a great pro programmer sent me a note saying, "I love Pizziz.
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:02.520]   You've got to try it."
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:03.520]   So I bought it.
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:06.440]   I've been taking Pizziz naps and I love it.
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:07.880]   You're right.
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:08.880]   You're right.
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.080]   So anyway, I just want to apologize.
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:11.880]   And you know what I did?
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:13.440]   The Pizziz guy after I bought it.
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:14.960]   He said, "What are you buying?"
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:17.640]   He sent me the money back, which I thought was kind of nice.
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:19.280]   They're written.
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:24.120]   He said, "Look, if you want, you can give a coupon code out to your listeners.
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:25.120]   So we have a coupon code.
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:26.120]   We get a little bit.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:28.720]   We're basically splitting the proceeds.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.640]   But it's a 25% off coupon code.
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:32.680]   Just put "twit" when you buy Pizziz.
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:35.600]   P-Z-I-Z or for Amber, it's P-Z-I-Z-Z.
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:38.640]   I like saying that.
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:40.880]   I love saying that.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:45.280]   P-Z-I-Z-Z.com and put "twit" in the coupon code when you buy it.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:48.120]   Instead of $40, it'll be $30.
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:50.040]   And we get some money too, which is nice.
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.040]   This is a new way.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.120]   I decided not to do ads anymore.
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:55.240]   We'll just get coupon codes for everybody.
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:56.880]   What do you think?
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:59.280]   And next week, we'll read your poem for 9.95.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.080]   We can do that.
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:02.080]   We can do that.
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:03.600]   That's a great idea.
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:05.960]   I sent Amber a Pizziz because she came straight from work.
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:10.120]   And I said, "If you get a chance, Amber, take a 20-minute nap before the show, but
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:11.120]   you didn't get a chance."
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:13.120]   She had to eat and stuff.
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:14.120]   But try it, Amber.
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:16.000]   You see what you just think.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   I'd be very curious.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   I like it.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.760]   Is it just a 20 minutes of mellow music?
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:22.000]   Is that right?
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.640]   Well, oh god, here we go.
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:27.520]   Should I play Pizziz for you?
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:28.520]   Do you have one hand?
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:30.920]   I have Pizziz is always ready on my desktop.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:31.920]   You have hornions.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:32.920]   You're freaking me out.
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:33.920]   I don't know.
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:34.920]   That's cool.
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:35.920]   That's cool.
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:36.920]   Here comes a Pizziz.
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:37.920]   Listen.
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:40.680]   I actually volunteered to voice nude.
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:44.800]   Now that you're getting ready to enjoy some rest and relaxation, it's a new track for
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:45.800]   a little bit.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:46.800]   I'm not sure that you'll not be too good.
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.800]   And he said, "No, no, it's too complicated.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:49.800]   You can't do it."
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:50.800]   It's possible, but...
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:51.800]   Because I said, "Well, I want to do a branded Pizziz.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:55.360]   What if we did a twit position for your body where you can relax completely?"
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:59.560]   Find a position for your body where you could listen to twit all the day so far for a little
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:00.560]   while.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:02.560]   Pretend you're murdered fast.
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:03.560]   It's possible from this time out.
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:06.080]   And you need help getting to see...
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:10.520]   Listen, we'll offer you some guidance for a few minutes to assist you in relaxing as
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.520]   completely as possible.
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:15.800]   Okay, now if people are listening to this in my car, there's going to be a problem, so
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:17.040]   I'm going to turn it off because we don't...
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:19.720]   I never realized how much he sounds like Hal.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:26.360]   You know, I think I insulted the guy because I said I'm a note saying, "If you'd ever...
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:29.560]   I tried to be a little..."
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:35.800]   I said, "If you'd ever like somebody with a mid-Atlantic neutral accent to do it, I
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:38.360]   would be glad to volunteer."
[00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:39.360]   And he...
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:40.800]   You don't have enough to do already, Lisa.
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:43.960]   But I want to do some Pizzizzing, but then it wouldn't be any good for me because I'd
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:46.440]   be talking to myself, and that would be kind of creepy.
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:48.520]   Oh, that puts me to sleep, Leo.
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:51.400]   Well, people have told me I have a soparific voice, that's why.
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:52.400]   You do.
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:54.440]   It's very relaxing.
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.480]   It's the nice way to put it.
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:54:00.720]   And he took that in as kind of a... he took that as notes from you?
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.080]   Yeah, well, no.
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:06.320]   The guy's name is Edward Lang, very nice guy.
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:10.840]   And he said, "Well, thanks for the offer of the voice talent.
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:14.240]   The moment all the recordings are done by Michael Breen, but you do have a nice voice."
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:20.120]   Which was, I thought, very diplomatic.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:24.240]   Have you been doing them enough to find whether there's a certain length in minutes that
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.240]   tends to work for you?
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:27.200]   The default is 20, and that seems to be fine.
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:28.200]   Yeah, me too.
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:30.240]   I don't always fall asleep, but often...
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:31.240]   Neither.
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.240]   I do.
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.240]   I always space out.
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:34.240]   Yeah, Amber, you're going to love it.
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:35.720]   Can I ask you a question?
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:38.320]   Are you listening to it on headphones?
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:40.320]   Or do you have it?
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:41.320]   You can put it on your iPod.
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:44.280]   Because if my roommate hears me listening to that, I'm going to get kicked out.
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.880]   Jenna, you have time to relax now.
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:51.800]   No, the nice thing is you can put it on your iPod.
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:53.800]   It makes AAC files.
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:57.240]   They actually used to sell a Pizziz device.
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:58.760]   That's how they started.
[00:54:58.760 --> 00:54:59.760]   But they wised up.
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:02.800]   Because it was like 250 bucks.
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:05.840]   This entire podcast could actually be a 60-minute Pizziz.
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:06.840]   It is.
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:07.840]   It is.
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:10.680]   I think many people listen to this podcast before bed.
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:12.120]   And during bed.
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.400]   Sometimes they wake up and we're still talking.
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:16.320]   It's called night terrors.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:19.080]   Alright, a couple more stories before we move up.
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:22.720]   But I just want to mention that the coupon code is "twit" if you...
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:26.280]   P-Z-I-Z-Z, if you want to go to Pizziz.com.
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:27.920]   Did you see that Eudora is going open source?
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:28.920]   I think this is kind of neat.
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:32.920]   Yeah, because they're just on fire as a mail app.
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:35.480]   Well, obviously they couldn't keep it up today.
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:38.440]   It was the definitive Mac mail app for years.
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:39.440]   For a long time?
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:43.920]   All I used for the first, like, 6 years that I was on the...
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:47.160]   I felt sure you'd still be using it for some reason, Marilyn.
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.160]   You know, it's so funny.
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:53.480]   I've kind of said from time to time on 43 folders that it's...
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:54.920]   I don't know how to put this.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:59.920]   You so much adopt the kinds of practices that applications...
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:00.920]   They lied to you.
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:01.920]   They lied to you.
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:02.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:04.920]   So you get good habits or bad habits.
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:06.920]   And I got some of the worst habits from Eudora.
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:07.920]   I mean...
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:08.920]   But it was...
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:12.920]   Well, it's so funny when I very, very, very first moved to...
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:13.920]   What was it?
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:16.920]   Outlook Express and something like 2000, something like that.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:18.920]   It was the first time I'd ever dealt with the three-paint.
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:19.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:22.920]   And with Eudora, I had this.
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:26.920]   You know, God, I had, like, dozens of rules where they would all automatically go.
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:29.920]   All my in and out messages would go into the same window.
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:30.920]   So all my Leo messages.
[00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:32.920]   So when I came in in the morning, I took my messages.
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:34.920]   And like, 35 windows would pop up.
[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:35.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:37.920]   That I was done when all the windows were closed.
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:38.920]   Yeah, Eudora was very window-y.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:40.920]   Well, you know, it's actually interesting, though.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:42.920]   I'm actually not interesting, probably, to most people.
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:46.920]   But it's such a paradigm shift kind of with how the Mac has changed over the years.
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:50.920]   The Mac used to be much more window-like, you know, all about the windows.
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:51.920]   Don't you think?
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:57.920]   Yeah, although the earliest Mac designers were dead sent against modality, as you know.
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:56:59.920]   That was kind of the kiss of death.
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:04.920]   That was a big turning point, wasn't it, when they finally decided to actually have these
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:05.920]   stackable windows?
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:09.920]   Yeah, there was a raging battle over whether windows should be tiled or stackable.
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.920]   I don't think that was actually at Apple.
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:13.920]   I think that was earlier at Xerox Park.
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:17.920]   But, I mean, so I probably adapted a whole bunch of other terrible habits from the other
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:18.920]   apps.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:19.920]   But yeah, I loved Eudora.
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:22.920]   Of course, just, I mean, as much as I loved Pawn, getting into a GUI app was such a
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:23.920]   great program, though.
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:24.920]   I loved Pawn.
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:27.920]   I saw everybody say what mail app they use now.
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:28.920]   I bet we all use mail.
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:29.920]   I do.
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:30.920]   Heather?
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:31.920]   Heather.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:32.920]   I do.
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:33.920]   Amber me?
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:34.920]   I don't know why she's here.
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:35.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.920]   You have no idea how many people call me Heather.
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:38.920]   I apologize.
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:40.920]   I like Slimsy calls me Heather all the time.
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:41.920]   Really?
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:42.920]   Yeah.
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:43.920]   That's why I did it, because I heard Alex call her Heather.
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.920]   We have to have a woman on the show named Heather.
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:47.920]   I called her Amber, so.
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:48.920]   Oh, that makes sense.
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:53.920]   I've been using mail up until about a month ago, and now I'm on Gmail.
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:55.920]   You're 100% really.
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:56.920]   Yeah.
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:59.920]   I can't pronounce the name of my mail app, but I like it.
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:00.920]   Really?
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:01.920]   It's at a Mac app?
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:02.920]   Yep.
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:03.920]   G-Y-A-Z mail.
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:04.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:06.920]   I've seen that.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:07.920]   G-Y-A-Z mail.
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:10.920]   And why do you like it better than mail?
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:11.920]   It's fast.
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:16.920]   It has a really cool search feature that I like to work with, and it doesn't crash.
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:17.920]   I'm going to have to try it.
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:27.000]   I used for a long time I used, it was an iMap application from Mulberry from Cyrosoft, and
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.680]   then they went bankrupt, and now I think it's kind of open source.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.920]   It wasn't very good either, frankly.
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:36.920]   Do you guys think Gmail will ever go iMap?
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:37.920]   I wish it would.
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:41.120]   Well, it seems like it depends on what their strategy is.
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:45.200]   On the one hand, it's a crazy thing to do, because you're taking down so many page views.
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:51.200]   So Amber, you use a PowerBook, or use a Mac pretty much all the time.
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:52.200]   See, that's my problem.
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:53.200]   I don't know.
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:58.040]   Like, once you've gotten bitten in the butt by pop a couple of times in life, I never
[00:58:58.040 --> 00:58:59.040]   want to go off iMap again.
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:00.960]   No, iMap's the way to go.
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:02.720]   And that's why I'm so terrified.
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:05.240]   I mean, iMap has kind of become my controlling metaphor for what I want.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:06.240]   You use Fastmail?
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:07.240]   I use Fastmail.fm.
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:10.480]   I actually had a little belch this week.
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:17.400]   I'm thinking of-- there's a new iMap company called Island Email.
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:21.680]   And they do some really neat things.
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:25.360]   For instance, there's no limit to the size of file attachments, no limit to the storage
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:26.360]   that you have.
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:27.360]   Wow.
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:28.360]   Islandemail.com.
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:31.800]   They also use really good spam filtering from a company.
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:35.280]   The reason I found out about the guy who-- Tom Johnson, who runs MailRoud is a friend
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:38.040]   of mine, which excellent server-side spam filtering.
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:40.800]   They use that.
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:44.400]   No, I think it's $39 a year per address.
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:45.680]   I have an account there.
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:46.680]   I'm thinking of moving everything.
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:48.040]   I might give it an experiment.
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:49.040]   You know what thing about it?
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:50.040]   Islandemail.com.
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:51.040]   I'll give them a plug.
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:53.560]   The whole thing about Fastmail, though, a lot of people I think probably aren't using
[00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:54.960]   it or don't know is there.
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:57.160]   You know you get web dev space with Fastmail.
[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.160]   Right.
[00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:59.160]   Which you use that?
[00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:00.160]   It's not a lot of space, though.
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:01.960]   I've just fiddled with it a little bit.
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:06.840]   But for folks who don't want to pay $100 a year for .Mac, it's one way you can do iCal
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:07.920]   stuff, I believe.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:12.160]   I was using for a while, Eudora had a feature.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:17.000]   If the email-- remember it would put really red hot chili peppers next to the email.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   Oh, I love that.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   Yes, yes.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   I do remember it.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   What was that based on profanity?
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   I'm trying to remember.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.880]   Yeah, it was basically-- it had some kind of algorithm where it would look for cuss words
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:26.880]   and throw up chili peppers.
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:27.880]   I totally remember that.
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:28.880]   What was that for?
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:29.880]   Yeah.
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:31.960]   So I had a producer on Call for Help with George Crow as my producer of the show.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:33.760]   And I told him about that.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:38.400]   In order to get him to answer his emails, he would start every email with "fuck it,
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.560]   fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it."
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:43.040]   There goes the gleam day.
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.240]   No, no, no, I'll do that.
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.280]   I'll believe it.
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.880]   But he would start every email with that.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.040]   Can we cuss for a while?
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:50.040]   Yeah, let's everybody cuss and I'll believe it all.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.640]   Holy shit, I can't believe we can fuck cuss.
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:53.640]   Oh, wow.
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:56.240]   For Amber, Amber, we've never done this before.
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.240]   I apologize.
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:58.240]   Yeah, I'm surprised.
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.000]   It's really important that you edit this one.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.080]   I have never heard Amber cuss in my life.
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:07.120]   Listen, buffing nana.
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:09.400]   And Leo, do you remember the graphs?
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.480]   No, the graphs of what?
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:14.320]   To show you, it was to show you trends over time.
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.800]   How much email you'd gotten over.
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:16.800]   I remember that.
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:17.800]   I remember that.
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:18.800]   Oh man, now I'm nostalgic.
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:19.800]   I love to do it.
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:24.720]   Well, maybe if it opens sources and maybe the real problem was it's UI was so old school
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:25.720]   if they up-ed it.
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:26.720]   Well, I win.
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:32.040]   I think one of the reasons I left was they suddenly got very confusing.
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.800]   To me, with their business models.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.920]   Well, they started doing the whole ad thing.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:36.920]   They were like two or three versions.
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:38.120]   It was free and not.
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.560]   And then you had banner ads in your email.
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:41.560]   I don't like that.
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:44.960]   The funny thing is I stopped using it and every time George says me email, it still
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.960]   starts with fuck it.
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:52.960]   He just got in his head that that's the best way to start an email to me.
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:56.600]   So I think I'm trying to get a cloth.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.800]   Leo, should I try that?
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:01:59.800]   No, please don't.
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:00.800]   No, please don't.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:01.800]   I don't have any more.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:02.800]   I don't have chili peppers.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.440]   There is a red nano.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:12.640]   Oprah and Bono made a red nano to benefit his project red, which is to raise money for
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.840]   AIDS awareness and AIDS research in Africa.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:17.880]   Ten dollars for each red nano goes to project red.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:18.880]   That's cool.
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.360]   I see that the gap has red clothes.
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:21.560]   This is becoming a big thing.
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:24.400]   I saw a funny article.
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:30.320]   I think it was on Gizmodo where someone who works at, I think it's Staples in Canada
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:37.440]   wrote a post about all of the iPods being shipped that have the code 666 at the beginning
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:38.440]   of them.
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:41.880]   Then he made some theory that the red iPod is the actual devil iPod.
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:43.880]   It was so weird.
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.480]   I'm spending too much time online.
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:46.480]   That's really what this is.
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:51.520]   Poor Amber, this is her whole life now is seeking weird stuff on the net.
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:53.200]   Amber, did you get that email I sent you?
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:59.120]   I wanted to see if you could hold some money for me.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:04.120]   I have $18 million in the bank that I was supposed to buy guns with.
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:07.920]   Is that because your brother-in-law got something happen?
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:08.920]   Yeah.
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:09.920]   He lost his roster.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.400]   It's such a long story.
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:17.600]   What happened was, anyway, I have a lot of money and I'm in Nigeria and I just need
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:20.600]   somebody in Canada to help me get it and I'll give you 10%.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.920]   Nice to actually Merlin's more Canadian than I am, I think too.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.920]   He's more girly than I am.
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:29.560]   He apologizes for everything.
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:34.120]   That's how Merlin wants to be remembered as a girly Canadian.
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:38.040]   Hey, there's nothing about with a Canadian person.
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.360]   He wasn't very bright and he didn't have a lot to say.
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:45.040]   I'm sure why was he girly in Canadian?
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:52.240]   So we've offended the Swiss, the French, the Canadians and a few red-colored devils.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:56.080]   You can't much pull an apple, Leo, because I'm thinking you could actually get a Rickles
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.520]   tag that would appeal to you.
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:03:59.520]   I do.
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:04.280]   I will email Pete Alcorn and Scott Simpson, our good friends at the iTunes Music Store,
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:08.360]   and say, "Just for me, not clean, not explicit, just Rickles.
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:09.600]   I think it's good."
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:10.960]   I started doing that.
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:14.840]   I got email because I started using it when I saw that you could use the clean tag.
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.640]   I started using it because we're clean.
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:19.920]   I got email from people saying, "No, you're misusing that.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:25.840]   It's designed for songs that are explicit, but then edited, and now they're clean."
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:29.520]   This is actually truly a clean podcast because it was explicit, but I've bleeped out.
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:31.240]   It really means sanitized.
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.240]   Sanitized.
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:35.120]   I sent a note to Scott and Pete and I said, "Is that true?"
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.160]   They said, "No, you can call it clean."
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:38.160]   Now everybody does it.
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:40.560]   I noticed a lot of podcasts have the clean moniker.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:43.560]   I used to use it because it made us stand out, but now I have to change it to Rickles.
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.560]   I've got to stop cursing.
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.000]   I get so much email from people.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.680]   Every time I hear anything, I know I shouldn't.
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:49.680]   Don't work blue.
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:50.680]   That's what they tell you.
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:52.920]   Once you go blue, you can't go back.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:53.920]   That's true.
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:54.920]   Amber knows.
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:55.920]   Amber knows.
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.920]   She's always...
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:02.040]   I don't think I've ever heard Amber swear.
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:04.000]   Do you ever curse Amber?
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.400]   Not very often, no.
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:07.400]   Why is that?
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:10.480]   Have you always been that way?
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:17.080]   Yeah, I think it's just more of my parents because if my dad heard me swear even now,
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.080]   he would find it kind of upsetting.
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.960]   Not that they're really strict, but I think they just...
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:25.920]   They weren't big swears and it just wasn't really tolerated in our house growing up.
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:28.280]   I just kind of didn't do it.
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:29.280]   I don't know.
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:33.320]   It's one of those things too, is if I catch myself swearing now, it just seems so wrong.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:34.640]   It feels funny when it comes out.
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:35.640]   It's all how you're raised.
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.160]   I used to get a quarter every time I swore.
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:41.200]   You get a little swear box they take money out of and give it to my wife.
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.200]   That's right.
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:46.000]   I wanted to be able to get a fucking candy that I endured.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.480]   Don't sneak them in because one will leak out.
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:51.480]   Which happened once.
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.480]   Patrick, I'm to it.
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:53.480]   I accidentally...
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:54.480]   I missed one of these.
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:57.240]   He sneaks those f*cks in and then you're...
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:02.160]   Banana, banana, banana, banana, banana.
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:06.080]   Have we done every f*cking story on this list?
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:11.200]   I think every single one of these l*ckers have touched on tonight.
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.320]   I'm not saying anything else.
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:16.120]   Oh man, I got to get the bloop tool out.
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:18.920]   They really should have a bloop tool in soundtrack.
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:19.920]   I don't know.
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:20.920]   A little button that you know.
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:23.720]   I got to figure this one's not going to be going up too soon.
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:26.560]   You're going to be doing a lot of editing here, Leo.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:28.560]   I haven't been writing down any of the points either.
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.000]   I mean, I have to listen to the whole thing.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   All right, quickly.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.320]   One of the things that we like to do at the end of every show is your pics.
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:37.360]   I didn't tell Amber about this, so Amber, you're off the hook.
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.360]   That's okay.
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:39.360]   She's ever go last.
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:40.360]   She's...
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:41.360]   That's not fair, Leo.
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.360]   She looks at the internet all day.
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:44.120]   She's going to have something really good.
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:45.120]   That's true.
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:46.120]   Oh, easy there, Merlin.
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:47.120]   Hobo, man.
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:48.120]   Oh, what's the matter?
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.320]   You're afraid of a girl, Amber?
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:52.760]   You're afraid to fight a girl?
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:56.120]   You're slow and loving, Hobo.
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:57.120]   We got a geek fight.
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:58.120]   Geek fight.
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:59.120]   What are you going to do?
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:01.160]   Throw your dungeon dice at me.
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:02.160]   Excited.
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:03.160]   Oh boy.
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:04.680]   Okay, you start, Merlin.
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:06.760]   What's your pick of the week?
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:10.040]   Mine was sent in by a reader of 43 folders.
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.040]   And this is...
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.040]   I think this is kind of cute.
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:15.480]   It's monkeyon.com, one word.
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:17.920]   And it's a way to put a monkey on somebody's back.
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:19.920]   So it's a very simple...
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:24.360]   D'you know, Scott, you're going to have your chance.
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:26.480]   An actual physical monkey.
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:28.400]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.400]   Actually I'm glad you asked Leo.
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:32.480]   What we're going to do is we're going to really drill down and get an actual E monkey.
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:36.640]   We're going to monetize by being able to open the kimono in such a way that by the end
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:40.120]   of the day, really what I'm saying is monkeyon is a way to send a task.
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.920]   He's handling the phone guy again.
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:46.520]   You send an email to somebody with a task in it.
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:47.520]   It's very simple.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:48.640]   And it has a little basic.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:52.080]   So if this could be one way my wife and I have started using this and I'm sure she's
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:54.480]   going to start throwing stuff at me because I've been sending her monkeys.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.400]   I don't want my wife to find this site.
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:00.440]   But you send a little note to somebody and it reminds them periodically and until the
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:01.440]   thing is done.
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:02.440]   Is it HTML email?
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:03.440]   I mean, what do you get?
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:04.440]   Just a silly little...
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:07.520]   I'm going to send myself a monkey.
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:09.000]   Can you do that or do you like that?
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   Absolutely.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   I'll sell several monkeys.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.800]   I'll have to have a password to use it.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:17.040]   It looks like it's written in Ruby on Rails.
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:19.200]   It's got that shiny look.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.760]   Isn't there a look as a Ruby look?
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:22.760]   All right.
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:23.760]   Monkey on your back.
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.760]   It's monkeyon.com.
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:29.360]   Mr. Scott Bourne, you got to pick for us today?
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:31.240]   I do and it's for iTunes.
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:36.760]   If you want your iTunes experience to really improve, spend a couple of books and get the
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:42.480]   S-R-S-I-WOW plugin and I mean wow is the operative word.
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:46.160]   This thing will take whatever you're playing in iTunes and make it sound like you're at
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.800]   a concert hall.
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:48.960]   You should play with this thing.
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:51.160]   It gives you spatial control.
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.440]   It lets you control where you're at in relationship.
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:54.920]   Is it really spatial?
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:56.440]   It's very spatial.
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:57.440]   Okay.
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:59.880]   And it's made with Shakin' Bake and I hate it.
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:01.760]   It's spatial.
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:02.760]   It is really...
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:06.720]   I swear if you try it, you're going to say once again, Mr. Bourne, you have...
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:07.720]   Done it.
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:08.720]   So it's surround sound.
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:10.320]   S-R-S is surround sound, right?
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:11.320]   That's true.
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:12.920]   But that's not really all this thing does.
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:18.480]   It has a built-in EQ that's equalizer for those of you who are not pro audio folks.
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:22.720]   And it allows you to make the thing sound full that you're listening to without really
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:25.000]   understanding parametric equalization.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.200]   Well, and I certainly don't.
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:28.200]   So...
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:29.200]   Wow.
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:33.360]   Instead of having to worry about whether you cut that notch filter or boost that frequency,
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:36.480]   you just punch the button on I-well and it works great.
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:40.120]   Well, I don't have a tip, but it's related to your tip.
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:41.120]   You're...
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.960]   I don't have a pick, but I have a tip related to yours.
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:49.840]   We've been receiving a number of complaints from people saying that one podcaster or another
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:52.040]   will crash their iPod.
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:56.400]   And it turns out there is a flaw in iPods firmware.
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:59.520]   It's in the 5.1 generation iPods.
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:05.040]   A mono MP3 can actually crash people's iPods.
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:11.640]   Now, since all our MP3s are mono, I'm getting a huge number of people complaining about
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:12.640]   this.
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:18.080]   The answer is, and this is from an Apple Tech Note, turn off EQ.
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.080]   Wow.
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:21.000]   And it fixes it.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.240]   So apparently it's a bug in the EQ, I think, but that's the fix.
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:27.360]   So if you have noticed that...
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:28.360]   And I'm not kidding.
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:31.960]   I'm getting a lot of people saying, "Hey, you know, and it's no one podcast, so I know
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:33.040]   it's nothing I'm doing.
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.000]   Hey, this will crash my output or that'll crash my output."
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.240]   Turn off the EQ.
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:42.720]   It happens on mono podcast or mono content only.
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:45.240]   So if we made a stereo MP3, we'd be fine.
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.240]   Right.
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.240]   But there are twice as big as we go.
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:52.600]   And so just for the people like me out there, you would go to the top level, he says picking
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:53.600]   up my input.
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:54.600]   In settings, it's in the settings menu.
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:58.200]   And you can just turn EQ off under settings, go to EQ.
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:10:59.200]   Yep.
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:00.200]   And just click off.
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:01.200]   I don't use the EQ.
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:02.200]   Do you use it, Scott?
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:03.200]   You're an audio guy.
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:04.200]   Do you use the EQ in the iPod?
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:08.920]   Well now that I have this SRS plugin, it actually takes control of the EQ and iTunes.
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:12.160]   So I'm not quite sure how this would be impacted by this little body.
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.040]   But this is only the iPod.
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.040]   Does it...
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:19.160]   If you use the SRS plugin, does it change the music so that it stays that way on the iPod
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:20.960]   or is it only in iTunes?
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:21.960]   It's only in iTunes.
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:22.960]   So I guess it'd be all right.
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:23.960]   This would be all right.
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:24.960]   Yeah.
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:25.960]   Yeah.
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.200]   Hey, Leo, just a quick question about that.
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:32.240]   I just got an email today from someone who was saying that Command and My Video Podcast
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:35.880]   is freezing their iPod because there's a problem with the firmware.
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:40.240]   And they've started a petition online, firmware 12 sucks about blogspot.com.
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:41.240]   This is probably related.
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:42.240]   Yep.
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:45.000]   So this is for a video with some of the video podcasts.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000]   1.2.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   Or just don't have any on the iPod.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   It has been awful.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   This guy has started a petition.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000]   He's talked to Apple.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.400]   Actually, I think it's a woman.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:57.640]   And anyway, just got this email literally a few hours ago.
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:11:58.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:02.160]   In fact, a number of people have said, "Why aren't you talking more about the op-op?"
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:04.640]   It's an awful 1.2 firmware upgrade.
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.560]   I haven't had any problems with it.
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:07.920]   Well, actually, I take it back.
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:09.600]   I did have to format.
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:12.160]   I had to restore one iPod after I put one two on it.
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:16.160]   And then when I restored it, I formatted it for Windows and it fixed it.
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:17.160]   Oh, correct.
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:20.320]   So, but I think Windows people are actually having more trouble with it.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:24.400]   So if you have problems with your 1.2, maybe this is something worth looking into.
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:28.320]   Also, as long as we're talking about PX, I don't forget PZIZZ.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:34.120]   PZIZ.com and use the coupon code TWIT for 25% off.
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:36.640]   Amber, we've given you as much time as we can.
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:37.640]   Sure.
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:38.640]   I'm all set.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:41.160]   I guess I picked this week as something.
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:45.280]   I have to say that I haven't tried this out yet, but it's called the filter and it's a
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:48.800]   Windows plugin for iTunes.
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:53.480]   And what it allows you to do is to go into iTunes and get iTunes to actually create a
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:54.480]   mix for you.
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:57.960]   So you go and you put some samples of songs and then it finds similar songs.
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:01.560]   And so it creates custom playlists without you having to go through your entire library.
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.040]   I like that.
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:04.040]   It's very cool.
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:07.040]   So you imagine that you want to go on a run and you have some really upbeat music.
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:10.200]   You throw a few songs in there and then it spits out some other music that's kind of like
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.200]   that.
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:12.680]   So they say that they're coming out with a Mac version right now.
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.480]   They just have Windows.
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:18.680]   And also, I know there is a Mac download and I just confirmed this on Life Hacker called
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:20.000]   Music IP Mixer.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.200]   And I showed that off on Call for a while ago.
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:26.280]   But it seems like the filter might be better when the Mac version comes out.
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:33.120]   So via waxy.org sound flavor and BTUNs, B-E-A-T-U-N-E-S are two alternatives.
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:37.320]   All of these make specialized playlists for you based on your taste.
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.320]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:40.320]   I think that's correct.
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:41.320]   Isn't that right, Amber?
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:43.360]   Yeah, with a comment, it says with a common theme.
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:47.080]   So exactly based on the theme of types of music.
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:48.080]   So if you imagine...
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:49.080]   Ah, okay.
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:50.080]   So it's on genre.
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:51.080]   It's based on genre.
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.080]   Exactly.
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:53.080]   Interesting.
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:54.080]   Really cool.
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:55.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:14:01.880]   So it's based on like, according to the siddle, do it based on years or style sound.
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:02.880]   Yeah.
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.840]   Once again, no due diligence.
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.720]   We haven't done any testing.
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.280]   We just think it might work.
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:09.280]   And you might like it.
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:11.440]   You know what you ought to do is update your firmware.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:12.440]   That's your problem.
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.640]   Turn off EQ.
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.280]   And reinstall that operating system.
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:19.960]   I think it's the one thing I miss most about doing a Call for a Help with Amber is she
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:21.600]   always came in with fun stuff like that.
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:23.360]   And I learned so much about that.
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:28.560]   You can catch Amber MacArthur though on City News International every single week night
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:32.960]   on City TV if you're Toronto West, right?
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:36.040]   Actually West of Toronto is in CPT for in Toronto.
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:37.040]   It's city TV.
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:42.040]   But more importantly, all the segments are on the web at citynews.ca/international.
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.400]   And my segment is called World Wide Web.
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:47.480]   And although you might not know it, when you click on that on the homepage, it's actual
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:49.280]   video so you can watch the segment I do every time.
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:51.560]   And Amber gets $3 every time you click.
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:55.400]   I get no money, but I might be able to keep my job.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.640]   So I think you're going to keep your job.
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:58.640]   The segments are great.
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:14:59.640]   I don't know how you do that.
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:02.440]   I mean, they are there about 8,000 edits in each of them.
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:05.520]   They're very fast-paced, very well done.
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:06.520]   I had no idea.
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.600]   If we'd known you were that good, we wouldn't let you go.
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:11.680]   I have a good team of people working with me on that stuff.
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:14.960]   There's a Starbucks across the street.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:16.160]   That's all Amber needs.
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.280]   Scott Warren is with the iLife Zone.
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:20.200]   And of course, you've started another blog.
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:22.800]   You've got pod-tacasting tricks.
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:24.720]   And you've got the aperture tricks.
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.040]   What's the new one?
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:28.440]   The new one is called Podcast Gear Guy.
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.440]   And I just reviewed gear for podcasters.
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:32.880]   And I'm kind of following in Merlin's footsteps, Leo.
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:34.200]   He's got 43 folders.
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:36.000]   I'm looking for 43 blogs.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:41.600]   I have a website called 83problems.org.
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:43.240]   I haven't put anything on it yet, but I'm thinking.
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.240]   That's the Buddhist thing.
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.240]   That's nice.
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:47.240]   Yeah.
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:48.240]   You know, I heard somebody say that.
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:50.160]   I don't know if Isalyn wants somebody.
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:55.720]   It's a famous Buddhist story, a story about Buddha, where everybody has 83 problems.
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:56.960]   And I thought, I'm registering that.
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:00.320]   And the 84th problem is thinking you shouldn't have problems.
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:01.320]   Exactly.
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:02.320]   Very good.
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:04.120]   So maybe I'll just put that on the site.
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:05.120]   That's it.
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:07.480]   It's an easy site to maintain.
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.040]   So Podcast Gear Guy.com.
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:12.400]   And I agree with you on your post on the AKG K240s.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.160]   I have a 240s.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.160]   That's what I'm wearing right now.
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:16.440]   And it's my favorite.
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:19.800]   Every guy in radio has worn these for years.
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:20.800]   And I just love them.
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:21.800]   Me too.
[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:22.800]   I'm wearing them right this minute.
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:23.800]   Yep.
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:24.800]   Yep.
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:25.800]   They're so comfy.
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:27.640]   There's a nice picture of him wearing them, in fact, on his page.
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:32.160]   And I guess we should mention, because I think we've already broken the story, that Scott
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:36.680]   and I and Alex Lindsey are going to do a new video podcast called Gear Media Tech.
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:39.480]   It'll kind of take off on this Podcast Gear Guy.com.
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:42.680]   Did you just do something with your cheeks?
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:46.400]   I just swallowed a hamburger.
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:48.160]   I was giving you golf claps.
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:49.160]   I could.
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:51.160]   You're going to have to edit that out now.
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:52.160]   Wow.
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:53.160]   You know what?
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:57.160]   I think you just lost your rickles tag.
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:58.720]   Is it now Andrew Day's Clay tag?
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:16:59.720]   Is that what we're saying?
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:01.520]   Is it the Dice Man?
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:03.520]   Oh, God.
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:05.600]   Little Pete started a podcast.
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:08.600]   Mm hmm.
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:10.600]   Merlin Man is at 43folders.com.
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:12.040]   But you know, we haven't plugged it in a while.
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:14.040]   I think we should fives.
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:16.680]   The number five IVES.
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:18.280]   Is it org?
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:19.280]   VES.com.
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.960]   VES.com finally got an update.
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:23.560]   I think the last one was during the Johnson administration.
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:24.920]   If you know what I mean.
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:26.760]   And it's our latest one.
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:27.760]   The latest one.
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.520]   I just got it.
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:33.360]   Five possible signs your congressman thinks your teenage son is hot.
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:34.360]   That's right.
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:35.360]   That's right.
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:37.920]   If you're getting mysterious dinner time calls from the underwear police that are actually
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:39.440]   coming from Capitol Hill.
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:40.440]   If you--
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:42.520]   No, no, stop right there.
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:44.240]   I don't want to number two.
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:47.280]   No, if I could just-- this is for the kids, Leo.
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:50.640]   If you receive-- if you-- they need to know this.
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:51.800]   Give me a minute.
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:56.320]   If you get an invitation to a congressional lap sitting session, make sure that's not coming
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:59.160]   from an AOL address because that's not really from the Congress.
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.160]   Congress.
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:03.240]   If it doesn't say White House, no, no, no, no, no, no, in fairness, that's going to be
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:04.400]   a congressman.
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.000]   But it's not a issue.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.200]   We're burning in hell for this, you know.
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:09.760]   Oh, not us, Mark.
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.520]   Professional lap sitting.
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:17.000]   Extravagant gift of gladiator movie box set, personally delivered by your representative.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.840]   In full gladiator costume.
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:21.840]   I love these.
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:23.480]   Five things you did while Myspace was down.
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:25.840]   Amber, you're spending a lot of time on Myspace lately.
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:27.400]   You've cleaned up the site.
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:29.400]   You've put in some wallpaper.
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.800]   Yeah, I have been some, Neil.
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:35.080]   It's all that Starbucks coffee.
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:36.080]   I don't know.
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:39.440]   Yeah, this-- you know, Myspace is really ugly, but I think I found a pretty good template
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:40.440]   for my Myspace.
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:41.440]   Where did you find that?
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:42.440]   It is.
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:43.440]   It is.
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:44.440]   It's pretty.
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:46.160]   I think it's called Killer-- oh, I can't remember what it is.
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:50.560]   I have it on Myspace.com/ Amber MacArthur.
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:53.880]   Kiwi killer or something like that.
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:55.200]   Sorry, kiwi.
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:56.760]   Killer kiwi.net.
[01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:57.760]   Sorry.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:58.760]   I couldn't remember.
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:18:59.760]   Easy for you.
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:00.760]   He said izz.com.
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:01.760]   Killer kiwi.net.
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:02.760]   Killer kiwi.net.
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:05.600]   So yeah, I've been spending some time there.
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:09.120]   It's, you know, it's a fun place and it's not raining.
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:10.880]   Sorry, that was magic.
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:13.520]   It's been raining in Toronto for days.
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:14.760]   I know, and it's freezing cold.
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:18.280]   I watched the-- I have a little weather bug on my desktop to know what it's going to
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:19.600]   be like in Toronto when I go up there.
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:21.120]   And it's not been pleasant.
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:24.080]   Two feet of snow and buffalo, just a little south.
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.440]   Yeah, we didn't get any snow.
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:28.480]   So it's been decent here and it's supposed to actually warm up a little bit for a few
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:29.480]   days.
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:30.480]   So hurry up and get hurtlier.
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:31.480]   I am coming soon.
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:35.840]   And in a few months, I have to say I've been-- I don't-- maybe I had a little too much
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:41.400]   coffee, but I made a CSS-based signature for my email.
[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:42.680]   And I sent it to Merlin Man.
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:47.240]   He said, if you put that in Comic Sans, add a linen background and put in your home address

[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000]   That's all CSS, you know.

[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:27.960]   The only person on the show who does not have 80D is Scott Bourne.
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:30.960]   And he's got gout, so it's really-- [LAUGHTER]

[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:39.520]   Lost the Riggles tag.
