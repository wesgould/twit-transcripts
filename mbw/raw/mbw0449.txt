[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.640]   And Apple is telling you, don't go to the stores.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.960]   We'll tell you why.

[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.720]   This is gonna be a big week.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.040]   But as usual, when there's a big Apple thing happening,
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.520]   there's just kind of this, I don't know,
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.640]   it's like right before a thunderstorm,
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.920]   this tension in the air.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.760]   Nervous energy.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.760]   That's Rene Richie from iMoor.com,
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.760]   back from the Ulrich conference in, where was it?
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.240]   It was in, I think, Killarney.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.760]   It was at the Europe Hotel in Ireland,
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.760]   about three hours south at Dublin.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.760]   And it was quite magnificent.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.760]   And you were there with your partner, Georgia Dow.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.760]   We welcome Georgia, also from iMoor.com.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.760]   Hi, Georgia.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.760]   First time on MacBreak.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.760]   But thank you.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.760]   No, I'm having a dream that I'm on MacBreak.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.760]   That's a nice new sell.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.760]   So thrilled to have you.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.760]   That's so nice to be here.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.760]   Georgia is, during her day job, she is a psychotherapist.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.760]   But she's also a jujitsu expert.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.760]   Two-time Canadian champion I just learned.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.760]   That I am.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.760]   Be nice.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.760]   Folks, she can reach out through the chat room
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.760]   and kick your butt.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.760]   (laughs)
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.760]   Pluck your heart from your ribcage in three seconds.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.760]   Also here, Andy and I go, "He's on the road."
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.760]   You guys are back, but Andy is on the road.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.760]   He's at the Colorado University in Boulder.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.760]   C.U. Boulder, where the conference on World Affairs is going on.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.760]   Hi, Andy.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.760]   Hey, Leo.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.760]   Sorry about the altitude problem here.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.760]   (laughs)
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.760]   You are my high.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.760]   So we aren't going to have video from Andy this week,
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.760]   but we do have audio, and that's plenty.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.760]   Tell us about the Council on World Affairs.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.760]   What is that?
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.760]   It's pretty cool.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.760]   They've been doing this annual conference for the past, like, six to seven decades,
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.760]   where they bring in about a hundred people from all kinds of disciplines,
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.760]   like science, technology, politics, religion, entertainment,
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.760]   and they have a hundred panels that are open to the public,
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.760]   the entire Boulder community, discussing pretty much every single topic they can think of.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.760]   That seems relevant in whatever year they're holding it.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.760]   For instance, I talked on two panels yesterday,
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.760]   started the morning talking about Apple Pay and Bitcoin,
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.760]   and then the end of the afternoon, I was talking about ways
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.760]   of that government can weaponize the internet.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.760]   Oh, wow.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.760]   And then there's Q&A for everybody afterward,
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.760]   and that was just like my first day.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.760]   So they've got about another seven or eight different talks.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.760]   Over the course of this week, they're going to be doing.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.760]   Did you start going there with Roger Ebert?
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.760]   Was that how you got involved with it in the first place?
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.760]   Yeah, he invited me the first year that was way back in 1997,
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.760]   if you can believe it or not.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.760]   Wow.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.760]   And that's how most people come to be invited,
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.760]   like somebody who has been there a few times,
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.760]   suggests they have to kind of talk you into doing it,
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.760]   because this is not a conference where they pay you to attend,
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.760]   they cover your expenses, and you're here on your own dime,
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.760]   and the fact that so many people come back year after year
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.760]   shows how much fun it is to participate in.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.760]   Roger was a 30-year participant by the time he invited me,
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.760]   and he went out for another 10 years, I think.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.760]   Yeah, so neat.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.760]   In fact, I really want to go,
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.760]   especially because Henry's there,
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.760]   and I just never, I keep forgetting next year.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.760]   It seems like we had this conversation a year ago.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.760]   We'll have to arrange a good off-site broadband source for the show,
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.760]   but it'll be a lot of fun.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.760]   Yeah, that's a good point. We could do that.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.760]   I think Henry's dorm room has excellent broadband.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.760]   Awesome.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.760]   I'm just kidding.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.760]   It does if they're not all torrenting at the same time.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.760]   So did you see, now we were getting ready for the watch, of course,
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.760]   the Apple event I was talking about is 12-01 Pacific time,
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.760]   Friday the 10th, midnight Pacific time, Friday the 10th,
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.760]   Apple will start taking orders online for the Apple watch.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.760]   And of course, when the stores open that day,
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.760]   if I would suggest making an appointment,
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.760]   you'll be able to go in and get a 15-minute appointment,
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.760]   look at the watch, and, well, incidentally,
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.760]   you'll be able to buy a MacBook.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.760]   Will I be able to walk in and get that new MacBook,
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.760]   Renee, you think?
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.760]   Is it going to be a challenge?
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.760]   I don't know.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.760]   Based on previous experience, some stores have them,
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.760]   especially the more busy ones, the flagship stores.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.760]   I don't know what's going to happen, though,
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.760]   because it's also Apple Watch, try on,
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.760]   and will you be fighting your way through everyone yelling,
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.760]   "Millionaire!"
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.760]   Oh, it's going to be crazy.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.760]   Try to get to it.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.760]   I know. It's going to be crazy.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.760]   You know who has an Apple watch?
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.760]   Pharrell has an Apple watch.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.760]   Let me show you his most recent posting 15 hours ago on Instagram.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.760]   He's got the Mickey Mouse watch face.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.760]   That ain't no fake.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.760]   He was wearing it on the voice last night, I'm told.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.760]   It looks like, weirdly enough, he got the edition watch,
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.760]   the $10,000 watch with the cheapest plastic band,
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.760]   I'm sorry, Floro Alastomer Band you can get.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.760]   What was amazing to me is two, 23 weeks ago,
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.760]   Rolex released a $25,000 watch,
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.760]   and it came with a Floralastomer Band as well.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.760]   Oh.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.760]   Is this the new trend?
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.760]   Must be the thing.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.760]   Yeah.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.760]   You must be the thing.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.760]   So I guess Apple is seating these to celebrities already.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.760]   I don't know what the story is.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.760]   Or he blew embargo.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.760]   That's embarrassing.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.760]   Do you think he blew embargo?
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.760]   No, probably not.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:19.760]   If he's on one of the most popular TV shows available the week,
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.760]   two days before the thing is getting ordered,
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.760]   I don't think he's breaking any agreements that he agreed to
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.760]   when he was given that watch.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.760]   I think they probably said cynical.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:32.760]   Can you wear that on the voice tonight?
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.760]   Tim Cook apparently was wearing his at the NCAA championship game.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.760]   Tim Cook blew embargo well.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.760]   You can't trust anybody anymore.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.760]   A lot of people are wearing them.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.760]   Apple has said we'll give you 50% off unless it's the expensive one.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.760]   Then they're only going to give-- this is for Apple employees,
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.760]   not by the way, you, not you.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.760]   Sorry.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.760]   Didn't mean to get you all excited.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.760]   If you work at Apple--
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.760]   I'm excited there for a second.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.760]   Georgia, are you going to get-- I guess we all have to get one.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.760]   I've been waiting for this watch for four years.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.760]   Oh.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:10.760]   So I will be there first to try to grab the watch and/or knock someone else out
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.760]   that's trying to get the watch before me.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.760]   I am so excited.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.760]   Are you going to-- you'll get the sport model, I'm thinking.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.760]   I am going to get the sport model probably,
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.760]   and then I'm going to rock the Milanese band with it.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.760]   Ooh.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.760]   So no one will know it's the sport model.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.760]   No way.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.760]   I'm also, I think, getting the Milanese band only because I like the idea
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:27.760]   that it'll fit any size, right?
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.760]   You don't have to punch a hole in anything or just, you know,
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.760]   or take a link out.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.760]   You just wrap it to what you want.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.760]   So if you want to type one day, my wrists swell a lot.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.760]   It's the elastic waistband of watch straps, Neil.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.760]   Guess who wears elastic waistbands here?
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.760]   My only worry with the Milanese was I was worried that it was going to get caught
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.760]   in my arm hairs.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.760]   Right.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.760]   Which would have been really painful, but I've heard that it does not have that hat.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.760]   I'm told it does not pinch and grab, yeah.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.760]   I can't remember who told me, probably Renee.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.760]   No, we tried it.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.760]   I tried it at the event and neither of us could, could, there was, there were no incidents
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.760]   of arm hair tanglements.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.760]   Okay.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.760]   Well, that actually is important.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.760]   Apple's kind of encouraging people to go to the store though and try before you buy.
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.760]   It's, they, they don't know if there's a really personal item.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:17.760]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.760]   But I, but I wonder what their strategy really is there.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.760]   They're really trying to get this sort of feeding frenzy going for the, in the weeks before.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.760]   Like, iPhones and even the new MacBook, you can space things out.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.760]   You can get people in without really trying to say, Hey, look, we're going to open the,
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.760]   the floodgates early here and we're going to try to encourage people to keep coming in
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.760]   and, and trying it.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:44.760]   I think that they appreciate that they, no one can really relate to what a smartwatch is or does.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.760]   They really are going to have to have that experience before they figure out what they can do with this.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:55.760]   I was being driven back to my house for about 20 minutes by a student and we had to talk about smartwatches.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:01.760]   And he, it was the same conversation that I've been having with people for the past six to eight months where I don't wear a watch.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.760]   I, someone gave me a sport watch.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.760]   I worked for about a couple of weeks and I don't wear it anymore.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.760]   Even, you know, even free.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.760]   You couldn't get them to wear it and they just don't understand what a smartwatch is going to do for them.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.760]   So that's, there's so, there's so much that Apple is doing with the launch of this watch.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.760]   They have never done with any other product before.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.760]   Even all those product videos.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.760]   I'm not sure if they, they launched the iPhone with the exact same amount of like pre-release.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.760]   Here's a walkthrough of what you're going to expect when you see this.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.760]   I mean, they, this is really going to be an important point for them to make.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:35.760]   I'm going to be angry if it's Joshua Topolsky also has an Apple watch.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.760]   Is that not, that's not an Apple.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.760]   Is that a zoom in on that?
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.760]   Do you, can you set her?
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.760]   Zoom.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.760]   Enhance.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.760]   Set her.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.760]   Zoom.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.760]   Enhance.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:51.760]   Zoom.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.760]   Definitely.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.760]   He's a smaller one.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:11:03.760]   It was an interesting memo from Angela Aron's that Business Insider published earlier today saying that she was trying to end the era of the massive lineups.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.760]   She thought it would be a better experience if they did more.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:13.760]   And they've been doing this for a while, especially with the iPhones, if they did more pre-orders so that it wasn't as hectic experience for people at the retail stores on launch day.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:18.760]   I'm guessing.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:28.760]   I think that's a long overdue because I think that we were getting to the point where all those lines were more, getting to be more embarrassing for Apple than a positive thing because now the line is all about people who are just kind of kind of hanging out for two days.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:34.760]   Causing big, big crowds that don't really enhance the attractiveness of the product.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:44.760]   And certainly the quotes in the memo indicate that it's more like, look, customers are not having a good experience if they think they're going to show up on the launch day and get a product.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:53.760]   We want to sort of walk them towards a process where they are nice and safe and snug inside their homes and they make an order and they don't show up until they know for a fact they can actually get it.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.760]   And scalper is also kind of making a lesson still experience.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.760]   Do you think they'll be scalper?
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:11:59.760]   I don't know.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.760]   I guess it will.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.760]   But to say nothing about all the people who are like saying, my God, this is ridiculous.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.760]   All I want is a 64 gigabyte phone in the color that I want.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.760]   And I have to keep calling every store on every Tuesday to see if they have them.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.760]   And those are the sort of complaints that are going to start to fester.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.760]   I just want a USB cable.
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.760]   What the hell is it?
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:22.760]   Will I be able to, will you be able to mix and match any band, any watch?
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.760]   I think I asked you this already.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.760]   Yes.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:29.760]   As long as at the same size, so 42 with 42 millimeter bands with 42 millimeter case and the 38 millimeter bands with 38 millimeter case.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:35.760]   It remains to be seen how much stock they'll have of additional bands at launch, but eventually they should all be available.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.760]   You might want to get a couple, right?
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:38.760]   Not as first.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:39.760]   You can't get the addition though.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.760]   The addition ones are exclusive, but you can get any of the Apple watch, any of the Apple watch.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.760]   You'd be crazy to buy a 350 dollar Apple watch and put a $7,000 band on it.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:52.760]   And you also can't get the sports version, the silver sports version with the black band.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.760]   So you have to choose between the white and the colored versions if you would like that.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:01.760]   You get the black band separately though, so you have to pay 50 bucks more if you want to
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.760]   silver watch the black band.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.760]   So you can get it later.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:05.760]   I get it.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:13.760]   Apple employees will get 50% off the aluminum and stainless steel models and a mere $550 off the gold version.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.760]   Come on, Apple, you know that the markups higher on the gold one.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.760]   It's higher.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.760]   So you could give them more.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.760]   They probably don't want a lot of employees getting on the stock.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.760]   It doesn't look good.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.760]   Yeah.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.760]   It's embarrassing when your janitor is walking around with a $10,000 watch.
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:33.760]   It isn't exactly.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:38.760]   Maybe they're instituting a no riff ref policy in Apple watch edition.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.760]   The iPhone is my country's secondary market.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:45.760]   If you start having, if they get half price, editions, you might start seeing some of those show up in secondary markets.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.760]   I apologize for it.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.760]   A lot on eBay.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.760]   A T-Mobile sat in there.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.760]   That is not a subliminal ad for T-Mobile.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.760]   It's just my phone rebooting.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:14:05.760]   Mark Gurman says that the iPad, while not offered to discount it for employees, the iPhone original iPhone was given free to almost everybody.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:13.760]   So the special pricing lasts for 90 days, starting on Friday.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.760]   Anybody here going to get in line?
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.760]   Yeah, I'll do it for fun.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.760]   Like it'd been night.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:24.760]   I don't think I'm lying at midnight, but I'll go over to the stores and see what's going on.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.760]   Oh, I'm going to the stores.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:27.760]   I want to pick up a MacBook, frankly.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:37.760]   What I'm going to do, I think, and tell me if my strategy is mistaken, is at 1201, I remember doing this for the iPhone 6 and their servers were all screwed up.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:38.760]   It never did happen.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:45.760]   But at 1201, I will go to the Apple store on Friday morning and order.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.760]   And that way I'll get it on the 24th, right?
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:48.760]   I can do that, right?
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.760]   Absolutely.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:50.760]   The pre-order has become available.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:57.760]   The joke going around now is because Star Wars is launching on iTunes on Friday the 10th Apple Apple Watch and Star Wars.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:58.760]   Come on, Apple!
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.760]   Is that different servers or is it all the same?
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.760]   I mean, it's under the eye.
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:03.760]   Like, that's iTunes.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.760]   So it's all ADQ's job.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.760]   Oh, Eddie.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.760]   Eddie just showing off this time.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.760]   Say, "Hey, I can hail that."
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:11.760]   What else do you want to do?
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.760]   Especially on edition, though, so there might not be that high demand.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.760]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.760]   We also know that you can get Apple Care for the watch.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.760]   Actually, Apple Care Plus for the watch.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.760]   It'll be $1,000 for the edition.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.760]   $79 for the watch.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:34.760]   The regular middle one, the stainless steel and $59 for the sport version.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.760]   Why?
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:41.760]   Okay, so I apparently don't understand what Apple Care Plus does.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:46.760]   So you'll need to explain to me because I thought that this is a replacement program.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.760]   So the regular, you get Apple Care.
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:52.760]   Anyone who buys an Apple Watch gets Apple Care, which includes 90 days of phone support
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.760]   and a year of hardware warranty.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.760]   It's an extended warranty, the regular Apple Care.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.760]   Yes, so the Apple Care, well, regular Apple Care is a regular warranty.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.760]   And most jurisdictions have very similar rules and effect anyway.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.760]   They would have to offer at least a year of performance.
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.760]   Wait a minute, so why should I pay for Apple Care if it's a assignment?
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.760]   Apple Care Plus is what you're paying for.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:13.760]   And what Apple Care Plus does is on the regular Apple Watch and on the Apple Watch sport,
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:20.760]   it increases it to two years of both phone support and hardware replacement.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:25.760]   Plus, sorry, hardware defects, typical hardware insurance, plus two incidents of damage.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.760]   So if you drop it or you drop it in water or anything like that, there's a service fee.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.760]   I don't know if they've said how much it is.
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.760]   It's usually $79 or $99.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.760]   They'll basically just fix anything that you accidentally break on the watch for you.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.760]   But they only do it twice in two years.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.760]   Yeah, you get two incidents in those two years.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.760]   The Apple Watch edition is slightly different.
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.760]   It comes with the two years automatically.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.760]   The Apple Care Plus does theirs at a third year and it gives you 24/7 support.
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.760]   I don't know if a guy in a bow tie actually comes here.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:58.760]   Winklev service, Mr. Ferel, here's your new watch.
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.760]   You can be sure they'll have it on the air on the voice.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.760]   Okay, so it sounds like at 59 for the sport, 79 for the stainless steel,
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.760]   that sounds like probably something you should do.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.760]   I do it.
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.760]   Georgia can probably explain it better than me.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.760]   But I do it as stress relief.
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.760]   Once I know I have it, I don't really worry.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.760]   All right.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.760]   Well, it's one of those things.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.760]   You're going to be wearing it on your wrist.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.760]   So there's an increased chance that you're going to knock your wrist against something.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.760]   You're going to drop it.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.760]   I think that I've broken more watches than I've ever even owned.
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.760]   It's just something that I always...
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.760]   What are you breaking?
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:30.760]   Other people's watches?
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.760]   I step on other people's watches.
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.760]   I'm sat on someone else's watch once.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.760]   And I've knocked someone's watch off their wrist.
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:38.760]   It's a long story.
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.760]   So I should actually probably be the person that has AppleCare.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.760]   Okay, so they tell me...
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.760]   If you're getting the watch, you should probably get AppleCare because it would be so sad that
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.760]   you have this new piece of technology.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:51.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.760]   And then you crack the screen.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.760]   And then I have to bring it in.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.760]   It seems pretty reasonable.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.760]   So now I've got to add it up because I'm going to get the Milanese band and I'm going to get the 70...
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.760]   Maybe I will go get the sport instead.
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.760]   I was going to get the stainless steel, but...
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:08.760]   I mean, it depends.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.760]   If you want to collect it, like I have my original iPhone, my original iPad, my original MacBook, my original MacBook.
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.760]   They're all sitting behind me and they're collectors at them.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:20.760]   So I will probably get a stainless steel just so that I have something, you know, Mark Nusimi
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.760]   and Johnny Ivy to add to that shelf.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:28.760]   His special shelf behind him.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.760]   If you have...
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:31.760]   Okay.
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:36.760]   If you have standard AppleCare, you have to ship the watch back and your replacement will be sent.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.760]   So they're offering standard AppleCare, but you just get that for free.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:42.760]   Okay.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.760]   So AppleCare, you pay for it on a MacBook, but you don't pay for it.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:51.760]   If the naming is weird, the AppleCare Plus, I think they added the Plus because it has those two incidents as well,
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.760]   which the MacBooks don't have.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.760]   Right.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.760]   So it is basically the...
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.760]   Okay.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.760]   It's just, it's confusingly labeled.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.760]   Okay.
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.760]   See, this is kind of the problem that we're going to be dealing with, like with all these...
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.760]   like store orders.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.760]   It's like you could...
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.760]   You go into Walmart, you see a case full of watches, you pick out the one you want, you walk out with it.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:14.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.760]   And when you don't have that ability to do it, now you don't know, well, where's the one where I get this color band,
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.760]   which is the one where I get this service policy?
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.760]   What do I get for free with it?
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:23.760]   Oh boy.
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.760]   We're going to get so many calls from so many relatives over the next three weeks over this.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.760]   Well, that's why we're spending time right now.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.760]   Because I'm your...
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.760]   I mean, think of me as your old relative.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.760]   Okay.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.760]   Okay.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.760]   I really have been getting a lot of questions like that.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:43.760]   And I keep telling them that don't worry about it until this fall or early next year.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:49.760]   Because I really do think that the first watch is really going to be like the very first iPad or the very first iPhone.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:50.760]   Where if this tech...
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:56.760]   If this brand new technology, this brand new product really excites you, then you will be very, very pleased with it.
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:04.760]   But if you're expecting this brand new phone to act as the same way with all the features of an existing phone, you might be disappointed.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.760]   So I think that this is not going to be the same device that's going to be next year.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.760]   And the people who wait a year, maybe they're going to get a watch that has GPS on it.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:19.760]   Maybe they're going to get a watch with a much more mature operating system and a much more mature app library on it.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:25.760]   So given that so many people have not worn a smart watch before, maybe they want to wait a year and get the more mature.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.760]   And get the more mature version of this.
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.760]   I agree with Andy.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.760]   The only thing that mitigates it a little bit for me is that it's $350.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:39.760]   Most people, at least I'm more readers now, they tell us that they buy the new iPhone and they sell it immediately when the next iPhone is announced.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.760]   So their actual cost of upgrade is only a few hundred dollars each time.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.760]   And that's how they manage to get the new one every year.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:53.760]   And sort of like, yeah, I can wait for the one with the GPS and I can wait for the one with the video and then the wait for the one with the better, bigger screen and then wait for the one with the touch ID.
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.760]   But sometimes it's just fun to get new stuff.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.760]   And because the price, you can get in for $350 and you can probably sell it next year.
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:07.760]   I think if you're sort of on the fence and you don't mind looking at it as a bit of an adventure, then it's a fun thing to take a look at.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.760]   Yeah, I mean, absolutely.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.760]   But I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:18.760]   Oh, well, I think also, you know, if you're using this for health, if you're using this for fitness, if you already carry around a fit, but this is great.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.760]   It will be helpful to you.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.760]   It's going to be something that can help monitor your heart rate.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:33.760]   So if you're not, you know, you don't have a problem with using new technology and having to go through a slight learning curve and how to use it, I think that it's going to be something fun, but also something very helpful.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.760]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:42.760]   I've been spending a lot of time with people who use Microsoft Band, which has got a really soft launch.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:47.760]   I don't think Microsoft ever intended for it to be like a really popular consumer device with this first launch.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.760]   I really think they kind of just wanted to get it out there.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.760]   And it has some nice things about it.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:56.760]   It's a lot of things that are really inconvenient compared to Apple Watch and Moto 360 and all these others.
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.760]   But the thing that really struck me that I'm amazed I'm so stupid.
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:11.760]   I didn't realize it is that I see people wearing this relatively small black rubber band on their right wrist, but on their left wrist, they can still wear their grandfather's watch.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:15.760]   They can still wear whatever sport or fashion watch that they really, really like.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:22.760]   So I think that just goes to show that there are so many different ways of interpreting the mandate of a wearable watch-like device.
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.760]   I'm glad we got three very different approaches to it on the market.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:38.760]   The FDA apparently is going to be a little bit less, a little bit more, I don't know, they're not going to be as finicky about the Apple Watch.
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:44.760]   It's going to take, according to the FDA, almost hands-off approach.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.760]   So that's good.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:55.760]   They're going to take a very light touch towards wearable health devices going forward, not just the Apple Watch, but everything else, all those health bands.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:01.760]   But Cool Patel, who's the FDA's associate director for Digital Health, told Bloomberg Business,
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:09.760]   that technology is primarily focused on motivating someone to stay healthy rather than diagnosing or treating a disease.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.760]   That's good.
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:11.760]   That's stuff we don't want to regulate.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.760]   We're taking a very light touch of hands-off approach, said Patel.
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.760]   But it makes sense.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:25.760]   The FDA has always said, if you're going to get a diagnosis or a health advice from a thing, a device, then we want to make sure it's accurate.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.760]   We don't want the Apple Watch to say, "Oh, you need more salt."
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:33.760]   But it's okay for the Apple Watch to say, "Hey, get active.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.760]   You've only taken so many steps, that kind of thing."
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:43.760]   So maybe that gives a lie to some of the stories in the journal and elsewhere that Apple wanted to do more health stuff.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:44.760]   Although I...
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:45.760]   You always want to do more.
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:53.760]   One of the problems with the mainstream media coverage of the Watch is that their headlines are always misaligned with their actual content.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.760]   And when you look at the Watch, they make a list of everything we could possibly do.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:57.760]   What sensors exist?
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.760]   What could possibly go in here?
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:03.760]   And then they go through carefully and figure out what's realistic for Generation 1, 2, 3, and 4.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.760]   And you could spin that as Apple couldn't do everything.
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.760]   Like, they couldn't make a 5.5 inch iPhone in 2007.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:10.760]   Sorry.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.760]   They got there in 2000.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:13.760]   So the Watch is like that.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:19.760]   There are all sorts of interesting things coming along the road, but they got into this product what they wanted to get into this product for now.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.760]   Right.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:31.760]   But to be fair that a lot of us who commentate them on these things, we're making the same sort of complaints about Android Rare Watch's, where it's certainly not a complete product.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.760]   They did what they were able to do, both with the software and the hardware.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:51.760]   I think that part of our responsibilities to have the imagination and the experience to say, "Yes, I'm going to give you a practical rundown of what this can do right now, but let me tell you what I think is possible, given the hardware that I'm seeing and given the software I'm seeing, and given the people that are making this, who I've talked to, about what their future plans are."
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.760]   I mean, it really is important to remain an open mind.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:25:07.760]   I think that anybody who slams the Apple Watch as a failure in the first few weeks, I think there are people who have pretty much already written that editorial about, "Here's what it doesn't do, and oh my God, I couldn't wait to get it off my wrist. It was a piece of junk, and I will return it almost immediately."
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:19.760]   That's going to be one of the least useful things written because these are people who have no imagination and very little ability to really look at something critically.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:31.760]   I'm sorry, I should walk back one step and say, "I'm not saying that it's not possible to write a positive review of Apple Watch, but it's going to be easy to spot the ones where somebody had a picture in their mind of what their fantasy product should work like.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:41.760]   They were presented with something that did not match this expectation that they had, and on that basis, they were going to proclaim this one thing of failure instead of having a more balanced approach to it."
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:54.760]   The Malay Gandhi, managing director of Rock Health, a health-focused venture capital firm in San Francisco is interviewed in the Bloomberg Business piece,
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:26:01.760]   it points out that the FDA's annual budget is at one quarter of what Apple made last quarter.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:17.760]   It's about $4.5 billion. The issue is partly an enforcement issue. Dr. Mamma and Chatham also points out the FDA has no authority to enforce motivational devices,
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:23.760]   so they're going to take a light touch. They're not allowed to do anything about it.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:35.760]   Well, good. You feel like, Georgia, from what you've seen, and we'll show a few of these videos, by the way, what you've seen from these videos and read that the Apple Watch is going to be very useful to you.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:40.760]   More so you think than a Fitbit or a Nike fuel band or a jawbone up?
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:53.760]   Well, I think that one of the coolest things that's going to change with the Apple Watch is that I go down to a tech conference and I see everyone pulling out their phone or using Google Glass, and there's something in between yourself and the people that you're having a conversation with.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:27:04.760]   What I love about the Apple Watch is that very effortlessly, without breaking a conversation, you can check if a notification is something important or not, and it keeps your eye onto a conversation.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:14.760]   And so I think that that's a really nice thing, so hopefully we're not going to be seeing everyone pulling out their phone constantly and checking their phone instead of checking the people that they are with.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:25.760]   The one thing that I worry about with the Apple Watch on the other side is the stress levels of people that are constantly turning on notifications and having everything beep and buzz.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:36.760]   I think that there's going to be a huge learning curve on how much is comfortable and how much increases your level of stress because you're going to feel constantly beholden to take a look every time you get a slight tap.
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:37.760]   Yeah.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.760]   Well, I know I will.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:46.760]   Although you get used to this haptic interface and maybe we should start trusting it.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:57.760]   The benefit of the Fitbit also is that this doesn't just measure steps and stairs, it also does calories burned, it does exercise equipment inside and outside, which I've always wanted because I use a rolling machine.
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:04.760]   It's got a lot of really, like not next generation, but stuff that I've always wanted in the other products and just haven't had yet.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.760]   And it's constant heart rate monitoring, right?
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:08.760]   It's always doing.
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:19.760]   That's the stuff that's the big win for me because I had a Fitbit for a while, but I'm just not in the habit of checking my Fitbit to see where I am at the end of the day or in the per course of the day.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:32.760]   Whereas this Moto 360 watch, I'm checking the time several times a day, and that's when I will see a little card just like at the very, very bottom of the time screen saying, "Oh, by the way, you are about 70, you're only about 1000 steps short of your fitness goal."
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:41.760]   And without a rhyme, you think, "Well, okay, maybe I will walk home instead of getting a card this time." And it's that kind of subtle little reminders that subtle awareness that really helps you out.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.760]   I noticed that from wearing a fuel band and a Fitbit and all that.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.760]   That's the cool thing.
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:55.760]   In the screen that you're seeing right now, I love the fact in the upper left-hand corner you can designate that corner of the screen as, "Here is a little micro version of those three loops showing you what your activity level is."
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:03.760]   So it's just going to be almost like the phases of the moon, a little reminder of, "Here is your status on how well you're doing for your fitness on the day."
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.760]   And that's what's really going to help people out.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.760]   I'm getting a little excited.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:11.760]   So Apple has released a four now videos.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.760]   I think you were right, Renee.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:20.760]   The reason they want to get people in the store is they feel they'll be a learning curve and they want people to start thinking about how to use the watch.
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:24.760]   So they're not just looking at it going, "Ah, they don't want returns in the first two days."
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:32.760]   I did an article on this called Stay Calm and Apple Watch On because I noticed in the demo area a lot of people tried to use the Apple Watch like it was an iPhone.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:37.760]   They pressed it into the crown, they went to the home screen, they hunted around for the messages app, they went to start a new message.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:42.760]   And when we were doing the demo, the guy just lifted it up and said, "Hey, Siri, send a message to Bob."
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.760]   And it's a complete, it's an inversion. It's not a pull interface. It's a push interface.
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:50.760]   And most people are going to engage through notifications, through glances in a very different way.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:55.760]   And I think both watching these videos and being in the store and getting those demos is going to be vital.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:30:00.760]   Just as I like, we had to learn multi-touch is intuitive now. It wasn't when the iPhone first came out.
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:06.760]   That's why Apple did so many videos. We're going to have to learn how to use the sort of push glance look-based interface.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:10.760]   And I think they named it very specifically to sort of encourage us to use it that way.
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.760]   Yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:21.760]   And if I keep mentioning the watch that I wear every day, it's only because I think it's a good frame of reference for smart watches in general.
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:29.760]   That my main interface with this watch is really voice commands because all I have to do is describe what I want to be reminded of,
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.760]   what I want to watch, what I want to get information on, and it gets that information for me.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:41.760]   The more that you try to use it like a multi-touch screen, the more it's going to fail for you, the more disappointed you're going to be.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:46.760]   This is the first really good walkthrough that they've given of, here's what the actual experience is going to be like.
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:53.760]   And that's something they failed to do in September. They even failed to do it last month, which I have to admit got me really concerned.
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:58.760]   So we're starting to get some indication of, here's what you can anticipate.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.760]   Here's what the language of using this watch is going to be.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.760]   And I got to say that I do like most of what I'm seeing.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:10.760]   There are a couple of points that I still think I'm still a little bit confused on because I see some inconsistencies.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:17.760]   I see some inconsistencies on how you surface like an action button, for instance, when you decide that here's a notification I want to do something with.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.760]   It seems like sometimes you have to touch the screen to do that. Sometimes you have to swipe to do that.
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:25.760]   So I'm sure that's going to be more clear when I have an actual watch on my wrist.
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:28.760]   But it really seems like they have to teach a new language here.
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.760]   And it's not wrong for them to have to develop a new language.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.760]   It's okay if you have to learn how to use something.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:40.760]   These videos are actually a great idea. They're going to do more. They only have four.
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:45.760]   But you can see there's ghostly impressions of seven more that they want to do.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:49.760]   So the first one is just kind of a generic introduction.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.760]   And then they're going through features one by one.
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:56.760]   There'll be messages, watch faces, how to use the digital touch.
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:02.760]   They've got coming soon, phone calls, Siri, maps, music, Apple Pay, activity and workout.
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.760]   I was hoping they would release one of these a day starting last week.
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:11.760]   But they seem stuck at four. But I'm sure they're going to be getting these out.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.760]   I hope before April 10th because I think it would behoove.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.760]   Well, I guess they only really have to get them out before April 24th, don't they?
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:22.760]   When you see someone just raise the watch up and say, "Hi, hello. Yeah, okay.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.760]   I'll be back in a few minutes and then hang up the phone and just go right back talking to you."
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.760]   It's a pretty awesome experience.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.760]   Wow. I can't really.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:29.760]   It's Dick Tracy.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.760]   Have you watched somebody really use this other way than the demo room?
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.760]   I may have.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:38.760]   I may have been incredibly impressed and written thinly veiled articles
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.760]   of what I imagine such interactions would be like.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:44.760]   Yeah. Okay. So we could just say that has the Ring of Truth.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.760]   I'm thinking maybe the reason that Gabe wanted to Polsky.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.760]   He does doesn't need to do gadgets in Jimmy Fallon on the Tonight Show.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:53.760]   Yeah. He also does all the Bloomberg coverage in Bloomberg as a major pub.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:56.760]   True. But I wouldn't be surprised. I think they want to get it on TV.
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.760]   I don't think they care about Bloomberg as much.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.760]   Does somebody in my eye more have one?
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.760]   Not to my knowledge.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.760]   Yeah. Does somebody at... I wonder if it... There's no Mac world anymore.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.760]   Where else?
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.760]   Yeah, there's their Mackeld offices.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.760]   There's offices. There's a website.
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.760]   I thought this digital touch was interesting.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.760]   This is kind of one of the more trivial uses of it.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:24.760]   But in fact, you've even written about this Renee how it might have some potential of more value.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:30.760]   They also... They alternate between male and female narrators and wrists.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.760]   So the first thing you're going to want to do is set up...
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:35.760]   Choose a friend.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:36.760]   Here she is.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.760]   To set up your favorites menu, right?
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.760]   It looks like you can get quite a few on there.
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:42.760]   3, 6, 9, 12.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:43.760]   I don't have them.
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.760]   This is so interesting to me because there's two buttons on the phone.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.760]   And a lot of people have brought this up. You have the digital crown and then you have the other button.
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.760]   Yeah. That's twice as many as an iPhone.
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.760]   So the iPhone has the home button and the sleep button.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:55.760]   So it's analogous.
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:00.760]   I don't know if it'll ship this way, but you can technically right now press those two buttons to take a screenshot.
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.760]   So it's very similar to an iPhone.
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:08.760]   But they've assigned one click of that button to bring you to friends, which means that they're really emphasizing communications.
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:12.760]   Because if you're doing anything stressful, that's the easiest action to perform.
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:18.760]   Some people really want it to do a lapse for jogging because they feel like when they're jogging, they need something really easy to do.
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:22.760]   And other people want just one click right now. It's two clicks for Apple Pay.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:27.760]   If you hold it down, you get the shutdown. If you press it again, you get the force click.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:36.760]   There's a whole bunch of stuff layered in there, but the primary ones are really interesting choice apples made on what, again, you hold down the digital crown, you get Siri, you press it twice.
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:39.760]   You flip between the clock face and the most recently used app.
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.760]   You do it three times, you get accessibility.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.760]   So assigning each one of those, and no one's going to use all of them.
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.760]   Is that changeable?
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.760]   Or are you stuck with those actions?
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:52.760]   Not so far. But right now, they're very similar to what happens with the iPhone.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:55.760]   You get the single click of the home button, the double click, the triple click.
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:00.760]   No one uses them all, all the time. So the more obscure ones are just from more rarely used actions.
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:06.760]   And that's fine because you can stage interface that way. It makes it very easy for people who want it more will go further to get it.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:12.760]   But it is interesting how much stuff they did bring over and what priority they assigned to all those on the watch.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:18.760]   That was just my concern. As I was watching these videos, because again, I was not the watch event last month.
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:21.760]   So I have now had experience with a live fire version of this.
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:26.760]   I've had experience with the hardware, but not the actual software that was shown last month.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:40.760]   And they were showing things like the screen is sort of leveraged towards just showing you a piece of information without you having to do anything to get that information.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:48.760]   And if you want to action on that information, you have to do something to surface some sort of a button that lets you interact.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:55.760]   And there's sometimes when they're trying to say, "Well, now if you simply hold and press on that screen, that's when you get the reply button coming up."
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:02.760]   And there are other parts of this video where it seemed to say, "And to do this, you simply swipe up where you scroll down to see options on what you can do with this."
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:10.760]   I don't know whether that's a clumsiness of my thinking, a clumsiness in the video, or maybe a bit of friction inside the interface itself.
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:14.760]   Having two buttons, I think, does kind of bring that up for me anyway.
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.760]   And you're right, Andy, I have an open mind.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.760]   It just bothers me that I think it's a brilliant idea to have.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:23.760]   Here is one big button that does nothing but bring up people. That's brilliant.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.760]   And that's the case, even long pressing or force pressing.
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:34.760]   I'm saying, having, here's front and center, here's one of the biggest buttons. You can just simply not even divert your attention away from what you were looking at.
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:37.760]   You can just simply tap a button that you can feel and you see that.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:43.760]   That's a very, very elegant and interesting way of communicating what this watch is supposed to do.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:49.760]   It's supposed to help you connect to people. It's when you start thinking, "Oh, wait, is this one of those things where I have to hold and press this?
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:53.760]   Or is this one of the things where I have to click this several times to make this work?"
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:57.760]   So for the most part, I've watched these videos a few times now.
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:03.760]   And I was very pleased with what I saw. There are a couple of rough edges that are rather, I'm sorry, let's be more accurate and say,
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:08.760]   there are some things I still don't understand that seem a little bit confusing to me.
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:12.760]   There is a learning curve, though. There's absolutely a learning curve.
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:17.760]   I don't know if you guys remember the iPad. The button would be the mute button, or sorry, it was orientation-
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.760]   Oh, yeah, they changed it.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:24.760]   But then it was, well, no plan survives contact with a million or two million or five million active users.
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:28.760]   And that's part of the interesting thing of this is maybe they will let you reassign that later.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:32.760]   They'll say, "You know, there's five functions on this. Do you want one click to be friends? Do you want one click to be apple paid?
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:39.760]   Do you want one click to be timekeeping?" I mean, there's a lot of room for them to maneuver with this after they see how people react to it.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:43.760]   Yeah, that's definitely true. And there are a couple of different aspects to this.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:47.760]   It's true that you could reassign that that slidey button on the side of the iPad.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:53.760]   But it's not as though if you shift, if you move it up, then it's silent, but if you move it up and then press it in,
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:58.760]   now you've got the exact access series, if you move it up and then sort of hold it as you push it in,
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:01.760]   then that's the sort of complexity that I'm talking about.
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:05.760]   But it's possible that this is all just, you know, talking, this is all just worrying about nothing
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:09.760]   because some of my favorite interface things are you have a button that just simply does one thing,
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:13.760]   like the home button on the iPad and on the iPhone.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:20.760]   You associate it with that, you touch this and you will instantly be teleported wherever you are back to a familiar grid of your application icons.
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:25.760]   It's a very reassuring thing to have. Now, maybe after the first month, you figure out that, "Oh, wait a minute,
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:30.760]   if I actually double tap on this, that will actually get me to a carousel of all my running apps."
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:34.760]   And so once you discover that, that's great. And it's a great shortcut.
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:41.760]   But if you never discover that, then it doesn't really interfere with how that button immediately works.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:45.760]   So it's going to be an interesting learning process.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:51.760]   Yeah, I think that it's going to take that usual two-week learning curve of how do you use this,
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:57.760]   and you're going to feel that regular discomfort of it not wanting to do exactly what you want to do at the moment.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:01.760]   I think that, you know, depending on what screen you're on, different buttons are going to do different things.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:06.760]   I think that's going to be very confusing for people because they're used to always having a center home button.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:11.760]   We're going to expect that this is going to work like an iPhone, and it just can't.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:15.760]   It's just too small of real estate in order to interact with the same way.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:19.760]   So there'll definitely be people calling, probably most of us, up of how to use this.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.760]   Why is this not working the way that we hope it would?
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.760]   Let's take a break. I want to take a little break. We can come back.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:29.760]   If you have more watch thoughts, we'll certainly do more watch, although this concludes the primary portion of the watch segment.
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:35.760]   There's lots of other things to talk about, including I've got the new MacBook Pro, the 13-inch with the Force.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.760]   What's it called? Force Touch Track.
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.760]   Force Touch Track.
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:39.760]   Force Touch Track Pack.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.760]   And I can give you some thoughts on that.
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:48.760]   Georgia Dows here. It's great to have you, Georgia, from iMOR.com, her first time on the show.
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:49.760]   Thank you for having me.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.760]   Oh, you just, I wish you didn't work on Tuesdays. That's all I can say.
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.760]   Just quit your job.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:55.760]   Right.
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:56.760]   You hear every Tuesday.
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:01.760]   She writes it, "What's your beat at iMOR?"
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:05.760]   I used to do a lot of the reviews, so I used to do all the cases.
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:13.760]   We used to do a lot of videos there, and then I do some special pieces on different ways of psychology and the way that we use our technology.
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:17.760]   Yeah. I know you gave a talk at All about that.
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:19.760]   I did one on innovation.
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.760]   Is that online anywhere?
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.760]   I believe that it is. I think that it's already up.
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:28.760]   So that was on motivation. Why do we get stuck? How can we get past it?
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:38.760]   And we also then had an iMOR room where we each serenity, Renee, and I each gave a split and talk and dealing with the different things that might be stopping us from being more motivated.
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:47.760]   ULL.ie, if you want to see more about the 2015 old conference, and I presume at some point, if they haven't already, they'll have your video up.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:48.760]   I want to watch that.
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:53.760]   And she is not toot her own heart too much, but she's keynoting the NS North conference.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.760]   I think Saturday is a Saturday, Georgie.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:59.760]   I'm leaving on Friday. I'm actually keynoting on Friday. The problem is that's April 10th.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.760]   So I'm going to be driving instead of making my appointment.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.760]   What?
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.760]   I know it's a trial in my life.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:06.760]   That's scheduling.
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:07.760]   Oh.
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:08.760]   Right.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:09.760]   Oh.
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:10.760]   I know.
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:15.760]   So it's going to be a little bit of a hardship while I'm driving down and everyone's going to be talking about their experiences with trying on the watch.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.760]   Seems like you guys have some fun up there at iMOR.
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:22.760]   That's like a little geek, geek heaven. A little bit geek heaven.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:24.760]   We have the most fun.
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:27.760]   I don't know every other site, but we have a blast.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:28.760]   Seems like it.
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:32.760]   We do all kinds of craziness. We're jumping on beds, squirting each other with water guns.
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:36.760]   Renee caught me during our ice bucket challenge. I was bleeding during...
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.760]   Did I just cut you? I just sent it in your direction.
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:42.760]   You threw an ice bucket at Georgia? No.
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:49.760]   So what happened was it was the ice bucket challenge and it took Georgia so long to get ready that the ice fused into larger pieces of ice.
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:52.760]   Wow. And we didn't notice that until after it attacked me.
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.760]   Oh, it's her fault for taking so long to get ready. Is that what you're saying?
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:55.760]   It's it knows everybody's fault.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:56.760]   All right.
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:57.760]   Nobody walks away cleaning.
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:02.760]   I thank you, Georgia. I know your your throat is killing you from talking at old, but thank you for being here.
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:09.760]   Renee Richie from iMOR.com also. Great place to go as always, but he also does the debug podcast there.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.760]   I know Georgia's on some of the podcasts, right?
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.760]   Yeah, she does vector with us.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:14.760]   Vector.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:17.760]   You can find that at iMOR.com.
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:27.760]   Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times. He's in Colorado today for the Council on World Affairs, but we've got him via still picture.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:35.760]   We're I'm going to pretend like I'm it's like 1978 and I'm giving like a live from a conference in Moscow.
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:36.760]   I love it.
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:39.760]   Test negotiations closed today, Leo.
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:47.760]   Freshness insisted a hard line stance on NATO communities on the line with us now via satellite phone from musklaw.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:51.760]   Our show today brought to you by Linda.com. Here is a great way to learn.
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:57.760]   I think we I think human beings are learning machines. We're happiest when we're learning something new.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.760]   When we're solving problems, I think we're all just kind of curious.
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:06.760]   If you want to make things happen, I want you to maybe take better photos, build a better website.
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:09.760]   Matt, have you always wanted a master Photoshop or Lightroom?
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:11.760]   Maybe that's just me.
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:14.760]   Sharpen your negotiation skills, build a better resume.
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.760]   Linda.com has everything you need to feed your curious minds.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:24.760]   If because you're Mac folks, we figure you'll be interested in the and I've been doing this one, the swift essential training.
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:28.760]   They also have objective C essential training for the old school coders.
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:32.760]   They also have an amazing course called building a note taking app.
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:38.760]   This is kind of cool for iOS 8, so you actually start from beginning to end to build an app for an iPhone.
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:44.760]   Within hours, you'll have created that working app and kind of painlessly learned the basics of developing for iOS.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:52.760]   There's even a course and I think this would be a great one for high schoolers, programming for non programmers, and they do it with iOS 8 as well.
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:44:00.760]   LYNDA, Linda.com. With your membership, you get access to every course taught by the best, the top experts in the field.
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:05.760]   They're passionate about their subject matter and they're passionate about communicating to you and
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:12.760]   Linda does such a great job of producing these. They're really great. They chop them up into small chunks so you can learn at your own pace.
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:18.760]   You can browse and search the course transcript so you can find exactly what you want and follow along.
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:24.760]   I know a lot of you like to read along. It's great. You can also take notes there and refer to them later.
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:28.760]   You can even watch these on the go, download them and put them on your Android or iOS device.
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:32.760]   Create playlists, customize your learning path, share them with friends.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:38.760]   It's so cool that what we've done is we've arranged a 10-day kind of run-of-the-place trial offer for free.
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:47.760]   Go to LYNDA, Linda.com/MacBreak. You've got 10 days and you've got access to all of the 3,000 courses.
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:52.760]   Pick a couple, watch a little bit here, a little bit there. Get a sense of what they can offer. I think you will love them.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:59.760]   If nothing else, go watch Bert Monroy. He's just the greatest. Even if you don't have no interest in Photoshop,
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:04.760]   LYNDA, Ben Long's got a great photo. Of course, Lisa and I are watching that one.
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:10.760]   We have the basics of composition stuff. LYNDA.com/MacBreak.
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:13.760]   From a beginner to expert, there's something for everybody.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:18.760]   At Linda.com, we thank them so much for their support of MacBreak.
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:23.760]   Weekly, Georgia Dow, Renee Ritchie and the Inaco. We're talking Apple.
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:28.760]   We have been talking the Apple Watch. Of course, Wired Magazine has an article,
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:35.760]   "The Secret History of the Apple Watch." David Pierce writing about this.
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:43.760]   You've been following this all very closely. By the way, nice job in production, Wired.
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:49.760]   They're doing something really beautiful here. This is like reading a great magazine article,
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:56.760]   a New Yorker article with beautiful illustrations. What do you think of this? Any revelations here?
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:05.760]   Most of it seemed to be the same stuff that I got talking to people who were designing
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:10.760]   two different kinds of Android Red watches. It's very familiar to stuff I was talking about
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:14.760]   to people who were not involved directly in the development of the Pebble,
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:20.760]   but had spent a lot of time with those people. It seems like they're reiterating a lot of things
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:25.760]   that seem to be intrinsic and obvious to the design of a smart watch. Not a whole lot of surprises.
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:31.760]   The one interesting thing to take away is that they did make the point that this person was
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:34.760]   somewhat a controversial hire.
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:40.760]   Kruber called a "Linscha Bozo" a bad hire. He was the Flash guy.
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:45.760]   He was the guy at Adobe who said AI fun should really support Flash. That's part of the problem.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:51.760]   Well, but I mean, it's like, I don't know, it ignored the idea that there were some good arguments
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:55.760]   that he was making. And also saying, "Oh my God, what use could this person be?"
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:59.760]   because he had an opinion that was not shared by me being the commentator.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:06.760]   One of the interesting things to me is that they... We all know this. Apple tests a lot.
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:13.760]   There was this old saying that you do 100 prototypes, sorry, 100 ideas, 10 prototypes, one final version.
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.760]   One of the prototypes they mentioned was using a timeline-based interface,
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.760]   which sounds very similar to what Pebble is shipping as their next generation interface.
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:23.760]   But Apple decided against that because even though it would be past, present, and future,
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:27.760]   it didn't do enough in their minds, at least, to prioritize the importance of that information.
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:34.760]   It was just chronological and they wanted to have multiple dimensions of importance surfaced on the Apple Watch.
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:40.760]   So things like... Just a little bit about how the project started, how the development went on it.
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:45.760]   I thought were really interesting. I kind of wish that it had gone deeper into some of the stuff.
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:49.760]   And some of it was hard to tell what was David and what was Apple.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:56.760]   Just because it was described to Apple and what the journalists kind of takes away from that,
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.760]   I think are very different things.
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:03.760]   I like... I'm a history buff. I like knowing all this kind of stuff, so all these details are better for me.
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:08.760]   By the way, I have to give you credit because I stuck with becoming Steve Jobs and you're right.
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:12.760]   This is actually a really good book. And I can see why the Jobs fans like it,
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:18.760]   because it's a much more fully formed picture of Steve than...
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:19.760]   Not whitewashed.
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:25.760]   It's not... Well, it isn't whitewashed. And now in hindsight, the Isaacson looks a little bit more whitewashed.
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:28.760]   I mean, it really is the full picture of Steve Jobs.
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:33.760]   And I feel... I'm still not finished only in chapter 7, but I feel like I'm learning...
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:37.760]   I feel like I'm getting to know Steve in a much better way. It's really well done.
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:42.760]   It made me re-readcreative, sorry, creativity incorporated right afterwards because they kept referencing it.
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:46.760]   I'm dying to read this. This is, of course, the president of Pixar.
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:52.760]   And in the book, they really give... They say, "Steve would take credit for Toy Story. It ain't that.
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:54.760]   It's the president of Pixar whose name escapes me."
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:55.760]   Ed Catmull.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:00.760]   That's right. Ed Catmull and, of course, John Lasseter, who were the real geniuses there.
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:04.760]   Catmull's written book that I can't wait to read called Creative Incorporated.
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:11.760]   Creative Incorporated. And apparently it is going to be my next book because Schlender and Tetselli say...
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:14.760]   It's the book on how to manage creatives.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:17.760]   Yeah, well, not just that. You had to manage down all the talent in Pixar.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:21.760]   And a lot of Hollywood individuals, they just leave after a project. They make a project. They leave.
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:27.760]   They kept this group together. Also, they knew how to manage up to George Lucas and Steve Jobs, which is not an easy time.
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:28.760]   Not easy, yeah.
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:33.760]   Well, one of the things they did we learned from the book is just keep their physical distance.
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:40.760]   Catmull said, "We're going to be as... Pixar's going to be far away from next," which Steve had to run as possible.
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:44.760]   And Steve didn't really care to get in traffic, so it was really pretty easy to do.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:50.760]   There was a brilliant story from James Thompson who does the P. Cal Gap and drag things at the oil conference.
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:53.760]   And he shared a little bit that he was the original engineer on the dock.
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:59.760]   And he was working out of Apple's Irish office. And he went to Apple one day for one of the meetings.
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:03.760]   And Steve Jobs was alone with the human interface guy. And he said, "How's the dock going?"
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:06.760]   And the human interface guy said, "It's great. James is in town from Ireland now."
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:10.760]   And Steve just turned out... Turned left, went to the Bertrand's early office.
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:16.760]   And he said, "Am I to believe that the person working on the dock is living in Effing Ireland?"
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:21.760]   And he told him to fix it immediately. So they went to James and said, "You've got to move to Cupertino."
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:22.760]   And James said, "No."
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:27.760]   So he said, "Okay, here's what we're going to do. We're going to tell Steve that you've moved to Cupertino."
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:28.760]   He'll never ask again.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:31.760]   And then you're never going to be in the same room alone with him again.
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:34.760]   Yeah. How can you write good software in Ireland?
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.760]   That's Steve.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:42.760]   You know, what I get from this book is that he said things like that, and then five minutes later completely forgot that he'd ever said it.
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:45.760]   And would even be embarrassed to admit it.
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:46.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:49.760]   He was fiery. Tim Cook is more...
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:50.760]   One outlet.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:56.760]   One of the most interesting sort of through lines of the book for me was the number of times where he has...
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:00.760]   He felt the need to apologize for past behavior sometimes.
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:05.760]   Even like three minutes after he did something he regretted.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:13.760]   Schlender says, and I think this is accurate, he's basically like a spoiled kid who has temper tantrums and then regrets it.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:16.760]   And Gwanza in his way and no other way.
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:17.760]   Acknowledges...
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:18.760]   Not unusual at that level.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:19.760]   No.
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:33.760]   And I think we all have to acknowledge that it was those, in many cases, character flaws that made Steve Jobs a genius that gave us, you know, the iPad, the iPhone, the iPod, the iMac.
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:36.760]   I can't imagine someone writing a book about this, like about me like this.
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:37.760]   I would...
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.760]   Well, it had to be after his death, right?
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:41.760]   Yeah, but I have enough embarrassing in it though.
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:42.760]   I know.
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:43.760]   I'm going to see it in pretty...
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:44.760]   My God.
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:46.760]   I'm taking notes now and then taking notes now.
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:47.760]   Don't even worry.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:54.760]   But for Steve, you know, an only child, you know, he mentioned spoiled beyond belief.
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:59.760]   His parents thought he was like God's gift and they treated him that way.
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:01.760]   And he ended up believing it.
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:02.760]   Yep.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:03.760]   And it worked for him.
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:06.760]   Well, it did because he didn't let other people get in the way.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:17.760]   And I think one of the greatest quotes from Stephen that came from the Isaacson book was he said you got to realize, you know, everybody kind of accepts everything and assume that the people who designed everything around you were smarter than you.
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:21.760]   He said you got to understand they're dumber than you and you can fix anything.
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:26.760]   You know, you're not stuck with anything that you've been given.
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.760]   So make it better.
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:30.760]   And I think that's not such a bad thing.
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:38.760]   Hey, speaking of that, I thought I'd show you the this is the galaxy S6 edge, which I just got today.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:42.760]   So, but let me show you the fingerprint reader.
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:50.760]   First of all, it works just like it works just like the one on the iPhone and the iPad.
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:55.760]   I might have believed that their previous fingerprint technology has been changed for something that now works like...
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.760]   Yeah, because that's actually a good idea.
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:03.760]   I have the old one on the note for which you had to swipe just like most fingerprint readers until Apple came along.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:04.760]   Now it's Apple style.
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:08.760]   And if you want to add a fingerprint, it's very Apple style.
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:10.760]   I'll show this before the show, but let me show you again.
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:14.760]   I'll go to the lock screen in security and I'll add a fingerprint.
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:18.760]   So it says place your fingertip on the home key to verify your identity.
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:20.760]   So I'm going to unlock it now.
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:21.760]   Whoops.
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:24.760]   I'm going to unlock it now and I'm going to add a new fingerprint.
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:25.760]   Let's add this one.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:28.760]   Doesn't this look a little familiar? Watch this.
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:35.760]   Oh, and as I continue to place my fingertip on the home key, it builds up a fingerprint bit by bit.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.760]   It's black, not red, Leo.
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:39.760]   Okay, all right, all right.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:43.760]   It also asks you just as Apple does to, okay, now stop.
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:45.760]   We're going to try it from a different angle.
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:47.760]   It's very similar.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:51.760]   And I have to say, it seems to be very similar in its actions.
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:53.760]   It seems to be instantaneous.
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:55.760]   It's a great way to unlock the phone.
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:56.760]   I don't have to swipe it anymore.
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:58.760]   It's much more reliable than what we've seen.
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:00.760]   Everybody has these eventually.
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:01.760]   This is so great.
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:02.760]   Especially with TAP never.
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:08.760]   I'm not one to really care about one phone ripping off another phone.
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:13.760]   Usually, maybe like one new phone every five weeks with all the reviews I do.
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:19.760]   And every single time, it's like, gee, I wish that my Android phone had this feature from the iPhone or I'm testing out the iPhone 6.
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:23.760]   Oh, gee, I really wish the, I really missed this feature from Android.
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:32.760]   I mean, when I was using the iPhone 6, it's like, jeez, if Android had a phone that looked and worked exactly like this, I would definitely be buying one exactly like that.
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:36.760]   And so anything that makes a better choice for consumers, that's not just us.
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:48.760]   If they understand, I guess, if they understand the reasons why Apple or Samsung or Motorola made this choice and implement them in their own way, then it's just nothing but upside for consumers.
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:49.760]   This is the edge.
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:51.760]   So this is certainly unique.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:54.760]   I don't think it adds any functionality, but anybody looking at it will go with it.
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:55.760]   That's cool.
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:56.760]   Exactly.
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:57.760]   Beautiful.
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.760]   I don't understand why people are complaining about that.
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:10.760]   If you were to look at any product, Apple, again, any product and you have to justify every single detail as something that adds function, you're not going to get there.
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:14.760]   It's okay for people to buy this simply because my God, it's a really cool wrap around screen.
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:16.760]   I like it and it gives me pleasure.
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:21.760]   Especially as you do a lot of sliding so it feels very kind of nice when you slide.
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:29.760]   And particularly on Android where they really do at a much more intense level the idea of swiping in from one side of the screen actually actions something.
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:35.760]   Apple developers haven't really picked up on that the way that Android developers have.
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:39.760]   I think it's, I mean, just I've only had it for a few.
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:45.760]   And I decided to buy the edge because, and then I felt bad because I read all the reviews and said, "I'll save a hundred bucks. It doesn't do anything."
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:46.760]   But I just, I think it's pretty.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:56.760]   And, yeah, it is. It's a little, people were saying it's very iPhone-y and from certain angles, certainly if you look at it from this angle, that could be the bottom of an iPhone 6.
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:59.760]   But no one's going to mistake this for an iPhone.
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:01.760]   Except for Samsung's wrap according to Engadget.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:02.760]   I don't know if you saw that in Engadget.
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:06.760]   If you had the Samsung wrap picked it up for a few minutes and realized it was an iPhone.
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:07.760]   It's an iPhone.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:08.760]   I could tell the difference.
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:10.760]   I've been having used and owning the edge.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:12.760]   The edge at least looks, I like the edge better.
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:16.760]   The reason I like the Galaxy Note's better is that it feels more like Samsung being Samsung to me.
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:17.760]   And I find that way more interesting.
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:26.760]   It's, well, I mean, when you compare it to the Note with the plastic, you know, back and all of that, it's really quite elegant.
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:27.760]   I don't know.
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:30.760]   I mean, I'm excited about trying it out.
[00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:32.760]   I'll have a review for it on Friday before you buy.
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:35.760]   But so far, hey, the fingerprint reader works.
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:41.760]   And as long as we're talking other new things, here's the new MacBook Pro 13-inch with the,
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:43.760]   the Force Touch trackpad.
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:46.760]   That's really the only thing that's different from existing MacBook Pros.
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:47.760]   And Broadwell.
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:48.760]   Yeah, Broadwell processor.
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:51.760]   New chipset, faster SSDs, they say.
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:52.760]   It does feel snappy.
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:53.760]   I got the i7.
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:54.760]   I don't know why.
[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:56.760]   I get all the memory and a big drive.
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:58.760]   I just thought I'm going to max it out.
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:00.760]   But if you're going to roll, roll deeply.
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:04.760]   After having talked to Andy, you tried these out of the Apple Store.
[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:06.760]   I did a little experiment.
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:08.760]   I turned it off.
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:16.360]   And I had everybody in the studio click the trackpad and verify for themselves that it
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:17.360]   doesn't move.
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:20.760]   I mean, it's just a solid, it's like the wrist rest.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:21.760]   It's just solid.
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:26.760]   And then I turned it on and you start clicking and for you will swear your mind will swear.
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:27.760]   No, yeah, it's moving.
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:28.760]   There's a click.
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:29.760]   Like physics is a lie.
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:36.760]   No, I'm only less excited about Force Touch as I am about the Apple Watch in terms of what
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:38.760]   this says about future Apple products.
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:43.360]   Because once they start putting, once they start really expressing the rules for here's
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:45.120]   what this does with an interface.
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:49.360]   And once they start putting into things like the iPad and the iPhone, they don't even
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:53.240]   have to do something with Space Age like having a virtual keyboard where you can feel
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:54.800]   the keys underneath your fingers.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:59.720]   If they just simply give me the ability to rest my finger on a user interface element
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:04.680]   and get information about it and basically how I interact with it physically changes
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:06.160]   what it does for me.
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:11.280]   My goodness, that's a totally unimaginable way of interacting with a computer and it
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:15.280]   just gets me so excited about what could be done with this and how Apple could put it
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.040]   intelligently put it into something.
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:20.640]   This is a classic Apple though, where there's nothing new here.
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:23.560]   We've had haptic feedback for years.
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:27.560]   In fact, every time I use it, I was very, it's like, oh, that's a gimmick.
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:29.920]   But they just made it better and work.
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:30.920]   And now it's like-
[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:32.680]   It's a very different technology than the Apple's.
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:34.320]   This is not traditional haptics.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.320]   Yeah.
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:38.480]   I keep forgetting your name, but it's based on a 20-year-old paper on something called
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:40.080]   sandpaper.
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:41.280]   And some people try to do it with sonic.
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:42.840]   Some people do it with horizontal forces.
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:46.520]   But the one I believe Apple is using, they figured out that your fingers really can't
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:49.840]   tell the difference between horizontal and vertical forces.
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:53.800]   So they can hit things together horizontally and you'll perceive them to be a vertical
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:59.120]   push or press or they can do all sorts of things, dimples, all sorts of simulations of
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:02.480]   vertical, I forget what they call them, but vertical effects.
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:06.360]   And it took a long time, and I think I mentioned this before, Brett Victor, who worked on it
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:09.480]   for while at Apple, was tweeting during the event that he can't believe Apple got it to
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:11.080]   market so quickly.
[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:12.960]   And this is the first generation.
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:15.680]   They basically made multi-touch three-dimensional.
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:19.920]   And it's going to be super exciting because on the watch, they managed to get it on the Mac
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:22.160]   within six months of throwing it off on the watch.
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:25.840]   It's rumored to be in the next iPhone, perhaps the iPad Pro as well.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:31.120]   It's going to add literally another dimension to all the interfaces we've been using.
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:34.400]   This is Margaret Diane Resvan.
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:40.720]   She was at the MIT Media Arts and Sciences program co-authored with, I presume this is
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:43.680]   Marvin Minsky, came out in 1995.
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:49.880]   So it's computational haptics, the sand-paste per system for synthesizing texture for a force
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:51.120]   feedback display.
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:52.560]   Oh, I see.
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:55.080]   Her name is Margaret Diane Resvan Minsky.
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:57.080]   Okay.
[00:59:57.080 --> 01:00:01.720]   So Margaret Minsky and Nick Negropani's signature is certified.
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:03.720]   Nick Negropani.
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:04.720]   All right.
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:05.720]   That's her last name.
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:06.720]   I get it.
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:07.720]   Okay.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:08.720]   I said...
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:09.960]   That's like we used to see multi-touch demos at MIT that looked like minority report then
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:10.960]   eventually we got the iPhone.
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:13.200]   And these technologies take a while to...
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.640]   Well, and by the way, let me show you one interesting thing here.
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:17.680]   I'll quit out of that.
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:21.080]   So I've turned on tap-click.
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:27.040]   Maybe I shouldn't with haptics or haptics because that may be a little bit confusing.
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.240]   So I could just tap it.
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.560]   I can click something.
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:34.240]   If I press it a little harder, it's the click.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:39.480]   If I press it really hard, it does a preview, which is kind of interesting.
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:43.320]   I don't know if I am convinced of that...
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:48.680]   I mean, it's easy enough to press a space bar, which is the way I'm used to doing a preview.
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.600]   And space bars toggle, which is nice.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.600]   Yeah.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.200]   But it's like what I was saying before.
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.960]   It's the sort of thing where if you don't know it exists, it doesn't complicate this
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:56.960]   for you at all.
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:01.080]   But once you find out that it exists, if it's a natural gesture, then it becomes second
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:06.520]   nature, it's really going to be just a question of, can Apple implement this so successfully
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:12.360]   and evangelize it to developers so well that it will be just as natural as tapping the
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:17.680]   space bar or just as natural as holding down the shift key while you're clicking on something?
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:24.320]   I feel like this is not quite fully cooked, but maybe that's just me.
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.000]   It's well implemented.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.040]   It's just not as broad as it needs to be to be revolutionary.
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:33.560]   But I'm really excited about what could be done with this, so I'm very excited.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:35.560]   Yeah.
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.840]   I mean, clearly, and obviously it's not new.
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:44.560]   This Misminsky created the concept 20 years ago, and we've seen haptics often since then.
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:49.400]   But this is the first time I've used it where it has a clear value, and it is kind of magic
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.520]   that there's a...
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.960]   It feels like it's moving.
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:56.480]   There's a physical click on something that is absolutely static.
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.480]   Amazing.
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:01.880]   I think I might turn off the deep click because I don't...
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:03.440]   I accidentally do it.
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.640]   I'm not really sure when it's going to happen.
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:09.120]   Maybe I just haven't gotten used to how hard you have to press and all that.
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.120]   And it's new, Leo.
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:12.640]   I mean, this is again the first iteration of this technology.
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:15.760]   And I don't know if you've tried iMovie yet, but there was an editor talking about it,
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:18.920]   and iMovie, it'll give you a little bit of forced feedback when you get to the end of
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:22.920]   a clip to tell you that there's a drag coefficient now at the end of it.
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.280]   And the editor who was talking about it said, "I didn't even know about it.
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.600]   I just suddenly moved my finger told me it was at the end, and I realized it was at
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:31.760]   the end before I realized why I realized it."
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:32.760]   Okay.
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:33.760]   That's...
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:34.760]   So that's...
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:37.080]   Yeah, maybe it's going to be an application that will be the most useful.
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.160]   You know, I've only used it in finder so far.
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:40.160]   Okay.
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.480]   For a while, hopefully it'll just become intuitive.
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:43.480]   Right.
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:46.920]   Well, it isn't because we're not used to this idea of pushing a little bit, a little bit
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:47.920]   more, a little bit more.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.320]   It's like a little weird.
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:54.320]   Okay.
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.320]   That was horrible.
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.320]   That was a physical click.
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:57.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.320]   The second one was piezoelectric, which was a little bit different, but it still wasn't
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:00.320]   the same as terrible.
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:01.320]   Terrible.
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.320]   Terrible.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.320]   So there you go.
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:06.720]   A couple of new products in this brick house today.
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:09.320]   And so far, I love the MacBook Pro.
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.400]   I mean, it's fast.
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:13.640]   The screen is really beautiful.
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.680]   It's not a higher red screen than before, is it?
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:16.680]   No.
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:18.320]   I have last year's model, and I missed that track.
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:20.640]   It's just gorgeous.
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:24.200]   It's still the Mac, to me, it's still the MacBook Pro with the word pro and quotation
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.400]   marks, because it's an excellent mid-range computer.
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.400]   Right.
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:29.400]   It's really not a top of the line.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.400]   Anything.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:31.400]   It's a semi-pro.
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:32.400]   It's a semi-pro.
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.400]   It's, yeah.
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:37.720]   It's like, you know, when you go into the BMW showroom and you go into the luxury edge
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:41.560]   of the showroom and they've got like the one that's not really as good as the rest just
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:46.280]   to get you to spend the extra $10,000 on the really good ones, that's what the MacBook
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.280]   Pro is for me.
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.280]   I don't know if I--
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:49.600]   It's a Diet Coke of Pro.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.160]   The Diet-- yeah, exactly.
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.160]   It's--
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:54.400]   Sir, it gives a toaster of an argument.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:59.160]   I like it because I normally use a 15-inch here.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.880]   And I just like the portability of a 13.
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.680]   This is not going to end up being the studio computer.
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:04.880]   I think I'll just take this for my travels.
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:09.400]   This will be my photography computer, hence the picture.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.320]   So you'll have the MacBook for ultra light.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:12.560]   You'll have this one in between.
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:15.480]   You'll have the MacBook Pro and then the iMac.
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:18.760]   And then you're going to have that entire diagram Apple put up on their display.
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:24.840]   I'm actually not buying the MacBook because I decided instead to buy this, I decided that
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:27.800]   MacBook wasn't going to be fast enough for what I want to do.
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:30.480]   But Lisa's buying it, so I get to try hers.
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.400]   What color is she going to buy it in?
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.480]   I'm trying to convince her to buy gold, she won't.
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:35.480]   Yeah.
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.480]   It's the acceptable color.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.480]   Gold is so pretty.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.480]   I hear that, Lisa.
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:39.480]   I don't get gold.
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:40.480]   Gold is pretty.
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:42.400]   Are you going to get gold?
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:45.400]   It's a very subtle gold.
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:46.400]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.720]   I think she's thinking it's like gold gold.
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:54.040]   Yeah, it's more like if you go into the art museum and you see a relic from a thousand
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:56.440]   years ago, it's not designed.
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:59.920]   It was just a choice of metal as opposed to, hey, everybody, look at this gold thing that
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:00.920]   I own.
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:08.080]   As I said with a very first gold iPhone, it's more like Catherine Hepburn gold as opposed
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.640]   to King Kardashian gold.
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.520]   I think she's thinking it's Kardashian.
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:12.520]   We've compared it.
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.000]   You have a gold iPhone around there.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.960]   You're talking about you, Lisa.
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:20.240]   It's just enough gold so that people, everyone knows that you have the new MacBook.
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.880]   It's the same gold as the phone.
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:22.880]   You have the gold phone, right?
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:23.880]   Yeah.
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:24.880]   No, you don't have the gold phone?
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:25.880]   No, I do.
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:26.880]   It's just the gold.
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:27.880]   No, I'm talking to Lisa.
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:28.880]   I'm sorry.
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:29.880]   I see that you can have it.
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:30.880]   You have it, Renee.
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.360]   She says she's getting the gunmetal gray.
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.120]   Oh, that's also very cool.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.840]   She's kind of like shooting.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:36.840]   That's cool too.
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:37.840]   Yeah.
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:42.200]   I did want to say something though about the new MacBook.
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:48.640]   I only really get my most deepest opinions and understanding about something by trying
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:51.080]   things out and sometimes failing miserably.
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.480]   This week I decided, you know what?
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:54.360]   I don't want to be bothered by TSA.
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:57.240]   I don't want to be bothered with a 13-inch notebook.
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:00.960]   I can, whatever I've got to do this week, I can do it with my full-sized iPad and my
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:04.040]   iPad mini, and that's all I'm going to take with me.
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:09.080]   And of course, so many things today particularly would have been a lot easier if I just had
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:14.480]   the ability to run Mac OS or if I had that sort of resource available to me.
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:20.600]   And so it really did, not that I was ever skeptical about the 12-inch MacBook, but if
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:26.000]   I had had a 12-inch MacBook in my library, there's no question that I would have thought,
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.200]   well, maybe I should just leave a MacBook at home.
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:32.320]   A 13-inch Air might have made that decision for me.
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:36.640]   Oh, no, I don't really want to be bothered by that, but that would have been an iPad-sized
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:42.560]   Mac seems to be something that would get me very interested in spending $1300 worth of
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:45.320]   my money to have my fourth working Mac in the office.
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:46.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:49.680]   Well, actually, you maybe want to wait for the new 8K iMac.
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.000]   This is not true, is it?
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.960]   So this is why I don't like modern media.
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.520]   I have a big problem with mainstream media right now.
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:07:03.480]   So on LG's website, it said that Apple had announced an 8K iMac and a bunch of websites
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:06.280]   wrote a story saying LG leaks an 8K iMac.
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:07.280]   Right.
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.280]   LG did not say Apple is making one.
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:10.160]   LG said Apple had announced one.
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:15.560]   Apple has not announced an 8K iMac, so the headline should be LG erroneously reports
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:17.880]   that Apple has announced an 8K iMac.
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:18.880]   That's it.
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.560]   There's no other story here.
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:24.640]   The 5K already pushes existing hardware to its limits.
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.040]   Yeah, there's no connection.
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:29.160]   Apple had to make their own timing controller to get the 5K.
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:33.560]   The next generation Skylake processors, which aren't out yet, are required to drive 5K.
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:38.400]   LG's existing panels are nowhere small enough for an iMac at 8K.
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:42.880]   It is so wrong, but it also shows what is just not good reporting.
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:47.760]   Any story of Apple has legs?
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.440]   Well, yeah, of course.
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:55.680]   Everybody knows whether, you know, me being a suspicious type figure, the guys, especially
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:59.640]   at Apple Insider who are writing this, know better, but it's such clickbait.
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.680]   It just generates so much traffic.
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:03.240]   I think people would click anyway.
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:08.440]   If you just write LG says Apple announced, I think it would click on it the same.
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:16.720]   By the way, just so you know, the name for this will be quad ultra high definition.
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:20.200]   So it's 16 times bigger.
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:24.640]   I was at see that this is why there's subtle things you have to learn how to do when you're
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:25.840]   writing stories.
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:32.880]   I was introduced to somebody last night who a woman who was introduced to me as a needle,
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:39.600]   a neurosurgeon who works on Beatles, B-E-E-E-T-L-E-S, an insect neurosurgeon.
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:50.000]   And you realize that you meet enough odd things in this world that you don't understand,
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.360]   that you know that, gosh, I'm not going to go immediately, right?
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:57.960]   I met a sort of who performs micro neurosurgery on Beatles.
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:02.600]   And I realized that, no, this is the point in which I start asking very simple and straightforward
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:07.040]   questions to make sure I understand exactly what is being said by Beatles neurosurgeon.
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:10.920]   And it turned out to be something completely different from what those two words might
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:11.920]   actually mean.
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:15.440]   Do Beatles even have brains?
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.080]   They do.
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:20.400]   And according to this person, they do sometimes get tumors.
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:25.000]   And it turned out, it turned out, it turned out, time is the conversation that someone
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:32.560]   was having played a practical joke on her by introducing her to me with a fake job.
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:37.400]   And she kept up the improv for about 10 minutes before with me.
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:42.120]   Again, not my saying, oh my God, that's so much to say, oh, so my first question was,
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:45.400]   is this therapeutic or a research sort of surgery?
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:47.760]   Well, when you have the Beatles.
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:53.040]   So like if someone tells me that we're developing an 8K screen, my first, I will not say yours.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.440]   I'm not going to believe you.
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.280]   I'm going to say, that's interesting.
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:02.040]   What market exists for an 8K screen and who is being built for?
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:05.480]   And then eventually they run out of ways to tell you that, okay, I just made all that
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:06.480]   up.
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.480]   I'm very, very sorry.
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:11.400]   Was she at least an entomologist?
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:16.120]   She was, no, she was, she, she, I'm trying to remember who's in barista.
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:17.120]   She works.
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:20.120]   She works in social sciences and social sciences.
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.960]   So she can at least tell a good story.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:27.160]   She can at least tell us who was a very good sport and the fact that like, if I were introduced
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:32.400]   to somebody as, well, here's, he is, he is a mean ecotheologist.
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:36.520]   And for me to simply roll with that saying, yeah, well, the thing is not many people build
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:38.600]   furniture for underwater installations.
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:43.760]   And this is going to be a more important thing as we try to populate some of these places near
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:44.760]   the Marana's trench.
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:49.040]   There's one, I just kind of veneered to stick at 10,000 feet.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.200]   These are the problems I'm trying to solve.
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:53.720]   I should just clarify because some people are asking the chat.
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:57.880]   If LG is a major supplier for Apple, so if they have an 8K panel, it is, it is not beyond
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:58.880]   the realm possibility.
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:01.440]   In fact, it's likely that Apple has those panels and is thinking, what can we do with
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:02.440]   these?
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.200]   But that's not the same as Apple announcing it.
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:08.280]   And it reminds me of the Apple TV news this week where it was said that the Apple TV,
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:13.960]   the new version won't support or K. And that's a tricky thing to report because as far as
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:17.400]   I know, and I might be wrong because it's not the most updated information, the hardware
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:18.840]   is perfectly capable of 4K.
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:23.440]   There's just very few 4K television sets and almost no 4K content on the market.
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:26.200]   So there's not going to be any 4K content for it at launch.
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:31.000]   But where there's six months, a year, two years, three years down the road, they can
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000]   flip a switch on that.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.120]   That's sort of a nuanced difference, but I think it's an important one.
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:37.480]   Yeah, can the hardware do it?
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:41.320]   It's the question, not what they're going to support out of the branch.
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:45.320]   Are you talking about, I've seen two different stories.
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:49.800]   One of which talking about the 4K Apple TV and one person actually, one that was talking
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:52.200]   about an actual 4K Apple television set.
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:54.280]   You're talking about the Apple TV and Apple TV.
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:55.280]   The Apple TV, yeah.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.280]   The Apple TV box.
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:57.280]   Yeah.
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:01.640]   That second one kind of leaped out at me because this is another case of, so you're
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:06.560]   saying that you have a disappointing news about a product that Apple has not even hinted
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:10.040]   at ever releasing.
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:11.040]   And this is news how?
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:19.800]   I guess it just points out the importance of listening to Mac break weekly each and every
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:20.800]   week.
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.000]   Well, it sets expectations.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.840]   My only thing is that it sets expectations and it comes out and they'll say, well, Apple
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:29.040]   promised us this and you go back and say, Apple never said anything about that.
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.040]   Like, where's my AKI Mac?
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:32.040]   Where's the AKI Mac?
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:33.040]   Right.
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:34.040]   Right.
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:37.240]   Our show today brought to you by the folks at ITProTV.
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:43.520]   Here's a place that sets expectations they can keep, a great place to learn or polish
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:46.880]   your IT skills to keep up to date.
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:52.520]   ITProTV offers amazing courses in every field.
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:56.400]   You know, the originally started by Tim and Don who were IT trainers.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.560]   They help people get their certs.
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:59.560]   They said, there must be a better way.
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:01.960]   They saw the broadcast minds panel.
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:06.000]   I did a few years ago at NAB and they said, that's what we're going to do.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.320]   We're going to do what Leo does at Twitter.
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:12.520]   We're going to do it for IT and they have live streaming.
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:14.800]   They do about 30 hours, new hours every week.
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:16.920]   They have a chat room.
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.880]   They've got two, oh, I'm sorry.
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:20.120]   I have to update that.
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:22.280]   Oh, now they're doing it better than Leo.
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:25.600]   Two studios, 50 hours a week.
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:26.800]   Oh, crap.
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:32.160]   Oh, well, stream on demand to your Roku, to your Chromecast, your computer, your mobile
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:33.400]   device.
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:39.600]   They have certifications for Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, A plus, CCNA, security plus, MCSA,
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:41.960]   CISSP, network security.
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.960]   They just released their ethical hacker courses.
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:47.440]   I hope you watch those with Sean Phillip Oriano.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:50.840]   He did it live, which was so cool over a two week period.
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:53.080]   And now you can watch them on demand.
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:56.960]   He is the expert in security consults with enterprise and military, wrote the book on
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.040]   CEH.
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:03.960]   I want my CEH, my certified ethical hacker, cert.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:06.200]   You get the measure up practice exams with your subscription.
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:07.200]   That's worth $79.
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:11.640]   You also have this amazing virtual machine sandbox lab, which means you don't have to
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:14.840]   have a Windows machine to set up a Windows server to configure machines.
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:18.400]   You do it all with any HTML5 browser.
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:21.560]   This is so cool.
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:25.720]   And since we talked with the Mark Goodman on triangulation, ITProTV has just announced
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:26.720]   Sean's going to be back.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:30.000]   Sean Phillips Oriano is going to come back for three weeks.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   Remember Mark Goodman wrote that incredible book on future crimes.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.960]   He's going to teach a course on hacking.
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:40.160]   This would be such a great job.
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.720]   Hacking forensics investigator.
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:45.840]   And he's going to do crypto courses.
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.440]   I got to tell Steve Gibson about this.
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:49.000]   Let's fill the need for one.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.440]   Mark Goodman said we need one million cybersecurity professionals in the next year or so.
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:55.440]   We do it.
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:57.760]   This is going to be a great career.
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:02.480]   ITProTVs, their live stream is available for free with a basic account.
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:04.600]   So you can watch the entire course.
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:07.760]   If you watch the CES CEH course, you know how that work.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:12.160]   You could do the same thing with the hacking, for instance, investigator and cryptography.
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:16.720]   Live 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern starting April 27.
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:17.720]   Put that in your calendar.
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:20.000]   You do not have that's free.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.880]   However, I would love for you to subscribe to ITProTV.
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:29.040]   And I think you would to subscriptions normally $57 a month or $570 for a year.
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:34.560]   By the way, if you get the year, then you can download all the stuff and watch offline.
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:37.240]   They also have client and group pricing available.
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:40.800]   Some of their clients, I mean corporate group pricing, some of their clients include Harvard
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:44.680]   and MIT, Stanford, UCSD.
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:47.120]   This is good stuff.
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:53.680]   You'll get a free seven day trial and you can get 30% off for the lifetime of your account.
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:56.480]   That makes it less than $40 a month.
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:06.840]   If you use the offer code MACBreak30, MACBreak30@itpro.tv/MacBreak.
[01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:11.760]   Oh man, I'm thinking of a new career in forensics.
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:12.760]   I really want to do that.
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:13.760]   Well, I'm going to take the course.
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:14.760]   Yes, I had a luma.
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:16.520]   I know it's so cool.
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:20.480]   And you know, if you're in law enforcement, this would be such a great skill.
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:22.960]   Mark Goodman himself is such a funny story.
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:25.800]   He told this story in on triangulation a couple of weeks ago.
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:28.400]   He was an LAPD, just a beat cop.
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:34.120]   And his sergeant said, "Hey Goodman, how do you start spell check on WordPerfect?"
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:35.520]   He said, "Shift F2?"
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:36.520]   He said, "You're hired."
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:40.280]   And then all of a sudden he's the forensics guy for the LAPD because he knew how to spell
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:42.400]   check on WordPerfect.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.840]   All the writers on CSI cyber need to take this program.
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:45.840]   I think so.
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:48.240]   Yeah, let's get some real good information in there.
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:55.080]   It's free if you watch it live 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern time starting April 27th.
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:56.080]   Really cool.
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:57.080]   We love these guys.
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:58.080]   Tim and Don are so great.
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:59.080]   Aren't they coming out?
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:00.080]   They're coming out I think soon.
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:02.480]   If not, we'll get them out.
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:05.320]   Itpro.tv/macbreak.
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:15.640]   Angela Arrence, the new head of retail at Apple, told employees, quote, "A significant
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:21.120]   change in mindset is coming to the way Apple launches products."
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:26.480]   Now remember that there was a big move to get people to come into the Apple store to buy
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:28.400]   their phones.
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:33.600]   According to this article, and we're going to get you a chance to vet this year for Business
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:39.040]   Insider, Jim Edwards writing, "She wants to encourage customers to avoid their local
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:44.600]   Apple store when the watch goes on sale and order online."
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:45.600]   Is that true?
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:47.040]   Imagine doing that for a while.
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:51.400]   If you look at the most recent iPhone launches, for a while it seemed prior to Angela Arrence
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:54.000]   that they would try to encourage you to go to the store.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.920]   Tim, look, said that.
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:00.600]   He said it in a quarterly analyst call, "We want to get people in the store."
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:04.320]   They want to get the sort of buy iPhones, but for the launch itself, it started to look
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:07.400]   more and more over the years that it was becoming like Andy said earlier problematic
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:08.400]   for them.
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:09.400]   Yeah.
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:12.240]   And more recently, they've been making pre-orders available and they've been guaranteeing shipment
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:17.320]   as best as they can day in date, and that's been taking a lot of pressure off of retail.
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:18.840]   Those launches are hard for retail.
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:19.840]   Oh, I know.
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:20.840]   But it's also fun for retail.
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:24.680]   I mean, don't downplay the value of having a line outside the store.
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:26.000]   The employees get all excited.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.440]   They count down when the door is opening.
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.760]   They clap when people buy the first one.
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:33.160]   I mean, there's for a retail employee, it probably has to be a highlight.
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:35.920]   But they'll still get to do that.
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:39.480]   It's probably a highlight for the first few times that they do it about year five.
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:42.160]   It's probably getting to be tiresome.
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:46.920]   And then people are really aggressive when I remember once Renee and I lined up for the
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:52.720]   entire night and we got there, we are racing down to try to get to be first in line.
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:58.120]   There was three fights that broke out on who was the first person to get the iPhone.
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:01.520]   And so I think that they can also get a lot of negative press and they're hoping to make
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:03.080]   this as smooth as possible.
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:04.080]   Yeah.
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:06.480]   Yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:11.680]   You hear about the quotes about the disaster of New Coke when the team that held up that
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:16.000]   project later on was saying, was this just like a brilliant scheme to get people to buy
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.200]   more of the regular classic Coke?
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.840]   And he said, I'm not that dumb and I'm not that stupid.
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:21.840]   I'm not that smart.
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:22.840]   I'm not that dumb.
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:27.760]   And the more that you see, look at the arguments, oh, I bet that they're sort of constraining
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:31.280]   supply to make sure there's high demand for this.
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:36.320]   I might have had more belief in that argument a few years ago, but now it's starting to
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:40.880]   make Apple look like they can't anticipate demand and they can't manufacture.
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.920]   If they can't anticipate this sort of stuff.
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:48.200]   So the better they can do it managing people's expectations of how likely is it going to
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:52.400]   be that I'm going to be able to walk away with a new phone, a new laptop, a new watch
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:55.760]   in the first few weeks, the better they're going to look as a company.
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:59.440]   It's something that doesn't make them look good because if they're telling people, if
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:03.040]   they're encouraging people to show up at the store and not have any assurance, there's
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:05.280]   going to be any stock of what they want.
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:08.880]   I'm sorry, enjoy your 16 gigabyte iPad Air 2.
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:12.040]   I know you didn't want that one, but that's all we have for the next two months.
[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:15.120]   The better they can do it managing at the more professional they look and the better
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:17.880]   the experience is going to be for every consumer.
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:19.000]   That's actually a really good point.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.720]   There's also the issue of scalping, as you mentioned.
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:26.480]   And people getting paid to wait in lines and it's not the spirit that it always wants
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:27.480]   to be.
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:28.480]   Yeah.
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:30.600]   Yeah, I waited in line for the iPhone 6.
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:31.600]   We've got there.
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:32.600]   What time did we get there, John?
[01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:33.600]   Midnight to it.
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:35.000]   You got there at 10 p.m.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.040]   I think I arrived at 2 or 3 a.m.
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:42.120]   And it wasn't the experience I'd had waiting for the first iPhone, which was really a joyous
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:43.400]   experience.
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:49.200]   There were too many people there who were there just to get it for somebody else or
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:54.320]   I hate to say it, but like bums who had been hired by somebody to wait in line for
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.400]   them.
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:56.800]   So maybe that's it.
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:00.680]   If apparently there's not going to be any in-store pickup at all in the UK for the Apple Watch,
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:02.880]   I don't know what's happening in Canada, do you know?
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:06.680]   I don't know for sure in Canada in the US, I believe there is.
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:07.680]   Yeah.
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:11.600]   Customers will be able in the US, according to this article, to pick up their watch and
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:14.760]   store, but you are encouraged to order online.
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:15.840]   I'm not ordering online.
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:17.480]   I thought, see, I'm misunderstood.
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:20.520]   I got the impression that Apple really wanted people to make these 15-minute appointments
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:22.840]   and have the experience of trying it on.
[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:26.680]   If you're unsure, so there's going to be people like us who just are happy to order.
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:28.440]   We know exactly what we want or close enough.
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:30.480]   And there's going to be people who are unconvinced.
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:31.640]   They really want to see the bands.
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:34.040]   They're not sure about, you know, and they're going to want to come in.
[01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:37.640]   So the Apple needs to cater to both those sort of ends of the spectrum.
[01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:42.480]   Yeah, also realize the kind of, if anybody has any exposure to a smartwatch, which is
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:48.080]   not likely, pretty much, they've seen things like the huge Android Wear watches that have
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:49.520]   been on the market to this point.
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:54.800]   They've seen things like the PEPP Apple watches that are cute and they're very wearable, but
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:57.280]   they're not terribly ambitious.
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:59.480]   I can't say this enough.
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:03.480]   Apple really has a big job ahead of them, just to teach people that we are building something
[01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:07.720]   brand new, please come in unafraid and with no expectations, and we will fill you in on
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:10.560]   something that we're terribly excited about.
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:14.480]   When you think, though, that they have like a 300 million user base of people that have
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:20.480]   like fives and sixes and then can use the watch, like even if they only capture 2% of
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:24.520]   their base core audience, and they're definitely going to get over that, they're already hitting
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:27.400]   over 5 million people that are going to be buying the watch.
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:32.480]   So I think that it's not going to be as hard of a sell because people that love Apple products
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:35.640]   really love Apple products, and I think that the watch is going to be easier to sell than
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:37.200]   they would expect.
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:39.240]   The business insider got a link.
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:40.240]   Go ahead.
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:45.240]   Just, I would like to think it's going to be at least a little bit of a hard sell because
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:46.400]   again it is so new.
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:50.680]   I would be very suspicious of somebody who said, "I know that the new iPad costs $500,
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:52.040]   but I don't care I'm going to spend it anyway.
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:53.240]   I have no idea how it works.
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:54.240]   I've seen a couple of videos.
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:58.640]   I've seen everybody cheering during the rollout, but that's the fact that it has an Apple logo
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.160]   on it is good enough for me.
[01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:03.360]   I don't think any company can live up to that kind of expectations.
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:06.160]   I'm not even complaining about hype.
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:08.520]   I'm not complaining about hero worship.
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:13.200]   I'm saying that this would be a bad position for Apple to be in to simply say that just
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:16.440]   the fact that we put a logo on something is all the reason you need to buy this.
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:21.080]   I really like the fact that they keep saying, "Look, we're making this case point by point
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:22.080]   by point.
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:23.080]   We're releasing videos.
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:24.480]   We're doing multiple events.
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:28.640]   We are restructuring our stores so that people can come in without any...
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:29.920]   We're not going to do a credit check.
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:33.840]   We're not going to have any sort of idea of whether or not you're capable of buying the
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.280]   steel or the sport band.
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:39.320]   We really understand that we need to explain to you and convince you that we've done something
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:40.320]   great here."
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:44.440]   The thing that was interesting to me is my mother and my sister, they never wanted first-generation
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:45.440]   iPhones.
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:46.760]   They didn't get iPhones until much later.
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:48.800]   They didn't get first-generation iPads.
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:49.800]   They had no interest in them.
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:52.200]   They thought I was nuts when I drive to Albany to get them.
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:55.040]   They both want first-generation Apple watches.
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:56.040]   They want to get them immediately.
[01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:57.280]   I have some friends too.
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:01.280]   The reason is because they have specific problems with their iPhones.
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:03.680]   My mom keeps her phone in her purse and she misses messages and calls.
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:06.360]   My sister's paging system at the hospital works off iPhones.
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:07.760]   She doesn't want to have to carry her phone.
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:11.200]   They all have these problems that they face day in and day out.
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:14.520]   They've seen enough in the Apple watch to know or at least to suspect that it'll solve
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:15.880]   that problem for them.
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:19.320]   That's made being an early adopter or getting the first-generation or just knowing that they
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:22.400]   want to order it a very easy choice for them.
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:23.400]   This is the...
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:27.080]   I guess I didn't realize this, but Business Insider actually got a picture of the memo.
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:29.880]   Not the actual memo.
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:35.320]   There's some credibility here because there's the Apple watch table.
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:41.440]   I have been told by some person I know who was actually seeing the table that it is a
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:45.480]   very high-tech table with lots of electronics inside.
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:46.480]   You got to try them.
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:49.480]   Shunnedi and I lingered so long at the event that one of the tables cleared out.
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:50.480]   They went on us.
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:55.040]   You get a badge and you get to press the badge on the side and the secret drawer opens up
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:57.120]   and all the watches are in little containers there.
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:58.120]   There it is.
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:24:59.120]   Yeah.
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:00.120]   Yeah.
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:05.240]   So in the text of the memo from Angela Arance, get in line online.
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:10.760]   The days of waiting in line and crossing fingers for a product are over for our customers,
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:11.760]   she writes.
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:16.240]   The Apple Store app and our online store make it much easier to purchase Apple Watch in
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:17.880]   the new MacBook.
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:21.640]   Note that, the new MacBook too.
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:24.440]   Customers will know exactly when and where their product arrives.
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:29.920]   This is a significant change in mind set and we need your help to make it happen.
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:35.200]   Tell your customers we have more availability online and show them how easy it is to order
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:36.760]   you'll make their day.
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:38.040]   So that is a very clear.
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:43.040]   I mean, I think this is a genuine memo and that's a very clear shift.
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:46.800]   I think Mark Herman also reported that even in stores where they won't necessarily have
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:51.080]   a lot of stock and you'll be taken with them very kindly over to kiosk, which is their
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:52.080]   version of the Apple Store.
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:55.880]   I don't know, you'll order it that way and it'll be delivered to you.
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:58.720]   Should I get the Apple app on my iPad or iPhone, right?
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:05.320]   Because I remember last year when the iPhone 6, the Apple Store online was all broken, but
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:06.800]   you could get through barely.
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:07.920]   You could get through on the app.
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:09.800]   So do it through the app, it sounds like.
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:10.800]   Try both.
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:11.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:12.800]   Try both.
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:13.800]   Have both going.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:14.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:15.800]   And they'll probably be a limit.
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:18.200]   I think the iPhones are usually two units per person or per account.
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:19.200]   Right.
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:21.080]   Don't think you can buy an army full of them immediately.
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:27.840]   No, I do feel like these watches will often be sold in pairs because like Lisa and I are
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:31.000]   going to buy both buy them so we can do the heartbeats.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.080]   You can send your heartbeats.
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:33.080]   Right.
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.200]   You can send the cute little pictures to each other.
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:36.200]   Yeah.
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:38.320]   I think I'm going to drain my watch in the first hour.
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:39.320]   Yeah.
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:40.520]   Sending them to everyone.
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:41.920]   Don't send me your message.
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:46.920]   So do you have a special someone that you're going to have to get a watch so you can do
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:47.920]   this?
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:48.920]   I am.
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:50.880]   My husband and I are both going to be getting watches.
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:52.200]   It's going to be for his birthday.
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:53.480]   He's very excited.
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:54.480]   Yeah.
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:57.920]   And now what he normally is he a Mac geek?
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:00.360]   He is quite and he's been using.
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:01.520]   He has a pebble.
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:02.520]   Ah.
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:07.640]   And so he he's not a watch person per se but he loves the pebble because he can get any
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:09.640]   notification without having to worry.
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:10.640]   Yeah.
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.640]   And that'll be the same reason why I'm going to be getting the watches.
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:14.760]   I have the iPhone 6 Plus.
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:15.760]   It's huge.
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:17.680]   Trying to get out of my purse is a mess.
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:18.680]   Yeah.
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:19.680]   And so it's going to make it easy.
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:26.360]   I can if I'm in session and someone has an emergency I can get the message right away.
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:27.360]   You're a psychotherapist.
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:30.560]   A lot of therapists don't wear watches because they don't want to be looking at the watch
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:31.560]   during the session.
[01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:32.560]   It always annoys me.
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:34.400]   They put the clock behind my head.
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:35.400]   Right.
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:36.720]   So it looks like they're looking at me.
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:39.000]   Meanwhile they're thinking almost done almost done.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000]   Right.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.000]   You've talked.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.000]   I've seen the clocks in the room actually one that's behind the person and one that's
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.000]   in front of them so that they can also monitor their own time.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:51.040]   That drives me crazy because I can't tell what time it is because they put the clock
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:52.040]   behind me.
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:57.440]   I need to know if I've got enough time to tell this one faster than a normal clock.
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:01.560]   It is because in hours 50 minutes it's I don't understand it.
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:02.560]   I'm just kidding.
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:06.600]   Actually my ex-wife is a psychotherapist and when I told her that my therapist has clock
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:09.080]   behind me and I couldn't see it she said that's not good.
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:11.040]   She should have to just like you do Georgia.
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:12.040]   Exactly.
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:14.360]   So that everyone feels comfortable and no one feels stressed.
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:15.800]   But would you but how would you do the watch?
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:18.160]   I mean that's going to send a message.
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:20.560]   I'm not going to have any notifications only.
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:22.080]   I'll have everything off.
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:24.320]   I will just have to.
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:29.480]   But if I have a client that is on you know that is in dire straits and I need to get
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:33.840]   a message from them from the hospital immediately then instead of having them buzz my phone
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:38.480]   in the room which is very distracting in session but only in cases of emergency they can do
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:42.920]   that instead they can send me a message of you know emergency call right now and then
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:47.320]   I will have to relieve myself from session or you know call back in between sessions
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:48.480]   just so that I get the message.
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:53.040]   You'll have to teach your husband some secret taps because the taps the clients don't know
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:54.040]   about the tapping.
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:57.440]   I know I don't think I'm going to be able to do that though because it'll be so distracting
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:02.400]   to me that you'll giggle in the middle of the session inappropriate giggling.
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:05.880]   I'll be tapping out where's my sandwich.
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:10.600]   Right right exactly so I'll have to have everything off while I'm in session unless
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:12.640]   it's emergency.
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:18.240]   It does struck me that's sort of an interesting modification to like the way that we socialize
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:24.960]   with each other because you could make the argument that if you've got your phone let's
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:32.280]   say on a table that's near one of the chairs near the desk and it buzzes quietly and there
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:37.040]   seems to be part of the okay there is something that is apparently important enough that someone
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:39.400]   is calling my doctor during this session.
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:43.560]   You excuse yourself and then for five seconds either dismiss the call or say oh actually
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:46.640]   this is a medical emergency I'm afraid I have to excuse myself.
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:52.680]   Would that be better than simply I've something has been communicated to you in this room without
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:53.680]   my knowledge.
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:30:00.080]   Now you're just saying oh gee I'm sorry I forgot my pen I'll be right back.
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:05.840]   It's everybody's entirely to the form of communication that works best for them but it's going to
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:10.040]   be interesting that now every time so it's oops I'm sorry look at this I've just spilled
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:11.960]   this water all over my shirt.
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:13.800]   Let me go for a moment here.
[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:14.800]   Change that.
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:15.800]   Yeah no.
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:19.480]   For me as I had lunch with someone who had an Apple watch for a long time and I had my
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:22.960]   phone in my pocket and my notifications are almost always off.
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:26.600]   There's only one thing that can buzz it and only certain people that come through for
[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:29.960]   that and it's people who usually have critical information for me.
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:33.360]   So when it when it does buzz I almost always have to check it.
[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:36.160]   So there are a couple of times when having lunch right to excuse myself and you know
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:40.000]   sit up a little bit so I could pull my monstrous iPhone 6 plus out of my pocket and then look
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:43.160]   at the notification and I have previews off because you never know you don't want to have
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:46.800]   any sense of information display so I have to swipe through to get them and it's this
[01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:50.360]   it didn't seem like it was an arduous ordeal but a couple of times I just saw him twist
[01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:53.360]   his wrist slightly glance at his wash and then go back to talking to me and suddenly
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:57.600]   I felt like like an animal like a caveman like someone from a different time and I just
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:01.520]   it was such a much more elegant experience for him to do what I was trying so poorly to
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:05.600]   do that I was sold on a whole notification triage system immediately.
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:10.480]   Incidentally look at this table you if you walk into the store that you will not be able
[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:15.120]   to touch the watch they are under glass in this table.
[01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:19.480]   You can only touch the watch if you have it a 15 minute appointment slot.
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:21.880]   So can we schedule those now?
[01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:24.760]   No Friday morning.
[01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:26.600]   They should allow us to do it sooner.
[01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:27.600]   They'd be gone instantaneously.
[01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:28.600]   I know.
[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:31.600]   I just had a really.
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:34.600]   I just had a belief that you'll be able to get an appointment on the first day.
[01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:39.600]   I just had a way from you right when it opened.
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:45.080]   Oh man the products will not be on little stands or attached to security changes the
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:52.760]   iPhones are because in part the back of this watch has sensors and so they can't sit on
[01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:57.320]   the display so they have to have some sort of plastic thing holding them and they can't
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:00.480]   be locked down and blah blah blah.
[01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:05.920]   Wow so you when you tap the card does the glass slide back.
[01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:07.400]   We don't know.
[01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:08.400]   No no.
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:14.080]   It doesn't emerge like gold finger from the watch is in the drawer underneath.
[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:16.920]   Oh it is a it is a concealed drawer so it is still hella cool.
[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:17.920]   That's cool.
[01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:20.600]   Wow I can't wait I want to go in.
[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:23.840]   Tim Cook has wanted one since he's five years old Leo and unlike us he has a resource system
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:29.720]   making anything Tim Cook wants he gets including if he wanted to make a Mac I guess he could
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:30.720]   do that.
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:34.960]   Yeah I don't know see Jeff Bezos had the same thing but we he decided to be a billionaire
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:40.240]   he said you know what I'm gonna build spaceships if Tim Cook just wanted a wristwatch I don't
[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:43.640]   know if this is the most ambitious guy in the world.
[01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:45.560]   Let's see.
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:51.280]   HBO now ships today I don't know if that's maybe that's one of your picks I won't nobody
[01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:58.000]   has that so something to be aware of this is the one that's 15 what is it $15 a month
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.800]   for non cable company subscribers.
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:06.200]   Who has only and that and that and that and that and last last week was also sling dot sling
[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:11.880]   TV also announced that it is also offering that same service for $15 a month if you already
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:16.120]   subscribe to their $20 a month package so it looks like the and they also said it's
[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:21.040]   also going to be available in time for the premiere of the game of thrones.
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:25.480]   Yeah somebody was saying that the sling TV had all sorts of issues during March madness
[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:26.480]   especially the finals.
[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:28.280]   Yeah there was a lot of buffering.
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:29.280]   Leaving it hard.
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:38.880]   Yeah HBO as we as we mentioned before is using MLB's very robust network major league baseball
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:41.800]   is very robust network which is probably why it's not available in Canada because you
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:43.400]   guys don't have a ball do you.
[01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:44.400]   We just play hockey right.
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:46.400]   We have the Toronto Blue Jays.
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:47.400]   I'm teasing you.
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:51.200]   No but it's amazing how companies that it is so hard the companies that figure it out
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:52.560]   can become infrastructure companies.
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:53.560]   Right.
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:55.040]   Amazon became an infrastructure company.
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:56.040]   Right.
[01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:57.040]   Right.
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:04.200]   Let's see I'm just looking at the last few HBO's CEO reached out to Jimmy Iovine.
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:09.640]   That's how apparently the deal between Apple and HBO now happened but I didn't mention
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:17.760]   HBO now for the first three months is only Apple TV iOS you know iPad and iPhone but
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:21.480]   apparently HBO approached Apple about doing this.
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:24.400]   Jimmy's response was that's the expletive.
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:31.440]   I think that's the you know if when we say it that way I don't think people are going
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:32.800]   to think of what the expletive is.
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:35.400]   I think that's the S word.
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:41.000]   I feel like a four year old when I say that.
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.840]   Okay.
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:50.640]   What else Samsung is going has got the contract for the A9 the next Apple microprocessor at
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:54.000]   least according to Bloomberg and Bloomberg got to know.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.800]   That's been yeah they've been reporting that every two or three months for the last year
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:59.000]   and for two years.
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.680]   Oh you really are bitter aren't you.
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:04.000]   I just I want them to work a little bit.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.520]   Yeah I agree.
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:08.000]   But I'm not working so I can't really complain.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.360]   I'm just reading their article.
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:18.720]   Okay so you know I think the only reason that's interesting is people thought maybe Samsung
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:23.560]   and Apple had had a rift because of the lawsuits and no Samsung still provides most of the.
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:26.920]   They are major panel manufacturer major NAND flash manufacturer.
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:27.920]   You can't avoid it.
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:31.520]   It's not like it's it's it's basically Korea in many ways.
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:32.920]   It's like it's Korea in the 80s.
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:34.520]   You can't avoid Korea.
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:38.360]   And apparently this S6 is bendable but I'm not going to bend it.
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:40.400]   Can we just stop the insanity.
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:41.400]   It's physics.
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:48.520]   I just said I was just I was just so something something something to the tech news cycle.
[01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:50.320]   Just get me so exhausted.
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:55.320]   I know it exhausted me when people were saying oh my god look what happens if you put if
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:59.520]   you put the iPhone 6 under an anvil and you press down on with both sides and now I'm
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:03.920]   I'm equally tired with hey look hey look now these Samsung six has this problem.
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:04.920]   Oh look Samsung.
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:09.360]   It's like okay fine take care of your toys this don't happen.
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:13.080]   It's funny only in that it should be a lesson to Samsung executives not to not to say their
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:15.920]   stuff is unbendable or to make fun of Apple just like make good phones.
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:18.120]   It's all we consumers want make good phones.
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:21.480]   They did say that right Apple Apple Apple does it too.
[01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:22.920]   I don't think anybody should do it.
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:23.920]   Yeah you're right.
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:27.920]   Andy it's a serious issue for blacksmiths.
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:28.920]   If you have an anvil.
[01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:33.880]   Well that's it should be the least it's really the least issue possible for blacksmiths.
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:38.240]   Because if it happens to your phone you simply drop it in the forge get it white hot again
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:41.400]   put it back on the forge hammer it flat you're done.
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:43.640]   Those are the people who have the iPhone sword.
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:47.760]   All right let's take a break when we come back your picks.
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:51.480]   Georgia you've not been here before we called you like minutes before the show began so
[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:54.720]   I'm not going to make you do a pick unless you have something you like and you want to
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:37:00.080]   talk about and it does not have to be you know program it could be anything as you'll
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:02.480]   see because Andy always picks crazy things.
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:03.480]   Yeah.
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:04.480]   Yeah.
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:05.480]   Groot.
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:07.320]   Groot's always safe.
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:09.040]   Now is that a dancing group?
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:10.440]   It is it's a bobblehead group.
[01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:11.440]   Oh okay.
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:13.440]   That is a very nice group.
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:15.240]   Excellent group.
[01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:19.040]   Can you just quit your job on Tuesdays?
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:21.720]   Seriously I want to get you back here we'll figure it out.
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:23.400]   Maybe we'll just move Mac break weekly.
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:25.560]   Do you get a day off?
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:26.560]   Mondays and Fridays.
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:27.560]   Mondays and Fridays.
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:29.000]   I'll figure it out.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.800]   You work Saturday and Sunday.
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:33.200]   No I'm off also on Saturday and Sunday.
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:39.280]   Oh all right Mondays and Fridays.

[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:54.040]   Maybe you have some old stuff lying around like maybe a note for just sitting in a drawer
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:55.040]   gathering dust.
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:38:00.960]   You know if you've got an old phone or an old pad or a tablet or a you it's silly to leave
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:04.800]   it in the drawer or put it you know as a door stop because it's like you wouldn't use
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:08.080]   a hundred dollar bill as a door stop.
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:09.840]   You can get cash for this sucker.
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:16.240]   So go to Gazelle.com and get a great price on your old stuff.
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:17.720]   You get paid in cash.

[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:24.360]   They bump the offer up by five percent if you take the Amazon gift card.
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:26.160]   So that's a good deal.
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:30.240]   Now here's a nice thing that quote you're going to get from Gazelle is good for 30 days.
[01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:34.440]   So you can shop around and check it out and you know and maybe even not decide.
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:36.600]   Maybe you're not sure what you're going to get the watch or which watch you're going
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:37.760]   to get.
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:39.200]   What did that what?
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:40.200]   What?
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:41.800]   This thing's worth $275.
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:46.080]   That would I'm going to sell this bookmark that.
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:47.360]   Athlete on Apple Watch.
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:51.680]   Halfway to an Apple Watch with one with one swell.
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:52.880]   They pay for the shipping too.

[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:05.120]   broken iPhones and iPads they'll wipe the data for you.
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:07.520]   Don't worry about that.
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:12.000]   Now you may ask Leo what do they do with all those devices?
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.640]   Well the very best the creme de la creme they offer for sale.
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:21.640]   See Gazelle this is a new thing from Gazelle is now offering a certified pre-owned.
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:26.400]   Owned gadgets devices from Apple and Samsung.
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:27.600]   So there are two conditions.

[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:46.440]   That's all.
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:50.000]   What they do with everything of course is run it through a rigorous 30 port inspection
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.280]   to make sure everything's working fine.
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:55.520]   And of course there's no risk because certified pre-owned devices from Gazelle are backed
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:40:00.520]   by a 30 day risk free return policy.
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:11.160]   Gazelle to buy and to sell G A Z E L L E Gazelle dot com we thank you for their support.
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:15.160]   Mac break weekly Renee Richie why don't you kick things off.
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:20.280]   So it is a national autism awareness month some people call it national autism acceptance
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:24.200]   month both are I like that I like that yeah.
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:28.000]   And Apple is doing a promotion in the app store for a bunch of apps that are really helpful
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:33.120]   in many different ways especially for children who are on the autistic spectrum.
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:36.600]   There's a whole category in iTunes for this month where you can go and get things that
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:40.840]   help them with communications that help them with learning that up with all sorts of skills
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:42.200]   that are really important.
[01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:46.040]   One of the apps that I got a chance to see at all because it's made by people in Ireland
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:52.000]   is called grace and what grace does is it lets it's a visual sometimes people on the
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.760]   autistic spectrum they just can't communicate what they want to communicate.
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:57.960]   So this lets you take a picture of something with your iPhone it loads it in it makes
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:02.960]   it into a card and the child can assemble the cards in order to make visual sentences.
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:06.840]   So they just assemble them and then show them to their parent or their guardian or their
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:09.720]   caretaker whoever whoever they want to communicate with.
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:12.560]   And if something is missing traditionally you couldn't do anything about it you just
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:16.040]   couldn't add that card but they can you know they or their parent again can just take the
[01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:20.200]   device take another picture add a new card to it so their vocabulary can grow almost
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:23.280]   instantly and it can adapt almost any situation.
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:28.040]   And once they have this it just empowers them with a level of communication.
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:30.640]   Powers both them and the people around them with a level of communication that they've
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:33.120]   never been able to enjoy before.
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:38.880]   And if you look the iPad especially is five years old as of last Friday and there's been
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:42.720]   people blogging about using it with people in autistic spectrum for the last five years
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:48.400]   Apple added the guided the guided access mode a couple years ago to help people focus more
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:49.720]   on those apps.
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:54.520]   And it's just when you start looking at how it makes a real difference in people's lives
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:57.840]   you know it goes back to that commercial where Apple said you know technology is nice lighter
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:02.000]   thinner faster these are all good things but it's the experience is what you can do with
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.080]   it that really matters and it's apps like these to me at least that show you know when
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:10.280]   you make this technology not just available but you make it accessible you make it you
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:15.400]   know almost anybody can buy it and use it then you really get the benefit of apps like
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:16.400]   these.
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:18.200]   And I think it's terrific that they're highlighting them.
[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:21.320]   Yeah that is so great.
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:24.680]   I guess how do you do this you search for autism awareness month or.
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:29.040]   Yeah and we have we put up a big post on our line war two with a bunch of extra apps
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:32.520]   and accessories and there's some bundles as well some of the apps are half off some of
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:38.880]   them are bundled together so you can get them at a discount and it's really cool.
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:40.960]   Autism awareness week and grace.
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:44.760]   Yes see by Stephen trot and Smith or you might know from all his awesome hackery on
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:45.760]   Twitter.
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:46.760]   Yeah yeah yeah.
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:50.320]   He's a guy who gets you know iOS apps running on intendos and things like.
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:54.520]   Andy and I go what do you got for us.
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:43:00.800]   Mine is a web browser let's say time observer app called waste no time it's a plugin that
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:03.000]   works with Safari and with Chrome.
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:07.400]   You see you've heard about these what these plugins you can put in that say look I don't
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:09.080]   want to be distracted by the internet.
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:13.000]   Please just whatever I do don't let me access the internet for the next 30 minutes because
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:17.440]   I just need to get through this to do this I just need to write this sort of thing.
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:21.000]   The problem with a lot of them is that they are really all or nothing at all.
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.600]   They don't really help you figure out where are you wasting time on the internet.
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:30.720]   How bad is this problem and what are the sources of your problems because I myself you
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:35.720]   know if I'm stuck for more than like 15 seconds on the next sentence I might like tab over
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:39.760]   and just see okay has my favorite webcomic been updated today.
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:43.080]   And so this will give you like bar charts to simply say here is all the time you spent
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:47.200]   on the internet today and here are all the sites that you visited and then you can simply
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:53.320]   say look give me just 30 minutes a day on Facebook let me only have one hour on tumblr.
[01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:57.640]   Don't let me access read it at all and when you enable it you will basically be able to
[01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:02.680]   create an environment where like in my case for instance I would be able to write my column
[01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:08.520]   still access websites that I need access to like look up product specs on apple.com
[01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:09.960]   and stuff like that.
[01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:15.240]   The weaknesses of it are that it is easy to get around if you know how your web browser
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:20.720]   works but I think that's that's okay because really the purpose of this sort of a blocker
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:24.640]   is to remind you that look you told yourself you did not want to be distracted for the
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:29.340]   next half hour I'm here to remind you that you really wanted to focus and if you really
[01:44:29.340 --> 01:44:33.760]   do want to like with see with some of these other plugins if you really do want to quit
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:38.320]   your browser and restart it or shut down your Mac and restart it you're free to do so but
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:43.760]   now you're sort of like that person who is now you know going going into the recycling
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:48.800]   in your garage to find that one cigarette but that you know still has about a good 20
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:52.400]   seconds worth of smoke left onto it that's the sort of behavior that reminds you that
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:57.280]   oh I guess I really do have a problem with dependency and obsessive behavior here here's
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:45:01.160]   the challenge section which you have to enable when you are blocked by the time quota you
[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:08.040]   set you will likely be tempted to add more time or remove a blocked site this option helps
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:15.360]   you fight the urge so you can say type make me type a randomly generated string and I
[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:20.080]   guess that's kind of like you know counting to 10 only harder yeah it's just safe word
[01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:24.840]   and it's different every time and then if you type it okay you can go back to Reddit but
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:31.040]   don't say we didn't warn you now Andy will this lock me out of playing Candy Crush
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:37.080]   uh-huh you can have that on your block list oh that's only on the web though right on
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:41.040]   the good enough for me because I will play Candy Crush on the web and surf Reddit instead
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:47.280]   of doing any of my paperwork so I might know you know what you know it should do like if
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:51.040]   you want to block like phones apps like that on the phone there should be an app that says
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:55.360]   okay well because just like expector cluso hired kato does look I don't care wherever
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:46:00.000]   I am try to attack me anytime I'm inside the house you could tell me look anytime I try
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:05.280]   to launch Candy Crush you are to take one photo from my private photo roll at random
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:10.040]   upload it to a URL and give me like a math problem I have to solve to figure out what
[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:12.680]   that URL is in order to take it down.
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:17.320]   So as I was playing Candy Crush you have to do 30 minutes worth of math to prevent like
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:22.160]   your embarrassing like drunk birthday photos from being like on on Reddit.
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:23.160]   Love it.
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:29.620]   Actually you teach CBT don't you this would be a good tool for clients if you had any
[01:46:29.620 --> 01:46:34.600]   clients it just couldn't manage to avoid their compulsive playing of I don't know Candy Crush
[01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:35.600]   Saga.
[01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:37.600]   Yeah World of Warcraft.
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:38.600]   World of Warcraft.
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:41.800]   Whatever it might be that they're playing now that they shouldn't I think that it's a
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:46.360]   really useful tool because a lot of people want to do their work but it's just you know
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:49.640]   that delay of like you want to avoid something that's a negative experience.
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:50.640]   Yeah.
[01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:51.880]   So you're going to do something else to avoid it.
[01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:55.520]   Yeah it's like this but they're telling me it's like the scene in Young Frankenstein
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:47:00.680]   where he goes in there and says no matter what I do do not let me out.
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:04.680]   What's the matter with you people I was still a game.
[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:08.760]   Don't you know I just don't want to hear what I was talking about.
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:16.040]   Jesus Christ get me out of it.
[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:20.920]   I'll be honest I won't know about it.
[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:22.920]   Listen properly.
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:30.880]   Oh I'm I just installed this and now I'm uninstalling it right now.
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:31.880]   Right now.
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:36.280]   All right Georgia we gave you a few minutes to thank you got anything for us.
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:41.560]   Sure I have a puzzle game that I'm playing on my iPhone and it's called The Room 2.
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:43.840]   It's a wonderful thing about this.
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:45.280]   It's an amazing puzzle game.
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:50.840]   It's a 3D experience where you interact tactfully with the world and what I love about it is
[01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:54.840]   that if you can't really frustrated there's an area that you cannot pass you can get a
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:57.720]   hint and it's not it's not going to give you the answer it's just going to give you
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:03.200]   a tiny hint to lead you into the right direction and then you go through it and it's it's just
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:04.360]   beautifully rendered.
[01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:05.800]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:11.120]   The auditory experience is also really interesting and it's also a mystery game at the same time.
[01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:14.680]   So you're also trying to uncover what the mystery is as you play along.
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:19.400]   Yeah highly recommended the room and then the room to you should start with the room I guess
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:23.240]   and then you probably should start with the room before you go to the room to it's if you
[01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:25.160]   liked missed.
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:28.960]   It's like yeah it's like a better missed it's that kind of puzzle.
[01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:33.160]   It's beautiful 3D unlike missed it's not a slide show.
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:35.840]   It's beautifully rendered.
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:41.320]   Excellent choice the room and the now the room to gorgeous.
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:43.080]   Have you solved it?
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:46.360]   Yes I finished it was a lot of fun.
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:51.800]   It's one of the games I can be fully immersed in and it's enjoyable over just being stressful
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:55.440]   to stress so you can choose your level of stress while you play the game you're over
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:58.560]   stressed get a hint and you can buy your way out.
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:02.360]   Georgia Dow I want you to come back you're so fantastic.
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:05.480]   I really thank you for showing up at last minute.
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:08.200]   We weren't sure if Andy would be able to make it through the whole show he did which
[01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:14.480]   is great but thank you for being here you'll find more of her work at iMore.com and also
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:15.480]   her podcast.
[01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:18.480]   What's the name of it again?
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:22.480]   There's a vector and I also do a gaming podcast called Isometric.
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:25.160]   Ooh is it like casual gaming?
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:29.480]   It's for casual gaming and it's a podcast that breaks all the podcast rules so we're usually
[01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:32.920]   joking around and doing silliness.
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:34.720]   That is not allowed.
[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:38.960]   They don't actually play games they just watch the podcast and it's funny to see it's
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:39.960]   intract.
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:45.880]   Awesome so look for vector and what is the name of the gaming show?
[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:46.880]   Isometric.
[01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:47.880]   Isometric.
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:48.980]   I love it.
[01:49:48.980 --> 01:49:51.480]   Thank you Georgia we appreciate it.
[01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:56.600]   Renee Richie is also at iMore.com he hosts the debug show there and writes a lot lately
[01:49:56.600 --> 01:50:00.280]   writes a lot of stuff about how bad the mainstream media is but there's other things
[01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:01.280]   too.
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:04.640]   We just did actually we just did a five year retrospective on the iPad and we managed to
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:11.440]   get comments from Caroline Mizzolese, Lauren Bricter, Alan Pike, Mark Kuanno, Nitin Gannatra,
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:13.040]   Ben Bahar and Janie Yang.
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:16.360]   Just a whole slew of people who were there either building the iPad or building apps
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:17.520]   for it the first year.
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:23.120]   Ken Case, James Kuda, just a litany of really cool developers gave us their thoughts on
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:25.120]   the iPad now five years later.
[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:30.800]   Yeah we didn't mention that April 5th was the 5th anniversary of the release of the
[01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:33.840]   very first iPad April 5th 2010.
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:41.120]   It seems longer and not as long it's funny it's an odd thing it doesn't seem like it's
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:46.200]   been around that long and yet.
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:48.360]   It is because it's ubiquitous.
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:52.720]   It is a bigger iPhone but it's like an iPhone on iMac so people were used to the experience
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:56.720]   already so it was additive and then they just had to pick the sort of screen size they wanted
[01:50:56.720 --> 01:51:02.560]   and we got the retina version and the mini so it's been part of a larger story I think.
[01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:05.800]   Yeah, yeah it has.
[01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:08.840]   It has changed the world in a very significant way.
[01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:10.480]   Alright we'll look for that.
[01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:14.680]   Andy Inako, he is in Colorado now the Council on World Affairs.
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:18.560]   Go there if you can if you're in the area and near Boulder.
[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:22.360]   Yep everything's open to the public and we got sessions all the way until the end of
[01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:23.360]   the week.
[01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:24.680]   You're going to stay all week.
[01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:26.440]   I'm here all the way through Friday.
[01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:27.440]   Nice.
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:30.840]   It's kind of like a working vacation I would guess for you.
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:34.920]   It really is I mean I'm speaking for about three hours a day but the rest of the time
[01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:38.120]   I get to attend other people's talks.
[01:51:38.120 --> 01:51:42.560]   Also there are friends of mine that I met originally here at the conference that I get
[01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:45.240]   to see like for the entire week.
[01:51:45.240 --> 01:51:47.120]   Boulder Colorado is a beautiful city.
[01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:52.920]   I came here to the Colorado Rockies to finally have nice 60 to 70 degree spring weather because
[01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:56.200]   it's still in the low 40s back in Boston.
[01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:57.720]   So it's really great to have it.
[01:51:57.720 --> 01:51:59.120]   You meet people you never get to meet.
[01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:03.360]   You talk about things you rarely get to talk about and I spend as much time on that panel
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:07.480]   talking as I do scribbling notes about these really interesting things that other people
[01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:10.160]   on the panel are saying on the same subject.
[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:11.160]   Is there a website?
[01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:12.920]   I guess if I just Google it I could probably find it.
[01:52:12.920 --> 01:52:17.800]   Go to Colorado.edu/cwa.
[01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:19.320]   That's the main site.
[01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:20.720]   The schedule it has all the.
[01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:24.960]   It just take a moment to just look through like all the people are speaking here.
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:29.760]   One of the people who's just a panelist here was one of the lawyers who argued Roe v. Wade.
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:30.760]   Wow.
[01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:36.280]   We have G. Willow Wilson who's the writer that incredibly cool Ms. Marvel comic and has
[01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:41.080]   been doing a lot more stuff for Marvel and also really really talented novel is one of
[01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:42.680]   my favorite writers.
[01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:47.280]   Just so many people that you're like I would enjoy being here just to listen to these people
[01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:49.040]   talk and I get to like hang up with them.
[01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:50.640]   So these are it's really pretty cool.
[01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:56.640]   It's funny as soon as I start typing Colorado.edu it takes me right to the bursors and ask me
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:57.640]   for money.
[01:52:57.640 --> 01:53:00.600]   I don't understand that there's the council on conference.
[01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:05.240]   I've been calling a council conference on world affairs 67th annual.
[01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:09.920]   Yeah Eleanor Roosevelt was the first keynote speaker for the first one.
[01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:10.920]   So neat.
[01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:13.960]   So one of the reasons I was really happy when Henry said I want to go to see you Boulder.
[01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:14.960]   I said yeah.
[01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:16.720]   Yeah, it's really good.
[01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:17.720]   Cool.
[01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:18.720]   You should come over.
[01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:19.720]   You should you have things to say.
[01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:21.320]   I will go next year.
[01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:22.720]   Lunches and dinners are complimentary.
[01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:24.560]   Oh, oh, wow.
[01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:26.040]   Free candy bars.

[01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:06.320]   Plus it's not a robot.
[01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:09.120]   It's like Glenn.
