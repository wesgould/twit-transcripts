[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.960]   Yes, very busy day
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.720]   I spent most of the morning sleeping because I went to bed
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.320]   Like after I filed my my apple and bargoes this morning. So no busy day lots of stuff
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.320]   I'm coming to you live from New York City
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.320]   No, I can't do the accent Mac break Mac break one
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.040]   We still believe Christina's I've been interviewing Apple executives all day. I'm so tired bit. We still might
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:07.600]   That's a great reason to be tired more like well, I was been watching Seinfeld on Hulu. I didn't realize was 530
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.400]   That was over the weekend Andy that wasn't last night. That was like Saturday and Sunday night
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.560]   I got the Mac. I got the Mac put in that apartment man. That's all I care about
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:26.640]   We all we all we're all here to fight the battles we feel as though we're best qualified to fight
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:34.000]   I I had an experience like that where there is a high-profile product in which they use the wrong plural form in the user interface
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.120]   You might want to change those to this like oh wow good catch
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.240]   Thank you and then I felt like you know what it's 2 p.m
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.640]   But I'm gonna knock off work for the day because I spoke truth to power and I affected social change
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:55.200]   Also with us is Kelly Guymont of Mac Observer and app camp for girls. How you doing Kelly? I'm well Andy. How are you?
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:04.720]   It's it's not that nice. I'm hoping for you know sub arctic sub arctic things going on here
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.360]   No matter how many windows I open it's just not working
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.200]   Yeah, it's we're having the same thing here. So and it's not what we do as
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.200]   Portlanders. It's this is not a thing and so we've had like a week of 90 degree temperatures and it's not okay
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:27.280]   Yeah, I was looking at the they they're they on twitter someplace. They had the national map talking about a national heatwave and
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.600]   I'm normally very happy to live in the northeast, but I'm also happy because the northeast right now is the only place that's colored
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.120]   Orange trending towards yellow as opposed to red. Oh geez trending towards a redder version of red. So yes
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:49.120]   Well, they were Andy before we move on. I think it should be noted that we now have an official logo for Mac break one
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:56.080]   So anytime we do a sounder or a bumper we have something to jump to that's thanks to f and done
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.960]   Also lost in New York
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.360]   And as personal as your living room it's Mac break one
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.840]   Also
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.080]   Also, we each get a taste today show of the merchandising on on mv1
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.600]   So I'm glad to know that you know, we're we're giving back to the community
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.480]   But also hoping to put that Tesla in our driveway
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.360]   But of course today's because is okay, that would look good on a t-shirt. Let's just point out
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.680]   Also, we would fit in pretty much everywhere. It's one of those great logos that could mean just about anything
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.360]   So
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:36.000]   It could it could be like our music our own personal music group or it could mean that we have like sort of a
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.680]   Leveraged financial holding company that managed to finish the third stage of the transaction deal
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.480]   And everyone gone the team got a t-shirt or maybe it's a solution for property. I don't know
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.400]   It looks as if Jason
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.600]   Literally lifted the logo off the internet and we've repurposed it for Mac break weekly
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.440]   So it could be a number of things it would be it would be very apple for us to say well
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.800]   Actually, we really do need that trademark. We can really have to lodge on this date
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.200]   We'll set it out. We'll settle it in the courts later on
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:12.320]   We'll see whether that whether mv1 becomes better better well known for our brand new next generation iPhone
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.840]   Or this little property holding company somewhere that no one's ever heard of
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:22.640]   Good luck to you again. I if I were you I'd be take I'd be accepting the $6,000 settlement we're offering but hey
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.240]   We're both businessmen. I guess we're just in different businesses
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:34.240]   Okay, so yes today was the official launch of apple music including the launch of of of beats one there
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.080]   the the
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.280]   internationally
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.600]   100 country live radio station
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:46.640]   Those of you who were tuning in at noon on the dot and had updated to ios 8.4 on your ios devices
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.880]   This is what you got to hear
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.320]   First about three hours of brine, you know, music like on hold screaming music
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.160]   a little bit of
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.120]   microphone chatter
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.560]   We spent the last three months trying to build this radio station and now we can build no more
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.280]   We must launch
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.880]   We've had all sorts of ideas about the first song things that are made statements things with fanfare
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:14.480]   But ultimately there's been one song that all of us keep coming back to we've tested sound to it
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.400]   I've referred to it lyrically when I needed a boost because it's been strange all the times, you know
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:24.000]   And exciting and challenging we've even cut demos to it to convince people to continue to support this radio station
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.920]   This band put this ep out a few months ago with little or no fanfare outside of core fans
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.240]   But they're building that's exactly the kind of story. They kind of record
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.840]   We need to kick this whole thing off with because man, it's not about fanfare
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.000]   That's fireworks and a hangover the next day. It's about quality and consistency
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.880]   Where beats one we're worldwide
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.440]   And from now on
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.440]   We're always on
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.920]   And it's city by spring king
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:08:03.760]   Called it
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:11.120]   Yeah, so basically the next two and a half years of pub trivia questions that has been settled is going to be
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.920]   spring king's city
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.320]   Now uh, kelly, I think you're the only one who hasn't listened to beats one yet
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.000]   Uh, so let's let's share our own experiences with it. Uh, Renee
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.560]   What was your first impression when you first got the here the radio station?
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.680]   So I don't I have to say I don't listen to a lot of music
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.280]   I'm much more a video person
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.840]   So I have Netflix running all day instead of music running all day
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.840]   And I haven't listened to music in a long time
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.200]   But I put it on because I was curious and it instantly reminded me of everything
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.280]   I loved about FM radio back in high school when I could name all the DJs
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.920]   And it's something Christina Warren actually said to me a long time ago
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.280]   We were talking on twitter
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.960]   And it's like, you know, if you have the dvd on the shelf you still don't want to you're too lazy to go get it
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.480]   So streaming is great
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.680]   And it immediately gave me music. I didn't have to figure out what to play
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.360]   It was just playing for me
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:01.520]   And it was like nostalgae all the best bits of nostalgia wrapped up in all the advantages of mobile always on connected devices
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.760]   So I thought it was thought it was great to listen to it all morning
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.400]   Yeah, I I've not listened to it was it felt a little bit
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.720]   Intrusive that you occasionally hear Zane talking over parts of the music
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:19.360]   It felt really really weird that the first three or four songs they would be saying like little like station IDs in the middle of the songs
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.640]   But then I realized that I have not listened to FM radio
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.560]   I can't I don't can't even remember the I think the last time I listened to radio
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.600]   Seriously was the last time we had like a two-day power outage and that was the only way to get the only thing right?
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.840]   Yeah
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.840]   Christina, what did you think
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.440]   Well, so I used to listen to Zane's show on a bpc radio one
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:47.840]   Speaking of before of trademark abuse. I wonder if apple's gonna get in trouble for calling it beats one when it's so clearly kind of a call to to radio one
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.160]   And in his show, you know
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.200]   It was a lot kind of like what the apple show seems to be and
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:10:01.040]   I used to like basically because I don't live in the UK, you know pirate somebody's iPlayer login to to listen to his show
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.040]   Um, so I mean I liked it. I haven't had a ton of a chance to listen to it
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.240]   But it's I like that it's a weird novelty isn't it?
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:15.440]   It's weird how like in in a period of you know 15 20 years we've gone from radio kind of being ubiquitous and being one of the main places we get music to
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.160]   a live radio station being
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:23.440]   With people actually talking and with people actually spinning tracks and not being algorithmically determined playlists
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.680]   Um is is like a novelty and and it's like oh my god. This is this great experience
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.520]   I was like no, this is actually like how music was done for like, you know 50 years
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:36.560]   um, so but but uh, I've been impressed with kind of I guess the
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.320]   The point of view um at least in the song selection so far
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:47.760]   um, which uh, I mean, I'm hearing a ton of stuff that I wouldn't hear maybe on anything else unless it was like a more obscure like serious
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:54.480]   Exum channel, but um no, I mean so far it's it's it's cool. I don't know if it's going to ultimately work or not
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.560]   But uh so far so good
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:01.600]   Actually, that was the thing that I was excited about when I heard that um apple had picked up zane in the first place
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.920]   Was because I used to also listen to his show a lot on
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:11.200]   Radio one and I really liked um the shows that he did he did this series called masterpieces where he really dug into albums
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:19.040]   And uh they would play it and then they would have like interviews and and how like sort of the aftermath of music after this album came out
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:26.240]   And they were things like uh nirvana nevermind and led Zeppelin for an okay computer and public enemy
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.680]   Like he did a wide variety of stuff with these and I remember getting to hear some of the early ones
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.800]   And it's um so I was really excited to hear about it
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.320]   um and
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:42.720]   And it felt weird to be looking forward to something that was sort of radio related because I actively do not listen to the radio and haven't for a long
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.800]   Time because a lot of stations here in portland have become those robo stations
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.040]   Where there is no dj and there really isn't any personality and it's all being
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:59.360]   Dictated by some guy in a tower somewhere else who says like all of the stations today should be this thing, you know
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.000]   Uh, you know everybody's gonna play this song now and it's gonna be popular
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.320]   And I think about just in the amount of time that I've had the car that I have
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:14.880]   um I updated the cd player in a I got my car in two the car I have now I got in 2004
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.320]   And when I got my car I was really excited to
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.920]   Upgrade the cd player so that it was one that would play discs that I had burned mp3s too
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:30.320]   That was the most exciting thing I could do with this and one of the side options was someday
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:36.640]   When I got an iPod I would be able to plug it in and connect it and then once I was able to
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.720]   Do that effectively with my phone?
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:43.040]   I basically quit burning those CDs and that's all I use to listen to it now now
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.400]   The ox cable that I use I've plugged a bluetooth receiver into the end of it
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.200]   Every time I get in my phone connects and I just move on with my day
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.880]   Um, I don't do a lot of radio. So I was like wait, they got zane low and he's gonna build this radio station
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.720]   That's gonna be awesome. That's really weird that I think that that's gonna be so awesome
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.760]   So I can't wait to see how it ultimately ends up evolving
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.880]   That sounds cool. So I'm ready
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:12.720]   I never I've never heard zane before so is he known for doing these like really like a collected playlist because one of the things
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.840]   I've really liked about my first half hour with it is that it wasn't all like music for people who
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:24.160]   Have a six-month window of uh of interest in music. They had the ac dc for those about to
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:29.920]   They had some feral they had some some Beck they had some new artists that I had never heard of but I liked a lot
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.320]   Is this like is zane like known for like just cool music wherever it comes from he's deep
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.800]   He's got some deep music cred and it's and it's broad too like that's the thing is very broad
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:45.360]   He's got cred all the way down but also all the way across so um he's sort of like john piel in that way where john piel
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:51.040]   Really didn't care if it was a rock song or a pop song or an electronic song. He just cared that it was great
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:57.680]   and um zane is zane low somehow has a similar sort of knack for that kind of like this is a great song
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.680]   Oh, yeah
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:05.280]   Exactly and when I talked to uh when I talked to Trent russner yesterday and I promise you guys i'm not gonna say that too many times
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.360]   But but say that
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.880]   Say that as many times as you want because that's awesome
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:15.200]   I had the opportunity to say that I would say it an awful lot if I got an interview with dave growl
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:20.320]   It would be I would be worried. I talked to dave growl hat here and it'd be my first hat too
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.840]   Yeah
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:27.120]   I I would when I when I talked to trent yesterday because um beats one was well a lot of it was his idea
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.600]   He said that I mean a lot of the genesis came from hearing zane's show in the uk
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.760]   And and when he was going back and forth to London to to complete his his last album
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.840]   He um would listen to uh radio one a lot and zane's show
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.600]   And so when they started kind of playing around with the idea of doing a radio station
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.480]   He said that the first and only choice was zane
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.080]   So they approached him and basically said we want you to take half full control
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:56.880]   Put your dna put your judgment put everything into kind of the the the you know essence of this station
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:04.800]   Um, so um, yeah, he's really well known for having a good uh in a unique voice and not being the typical kind of um
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.560]   DJ and I think that what's interesting about that is because this is a
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:13.680]   An international radio station which in and of itself is actually kind of unique in this day and age
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.880]   Um
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:20.240]   There are so many people who who haven't been exposed to him like kelly and i we we've listened to him and we like went through like
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.760]   Weird ways to try to like listen to him, but like a lot of people in america
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:28.400]   Have never been exposed to him and maybe people in other parts of the world haven't and I think that's uh, that's interesting
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.920]   That that they're able to do that and I think that's one of the the things that
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.960]   Uh, probably only apple can do because of just their their broad scale and the fact that they have so much money that they can
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.960]   You know invest in experiments like this to see if something like this is going to work
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.440]   I can't see other companies bothering
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:48.960]   Um to create a alive, you know, uh, 24 hour international radio station
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.880]   That was a huge thing for me. It's because uh, you know, it's not going to make as much money
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.000]   Uh, all all of apple music is not going to make as much money as the iphone
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.920]   I'm not even the ipad probably not even in the apple tv for them in the long scale of things
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.120]   But they're willing to they they literally do love music so much that they put it at the very top of apple.com
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:10.960]   They've got everyone at itunes all the way to the highest levels deeply invested in this throwing resources at it
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:15.200]   And they they believe they don't apple doesn't need this apple could lose music and not you know
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.600]   It would it would not be a very big hit on their bottom line
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:23.280]   But they really believe that they need music to be part of their dna and that they haven't they haven't had music since the height of the ipod
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:27.120]   And this is their big shot to get it back and I think it's wonderfully human and optimistic
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:34.480]   And whether it wins or loses at the very least people on twitter are having a worldwide conversation about music and a shared experience now, which is amazing
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.360]   Yeah, I mean, I had a
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.960]   I think all a lot of us were a little bit puzzled by what apple music was going to be
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:46.400]   During the during the keynote because I don't think they made a really good comment on what they're going to be doing that was different
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.600]   uh, and
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.560]   And a unique position that apple is in is that they're unlike spotify unlike artyo
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.880]   They don't have to make a fortune off of music
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:00.000]   And off of a streaming service. They just have to make it sure that it does okay because like with google music
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.840]   It's just part of a larger portfolio
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:06.080]   And so it's really really encouraging to see that they didn't just simply say well, you okay fine
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:12.240]   We'll have a streaming internet station too. We'll just hire some consultants to put together a playlist that will just loop for 24 hours
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:19.360]   Uh, proceed did the did trent resner have anything else to say about how the what the intent of the radio station was going to be because it
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.040]   I was
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:26.800]   Impressed that someone who was so deeply ingrained with music got so much power to simply shape here's what the content is going to be like
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.520]   It does. Did not have very corporate decision
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.120]   No, no, not at all
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:37.440]   Well, so I mean a lot of this comes back from the you know from really goes back to beats music and and what beats music was trying to be
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:43.440]   And so, you know, I think it shows a couple of things one it shows that when apple acquired beats and and obviously beats music
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.040]   Um, they've done a really good job and and I've seen this kind of interliven people
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.440]   I've known who've gone from one place to the other of
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:55.440]   um, I guess keeping the beats culture intact and so um, I think that some of the ideas that that the trent had
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.960]   Were things he wanted to do at beats and then he felt like okay at apple
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.640]   I'll actually have the opportunity and the scale and the money to to get this done
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.200]   Um, but he actually made a comment. It was kind of interesting
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:10.720]   We're talking about how you rene is mentioning that we're having this like kind of global conversation about a radio station right now
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:15.600]   And that's kind of what their intention is they kind of wanted to have a throwback when I when I talked to somebody
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   From from apple music at ww dc. He kind of likened it to
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.480]   You know remember when when mtv was new and it was the sort of thing where everybody had kind of a conversation about what was happening
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:32.080]   On mtv and they kind of want to create something that has I think trent resner said if I have to look at my notes
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:39.280]   I'm like like, you know have like a cultural, you know, resonance like like be like culturally relevant and um
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.840]   That's I you know
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.920]   I think a big part of about what they want the product to be and I think part of the reason that they're investing in
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.280]   This is is I talked to eddy about this and in jimmy iving too
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.440]   Um is that they firmly believe that the only way that this really works is
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:57.120]   Um and can make money for everybody the only way it scales, you know jimmy
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:01.600]   Iving said is that if it's a service and not a utility and he sees the existing
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:08.400]   streaming services not as services but as utilities where you know, basically they haven't taken any kind of you know, um
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:15.040]   Curated artistic approach editorialized approach to the music they just kind of dump you in maybe they have some some playlists
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.600]   Maybe they have some, you know, um, you know curators and that sort of thing, but they're not really taking
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:25.600]   um a really handpicked kind of you know deep dive level into creating a great music experience
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.480]   Um, and so if this is going to work
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:33.840]   If people are going to pay the experience has to be key and they think that the way that you do that is by doing things like having
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.960]   You know the place that you can listen to live radio anywhere in the world
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:42.320]   The fact that they're going to be doing it 24/7 the fact that they will have artists doing unique types of shows
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.680]   So even though zane show will be accessible to the mainstream
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:50.320]   There will be an hour programming each night that might be like out of the mainstream where you might have like, you know
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:56.960]   Once a week, you know, like like st. Vincent she'll have a show where she's going to be kind of creating a custom mix tape for for people based on
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:02.160]   um their request and the letters that they send her and so so I kind of described that uh
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:06.240]   The beats guys or the apple guys. I was like, oh so you like the lilah that doesn't suck
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.800]   um and and I think that that's
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:16.720]   What they're it came to cross to me. Anyway, like this is a core part of their mission is is to really have a good solid music experience
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.720]   Because that's what we'll keep people
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.080]   In it and that's what we'll make people subscribe and ultimately pay for it
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.160]   Is that they can get something out of it?
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:28.640]   It isn't just you know dumping them into a catalog of music with a search bar
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:32.880]   How many zane lows are available to run your curated physics radio station?
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:37.040]   Right. Yeah, that's a valid question and it's really not that many
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:45.600]   What's really been interesting to me and in a lot of this is watching how Trent resner's role in the music world has evolved from
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:49.600]   Let's just paint in some broad strokes from pretty hate machine to now
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:53.120]   like that's a pretty that that's a pretty wide and
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:21:00.640]   and winding path that he's taken and it's been really interesting to watch and we were talking about him in the chat room and
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.680]   Like he had a streaming radio station ages ago
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:09.040]   If i'm if i'm remembering properly and i i feel like i am because i was only interested because it was Trent resner
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:14.960]   Um and he did like an internet radio station a long time ago where it was like his handpicked stuff out of
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.520]   his record collection and and
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:21.680]   That kind of stuff is always really great and i never really got into the celebrity playlists
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.920]   And so i'm hoping on itunes
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:28.880]   So i'm hoping that with the connect stuff that they're doing that maybe that will be a little nicer
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:34.000]   But of course all of that leads to a conversation about how apple wants me to spend more time in itunes
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.960]   When all i want in life is to feed it to a wood chipper so
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:41.040]   There's some tension there right now in that relationship
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:45.760]   How big do we think that connect is going to be to the experience we've already had some artists
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:52.080]   They're posting like full studio for uh, uh tracks without audio. We've had uh lost tracks being posted
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.040]   um
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:58.000]   My point of confusion about connect is whether it's going to be more like soundcloud where
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.480]   Anybody can come in and post their
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:05.200]   Their own creations or whether it's going to be more like a marketing thing
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:10.800]   Where if there's someone who's selling a lot of stuff the right tunes they can use connect tracks and connect bonus materials to encourage people to buy
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.520]   What what fiber is anybody else getting from this?
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.000]   I think they wanted to be a mix of both
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:23.680]   So when i talked to to in rogers who was the ceo abuse music and now kind of runs like the itunes radio stuff and it's heavily involved with apple music
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:29.280]   He basically kind of described connect it's kind of their vision of wanting to kind of take what you saw in soundcloud and bring it
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.680]   um to you know
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.080]   To itunes so you wouldn't have to go to a bunch of other apps
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.960]   Um and and they've been very clear, you know, right?
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:41.440]   There was an update to a garage band that was issued today where you can actually publish directly from garage band to
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:45.840]   Uh connect and and the artists have complete control over whether they want
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:50.640]   Um, you know, there's the music to be paid, you know behind the paywall or not. Um, how accessible they want it to be
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:54.960]   It can be you know their own track. It can brand new it doesn't have to be associated with anything else
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.240]   Like you said, you know, trent he released, you know the with teeth album
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:05.120]   Without vocals, um, i am moored. Um, he posted some track yesterday. I saw that, you know, it was like some
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:09.600]   Live track from from a kcrw performance from a couple of years ago
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:13.760]   Um, I mean, I think that the idea is that they want artists people to use it that way
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:20.960]   I think the reality is I don't know how they're able to maybe internally scale it so that more artists can have access
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:26.080]   I don't know what that process is going to be of getting people to access it because part of what makes soundcloud so great
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:31.200]   Is that anybody can use it and and that means that there's like a lot of crap and stuff that you don't want to see but that also means
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.360]   There are a lot of up and coming emerging artists who might not have the label representation
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:41.440]   Who are on soundcloud and kind of build a following that way? So I don't know how you're able to I guess
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:46.080]   Do that sound cloudy thing in a vetted way, which is i'm sure what apple wants
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:51.840]   Um, my fear with connect. I think it's a cool idea and I think that um if if
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.480]   You know people use it if the artists use it it has potential to be a really cool tool
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:01.040]   I just having talked to the artists for so many years and and seeing how much they've struggled
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:05.680]   To get the social game and get the digital game when it comes to music, you know, they all got my space
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:09.440]   And then it was like when my space died, no, what he would knew what to do and they've kind of you know
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.520]   Scattered to these various platforms. I don't know if this is going to be the answer bro
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.400]   This is going to be the service they use to connect with fans
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.480]   I I almost think that they'll still continue to use soundcloud and twitter and facebook and and
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.960]   You know instagram and other places
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:28.080]   Um, and so it might just I think it runs the risk of becoming just another marketing platform
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:33.600]   And if that's what it is where you're basically just seeing the same stuff that you would see if you follow them on on instagram or
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.360]   YouTube or wherever
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:40.080]   Um, I don't know if it's actually going to have any value and I don't know if users are actually going to engage with it
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.360]   Because at that point it's basically just ping and we know what happened to ping
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:49.280]   I think some people were also unclear because I think they said that you could go from connect and share stuff out
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:54.400]   But some people were assuming that all the facebook and twitter stuff would also come in and it just seemed like no one really knew
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.080]   What it was going to be uh, right?
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.880]   You can share out, but it's not going to pull in the other stuff
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:03.120]   So if you wanted to actually post you'd have to you'd have to post to multiple places at the same time
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:08.320]   Which you know, frankly, plenty of musicians they have their people, you know, if they have a team to do that
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:13.120]   You know, it's not like they're all individually posted to google plus every time they update something they they have
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:19.360]   They're they're purposely having someone, you know, make that decision to publish there too. So, um, I think that'll be
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:24.400]   The big thing though is we'll see if they just start to to share the same content that they're sharing other places
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:28.720]   Or if they actually want to take it a destination for for original content
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:35.040]   And I think apple actually kind of has a responsibility to make a service like connect part of this because
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.520]   Intentionally or not to various degrees
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:43.920]   If the goal is to make sure that people are never going to leave an apple app in order to get music the way that they want to get it
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:48.320]   It makes people less likely to leave them the the the music app
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:54.080]   To get outside music so it seems as though it's they almost have an obligation to make sure that people who are not necessarily
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:26:03.440]   The holders of really huge studio deals have the ability to release place music in a place where apple and iphone users are going to be able to see it
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:09.440]   Uh, do you is is it really in their best long-term interest though to support something like connect though?
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.680]   Renate tell me about that
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:16.880]   I was sort of really interested and I know I know itunes is horrible and there's all sorts of legacy and
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.520]   Portability reasons and self-evident
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.120]   Yeah, so that being said, uh, I think when jimmy
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:28.960]   I've I said that they were trying to make one single thought around music he was being sincere and I think a lot of times when apple speaks
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:34.160]   They are really sincere about that and people have complained that it's it's complicated the new music app is complicated
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.520]   I'm sure music in itunes is going to be even more complicated
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:43.440]   But they have this advantage of being able to put this app on the screen of hundreds of millions of devices all at once
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:48.480]   And right now we do have a very fragmented experience some of us have itunes music some of us have google music
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:55.040]   Some of us have spotify subscriptions or arty or pandora or slack or an on and on and on and you're always jumping around and for me
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:27:01.680]   It's almost like not quite but it's almost like that experience of going to iOS 8 where everything I used to hunt around and peck and choose for
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:09.840]   The suddenly just available to me in one place and it does cause a little bit of friction and there will be limitations and collisions and things that aren't intuitive at first
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.560]   But the ability to have all these different types of music from what I've bought in my collection
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:18.800]   To what I can stream from the iTunes collection to what zane low and the rest are are
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:24.080]   DJing on beats radio to everything that's in connect all in one place
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:28.640]   And with the mini play area, it's really easy to control that and move around and do a lot of things
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:32.720]   It almost becomes its own little environment and that makes it incredibly powerful to me
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:38.480]   It's it's almost that old apple adage of we have that you know that one that one shot and it has to be the bay bruise shot
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:44.160]   They're putting all their wood behind it being this one seamless experience and if part of that is broken, maybe it won't work
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.600]   So it's like a gamble, but I think certainly compared to what we've seen from other people
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:53.520]   It's it's worth a shot from them at this point. Yeah, I really feel like this is I really feel like this is the first time that they have
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:59.440]   Taken a passion approach to music since they realized that the motor roller rocker was a bad idea and they had
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:05.200]   Their own hands. It's nice to see that they're not just simply they just tossed this project to somewhere because we need one of those as well
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:11.920]   That's definitely the the approach I got. I'm sorry. I was interrupting though. Uh, Cali was that you? Yeah, it was I just wanted to say that
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.200]   At least on the upside they're giving it away right now
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:20.320]   So it's not like you're paying for something from the get-go and if there are rough edges
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:25.840]   You know, um people have as as in fact itunes itself has taught us
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:30.960]   Um anything that wants any amount of money from you for any reason
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.880]   Must be absolute perfection or it's utter crap
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:44.480]   There is no middle ground according to the reviews in the itunes store. So, um, I I really like that they're giving away for free and it sort of feels like
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:48.080]   Maybe it's maybe it's a little bit beta
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:53.360]   And there may be some there may be some some rough spots like once I update my phone and I'm able to start using it
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:57.360]   It might end up being a little odd, but at the same time if it's free
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:02.960]   I'm not gonna worry about it too much and I'm willing to cut them an awful lot of slack as long as they're not charging me for anything
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:07.760]   So, um if it turns out to be something really well, this would be the one that I would pay for
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:15.520]   Um, I actually don't pay for a streaming service now. I am apparently not the young people who don't buy CDs
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:20.240]   So I do I I will like I keep finding out like people are like
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:26.640]   You know, I'm really excited about this new thing that came out and I went and bought it and be what like not in itunes?
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.040]   Like yeah
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:35.440]   Well, and it you know, I I love CDs. I love the import version. I love
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:39.040]   Um opening up the little booklet and reading all the stuff that's in it
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:46.720]   Um, I was actually a little bit sad when everything went to CDs. I do remember records and the books were a lot bigger and you could get a lot more cool stuff in them
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.400]   um
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.400]   So to me
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:55.280]   Like looking at something like spotify, which I don't have ultimate control over my playlist
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.760]   Um, you know, at least for free
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.400]   Uh, you know to me that doesn't hold a lot of appeal and pandora never really held a lot of appeal
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:09.680]   And it's only in the itunes radio stations that have ended up over time being very well trained
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:14.480]   Um, thanks to the fact that I actually can do that on any device that i'm using
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.960]   that has been
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:21.200]   Probably the best listening experience i've had but I still am not paying for any of them
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.600]   So if this one was actually
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.880]   Actually turns out to be something really useful and very interesting
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:31.760]   This is the thing I would listen to in the car and you know, maybe even not my own playlist
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.680]   Just put on whatever's on beats one at the time and see what the radio
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:39.600]   Air quote radio has uh for me when i'm headed someplace
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:46.080]   Yeah, yeah, that was what eddy said to me, um, you know talking about how like I and I wrote about this a little bit my piece
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:50.960]   I don't think that their goal right now anyway is to like steal the way the people that are already subscribing to already
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:56.400]   Or spotify or whatever. I think that they're really kind of going after the much bigger audience who doesn't pay for anything at all
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.080]   And and I agree with you kelly
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:02.880]   I think that having a free trial, you know three months free gives them a lot of of room to do that
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:08.160]   It does two things one, you know, it lets them work out, you know, the kinks and and I think the underlying product is really solid
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.400]   But I think that obviously they're going to be issues with you
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:15.920]   It's when the sinking stuff and some of the cloud stuff and and obviously they'll need to get the the radio and some of the other features, you know
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:21.840]   Working correctly, but um so so doing that while you know the product is is free
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:26.560]   I think um gives them a lot of goodwill that they wouldn't have if they launched it fully formed
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:30.160]   Um or rather charging fully and it didn't feel fully forms
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.560]   But but I also think that you know, like
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:36.160]   I get the distinct feeling that they are trying to do exactly what you're saying
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:41.120]   Like they're trying to go after people who haven't really had a reason to pay for music like I have had
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:47.200]   Let's see. I had a streaming music subscription service. I think before iTunes even was on Windows
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.480]   If I'm if I'm thinking correctly, I had a rhapsody account
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:56.240]   I think it was even before real bought them in 2002 or 2003 and that was before the iTunes store even hit windows
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:01.360]   And um that was like $10 a month and it had you know, I think maybe like a like a you know
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.960]   Three or 400,000 song library and then it eventually got got bigger and bigger
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.160]   Um, I've been a Spotify subscriber since gosh
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.560]   Um, they came to the us in 2011
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.480]   But I I've been with them. I think since 2009 or something
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:17.200]   Thanks. Um, um, I was Spotify Sweden guys
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.440]   um and um
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:24.880]   I I've dabbled with rdo and and and the other services too. I even remember the beats music precursor, which was mogg
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.320]   Um
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:31.440]   And so I'm the weird person that pays for these services that always has and then then I still buy music too
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.080]   But I I buy everything I'm like a a media
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:37.200]   Hoarder and and whore and and I just I buy too much
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.160]   Um digital stuff and physical stuff for that matter
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.840]   But um, I think for the people who aren't like me the majority
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.560]   This is kind of what they're trying to do. They're trying to say, okay
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:51.440]   Um, we can give you an experience that will make it easy for you to listen to anything you want
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:55.920]   Have access to all the things you've purchased before and then we're also going to help you discover new music
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:03.200]   And give you kind of a lean back a lean listen, um experience and um that I think that their target audience there is a lot
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.160]   Larger than the you know 20 million people that pay for spotify
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:12.240]   Um, which which it's great, but I feel like I mean eddy said he didn't he didn't use these terms exactly
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.240]   But his term was basically like, you know, look we we can you know still do really well
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:20.720]   You know, we don't have to we don't have to steal from them for us to still win
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.840]   You know kind of kind of a play on you know, seashobs as you know, like apple
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.320]   You know for for apple to win microsoft doesn't have to lose
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:30.240]   Um, and and so I think that there's it's there's a broad enough
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:35.520]   Sector of people who just don't pay at all that they can they can capture some of that they can capture
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:40.960]   You know a significant portion or even a small portion of that audience. Um, they have a real shot and and
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:48.880]   Eventually what might happen is some people might you know, migrate over from spotify or whatever and some people might not for for me
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.720]   What I anticipate happening is that I will be paying for apple music
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:58.640]   And I will be paying for spotify side by side for a long time until I can figure out if I can get rid of spotify
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:02.240]   But I do very much anticipate paying for apple music just because I like
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:09.200]   The experience of having the last 12 years of my purchases living alongside, you know, my my streaming all-acart stuff
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.440]   Like for me, that's that's worth the $10 a month
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:16.880]   I'm really glad to see that apple has not oftentimes when apple introduces a new product or service
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:21.600]   Be it's seria or apple news part of it is to make the iphone or make something that they sell
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:27.360]   That much more valuable and give make that a value add that's exclusive to uh to ios or to macos
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:31.680]   And apple music is certainly the most acumenical product that apple is making
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:36.400]   Because at least by until the end of the at the end of the year when everything is all all said and done
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:43.040]   You will be able to get access to apple music on mac on ios on windows and android app is coming in a few months
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:46.480]   And so my usual worry is about
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:51.200]   Liking beats one so much that I feel as though i'm going to have to buy something
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:56.400]   I don't want to buy just to get this one product that i really really like and have to do with one or the other
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.560]   When apple is simply saying no no
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:04.400]   Will we we we don't approve of the fact you carry an android phone, but we will not punish you for carrying an android phone
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.520]   uh
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.520]   And that really does point to
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:14.400]   How important this service is to apple if if all they were trying to do was to get into the music game and to make the iphone more valuable
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.480]   They certainly wouldn't be quite that open
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.880]   Um, I think we do want to talk about uh, i'm sorry
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:25.680]   I want to ask rene what christian gave a good discussion about what what what it would take for her to become a for real
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:31.680]   subscriber i've been thinking about that myself the difference between being a journalist subscriber meaning i will pay
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:35.760]   10 dollars a month just so that i can continue to to write about about apple music
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.600]   the
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:41.360]   Beats one really made a good impression. I've just started to dive into the ios apple
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:44.240]   We're going to be talking about the ios apps in a bit
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:49.360]   And i'm always i'm already grateful for features that i've been begging for for several years
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:53.280]   So I actually do think that i might be become a regular subscriber
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:58.800]   In three months time or at the very least i will not i've set a reminder to remind me to cancel in three months
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.880]   If i don't want to actually keep on going that that might not just be i forgot to do it
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:05.840]   It might be an actual active active active will to do
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.640]   Uh, rene, what what do you think we are? Where are you right now?
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:13.280]   Well, it is first and you can go into if you click the little account tab you can go in and turn off auto
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.240]   Uh renewal if you don't want it to automatically switch to the paid account
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:20.080]   Um, so you don't have to set the reminder you can do it immediately and and get it off yourself
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:21.840]   Uh, but for me
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:25.120]   It's actually really interesting because i like i said i don't want a big music listener
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:29.920]   I listen to music when i'm in the car sometimes when it's on and other establishments like at a coffee shop or something
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:34.160]   But i don't go out of my way to listen to music because i'm typically watching some sort of video somewhere
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:39.920]   But i like the idea that it's integrated and i like the idea that it's easy and those are the two huge wins for me
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:46.080]   Uh, this happens to me with with video too is that phenomena where you're trying to find something to watch and you have this dvd collection
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:50.960]   Or you have this or you have the netflix queue and you just look at it and and you're paralyzed
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.560]   Sort of you don't i don't want to watch this that's boring
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:57.040]   I just saw this but then you flip on cable tv and a movie is playing and it's got ads and it's
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:01.200]   It's pan and scan but you just watch it because it's on and you don't have to decide
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:07.440]   And i got that immediate feeling from apple music that i can find almost anything i want if i hear it snip it and want to hear it
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:12.160]   But there's also just this ambient music always playing and it's really engaging personality
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:18.240]   Which to me i found missing in a lot of the other services there was just nothing human to connect to no no pun intended
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.840]   And for me
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:23.440]   Whether that ends up being worth ten dollars a month i don't know i'm not sure how much i'll listen to it
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:28.000]   But if they can provide me with sort of music on demand not just music i want to listen to
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.320]   But music i never knew i wanted to listen to and it's always available and interesting and engaging and has that sort of humanity about it
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.560]   Then i might easily pay the ten dollars
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:44.240]   Yeah, well again if if if it breaks people's habits again i'm not a radio listener i'm not even necessarily a streaming music listener
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.640]   My entertainment from music comes from
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.800]   I have fun
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:54.880]   Sitting like you know cross-legged on the sofa with all my CDs around me and building a playlist and making the perfect
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:38:00.720]   Top 10 playlists and that's where all my fun comes so if it changes people's habits just make them into a radio listener
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.040]   That's a pretty big win. Oh
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:08.640]   Andy before um just before he moved i there's a bunch of people asking this so a lot of people are getting an i-cloud music library error
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:14.480]   When they're starting off that's kind of the new name for itines match and if you're getting that just go to settings and keep toggling it
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:19.760]   And it will eventually work and if you're seeing weird things that say fuse dot something string blah blah blah
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:25.120]   Fuse is just the codename for apple music and it means there's some sort of error in your localization and you can ignore that
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:27.760]   They will tidy that the little elves will tidy that up as you're sleeping
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:30.960]   So those are the big two questions and they're pretty easy as well
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:37.760]   Yeah, I mean there are gonna be some growing pains and we haven't even talked about the apple music app itself and what what it's like to integrate with your own library
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.800]   uh christina you had a really great article that
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:49.600]   On a good walkthrough of what all that experience was like uh my my own first impressions were really i i really just i'm just a dog who just wants a cookie
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:53.440]   And i wanted i really it's just like i'm happy that the joke
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.440]   Exactly
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:00.720]   It's like i'm just so happy that they gave me the ability to like do like a little on the spot queue of what's going to be up next
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:05.440]   What i what i want to hear next i'm glad they finally gave me a mini player and i'm glad they finally fixed search and
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.200]   Apart from that they give me two bacon treats and i'm good
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:09.760]   uh
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:16.480]   Christine what but how easy is it gonna be gonna be for people after they install the 8.4 update and take off from there do you think
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:20.640]   Yeah, I mean I think it's easy. I mean I think that the the thing that the for use section
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:24.240]   Which is how it kind of customizes what it will show you for your for your recommendations
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:29.040]   They they took direct like from from beats music and it's a really fun way of kind of customizing
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:33.520]   What types of music you like, you know you tap on bubbles and and the more you tap on thing
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:39.280]   You know the the the bigger the bubble gets and it'll it'll sort of populate suggestions based on
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:43.200]   That also you're listening history and frankly what's in your iTunes library
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:50.080]   And this is where having a really big iTunes library and having used a service for a long long time really comes in handy because
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.760]   When I opened up apple music for the first time the for use section
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:40:01.840]   I was given you know Taylor swift and stephen stevens and um, you know vampire weekend and and dapper cutie and like you know and
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:08.640]   Miguel and like uh, you know, uh the kinks music that I love but that I probably wouldn't see in
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.680]   Uh more, I guess typical streaming service
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:17.040]   But it knows that I like all those things because it knows that I have had that music or music like that in my library
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:21.680]   Um my music section is you know where all of your current songs exist
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:26.080]   So if you are, uh, you know all of your current purchases and if you're an iTunes match subscriber
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.320]   All of your matched songs live there
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:32.480]   Uh one clarification for people who have been asking if you already subscribed to iTunes match
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:38.000]   You can cancel your iTunes match subscription if you want to subscribe to apple music the services are complementary
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.080]   They're very similar, but they're not the same
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:43.840]   What that means is that how iTunes match works is that if you cancel iTunes match
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:48.480]   All of that match content still exists in the cloud and you can still kind of access it
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:53.760]   And you just can't add new stuff with apple music if you stop subscribing to apple music anything
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:58.000]   You've matched and have uploaded and that it's you know created like that the high quality versions against
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:02.080]   That will go away if you're not also, you know paying for for apple music
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:05.280]   So conceivably you can pay for apple music and iTunes match
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:10.400]   But most people if your nichon's match user and you like apple music you can just save the 25 bucks a year
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:13.840]   And just uh just to get rid of that um when your renewal point comes up
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.760]   Um, but you know, it shows you your library and it shows all of your you know
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:23.280]   Artists and albums that are there as well as your playlists, but what what we were saying before but I love
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:27.280]   Oh, and they fixed search like you like you mentioned search just finally fixed and there's a mini player
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:30.400]   Um is that your life exactly? It's great
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:37.360]   Um is that your library now consists of both your local and your purchase files as well as anything you've added from their catalog
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.400]   So it all sits together in one place and there's not really differentiation
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.720]   It's like, you know, whether I bought an album
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:47.440]   Or I uploaded it or I've added it from apple music. It's in my library regardless
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.160]   And and that uh takes away
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:55.280]   Uh one of the biggest pain points that I think most streaming services have google music being one of the exceptions
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:42:00.720]   But obviously if you're in the apple ecosystem, we haven't had the opportunity to have all of your music live in one place
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:07.120]   Um, and so that makes it really handy and what i'm so cool about that is you can create playlists with songs from either place
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:11.440]   And um what's cool about that is that if you have a song that's only available
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:15.360]   You know that you bought or that you uploaded it can sit alongside
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:20.800]   You know songs that you didn't purchase but are part of apple music and you can still share that playlist with someone
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:25.120]   Um, if they had the track they can listen to it if not, you know, it just will show up great out
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.640]   Um, but you know putting all the music in one place is really cool
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:33.280]   But but for me the real like heart and soul of the experience is that for use section
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:39.040]   Which the more you use it the better it gets and even just using it over the course of you know, like, you know 24 hours
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:44.400]   Um, I've seen it get better with its recommendations and with the stuff that it's showing to me, you know
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:49.760]   Like I'm saying refresh on it now and it's showing me, you know behind the boards with with dallas austin
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   Who's who's an atlanta? Um hip hop producer who's done stuff for you know back in the day tlc and madonna
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.560]   I haven't thought about dallas austin in years, but um actually um being from atlanta. I like that sort of thing
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:09.120]   There's an intro to kanye west playlist. I've got um some stuff where like we're giving you recommended albums
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:13.600]   I'm getting pavement to park the shins keen the white stripes and naz
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:18.560]   And that's perfect for the source of music that I like to listen to and I and you know
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:24.960]   I I haven't listened to illiamatic in a long time. Um, but it's right there and I can press tap and press play
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:31.040]   Uh the new feature which is which is right next to for you is basically where apple like if for you is all about
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:33.200]   giving you customized um
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:39.760]   A look at what you should be listening to and maybe uncovering music that you might like new is all about kind of apples
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:45.200]   editorial vision of their music expert saying this is the new stuff and this is stuff that you should pay attention to so
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:49.840]   It has both the new releases of the week hot tracks recent releases top songs
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:57.280]   Um, but it also um, you know, you kind of can go into their their music editors pick where they have different music editors who
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:03.040]   Will curate and you know entire genres. So if you go into the um classic rock
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.480]   section
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:08.560]   Um, you can see the different playlists that the classic rock uh curator has created
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:14.000]   But right now for instance they've got albums you need to hear which includes you know the monstant of years from from new yong
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:20.560]   and um, uh promise of the uh, uh, uh, real it's got you know the rolling stones acdc
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:29.840]   Um, they've got a whole section on a spotlight on the grateful dead to kind of you know commemorate that the the 50th anniversary of the band and their their final concerts
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:32.320]   and um
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:33.680]   so
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:37.120]   You can get really deep into that sort of stuff and um
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:43.120]   They've got that for all these different genres and then they're also showing like, uh, I guess like playlists for activities
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:46.880]   Which is similar to what songs it does if i'm being honest, I think songs is still as better
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:52.960]   But um in terms of you know like playlists, you know for like your morning jog or you know playlists for up in the morning and that sort of thing
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:58.480]   And then they have um, you know curators, uh, you know, uh music outlets like rolling stone and pitchfork
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:03.520]   Um who are creating playlists of music that people think you should hear
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.640]   Um, and then there's the radio tab which we've talked a lot about
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:16.640]   Yeah, I mean for me. I I like recommendations, but for me, uh, just the basic usability of the player has always been just so sorely wanting
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:23.360]   Um, it's it's one of the things that has made me a happy android, uh, phone user the fact that there's such a such a vibrant
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:29.840]   Category of music player apps just just a simple fact that this uh, the new a point for a version of the uh, uh,
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.440]   Uh, ios music player
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:37.680]   Makes it very very easy to tell at a glance that here is a file that is there's a music file that's on the device itself and does not require an
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:41.520]   Internet connection to play versus how many times i left the house like with a playlist
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:45.040]   I think i'm gonna be listening to right take my walk and then nope, sorry
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:50.400]   18 of these 23 tracks are actually in the clouds. Sorry. I guess we should have told you that before you were before you left the house
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:57.840]   I mean, i'm just totally yeah, i mean i was breaking news and the uh, Ian has announced that that they've handed off to julia nuga live from london
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:03.440]   Yes
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.440]   It's like it's like falling in an animal torch
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:08.000]   It's like it's like falling the limping torch around the planet
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.760]   We are going like time zone to time zone to time zone and actually now that
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:18.720]   Uh, we laugh but that actually makes that actually makes me wonder if you're gonna be if you like one dj
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:21.840]   But not necessarily another like if you're a big fan of zane low
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:26.560]   But you don't know two of these other people and maybe they don't you don't like their taste in music
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:30.800]   Does that mean that this the this service only lasts for like three hours a day for you?
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.840]   Yeah
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:35.840]   That means
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:39.200]   We know there's gonna be any replays, uh, like i know they're playing the same songs again
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:43.120]   But is it actually going to be people 24 hours a day where they're going to be replays of the shows
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:48.160]   They will do some content some of the content will be reused for the weekends from what i understand
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:50.720]   And they'll be doing some of the interview sections and other things so some
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.880]   M&M
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:54.880]   M&M
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:47:00.480]   Well, like they'll be replaying that m&m, um, you know like like interview at other times
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:05.120]   They'll be able to repurpose that but no, it's live. I mean, um, uh, when when I talked to them at WWDC
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.960]   They said that the playlist they might make playlists available of what sets were on for a certain day
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:15.440]   But you would miss any of the live stuff that happens. So I mean they're kind of treating this like a live show, you know, I mean and and kind of you know
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:18.640]   similar to just um, you know the the case of your W's and um
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:23.440]   K exp of the world I guess where you know like if you miss it you miss it um and and you know
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:28.480]   Case of your W and some of those stations have done a good job of creating podcasts of the live experience
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:34.400]   From what I understand apple is not interested in doing that. I would be interested to see if maybe down the line that changes
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:38.880]   I think right now they're really trying to build the appeal and the novelty of people tuning in live
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.520]   Yeah, they they also have a presence on tumblr
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:44.960]   They have a presence outside of this service and a lot of different places you can experience it
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.960]   We do know we do do need to go to a break
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:50.320]   But a couple of last things about uh, apple music before we go
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:54.080]   Uh, we didn't mention that one of the cool things about beats one is that you like a song
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:58.320]   Go inside the app and simply add it to your collection and if you're a subscriber, you've got it in your collection
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:02.080]   Uh, they have some exclusives now. Uh, farra williams broke a new track
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:06.320]   Interestingly enough you could not add that track to your collection as it was playing
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:10.080]   So maybe there's some some are in that in that house and some are not
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:16.480]   Uh, you cannot add uh, beetles tracks as part of this apparently, uh, it's still uh sold to the store
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:21.600]   You can still get through iCloud match, but you your subscription apparently does not include access to the beals catalog
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:25.120]   That's uh according to ac dc and dray andy
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.840]   Well, yeah, it's gonna stay the chronic is there
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:32.640]   You got the dc, uh, also also, uh, the 1989 album
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:37.360]   Also part of the part of the collection so we managed to solve that crisis, uh, nice and quickly
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:39.680]   Um, our long national nightmares over
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:46.560]   Do not do not pull the tail of that particular drag and she is lights. She has talented
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:49.760]   She is entertaining, but she is also quite quite powerful
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:56.720]   Um one question that still hasn't been answered. Um, rene do you have any news about whether saunas is going to be working with this new system
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:58.960]   I've heard conflicting information
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:01.120]   One what includes licensing agreements
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:06.000]   Sonos marketing said that they would have it by the end of the year and Ian roger said that it would be their a sap
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.160]   Which is pretty much when I think everyone expected it to be there because it can't be there sooner than it could possibly be there
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:13.040]   So yeah, we just have to wait and hold and um
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:15.280]   Yeah, I mean sonos is interesting
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:19.920]   There was this whole thing but they don't support airplay and then maybe they don't have multi-room rights and all these stuff is just so unbelievably
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:25.840]   Hard to negotiate especially internationally that I don't even want to think about having a job that's anything like theirs
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.640]   But uh, hopefully we'll get it sooner rather than later
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:34.080]   Yeah, the air airplay we we talk about uh, we we talk about technical limitations
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:37.520]   But oftentimes the reason why there isn't a feature on a device that makes absolute
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:43.200]   Ironclad sense is because somewhere there is some line in some deal that says you are not allowed to do something
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:47.280]   That's called that that amounts to rebroadcasting or allows the same content to be broadcast
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:50.000]   And explains it to me very patiently
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.080]   Yep, and that's and that's how that works. So
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:56.400]   Uh, we will be right back with after this message. We've got uh, ranny richy
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:50:00.000]   Of course we've got chrisina warren from mashable and we have got kelly gynont
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.520]   Uh, we have a murderous row of uh of commentators
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:07.680]   We come back. We'll be talking about apple social consciousness consciousness
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:14.800]   And their desire of late to make sure they flex those muscles but after the after this message from our vacationing leola port
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:17.680]   I am really thrilled to welcome
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:22.240]   Uh, this new advertiser to mac break weekly, but I have oh, hi leo here
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:25.120]   I'm just jumping in you know, you don't mind
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:31.200]   Um, I have I have to say one thing about this normally when we do uh an advertiser
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:37.600]   On the show. It's because I use them and recommend them. I don't use wealth front. I can't
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:44.480]   I want to use one front. I'm dying to use the wealth front, but security regulations prevent me
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.720]   because
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:50.880]   Companies that do what wealth front does which is invest your money to make you money
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:53.440]   Are not allowed to use
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:56.880]   client testimonials and this would be considered a client testimonial so
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:02.320]   I was I was so ready to sign up for this and they said well leo you can't
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.560]   because
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:06.560]   Then it would be a client testimonial
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:12.880]   Uh, but let me tell you about wealth front because this is something you ought to know about and i've done a lot of reading over time
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:20.320]   Uh about investing about the best ways to invest i've read some really powerful books that have highly influenced
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.160]   my investment
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:26.480]   theory and policy and it put this is particularly important when you're investing for the long haul for your retirement
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:28.880]   uh for the long-term investment
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:34.240]   And for years, I've been you know trying to do this sometimes better sometimes not
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:40.320]   Uh, you know index funds very carefully managing the amount of money that's spent to manage it even doing some
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:46.160]   Uh selling and buying for tax benefit and then I found about wealth front and they do this all automatically
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.640]   They do it beautifully
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:56.160]   And they do it for the lowest fee i've ever seen a traditional advisor's human advisors these guys are not human i'll explain what I mean in a second
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:52:01.920]   Traditional advisors charge giant fees. I mean we're talking 1% 2% as much as 3%
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:05.360]   Of the money you have on our management if you go to somebody to manage your money
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:10.560]   And then there's also that's just what they charge you there's hidden fees and charges for the transactions
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:14.800]   Uh and changes and so forth wealth front makes it so easy
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:18.720]   For you for me for anyone to access world class
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:22.320]   I mean the kind of long-term investment management
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:25.920]   The big guys have the millionaires the billionaires have

[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:05.040]   Uh wealthfront automatically rebalances your portfolio. This is absolutely critical and one of the things I always forget to do
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:09.200]   Reinvest your dividends and this is commission free
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.760]   Commission
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:15.440]   Free that it is software based it is brilliant
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:18.960]   Um, as we as we keep doing these ads
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:26.000]   I don't want to take up too much time here, but I'll tell you a little bit more about the people behind this and why I totally trust them
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   And I want so badly to do this
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.200]   It's transparent. It's accessible. You can look at your accounts in one place
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:34.080]   You can see exactly what's happening what your trends are
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:36.640]   What your what your gains have been?
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:42.320]   You see every trade they make on your behalf right there on the dashboard either on the desktop or on their mobile app
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:44.800]   And they're doing things
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:48.400]   That are fairly sophisticated taxed something called tax loss harvesting
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:51.200]   and direct indexing
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:54.400]   And that's going to optimize your after tax returns
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:58.160]   And lower your tax bill and this is all really good stuff
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:03.760]   Now you remember I said that sometimes an investor advisor could charge one two even up to 3%
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:06.720]   the cost for wealth front
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:11.120]   And this is the only cost ever one quarter of one percent a year
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:16.240]   25 basis points. There's no commission. There are no hidden fees
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:21.360]   That's less than five dollars a month if you're managing on account worth thirty thousand dollars
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:24.480]   And there are no additional charges. That's it
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:28.160]   one quarter of one percent per year
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:33.680]   That's why uh, they have now two point four billion dollars in client assets
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:36.560]   Uh, and they have grown
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:38.800]   20 times
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:47.040]   20 times growth over the past two years for compliance purposes. I have to tell you wealth front incorporated is an scc registered investment advisor

[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:19.520]   Does he not?
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:24.720]   You can almost smell the cocoa butter coming in through the skype connection or at least I could maybe it's just because I
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:28.960]   Had a almond joy bar just before the show anyway, that's neither here nor there
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:35.440]   Uh big week last year last week here in the united states as as the supreme court handed down a couple of pretty big decisions
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:40.640]   Uh, one of them was to affirm marriage rights to all americans yay, hey
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:43.840]   and also in response to
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:46.880]   Some rather ratchet ratchet ragic events
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:53.520]   We have finally realized that perhaps it is about darn time to stop flying the confederate battle flag
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:58.080]   Above state capitals and maybe it's even time for amazon and other stores like that
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:00.800]   To even stop selling those things
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:06.880]   Tim cook has been on twitter in response to a lot of these different lot of these different things
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:08.480]   he
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:10.240]   After the supreme court decision he
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:14.880]   tweeted out the famous apple line the people who are crazy enough to think they could change the world are the ones that do
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:19.360]   And followed by state marks of victory for equality perseverance and love
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:22.720]   And then in response to the south carolina shootings
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:25.840]   He said my thoughts are with the victims family in south carolina
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.720]   Less honor their lives by eradicating racism and removing the symbols and words that feed it
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:37.040]   Which weren't just idle words on twitter because uh apple soon thereafter
[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:44.240]   Started taking down any ios apps that featured the confederate battle flag and its icons and its
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:47.040]   In its screenshots and other things
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:51.840]   Which caused a little bit of a kerfuffle because it wasn't just people who were just using it the way they
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:57.360]   Sticking on the hood of the general lee car on dukes a hazard, but also there are a lot of educational
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:01.840]   Games and educational programs teaching people about the civil war that got pulled down
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:05.680]   uh rene is that a bit of a tempest in a teapot when do we agree
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:08.000]   Yeah, I mean
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:13.280]   First it's really the way that you phrase that was so perfect because it does show the difference in the modern era of apple where tim
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:18.320]   Sorry, steve jobs was really it just works and he believed it was inelegant to talk about social things
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:21.920]   You would do that privately and he was a big supporter of all these causes privately
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:24.400]   But he didn't want apple to get credit for doing it
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:31.600]   He thought you should just do this stuff where tim cook really is we believe and he believes that using apple as a moral entity as being part
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.920]   Of equality movements and civil rights
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:38.960]   Is almost like a duty it's something that they've been gifted with all this power and wealth and if they can help
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:45.280]   Bring collect a few manity into the light then they have a moral imperative to do it and the confederate flag thing
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:49.840]   I'm a Canadian. So I don't know if that means it's easier or harder for me to speak about the confederate flag
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:52.240]   And I do realize that i'm ignorant about a lot of it
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:55.520]   I have seen the explainers saying that the history is not what people think it is
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:59:00.800]   Uh, but what stood out for me was john steward when he was unable to give his monologue a few
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:02.480]   I think it was like about a week ago
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:06.320]   And he said that people in the us are forced to drive on streets named
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:12.560]   After people who wanted to keep them slaves and look up and and see flags for people who wanted to keep them slaves
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:17.760]   And I think we've all in our lives regardless of who we are had moments where we've felt less than or
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:22.560]   Singled out or not chosen or abused or disadvantaged
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:27.760]   Or discriminated against in some way and if you it's the same thing with with with feminism
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:32.000]   You expand that into the scope of large swaths of humanity the weight of it
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   Sort of becomes crushing and you get this moment of empathy and enlightenment
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:42.400]   And there is some criticism about how apple goes about these things they tend to take an axe to it and not a scalpel
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:44.640]   And I forget who wrote that line, but it was a really good line
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:50.160]   But there's a very sound psychological principle called decluttering where in order to affect change
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:53.760]   If you want to get rid of all the old clothes in your wardrobe if you want to clean out your kitchen
[00:59:53.760 --> 01:00:00.000]   It doesn't work to just start looking through it and trying to evaluate it and throw things out piece by piece because you never really finish
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.280]   What works is you take everything out and you put it in a big pile
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:07.840]   And then you carefully put back the things that are of great value or importance or our exceptions
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:10.800]   To the cleansing that you're doing and that's traditionally been
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:16.160]   Given all the legacy technology and the way that itunes works and things that we don't need to go into now
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:21.920]   But there's a lot of technical and and good reasons for doing things the way that they do them and they are galling
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:24.400]   And they do affect some people who have legitimate apps
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:28.000]   But you know what those people can be affected for a little while i'm hugely sympathetic
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.080]   To the cost incurred on developers and the stress and anxiety
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:35.360]   But it's fairly insignificant compared to the long historic
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:41.200]   Damage that this kind of material has been doing and some people thought that it devalues games that apple doesn't treat games
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:45.440]   With the same sort of seriousness that they treat documentaries or films or tv shows
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:50.480]   But they're actually treating them with much more importance because they're interactive and you're not watching a documentary
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.720]   You're choosing to play as a confederate soldier
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:57.600]   Which is sort of different than a world war two game when you're sort of marching people into incinerators
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:02.880]   There's there's a much more visceral connection to that stuff and if they are going to air they're going to air on the side of removing
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:09.440]   Absolutely everything and then super carefully putting it back. So tempos in the teapot. Yes, I understand people are going to react that way
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:13.920]   Especially people who have made really great historical content and and value it
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.280]   but
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:19.680]   The way you place on that just has to be weighed against the the the history and the culture
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:24.800]   And I think anyone with an ounce of compassion will see that this is a this is a very small
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:29.200]   Drop in the bucket of what's been happening. Yeah, you kind of hope that apple is
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:35.040]   That apple is going to be a little bit cautious with this because it's very easy to be very to be repulsed by
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:41.920]   surface actions there was remember that there was a game a few years ago a first person shooter that was set in the
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.960]   Dallas schoolbook depository building that
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:50.560]   On the surface was you get to be lee harvey auss wall and you get to fire a gun at the present in the united states
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:57.840]   But it was actually highly educational and in many ways highly important because they decided they tried to duplicate the game
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:03.040]   The physics the physics as well as they could they duplicated the terrain as well as they could they deck
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:09.040]   They duplicated the performance of the gun as well as they could and given that there's so many people these days who still believe that lee harvey auss wall
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:11.040]   It could not have possibly been the lone gunman
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:18.080]   It took only about a day for lots of lots of people report that I was not only able to shoot the president in the time allotted
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:20.640]   I was also able to take out the other two people in that car
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:23.920]   But on the surfaces of quite an offensive game
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:28.480]   Kelly and I apologize I have I want to I have I had the wrong note
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:32.160]   Do you ever mispronouncing your name like all through the show because I wrote it down like this
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:34.560]   Uh, and it's kelly gamant
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:37.840]   Yeah, and I'm so maybe maybe it's just that I grew up with a name like an oddco
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:42.960]   So I'm just I just don't believe that the default position is for anybody to ever pronounce a name correctly. I thought it was we mow
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:45.040]   I was all
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:49.280]   You're hiding your frenchness. Don't flip don't put your light under a ballot barrel kelly
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:51.840]   But what do you think?
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:55.520]   All the frenchness so so it's really mr. kelly that that you want to talk to
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.360]   But what do you think about this decision?
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.360]   Was this the right thing for rappled between?
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.440]   Well, it's really kind of a
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:09.040]   Damned if they do and damned if they don't when it comes to this because there are people who are going to be mad that they removed it
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:14.320]   Particularly because like Renee said, um, they basically yanked everything and put it in a pile
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:20.160]   and started walking back the stuff that was maybe the the historical things or the
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:25.200]   educational tools that people were using and that's not the same as
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:32.640]   Having it be a game like you were talking about where you're shooting the president. That's not quite the same situation
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:33.920]   so
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:35.920]   I'm really hoping that um
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:41.520]   This is one of those things where when people realize it's just time to draw a line in the sand that maybe the line is drawn
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:44.960]   And and we can all just move on from that. Um, I
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:52.080]   I was really also struck by the same thing that Renee was struck by in john stewart talking about the the shootings at the church
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:59.520]   Where black people have to drive on these roads that are named after people who wanted to oppress them and own them
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.120]   and I
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:04.640]   I was very it was it was very striking to me that that would be a thing
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:10.880]   so, um, because I don't live in the south and I have not spent a lot of a significant amount of time in the southern us so
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:14.000]   I don't see a whole lot of that that it was a very
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.720]   vivid example of
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.040]   some of the the
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.600]   Unbelievable lack of awareness. I think on some people's part
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.640]   um, how this might feel to someone else
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:31.120]   and I feel like uh, the the compassion is there and this is apple trying to do the right thing and I actually sort of prefer
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:33.760]   the new apple coming out and
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:37.600]   Taking these sort of stances and saying these sorts of things. Um
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.640]   like when uh, tim cook was at the
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:45.040]   Wdc scholarship perception and one of the girls that was there
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:49.520]   Uh, thank him for doing this and he said, oh, I'm gonna do this till my toes point up
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:53.040]   It was in the video that I saw and I I thought it was really great that
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:57.920]   This is something that apple is doing because I feel like this is an example they can lead by
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:03.120]   and um, and this is just another way that apple can sort of prove that they're
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:10.960]   They're a company with a very specific vision and doing things to execute on that and I don't think there's anything at all wrong
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:13.120]   with uh
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:16.400]   Tim making these kind of statements and and being someone who
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:23.520]   Has a comment whatever it may be on some of these issues and even if I did not necessarily agree with him on whatever it was
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:30.640]   I still really appreciate that he's coming out and saying these things that he that he has been saying and making these statements and taking these actions
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:33.120]   And I really appreciate it
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.440]   Yeah, I've always thought that some
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:43.520]   For a long time apple had one sort of message they wanted to say when they were producing an ad and trying to sell something
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:49.840]   But so when they're trying to sell people ipads they're going to talk about freedom and spirit and creativity and how we're all
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:56.080]   One planet of people but then when it comes to well, that would be great if you could back this legislation would be great
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:06:02.320]   If you'd be show create come up with a statement on this issue that reflects society and they would always be very very quiet about that sort of stuff
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:07.120]   And apple senior executives were never the sort of people who would ever speak on anything
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:12.880]   In public that was not directly related to ape to apple and not so carefully curated
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:16.560]   So it's great to see this human side of apple leaking out
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:25.440]   That realizing that's not just something that they do when their desire for social justice intersects with their company interests
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:28.480]   They can just simply put out a simple message that will
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:32.720]   Be so empowering to so many different people
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:38.800]   There was a wonderful picture that was tweeted out that I saw over the weekend that the san francisco pride march where you see of course
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:41.040]   Huge huge huge parade and you see this
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:46.160]   Wave of white shirts that goes on for like two three four blocks
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:51.840]   And the caption explained that these are all apple employees wearing an apple t-shirt for san francisco pride
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:57.120]   And I don't I certainly don't think apple was ever a company that discouraged their employees from
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:59.040]   from
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:01.920]   Living the lives that that they should be leading
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:06.000]   But I could see a while back where they would not be as
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   As interested in making sure that look we are we are part of this community our people are everybody's people
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:18.960]   And one of the things I've always loved about the apple store is that you just to the level of the people that are simply working in these mall stores
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:23.120]   That you do see a great range of diversity. I love the fact that you see these
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:27.600]   Apple geniuses and other people on the floor who are wearing their apple t-shirts
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:31.760]   But they've got like full sleeves tattoos. They've got tattoos their hands and on their necks
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:39.360]   And this is something that would remove them from consideration from a store that sells $10,000 gold watches, but with apple
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:46.000]   It's like nope. It's we are too smart to be distracted by idiocy like judging people for
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.200]   For how they dress for the for their parents or anything like that
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:56.640]   So I think I think it's a I think it's a really great thing and it makes you happier with the amount of money that you're spending at apple
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:00.000]   There's another interesting thing though speaking of games though
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:10.320]   They're also asking developers game developers when they're preparing artwork screenshots for for the app store to blur out or pixelate shot images of guns or any
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.640]   Person-on-person violence
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:14.960]   Which is an interesting move
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.440]   Because when you're talking about
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:21.440]   Getting rid of the confederate battle flag, which is again a
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:23.760]   It's really like a Nazi flag
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:30.800]   There is no way to spin this in a way that you're not saying that this flag is in support of man's brutality humanities brutality against humanity
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:32.800]   Whereas
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:39.120]   There are book covers that feature guns and there are movie posters that feature acts of violence against people celebrate them
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:46.960]   Well, not even celebrate them. I mean an enemy of a murder is uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, iconic movie poster is
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:51.760]   Certainly a representational figure of a dead body. But that's how you basically
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:54.480]   Explain here is the tone of the movie and here's what it's about
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:59.440]   Is it maybe a little bit different to say that we're going to make sure that you can't uh,
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:06.720]   You should not be able to kids who are just browsing the store should not be able to see images of guns people should not see images of violence
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:11.200]   Is that go one step too far or is that just simply another expression of a very consistent?
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:17.840]   Uh, social responsibility Renee so I have yeah, I have really mixed feelings about this and I remember you probably too
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:22.080]   As well guys that you know when they started censoring, um, I should not use that work
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:25.360]   I I take exception with the word censoring because that's typically when an outside party
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:29.680]   Forces change on you with when you exercise editorial discretion
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:33.440]   Uh when they started doing that with cartoons the first pass was just you couldn't understand it
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:36.720]   Looney tunes would come on and the show would make no sense to you and they'd be cutting out
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:40.400]   like like birds smoking cigars and and all sorts of
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:47.200]   Now completely inappropriate humor, but over time they got much better at editing it and digitally removing it and now the shows make sense again
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:54.160]   But the thing for me is um, I live in kabec and you could watch like basic instinct on french tv at nine o'clock and nobody says anything about it
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:55.840]   and and the
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:02.560]   The the weight given to what we want to censor or or editorially cut when it comes to sex is completely different than violence
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:05.920]   So I can't watch game of thrones a lot of the times not because there's sex on it
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:09.760]   But because I find the violence just uh, absolutely dehumanizing and horrible
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:14.640]   And I don't want to subject myself to it and having that kind of stuff in the app store
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:20.560]   And I'll go so far as to say removing confederate flags is great, but there's all sorts of misogyny and other another problematic content
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:25.200]   Uh in the app store that maybe needs to be looked at as well. I don't know but the idea of just
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:32.800]   Um pixelating it. I think doesn't really solve the problem of whether that content should be there and how that content should be represented
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:36.800]   Because that's not an accurate portrayal of what's in there and it feels like almost you're dodging
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:43.280]   The the social consequence of extreme violence by tidying up the poster or the packaging for it
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:50.400]   Maybe don't have screenshots that show those elements or maybe have better restrictions in place so that when people set parental controls
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:56.800]   Those apps not only can't download but can't be shown to you and yes that requires more work on the iTunes back end and whatever
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.800]   So maybe this is a stopgap measure
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:04.640]   Um, but again, I would rather that content not be presented then it sort of just be pixelated or or or smoked over
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:09.920]   Yeah, it's it reminded me the first time I saw it where you see this
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:15.600]   Obvious shot of you know, uh your your basic first person shooter and then you see pixels over
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:20.160]   I immediately thought of et and fbi agents that are suddenly running and holding walkie talkies like this
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:24.320]   Uh leaving walkie talkies threateningly at kids. Yeah, exactly
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:29.120]   Uh, what do you think about this kelly? I mean there's it's it's interesting when you think about that apple is
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:32.560]   Consessed consistently exercised one set of
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:37.280]   As a storekeeper they have the ability to decide what they want to sell
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:42.320]   They have a one set of rules for their for their gaming and their for their app content
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:46.400]   But a much more flexible set of rules for their books and their movies and their tv shows
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:48.880]   Is there is there sort of a disconnect here?
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:53.600]   Yes, I know because uh content wise that's entirely possible
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:54.960]   um
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:59.360]   One of the things that uh that I was when I was thinking about this one of the things that I
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:04.880]   Was wondering about was yeah, what about you know doing this stuff with a movie or with a book?
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:07.040]   but um
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:12.800]   You know if if you have an issue with gun violence and they want to take it an app out of the store that contains guns
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:20.080]   Uh because of the content of it, you know, that's one thing like that's one of the reasons that there are human reviewers in the app store and all that
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:23.120]   um within album like um
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:26.080]   Uh
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:28.800]   Why can't I think of the name of the album but jz's 99 problems?
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:33.520]   I think we can all agree. That's probably not something that you kind of want to expose grade schoolers too
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.760]   That's that that may not be the best example for them
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:37.120]   um
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:38.160]   and
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.520]   And that's just a file so that file is not going to hurt my computer
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:46.720]   So I think that's part of where the flexibility comes from is because the spotlight isn't necessarily shining on that stuff
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:54.240]   Because there's the explicit tag on the music and there's the age restrictions in the itunes store for a lot of stuff
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:13:00.160]   But um, I'm curious where sort of where the spotlight is going to shine next
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:03.600]   Depending on what happens. I think there's um
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.280]   I think
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.120]   This is one of those things that just should have
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:11.280]   been part of the app store in the first place that there shouldn't have been a lot of
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.920]   yay confederate flag kind of stuff
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:18.160]   um for for a lot of reasons and so it it seems like this
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:23.680]   The same sort of thing should be applied to the books and the movies and everything else as well
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:30.160]   um, but then you get into context and you get into um, what exactly are they trying to say and
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:34.800]   Is it just that you want to take this movie out because it's an accurate portrayal of the civil war?
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:39.840]   Maybe you can leave that in even though it was fiction and you know, it turns into a
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:44.080]   Really long and excruciating debate, you know on on every side
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:48.080]   Mostly because uh, you end up with with stuff like this, you know
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:50.800]   We you end up with a lot with a weird line, you know
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:53.200]   We know it when we see it and and that's what needs to go
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:59.920]   And you know that kind of thing but kind of the other thing I was wondering about all of this was people saying oh those poor developers
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:02.400]   Who got their apps pulled from the store?
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:03.840]   um
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:10.320]   I kind of have to wonder unless it's it's one of the like an educational app or an app that's that's relating
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:14.800]   Information about the civil war and things like that. Um, I kind of wonder
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:17.600]   What
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:24.720]   What kind of app would you have put in the app store that would otherwise contain a confederate flag that is now no longer in the app store?
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:26.640]   Hmm
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:31.760]   Yeah, I mean the difficulty is that then this is of course it goes well be a well goes well beyond digital content
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:38.000]   um, there have been discussions about those uh civil war monuments that uh john steward talked about and
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:44.960]   One answer could be to simply pull these monuments down because you're basically honoring someone who was fighting a cause that was not simply misguided
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:47.920]   But there you could make the argument that it was just downright evil
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:51.040]   On the other hand the other argument would be leave it up
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:55.120]   But also have another permanent marker next to it that gives this monument context
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:59.200]   Because it seems like it would be a missed opportunity
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:02.400]   To pretend as though this stuff didn't exist
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:05.200]   Uh and that right and to hide the fact that we were
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:12.160]   Collectively willing to tolerate this for a full century and that there's now a bare spot of earth where we were too embarrassed to leave something standing
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:14.720]   Up there was a you talk about the loony tunes cartoons
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:19.680]   One of the nice one of the one of the best answers that i've seen to the sort of problem
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:26.800]   Is that when one of brothers releases a dvd containing content that contains racist material like a lot of the world war two
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:30.720]   Cartoons there is they don't make any changes to the cartoon whatsoever
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:35.280]   They simply add a non-skippable thing to the beginning that's simply a phrase that simply says
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:39.840]   This is a product of its time. It is horrible essentially it's it's horribly racist
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:46.400]   We feel as though it is right to present this in context rather than to pretend that we never produce this to begin with
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.800]   uh and uh
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:51.200]   On the other hand there are going to be people who are going to be taking
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:53.920]   uh pardon pardon the use of what is a
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:16:00.480]   A very offensive term, but this is the name of the cartoon just to show you there is a cartoon called bugs bunny nips the nips
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:01.760]   and
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:03.760]   depicting uh japanese people
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:11.440]   In a much more you know so not a much more in a downright racist way that when they depicted the Italians and the germans that they didn't do
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:18.320]   It seems as though you need to teach people that this was this was continued considered to be popular entertainment of the time
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:22.080]   If you simply try to snip out those scenes and you know produce a one-minute
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:26.240]   Eight-second cartoon or make sure that you could that's impossible to be seen
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:32.000]   It seems as though you're trying not to talk about that relative of yours that worked for the s s you know
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.520]   Yeah, it's super interesting and it's interesting to me as someone was born in south africa too because I remember in the days of a part
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:40.480]   Side where you couldn't fly south african plains over most countries
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:44.560]   You couldn't uh south african teams couldn't go to new sporting events at some countries
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:49.360]   And that that was starkly different because if you look at the if you look at how you know
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:55.680]   Populations have been treated in north america a lot of the stuff in south africa was modeled on north the north american treatment of native peoples
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:58.400]   And yet the the standard of measure was so different
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:04.000]   Um, but when nelson mandella took power he didn't strip away the spring buck symbols for example
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.480]   Uh, you can watch in viktas. It's a very movie like
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:09.760]   Clint Eastwood movie like rendition of all this but it gives you the idea
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:14.320]   And he was very cognizant of the of the roles of symbolism and in letting people save face
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:18.800]   And slowly sort of walking people into the light and not dropping them in the boiling ocean of light
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:24.720]   Uh because it creates resistance, but I think apps and games are inherently different because it's not legacy content
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:26.720]   It's not something that aired at a certain time
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:34.400]   Uh, and it can be presented in that context is something that's new and fresh and is always uh, always sort of existing
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:38.240]   And it's not like these are civil war apps that used to be appropriate an hour and a longer appropriate
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:40.720]   We're putting this warning up saying it was produced in this time
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:43.120]   this is stuff all being produced now and
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:48.480]   You have to sort of I think treat that a little bit differently because you can't it's a modern context
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:52.960]   No matter what the historical presentation is. So if it's if it's designed to teach you something
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:58.560]   That's great. If it's designed to sort of evoke a feeling of a better time that people want to associate with
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:00.960]   And that gets into that line that kelly
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:03.360]   Mentioned where humans have to make a curated decision
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:09.280]   And that's sort of both the best and worst thing about the app store is there inherent humanism about determining this stuff
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:12.480]   but should apple worry about a
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:16.880]   App or a piece of content that was created in completely good faith
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:23.440]   But which can be misappropriated by a third party and whose purpose can be perverted to other ends
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:26.880]   Should they take a walmart sort of approach and simply say that
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:32.080]   We've decided there's certain types of content that we simply don't want to put on the store shelves and walmart's case
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:35.040]   It is more of a we have a very conservative customer base
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:39.280]   We simply don't want to have content that might offend our conservative customers apple
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:43.920]   It'd be more like we want to respect artistic expression while not creating
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:48.320]   Be coming a sales force for content that can hurt other people
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:51.440]   But how how far do you think apple should think into this
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:53.280]   in order to
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:55.040]   Retain their
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:59.920]   There's their sense of social honor and the stuff that they sell and isn't it interesting too because this is such an american thing
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:02.160]   Because that flag is meaningless to a lot of people around the world
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:07.760]   But they might have a flag that is just as horrific to it might maybe there's some places in the world where the english flag
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:13.280]   Knows all sorts of really different things and an apple is an american company and america's their biggest market
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:18.960]   So it's it's interesting to see but you know china's becoming a huge market at what point do do sort of international
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:24.960]   Sensitivity start to play I think it's an endlessly fascinating and problematic subject and I don't think there's any easy answers
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:26.320]   Yeah
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:30.960]   And I do think that apple's taking the right approach and this is and this is we should say a very typical apple approach
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:33.200]   There's been so many times where apple has
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:37.680]   Basically just pulled up the drawbridge and left a lot of people stranded
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:41.280]   There's there's there are two places two positions for the drawbridge up or down
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:48.080]   And so they will simply pull it up while they decide what find what what kind of finer tune response they want to create
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:54.240]   And we're not talking about content that is offensive. We're talking about should active apps should
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:59.200]   Should apps be able to put active content in the in the notifications bar
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:03.520]   Where they just simply have to put drop down the hammer on everything and then decide what they want to let back in
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:06.640]   So if apple makes one of these really really broad decisions
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:11.440]   It's not that this is the only decision they're going to make you can expect them to continue to think about this and sort of
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:15.520]   meter that approach as they continue to reflect upon it. So
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:20.400]   Um, let's see. Let's let's we a couple other things. Uh, we want to get to
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:26.000]   Uh, just today apple lost its latest appeal on the ebook pricing price fixing scandal
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:33.120]   Uh, so now they have essentially two practical responses at this point either pay pay 450 million
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.200]   In in damages, which will mostly go to readers
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:41.440]   Or take this to the supreme court apple has released a statement that
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:45.840]   As as sir said no, no, no, I don't care what the court said we did not do anything wrong
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:49.200]   We did not commit price fixing and we're going to consider all options
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:51.600]   Uh, what to
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:53.600]   Kelly what do you hope they're going to do is it?
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:54.640]   Do you just hope?
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:57.920]   Isn't there a time you just hope these lawsuits just go away. However, they're going to go away
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:00.960]   Yeah, I kind of hope you know, there's a dance off
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:03.680]   Or something
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:09.920]   Just so that we don't have to do this anymore, you know two books enter one book leaves like I don't even care anymore
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:17.600]   Um, and the reason I have such a hard time with this lawsuit in particular. Um, what's funny is that sort of like
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:22.800]   Um celebrity deaths. It seems like apple lawsuit news comes in threes all the time
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:28.080]   So when I started hearing her started hearing stuff about this one, I just thought oh, what are the other two going to be?
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:30.640]   Um, so in this case
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:34.880]   I think it's fascinating that it's apple being
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:42.720]   Roasted over the fire for this behavior when we've seen so much worse from amazon since this happened
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:50.640]   And that to me is the thing that's sort of astounding, you know, like maybe I get pulled over for going
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:54.320]   56 and a 55 while somebody going 90
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:56.880]   That was me. Sorry. Oh wow
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:58.480]   That makes sense
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:04.640]   Well, somebody going 90, you know is is whipping by me and and the cops like yeah, yeah, that's you know
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:07.040]   That's them, but we're here to talk about you
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:12.160]   And it it almost feels like a witch hunt maybe at this point to be
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:16.560]   Pointing apple out as the example of everything that's wrong in the book industry
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:21.520]   Which is how some of the press has decided to portray this that apple is the problem
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:24.320]   And and I kind of think you know
[01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:29.760]   There's another company and it starts with a and they sell a fair number of digital books
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:32.960]   And and maybe it's time to shine a little light that direction too
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:34.560]   um
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:38.080]   So really I think you're right andy at this point. I just want it to stop
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:39.600]   and because
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:42.240]   I kind of want it to go to the supreme court just because I really
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:47.120]   I'm a principal person and i'm the kind of person who would hold on to something like that and be like no
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:51.280]   This is what's going to happen because I know that i'm right and I know
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:54.240]   That you don't have a case and I want to go
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:59.840]   You know, I want to make absolutely certain beyond a shadow of a doubt that everybody knows that you don't have a case
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:06.480]   So I just wonder how I sort of wonder how it's going to go and I like on the one hand
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:09.840]   I'm sort of like, you know, you go apple and on the other hand i'm like
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:12.160]   Really
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:18.400]   Yeah, let's see that's it's a lot of this sounds like that friend of yours that you just want to say after four and a half months
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:24.560]   The I will pay the 250 dollar parking ticket. Okay, let's stop
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:30.400]   You lost it when it was 64 dollars and then when he went back it was 128 dollars
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:36.000]   Let's just pay it and move on with our lives we're moving we're losing more than gas money to the courthouse
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.720]   But now but actually no you you something that you that you said actually has changed my mind a little bit
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:46.960]   I hope that that I hope that apple does decide no no we shall fight until our our voices crack and our feet hurt
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:49.040]   We will fight this injustice because
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:52.160]   if there's if there's been a
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:54.960]   part of the joy of the of the
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:24:00.800]   Affirmation of of marriage rights has been the comedy coming from justice kalia
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:03.120]   And I just want to see what
[01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:07.360]   Try to explain how this technology works
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:12.160]   But what he would come up with when he gets when things do not go his way so now now i'm saying I will
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:17.440]   Picken if there's an indy go-go for the apple's legal fund. I will kick in 50 dollars
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:23.040]   I will I will kick in at least to the t-shirt level for this just I will absolutely buy the t-shirt for this
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:27.280]   I think there's one thing though that I wonder if apples reaction to this or all of our reactions
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:32.560]   So this would be different if it hadn't been for the way that like I think you can absolutely make a case and you can
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:36.720]   Like that apple did things that were probably inappropriate especially the most favored nation clause
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:38.960]   But when you look at judge cote
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:44.560]   And the the supervisor they put in place and then the person he had to hire because he didn't know how to do the job
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:46.720]   That she had that she had him do him though. He's a friend
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:51.520]   That whole thing just looked so fishy that I think it sort of cast a paul over it
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:53.840]   It had been a straightforward legal decision. You did this wrong
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:56.720]   You have to change this and this and none of this
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:01.920]   Trustee thing had happened. I wonder if apple would have you know disagreed with it paid their fine and moved on
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:05.360]   But it feels like uh, I'm forgetting his name i'm blanking on his name now
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:10.160]   But it feels like cote's supervisor or trustee whatever the totally blanking whatever he is as well too
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:15.760]   If he wasn't involved to be much less of a thorn in their side and something they wouldn't perhaps fight so aggressively
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:22.080]   Uh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. I'm going you know that was just agreeing. That was it. Here you go
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:24.320]   We are in agreement
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:29.200]   Before we take a break one last thing that's kind of interesting bloomberg is has a thin piece
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:32.880]   Claiming that apple has actually started early production of new iphone models
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:36.640]   But they feature called force touch I'll repeat that force touch
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:41.920]   Which senses how hard users are pressing down on a screen people with knowledge of the matter said
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:49.920]   The newest phones in the same 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch versions as the current iphone six and six plus devices will have a similar exterior design
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:55.200]   Volume manufacturing is scheduled to ramp up as soon as next month according to this bloomberg business piece
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:58.560]   It's gonna be another iphone andy really they're gonna make another iphone this year
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:04.080]   It's irresponsible for us to talk about rumors running. I mean it just they should just cancel it
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:08.560]   So we have I mean there's too much on the apple mass tech just cancel the iphone and put their attention on hot tubs or something
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:15.200]   Yeah, we well we need more room for the apple tv because that's that's becoming the their their their boutique business
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:21.840]   Every year we get these stories every year new iphone production every new iphone new iphone's being tested. It's so funny
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:24.320]   Yeah, but it does it does raise an interesting question
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:28.480]   I mean do you think I do you I'm not sure that apple can do force touch in a phone this year
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:32.560]   I'm sure it's coming because I mean it's it's so it's so useful on the on the watch
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:35.280]   It's so useful on the trackpad of the the new macbook
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:40.160]   And the new macbooks it seems like a natural thing from the put on ios devices as well
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:42.880]   But I don't think they're there it's gonna be this year
[01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:47.520]   My understanding is that there's typically several prototypes maybe two maybe three
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:50.080]   Maybe four i guess depending on it and there is more
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:54.720]   Sort of conservative and more aggressive prototypes and you could find for example
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:27:01.520]   An iphone prototype that has no home button that uses the screen and force touch for a virtual home button or home button on the side
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:06.080]   Or is all they try almost anything we could think of in a podcast or someone could write on a blog
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:09.600]   They have the wealth and the skill and the intelligence to prototype
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:13.440]   And we said this before you know and phil Schiller says he doesn't like touch screen iMAX
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:17.120]   It's not because he just woke up deciding that it's because he tried them and really doesn't like them
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:22.240]   So i'm sure that there is that prototype iphone that has the force touch
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:24.960]   And if it works, they're going to move it into production
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:29.760]   Which is what bloombrig is saying they're doing and if it doesn't there's probably a prototype that they have already to go
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:32.960]   That doesn't include force touch and we'll get it as soon as it's ready
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:38.080]   But you know based on the size of the iphone screen doesn't look that much different than the iMac trackpad
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:43.360]   So hopefully if they can get the the number of parts into production it should be okay for them
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:48.720]   Yeah, and we're assuming that they mean something like what works on the on the apple watch
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:52.400]   Maybe they just mean that instead of having a mechanical clicky button for the home button
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:57.760]   There'll be still a divot on the screen, but instead of having a clicky button. It will be a force touch responder
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:59.920]   This one still has a
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:04.880]   This one still has a home button as far as i know but you can do the force touch to get the context menus and the
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:07.920]   What's it called pressure sensitive drawing stuff?
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:09.280]   Yeah
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:11.280]   The home button want to think is further out
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:17.040]   It's weird. I mean i've i still after six weeks with the apple watch. I don't know
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:20.000]   What force touch means?
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:25.360]   Which is troubling because I considered myself to be a partially educated person
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:30.880]   About iowice devices and the fact i've been using this for a month and a half and I still don't instantly think oh
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:34.560]   I want to get this on the app. Oh, of course, that's something I would have to force touch to get
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.880]   So I think they still have a lot of
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:39.360]   Psychological engineering to do before they figure it out
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:45.600]   I mean kelly you have an apple watch right? I do not. Oh, you don't okay. I don't but I have the
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:52.560]   The current model 13-inch macbook which does have the force touch trackpad, which I love
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:58.640]   um, it's and it's it's not even because I run a bunch of apps that take advantage of it or anything
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:01.520]   it's just because i'm usually a
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:06.160]   Tap to click on the trackpad and not actually clicking it
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:11.760]   and with the force touch I actually get sort of that first layer of clicking and it's
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:17.120]   Exactly the reason that I turned off the the clicking in the first place because it was always so hard to do
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:20.080]   And now it's very easy and I really really like it
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:23.600]   I can't wait to see what sort of stuff ends up actually implementing that
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:27.200]   As part of the application. So I think they're I think it's great
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:34.800]   Um, I don't think we're going to see it this year and the reason I don't think that is because apple just bought the company bought a bunch of patents off a company
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:38.880]   um for force touch sorts of things and
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:46.400]   uh, so one of the waves of information that people one of the waves of conclusions, I guess not really information that people were drawing on this
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:49.040]   Was that this meant the home button was going away?
[01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:53.680]   And I don't think the home button is necessarily going away. I think what will probably happen
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:56.960]   Is it will end up with a divot like you said andy
[01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:02.560]   Um, because the home button has been the bane of a few models of iphone when it comes to
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:06.560]   The thing what fails after about 18 months
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:13.760]   Um, you know, I know mr. Kelly for a long time had an iphone for and people kept going wow
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:18.080]   And your home button still works like people were just stunned. So, um
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:20.000]   I
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:25.840]   I don't think we'll get anything this year because I think when it comes to deploying it on any scale larger than a watch
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:28.240]   That it's going to end up
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:33.600]   needing more improvement and more refinement and that it's going to end up being something more like
[01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:35.200]   um
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:41.040]   next year in in whatever the seven ends up being if if we get a success this year and next year is the seven
[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:46.160]   Um, it's something we will see more next fall. I think then then this one just to make because
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:54.880]   apple wants the experience to be right and you know, we know that and particularly if you are in the boat with me of apple tv fans
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:59.680]   who are really not being patient about waiting for the next one then
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:05.440]   You know, you're just hoping that you've pinned all of that on I really want this to be a good experience
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:08.560]   And it's not yet. So it's not out yet and i'm really hoping that
[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:15.600]   Next year will be the case for that only because I find that if I need to grab for my phone and i'm not looking at it
[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:19.600]   I need to be able to tell which part is the top and which part is the bottom
[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:24.160]   Yeah, one of the nicest the home button gone for years. Well for a couple of years
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:29.760]   It's it's it's so iconic for so many reasons and also I mean it's it's amazing
[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:32.800]   when you look at how
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:33.760]   simple
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:35.440]   human engineering
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:38.960]   Considerations can can create a feature that's just as good as something that seems
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:41.520]   Complicated for actual hardware engineering
[01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:46.880]   I love the moto x one of the reasons why I love it is that they put a little divot on the back at the top of the screen
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:52.320]   That just immediately oriented in your hand so you know, you're you know, you're you're holding it right side up
[01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:55.120]   You also know that it's it feels a bit more secure in your pocket
[01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:58.720]   And all they had to do was just sort of you know, lick your thumb on the clay maldol
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:03.760]   And here you go. We just put a divot on the screen. Oh, it's worth adding that uh the same way when apple hears
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:08.480]   We need multitasking. They're like, oh no what you really want is is surfing safari while you're listening to pandora
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:09.920]   Here's an api for you
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:15.040]   The whole reason for exploring home buttonless iphones is people saying we want small screen iphones again like the iphone
[01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:20.880]   For or for s and what apple hears is oh the case like the whole package is too big for you
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:22.960]   So if we could reduce the case thing around it
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:27.920]   You could still have a big screen and not have to worry about reaching all the corners or using it one-handed
[01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:34.160]   So it's an exploration sort of how can we solve the real problem you have and not any particular version through hardware features or not?
[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:37.440]   Kristina Warren is back. Hello. Yeah
[01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:42.000]   We were just talking before we go into pics of the week. We're talking about the idea of a forced
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:47.760]   Bloomberg had that piece about a possible force touch iphone this year and not next year
[01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:51.120]   Uh, what do you think about force touching an iphone and what do you think of it happening? Maybe this year?
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:55.200]   Yeah, no so much so and I don't I don't want to repeat too much of what you guys have already said
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:57.280]   I guess my big question would be
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:00.880]   Are they putting force touch on the home button because if they do that that makes total sense, right?
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:06.560]   Um as kelly was saying so many of those buttons fail it'd be like a great way of like or moving a moving part
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:12.400]   If they do it on the screen, I wonder if that adds too much ui complexity because already on the apple watch
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:16.400]   I find myself like I don't always know when to when to force touch
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:21.200]   And so I wonder how much like training it would take and what it would do to developers
[01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:24.240]   It especially, you know
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:26.240]   To give it to us like this year
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.640]   Um to start to build those things in
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:33.120]   Um, but I don't I don't I think that that we've heard so many rumors
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:39.600]   It seems likely we'll probably see something force touch like I just don't know if it's going to be on the screen or if it'll be on the button
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:41.280]   um
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:45.200]   I would I probably eventually would I would be okay with the home button going away
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:49.360]   But as you said and even it's so iconic. I don't I don't know what they would do
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:57.360]   Without it to a certain degree. Yeah, it's it's easier to imagine at this point an iPhone with sharp corners
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:59.520]   Then an iPhone without a home without me
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:00.960]   So
[01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:02.560]   That's the angle
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:08.240]   I think I wonder if apple has ever like sent up and they need to do actual real world field radio testing if they simply
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:13.600]   Will make a few cases with sharp corners on them. They will never ever in a million years think that this is an actual iPhone
[01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:19.840]   Uh, we are going to be right back to our picks of the week before that we have another message from the recationing leo the port wheel
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:25.360]   He limit me let me interrupt for just a little bit any I've come back
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:30.240]   From the grave looks like i'm I don't know in the afterlife to have
[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:33.600]   Now you about legal zoom
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:34.640]   Uh

[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:42.000]   We're still using the same legal documents that I paid so little for back then
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:48.400]   Uh, so many reasons why a smart business person might choose legal zoom. I haven't rose told me to

[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:23.840]   I'm a big fan of the the sort of holoha shirt that still makes you look like a vacationing clergyman
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:28.000]   You know black and a little bit muted green, but not really a whole lot of colors. That's
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.480]   That's that's that's in my closet right now
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:34.880]   Uh time for picks of the week. I'm gonna start off with kelly gammant kelly. What's your pick this week?
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:41.360]   Okay, so since we've got apple music now and everybody's uh going to be listening to their phone a lot more
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:44.240]   I thought that this would be a super fantastic pick
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:49.680]   Um, this is a what I'm what I'm picking here is a case
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:54.400]   Four headphones and that sounds kind of silly, but i'm about to tell you why it's awesome
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:58.320]   So this is from square jellyfish at square jellyfish.com
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:01.280]   And the reason it's neat is because you pop it open
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:05.200]   And there's your headphones and they can be the ear pods or the earbuds
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:08.560]   It doesn't matter they make a flavor for for each kind of apple headphone
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:13.520]   And just like the box that you have they wind around and then they they slide the prong
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:17.600]   The jack up the middle right there like that, but here's why this one is great
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:21.440]   So when you close it, it's super compact and it's it's one piece
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:25.520]   So you don't have to worry about losing it like if you were saving the apple box and winding your headphones and that
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:28.240]   Here's the reason that I think this one is fantastic
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:31.680]   Because if you press a little bit it goes like this
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:37.200]   And the top becomes a place where you can set your phone
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:39.200]   Oh
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:43.360]   Or your ipad mini um, i've used a full-size ipad with varying degrees of success
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:45.680]   But it'll hold your phone either direction
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:49.120]   Particularly or horizontally it's fantastic with an ipad mini
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:54.960]   And it's got a little bit of rubber on the edges where it would hit the deck
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:38:00.160]   So if you like to use your phone or your ipad on an airplane and you need your headphones
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:04.000]   I got you because the rubber keeps it from shaking
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:09.520]   Most of most of the way like it helps a lot of the vibration of the the tray on the airplane
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:14.080]   So that's why I like this and they will you can get them in a bunch of colors
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:15.760]   and
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:17.200]   I think
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:19.200]   They're right around like five dollars
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:21.600]   For one of these
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:26.560]   Um, and I I love mine. I take it everywhere. I think it's it's just fantastic
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:28.080]   In fact, I got one
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:33.680]   And what I did was I bought a I bought a second one at mac world and I think I bought it for
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:36.640]   Like five dollars or something a couple of years ago
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:42.320]   And I just love them because it's so the handiest thing and that's my pick this week
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:46.400]   Wow, they got they had a whole bunch of cool stuff like that. They've got a pocket tripod
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:50.960]   They've got a car vent mount. They okay, so they they know what they're doing
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:52.160]   I
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:54.560]   Really like squared all the square jellyfish stuff. I have
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:57.040]   uh, the the tripod piece
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:00.880]   I have the pocket tripod like that one there. I have the um
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:03.200]   The phone mount
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:06.480]   Which has the the screw hole in the bottom to put it on a tripod
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:08.080]   But it it slides
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:10.880]   Open to hold whatever device you want to have hold it
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:14.160]   And it's uh really great. I like all of their stuff
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:15.200]   I've used it
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:19.040]   I drop it in the bottom of my backpack or in my shoulder bag when I'm headed somewhere
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:26.080]   And uh, I'm not the most careful person with my stuff and all my all my square jellyfish stuff still looks great
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:29.760]   It manages to survive me. Yeah, so I feel like that's a pretty good sign
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:34.160]   I love the design. I mean if if you're if you're a if you're an accessory designer
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:38.640]   I want you to think about the prototype. You're building no matter what it is
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:44.640]   Right now and think is there a way we can add a simple feature that also turns it into a phone or iPad stand
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:48.640]   Because there almost certainly is a way you can do that and when we discover that
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:51.040]   Oh my god, I thought this was just a stylist
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:55.840]   But if I twist this and pull it out legs pop out and hey now i've got an iPhone stand
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:40:01.920]   I will put an extra piece of money into a box and mail it to you because that's that's clever. That's just good thinking
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:04.880]   Uh, Christina, what's your pick this week?
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:13.680]   All right. So my my pick is uh an amazing amazing game called yoko's chess game yoko. Oh no has a chest game
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:16.160]   Oh, um
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:18.640]   Yeah, it is it's as fabulous as you thought it would be
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:23.760]   Um, it's bizarre is all get out. She has a couple of remotes. It's it's got a standard mode
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:28.880]   Um, there's a doggy chess mode where all the pieces are dogs and it makes noise
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:33.680]   Um, it's got weird ass background music from off of her latest album in the background
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:35.360]   and um
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:39.440]   She's got this this mode called trust mode where all the pieces are white
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:42.240]   And you basically have to trust
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:46.640]   I guess like like what pieces are yours and what pieces are are the opponents. Um, it's
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:50.960]   It's a free app that the the trust mode and the doggy mode are in app purchases
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:54.800]   Uh, well worth the money because the the dog sounds are fantastic
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:59.840]   It's not a bad chess game, but it's so freaking weird that it has to be my sake of the week because it's so bizarre
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:02.080]   The yoko otto has a chess game
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:03.280]   Wow
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:05.280]   Playing chess on the honor system
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:10.160]   That's something that a lot of elder may then will get very very angry about
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:17.440]   Yes, and also if you read if you if you read like the it's it's it's worth getting just to uh to to read the rules that she's
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:23.600]   Um, it's just czar. It's so great. Did it break up the king and bishop?
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:28.320]   Yeah, I mean
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:32.560]   Basically, she's she's proving like how she was able to be together three, you know, um beetles
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:37.680]   Um at chess clearly no, it's a bit this is it we we found this yesterday
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:41.040]   And I when I haven't been playing with apple music up and playing this it's
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:44.000]   Yoko no she has it has an iphone app you guys
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:47.520]   That's cool. They just released that best as for a
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:52.080]   There's a there's a one woman. She's she has a one woman show at mama right now
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:58.240]   Uh and which you get you get to oh, there's also a lot of like interactive things on the wall that are kind of similar
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:02.720]   So that's that's pretty cool. Yeah, apparently this the the the the
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:08.880]   Trust game was was built out of uh some sort of actual thing that she created in like 1996 for some installation
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:12.960]   So yeah, I mean she's apparently but that's chest thing for a while and now she's nap
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:18.880]   Okay, what what is the yoko gambit like if there's an opening move called the yoko
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:25.200]   I will I will leave that as an exercise for the listener
[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:26.240]   Uh
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:28.160]   Renee, what's your pick this week?
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:33.680]   All right, so I have a pick but I just wanted to mention in passing that iBooks got updated and there's now audiobooks inside iBooks
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:38.560]   So if you've always hankered to have all your books written and spoken all in one place
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:41.920]   There's that and I too sorry iBooks author now finally
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:48.400]   Supports the iphone as well. So if you've always wanted your iTunes author your iBooks author stuff on your iphone
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:49.840]   You can get that as well
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:54.320]   And it looks like iTunes update still hasn't come out and a couple of other apples updates for today still haven't come out
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:55.840]   So there's more goodies
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:57.840]   Hopefully as the day progresses
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:01.040]   Yeah, it was mostly an update for for apple music
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:04.160]   The other cool thing that you'll want to know is that they did fix that
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:08.720]   Messages bug where if someone sends you the message of doom it does and no longer locks up
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:16.480]   They decide they they thought about it both ways they decided maybe it works better if you can't lock up the phone with the message of doom
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:18.080]   So
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:19.760]   Unicode is hard
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.760]   So my pick is a camera
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:24.240]   Obscura and it's an app by ben rice
[01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:29.840]   Who's a young developer, but he's a photographer. He did all the photographs for the oil conference
[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:31.840]   If you're familiar with that conference
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:39.200]   He's very good and he sort of wanted a camera app that was just really fun to use and he really succeeded brilliantly in making that
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:43.200]   So it gets a lot of stuff out of your way it does have filters it does have manual controls
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:45.920]   But all of it is is super accessible
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:49.840]   And it's sort of for the person who just wants to take a great picture
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:53.520]   They want to have a little bit more control over it then you know, maybe the basic built-in
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:59.760]   iOS camera app, but they don't want to be futzing with every dial or every switch and spending a lot of time and maybe having
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:03.760]   Their pixel dog run away from them before the shot is as taking place
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:10.000]   So it's it's on the app store. You can you can get it now their filters aren't an extra in-app purchase, but they're totally worth it
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.800]   Um, I think it's Gotham like filter is enough
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:15.440]   Sort of make rans even happy
[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:22.240]   So if you are really into iPhone photography and you do love your new camera apps give camera obscure. Oh, look it's totally worth it
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:27.920]   Well, um my pick of the week is actually mostly for people who are listening live
[01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:32.400]   Appcamp for girls is having their fundraising an ad go go fundraising campaign
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:36.160]   You can still throw money into the kitty today and tomorrow july first
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:41.040]   You should definitely do that because there there are there are some organizations that I think that they should
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:44.960]   Basically have baskets full of money for all the money being thrown at them
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:50.960]   And kelly app camp for girls is definitely that maybe you can do a better job than I can't explaining how cool app camp for girls is
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:53.760]   um
[01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:58.560]   I talk about it all the time and so it's so you'd think i'd be way better at this
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:05.520]   um app camp for girls is amazing what we do is we take girls who are going into grade eight and grade nine and
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:08.800]   uh, so that's about 12 13 years old and
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:12.320]   For a week we have day camp and they come in each day
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:16.800]   We give them an an ipod touch to use for the week and they learn about developing apps
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:21.440]   and they use macbook pros and they use xcode and they have to type stuff in xcode and
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:23.200]   uh, there's
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:29.680]   Bugs in the app they have to find them they have to fix them and at the end of the week they have to pitch their app to a panel of investors
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:33.520]   and uh, we really have the most amazing time
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:36.720]   uh getting the getting them excited about
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:40.160]   uh, software and the reason that it's exciting is because
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:42.560]   every time we do it every time we do
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:47.920]   uh, the camp there's uh teams of four we team the girls up in groups of four and
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:54.160]   Every single time we do this there's one girl who realizes that someone has to draw all of the stuff that goes into an app
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:57.120]   somebody had to generate all of the art that you see and
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:59.520]   someone realizes that uh
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:07.120]   Breaking stuff is really fun like I they're the best thing in the world to do is to push that button and push back
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:12.320]   When you're not supposed to push back and what happens if you hit the home button in the middle and how does all how does all of this work?
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:18.640]   and what what happens when you do these things and then um, someone else realizes that uh,
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:23.040]   Getting up and talking about their app to other people is like the best thing they could have been doing
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:32.640]   And all of these things like showing people that there's more to developing software than just hunching over and typing mystery strings of characters
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:34.960]   Into what looks like a terminal
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:41.760]   um, you know, there's there's so much more to it than that and and we don't necessarily expect that all of them are going to become computer scientists
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:46.480]   But we do hear the same stories from all of them, which is things about um
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:53.840]   Things about how I went to this camp and I was the only girl and so all of the boys shouted me down and none of my ideas made
[01:46:53.840 --> 01:47:00.080]   It into the project we were doing or um, you know, I would I tried to offer and and you know
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:04.800]   None of the boys took me seriously because it was a computer thing and i'm female and that's not supposed to happen
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:11.840]   and you know, we we kept hearing these stories over and over and and one of the great things about this year is that um
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:16.880]   We had volunteers that once they extended the dub dub dc scholarship program
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:21.440]   To stem organizations one of the organizations they extended it to was app camp for girls
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:25.680]   And some of the people who volunteer for app camp were people who got those scholarships
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:27.840]   And it was really great to get to
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:33.200]   Have the opportunity to have those people at dub dub actually learning actually talking about that stuff
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:35.680]   and I really
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:41.360]   I get so much more out of it. Like I know we're doing something that's really great for the girls that are there who
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:45.280]   Get to learn a lot more about what it takes to make software development happen
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:51.760]   And what software development is all about and yet at the same time we get so much out of it to see their ideas and
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:57.840]   When they didn't have to put up with all of this kind of stuff, you know, nearly as long as as all of the adults have
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:03.360]   Um, you know, they have so much enthusiasm for it and they're so great and super creative
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:08.160]   And just getting to have the the the week that we get to spend with them
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:13.920]   Um every time like it's a completely different group of people and it's always so so so much fun
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:19.920]   And so the indiegogo fundraiser that we're doing is to build this into a sustainable organization gene had an idea
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:23.600]   And we've proven it can work and we've proven that
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:27.600]   It's something we can execute not just in a different location, but in a different country
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:33.520]   We are officially a society of canada now so that we can start our eastward migration
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:36.640]   Um, so yeah, we're coming for you rene
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:40.240]   Can we you not may you're not die of cholera
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:44.160]   Yeah, I
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:50.800]   I love my ox and so but i it's i love it so much and and i'm really excited that this went from
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:58.240]   An idea that gene mcdonald had to what it is today and we're what we're doing with this current fundraiser is
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:04.720]   Trying to build an ongoing organization that will have the funding for things like staff members so that we have people for whom
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:07.600]   appcamp for girls is their entire job and
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:14.400]   Coordinating all of these things and being able to take the app camp kit and export it to anybody that wants to build one
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:17.600]   And making this a reality for as many people as
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:21.680]   Want it to be a reality for them and that's our ultimate goal
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:24.640]   um in the joke. I always tell people is that
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:30.000]   Um, what I do to make sure that I can keep track of all my stuff because everybody's got the same white cable
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:35.440]   And everybody's got the same charger, you know for their laptop and everything else i put a helikitty sticker on it
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:39.360]   And it has 100 return rate for me
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:46.320]   Nobody else ever once i'm going to my laptop adapter with the helikitty sticker and I want that to stop working
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:48.240]   Yeah
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:53.520]   Oh again. I every every time every time I've met people who have been working with app camp for girls. It's just
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:59.120]   Every they're all like you which is a great thing to say about a organization
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:01.600]   Uh, and I just I I've I've had
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:05.680]   Only a few experiences to teach in environments like that not necessarily
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:07.920]   Uh just for girls but for all kids
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:15.120]   But if there's anything that sort of brushes aside any cynicism that has sort of crept in after 10 years or 20 years of
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:18.000]   Observing technology or working in technology and running apps
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.880]   It's being the person who shows someone the first their first app dev kit
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:27.280]   And watching them as they discover that they have a power that they did not have
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:31.600]   Before they got out of the car this morning. Uh, so just really great organization
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:33.120]   And I'm so glad we had a chance to talk about it
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:36.960]   Uh before we go though, of course apple tried to be fuddle us
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:41.200]   By coming up with a big announcement just after we normally stop
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:45.600]   Recording but we stuck it to them didn't we stuck ticket to the rene rene
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:49.360]   Tell us what apple tried to get us to not be able to talk about today
[01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:55.920]   So yeah, so pushing out software is hard garage band 10.1 for os 10 just got updated and it brings the funk andy
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:58.880]   It brings you electronic dance music the hip hop the noise as well though
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:02.560]   We got the funk. Do we got the noise as well?
[01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:04.560]   You go, um, yeah, no, absolutely
[01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:09.840]   It uh, it has all for everyone who's loved the acoustic stuff and the sort of stuff that's been in garage band before
[01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:16.080]   They've now added all the synthesizers and they've added all the beats and everything that you could want to use to produce sort of the electronic
[01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:21.280]   The hip hop that sort of sound it's got this awesome pad that you can use to sort of move things around
[01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:26.480]   And you can record stuff now. They brought the record level feature down from the pro set to the the free garage band
[01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:29.840]   Set and it's just I only had a really brief time to look at it
[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:32.800]   But I mean there's house. There's techno. There's dubstep
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:35.360]   And I think it's really awesome that kids were not just kids
[01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:39.920]   But everybody who's listening to this kind of music can now go to garage band and have it sort of easily accessible
[01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:46.640]   To them so they can go from enjoying it to sort of making it and the barrier for entry into garage band has always been extremely low
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:51.840]   And they got a really good way of rewarding you they kind of do all the heavy lifting so that you don't have to
[01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:57.760]   Worry about how to how to get started. You don't have to feel like a failure and stop as soon as you get started
[01:51:57.760 --> 01:52:03.280]   And they brought all of that to the new sort of techno electronic sound that they're they're adding to this feature set now
[01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:07.600]   So there's a ton of stuff inside there. There's 10 new drums. There's a hundred new loops
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:12.560]   Again, it's all of apples music director people involved. So it's super high quality. It sounds great
[01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:16.720]   It's really easy to use if you're at all interested in this kind of stuff, absolutely check it out
[01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:23.680]   Oh great. So we did we did mesh get it in garage band still when the the adult version of the busy box
[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:26.640]   We played with as little kids with the with the added friends
[01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:30.720]   You can actually create art with it, but who who am I kidding? I'm just using to use the drum machine
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:35.680]   The next stuff like rocyna mentioned in the iOS version it will be coming to the OS 10 version in a future update not there this time
[01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:41.280]   Sopa, yeah, I guess what I guess that's going to be it for us this week
