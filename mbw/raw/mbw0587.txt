[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.560]   Renee Richie's here for MyMore.com.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.560]   Hello Renee.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.920]   I had it so big, I can't get it Andy sized.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.920]   I've been trying, but I don't know what's going on.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.920]   Andy's had his giant.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.920]   I don't know what he's done.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.920]   It's the new version of Skype.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.640]   It's like it doesn't show me the chai- I don't know.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.640]   I'm trying my best.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.640]   I hope my head is up.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.640]   Your head looks perfect.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.640]   Your lighting looks great.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.640]   Yeah, you actually look really good.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.280]   And of course, when are you moving soon, right?
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.640]   Sometime between now and middle January.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.640]   Now that you've got it all set.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.360]   Yes, let's move.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.600]   We also have Andy Inako.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.000]   Now, the new improved Andy Inako where his voice matches his lips.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Ah, you do not have to focus.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.560]   I'm joking with you.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.400]   I'm joking.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.880]   It's great to see Andy Chicago Sun Times, of course, C-W-O-B.com.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.400]   And we owe a little bit of gratitude to this cat right here, Alex Lindsey from the Pixel
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.920]   Core who hooked Andy up as the kids say.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.920]   I like good audio.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.920]   I cannot lie.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.160]   I like to spread the love.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.160]   I cannot lie.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.840]   Well, thank you.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.840]   Thank you.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.840]   Thank you.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.760]   And sound devices is going to make a little money off of us this holiday season.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.760]   I bought myself a good idea.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.760]   Just let me buy.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.880]   Renee, why don't you just order one?
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.440]   That's one of the big truths.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.680]   People have been asking me about, should I get the iPhone 8 or the iPhone 10?
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.600]   And the thing is, once you find a tool that is perfect for you, that you realize that,
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.360]   oh, this solves so many problems, you forget about how much something costs.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.720]   I was assuming that you have the money for it.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.560]   But it's like, whereas my eyes would have like glossed over, oh, you sure?
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.680]   I'm going to spend $600 on an audio interface recorder.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.800]   That's going to happen.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   And then I use this.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.000]   Yeah, that's going to happen.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.920]   It is definitely going to happen.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.960]   I think that that's true.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.400]   And I think, you know, Apple has shown that people are not as price sensitive, at least
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.920]   based on what looks like the best selling iPhone of all time.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.000]   Not as price sensitive as we might have expected.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.400]   I mean, the iPhone 10 is there now up to, I think we reported this last week, half a
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.080]   million units a day, according to Ming Chi Quo and KG Securities at the Fox Compliant in
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.080]   China.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.240]   And that's what is about 15 million a month.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.320]   That seems like they should be able to feed the demand, but maybe, maybe not.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.840]   They're not getting to, I think less than a, about a week of delay now.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.840]   It's a week.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.560]   So I think it sounds like they've gotten whatever was, whatever it was in the pipe is
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.560]   through it.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.560]   Yep.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.560]   Yep.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.560]   And they've really beefed up production.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.560]   So that's pretty impressive.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.520]   I have to say, I was kind of amazed at the difference.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.160]   I haven't used the eight, but I have, I was carrying around, I was in India last week
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.920]   and carrying around a seven and a, and my ex.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.480]   And the reason is the seven is on T-Mobile.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.960]   So it works in India and taking pictures with both of them.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.320]   I was amazed at how much better the ex camera is than the seven.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.280]   Is it really like I was taking pictures in the same environment and I could, I was like,
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.280]   I'm not going to say anything.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.760]   They say it's like a half stop better in low light, but it'll engage the telephoto lens,
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.040]   the quote unquote telephoto lens about two stops earlier than the seven.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.040]   Interesting.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.640]   Also, now you can get the unlocked version.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.600]   It just started offering that in the US.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.400]   So that would actually be maybe something you'd want to take a look at.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.680]   You don't have to be tied to any carrier.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.680]   It's about right, right?
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.680]   It used to take, it took actually is taking longer in the past.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.680]   In the US is weird because we get them SIM-free day one.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.200]   I think you have to do.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.760]   I think I bet you there's rules.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.560]   I bet the CRTC or somebody.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.720]   But like the, I think the little known secret is that the T-Mobile one I believe is always
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.120]   SIM-unlocked and the Verizon one is GSM-unlocked, even though it's CDMA on Verizon, but the
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.360]   GSM slot is unlocked.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.000]   People usually who want it right away, usually go for one of those two models.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.040]   Yeah, I have a T-Mobile.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.760]   I don't know if it's SIM-unlocked, but I should try it.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.880]   Verizon has a deal with RFCC in the US that they can't lock their SIM slots.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.880]   So the LTE stuff is unlocked.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.880]   But I use the e-SIM.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.000]   I might regret that because it was really nice to be able to pop the SIM and put it in
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   another phone.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.760]   And the e-SIM is kind of tied to that phone now, right?
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.080]   Yeah, not only that, but for AT&T, I had to, I returned, I made the stupid mistake of
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.160]   returning my iPhone 10 the day before I was headed to DC for like three or four days
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.200]   and thought that I could just, you know, re-sign in with my old SIM.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.240]   But no, of course, AT&T canceled out my old SIM as soon as the new e-SIM got created.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.240]   Right.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.800]   So it's not so you could switch from one to another now.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.400]   You'll basically have to go, I had to go back to, as soon as I, as the first thing I
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.080]   did in DC was find an AT&T store and give a nice young man $5 to give me a brand new
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.080]   SIM.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.080]   So here's my question.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.080]   Here's my old phone.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.080]   All right.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.240]   Now I've activated this with, is this like the old bad old days with CDMA?
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.440]   Once you activate it with Verizon, you couldn't use it with anything else?
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.600]   Or does this e-SIM, is it reprogrammable?
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.480]   Now that I've activated it with T-Mobile, let's say I wanted to move to Verizon or AT&T,
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.520]   well, I guess it'd have to be a GSM, or AT&T.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.760]   Can I call AT&T and say, take this SIM over?
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.400]   Or if I locked this phone now, Renee, do you have any idea?
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.360]   I don't because I haven't played around too much with the, with the e-SIM.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.320]   I have heard stories where people say it locks right away, but I don't know if that's,
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.320]   but I don't know if that's,
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.160]   remember the old days in the iPad it did, and this was AT&T doing this.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.840]   The iPad had that, it still had a SIM, but it had the non-denominational SIM, the secular
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.840]   SIM.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.120]   And, but once you, in at first, I think they, they, the ATT backed down on this, but when
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:06.800]   you activated that iPad with AT&T, that SIM got burnt into AT&T land and you'd have to
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.320]   get a different SIM if you want it.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.280]   Now, I think AT&T is backed down on that.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.480]   So I just, I'm, let's, I would love to get some clarity on this e-SIM because really
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.680]   that's not an improvement.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.120]   That's kind of like the old CDMA activation thing.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.680]   You still, I mean, I had to call T-Mobile and activate it, right?
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:30.480]   So the, the, the, um, uh, EI number and tell them, I have a new phone and they said, okay,
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.480]   well, yeah.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.480]   They might be able to read.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.760]   There's got to be a way to change that, but I would never, yeah.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.000]   Well, they have to, because they, Apple, Apple's very, well, also Apple's aware of the resale
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   market for it.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.080]   So they, I'm sure they wouldn't have it locked in, but I'm sure they're looking at it from
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.200]   a point of view of, isn't it nice that you don't have to worry.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.780]   There's, you don't have to, we don't have to include a tool.
[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.800]   We don't have to say, here's how you insert your SIM into this thing.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.800]   It's like, nope, you buy it.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.240]   You tell us what your phone number is.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.640]   Your carrier will set, make sure that by the time your phone arrives, we'll be ready
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.680]   to rock and roll without you having to do anything else.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.680]   So I think we have to, that's, that's one error.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.680]   It's not though.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.680]   It's not though.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.680]   Cause I got my T-Mobile.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.680]   It was not activated.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:11.960]   It was not usable until I called T-Mobile and assigned that IMEI number to T-Mobile.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.160]   So it's not just comes out of the box ready to go.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.360]   I actually met with my ex, I just popped the SIM out of my old phone.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.360]   I was stuck in my new phone.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.360]   You could still do that.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.680]   It might be, I'm just saying for users, maybe that's the thing to do.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.520]   It was just like, it was working in minutes.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.520]   Right.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.520]   You know.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.120]   So what, so what, who's carry, what carry did you use Andy?
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.120]   AT&T.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.560]   Was this a review unit?
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.360]   No, no, I bought the first, the one I have right now is a review unit.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.240]   The one that I bought though, when I bought it, it asked me, it took me to like an AT&T
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.360]   page within the Apple store app saying, what's your phone number?
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.520]   Great, well, make sure it set up.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.280]   And so when I took it out of the box, it was, it was my phone.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.520]   They don't do that with T-Mobile, which kind of is, I guess, because it's really unlocked.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.560]   They just say, who's your carrier?
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.040]   You say T-Mobile said, OK, fine.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.040]   And they don't do anything.
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.040]   They don't verify or anything.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.860]   And then when you get it, you have to sign it up.
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.760]   So I really want to know, I mean, how locked am I in?
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.760]   Am I?
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.880]   Have I just, in effect by using the ECIM carrier locked my phone?
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.280]   No, I think you could still pop the SIM out and put another SIM in it, can't you?
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.280]   There's no SIM in it.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.560]   There's no SIM slot?
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.840]   There is, but there's no SIM, because it's an ECIM.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.000]   Yeah, but maybe if I put somebody else's SIM in there, would it over?
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.160]   What do you think?
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.720]   I would guess it would.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.960]   I'm more.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.960]   Get on that, will you?
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.000]   I'm not a new hunger strict that I am that I'm not in the US.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.480]   I would love to be doing all this stuff.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.480]   Yeah, you have a different situation.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.040]   Well, and it may be a call to Apple, I don't know.
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.840]   Because I could tell you right now, if I call T-Mobile.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.000]   No, I'm sure there's so many US phone nerds.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.840]   I'm sure that they've done this for years now and have all these answers.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:47.240]   I've just never paid attention to them because I'm a selfish Canadian.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:52.480]   Well, acquiring minds and we've just raised an issue we don't have the answer to.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.520]   This comes now because they're selling these.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.840]   You can actually apparently go into the store today.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.200]   If you ordered online, you'll get a December 13th.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:06.160]   But if you go into an Apple store today, you could pick up an unlocked carrier agnostic
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.160]   iPhone 10.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.160]   So what did they do before today?
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.200]   If you went to the Apple store, did they force you to pick a carrier?
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.600]   But if you pick, as I pointed out, if you pick T-Mobile, they would go, "Okay, good."
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.600]   They didn't do anything.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.600]   It just says, "Okay."
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.120]   Which tells me it was a carrier unlocked version, right?
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.760]   Yeah, so it's all just sophistry.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:23.760]   I guess.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.520]   Because if you go in and say, "I just want the phone," here is $1,200.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.160]   I have an AT&T sim at home.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.160]   I should just plug it in.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.360]   Because what, I mean, there's a lot of people who just buy them to ship them overseas and
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.200]   I'm sure they're not buying locked versions.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:41.880]   And it used to be the advice was to get the Verizon one because then you get all the radio
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.280]   band CDMA and GSM and an unlocked system.
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.280]   And the Qualcomm modem.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.520]   Who else does CDMA and GSM?
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.920]   Yeah, I have thank you.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:48.920]   Let's talk about that.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:50.920]   They did it again.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.600]   There's Qualcomm modems for the GCDMA versions and there's Intel modems.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.080]   And once again, the Intel modems are not as fast as the Qualcomm modems.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.160]   So it's a yes and no thing.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.840]   So Infineon was the original iPhone modem company and they got bought by Intel and
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.440]   Apple went to Qualcomm.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.680]   Now Apple is using both because Apple and Qualcomm are at war.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.320]   But Apple doesn't spec them for that high speed anyway.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.120]   So if they were using Qualcomm modems, they would still ship with whatever they said LTE
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.120]   advanced 800.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.200]   It wouldn't be enabled for gigabit ethernet, sorry, gigabit LTE or anything.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.800]   Apple's basic thing is, hey, supplier, we need them.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.480]   We need someone who can run a 10 minute, sorry, 10 second, 100 meters.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.560]   They're like, we can do it in nine, fine.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.360]   We can do it in 9.5, fine.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.200]   As long as it's under 10, they don't care.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.320]   So whatever the spec is, if you can beat it, that's fine.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.520]   But they're not implementing anything over it.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.520]   Okay.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.800]   And we know in the past that actually Apple artificially slowed down the Qualcomm modems
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.280]   to their spec.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.280]   Here's the test.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.280]   Yeah, that's the.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.520]   Here's the testing from a PC magazine.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.840]   And it shows that the orange line is Qualcomm.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.840]   It's not a big difference.
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.840]   The Intel, the blue.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.840]   Qualcomm makes better modems.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.520]   I mean, they invented a lot of technology that send them.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.200]   They just simply make better modems right now.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.760]   Where you'll notice the biggest difference is where the signal is weak.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:11.280]   The Qualcomm continues to get good speeds even in poor coverage areas.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.800]   And the trade off here is that if they went purely with Qualcomm modems like they used
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.880]   to, everybody was paying, even people outside the US was paying the CDMA tax.
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.040]   Because we don't need those CDMA radios.
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.600]   They don't do any good for us.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.600]   But because it was Qualcomm, Apple had to pay for them for every phone that it shipped
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.600]   anyway.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.560]   Apple eventually would like to do it themselves, right?
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.440]   I mean, they don't want to be beholden to either Qualcomm or Intel.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.960]   It's great that all those lawsuits are happening now, isn't it?
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.400]   Before Apple rolls out the C series modem chips or whatever.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.560]   Lord, for the L series.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.840]   All right.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.520]   So what's our advice then?
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.800]   If you're going to buy an iPhone, buy it unlocked.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.040]   Why not?
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.960]   Should you get the Verizon or should you just get the on?
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:58.040]   For a lot of people, the leasing programs, like the iPhone, buyer program or whatever
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.560]   the T-Mobile AT&T versions are, you pay like 30 bucks a month and you get a new phone
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.560]   every year.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.560]   I'm going to do that next time.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.360]   Because it doesn't cost anymore, right?
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.600]   If you get from Apple, do you get Apple care?
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.800]   Do you get that for free or do they build that in the price?
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.280]   Apple care plus, I believe it's for free.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.280]   I believe you get that additional.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.120]   And it's, yeah, and you're still at 0% financing.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.760]   And as long as you keep that phone in good shape or you get it repaired to acceptable
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:24.880]   shape, you trade it in at the, when the new one comes out and you just continue to pay
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.880]   that 25 bucks, 30 bucks a month every year.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.000]   A listener just, I mean, nameless.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:39.400]   So they bought the iPhone 10 and they popped out at Verizon at SIM and put in their AT&T
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.400]   one and it just worked fine.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.400]   We thought that that would work with A with Verizon.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.360]   So now I'm kind of like wishing I just bought a Verizon.
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.000]   That was always the advice by the, at least in the previous years, by the Verizon turns
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   out they're Verizon.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   You ever long run them off?
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.120]   Because you get to make an GSM and just unlocked because the FCC won't let them lock it.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.120]   That's in the US.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.880]   Well, there's, there's the tip for the day.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.000]   You haven't bought your 10 yet.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.960]   And it confirmed, well, it's been the tip for a couple of years now, but it confirms
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.200]   that it's the same for 10.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:10.720]   I say it all the time by the Verizon, but it confirms it for the 10, which I wasn't sure
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.840]   about because I thought the ECIM is complicating things.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.840]   All right.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:21.640]   I hate last week was a fun show because in the middle of the show, we learned about
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.520]   a flaw, fix the flaw and then it came back.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.520]   But we'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.520]   And that was only the first flaw.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.800]   I did not sleep much last week.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.800]   I bet not.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:35.040]   Well, we'll give you the skinny, the scoop and all of that.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.840]   And I was 11.2, which is out now.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.840]   So happy that we did.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:46.880]   And I'll tell you the story of how I reconditioned my 2012 15 inch MacBook Pro and it's great.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.360]   It's great.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.000]   It's like the old days.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.120]   It's the MacBook got intended.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:57.520]   I was going to, well, after Marco's column about the perfect Mac book, which is the,
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:01.600]   they still sell the 2015 edition on the Apple store without the touch bar with a 15 inch
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.680]   screen with a real keyboard.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.200]   And you have a lot of them and you have one right in front of you, in fact.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.200]   I have one farming.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.320]   And I said, oh, I should get one.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:14.760]   And John, John, Jim or B said, we got about a hundred of those.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.760]   Three.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.760]   Three.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:17.760]   Well, that's all right.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:22.920]   So my 2015 MacBook Pro just got just came back from service has a brand new battery and
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.960]   be and Lilith, Lilith 14, I think.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.720]   And just and because the battery is fused with the bottom plate, they also had to give
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:34.880]   me a new bottom plate, which means that the dent from the one bad thing I did with it
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.880]   is has been repaired.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:41.560]   So Lilith is her and because because the two of the cells were swollen, even though it's
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.080]   like well out of warranty, they did it for free.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.080]   Baby Lilith.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:52.440]   So I was I was so we had four because I took one home and mine was the one.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:55.400]   Remember, I had put all those comic book stickers on the keys.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.400]   Yes.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:02.100]   And I put I put a sticker on the front and everything, but I found out that the I fix
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.100]   it sponsor.
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:10.080]   I fix it kid has a spudger that's perfect for moving stickers from keys and I just got
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.080]   them all off.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.080]   Look, we got a hope.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:17.000]   What so actually I should trade in mind for the most recent of these, although I have
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.800]   to say mine's 2012.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.800]   It's an I seven.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.480]   Okay, caps out of 2.3 or something gigahertz.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.560]   It's fine.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.840]   I had upgraded it with another world computing SSD.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.400]   It has a mercury SSD.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.840]   It's great.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.240]   So this one is you have to go by serial number, right?
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.040]   Because they're all a 1998.
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.280]   Yeah, that is.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.040]   So which one which one's yours, John?
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.040]   Do you know?
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.040]   Do you have yours?
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.040]   So who's are these?
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.280]   Do we take them from people or are they just sitting around?
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.280]   They're kids.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.280]   They're kids about Mac books now.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:53.320]   They're kids without Mac books in that house.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.200]   These employees actually have acquired these.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.200]   Is there anything that's available?
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.200]   These are available.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.480]   No, those are available.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.600]   Let me look up the serial numbers because what's that's funny thing is they're all
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.760]   the same model number from 2012 to 2015.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.280]   But if you look at the serial number, you can see other equipped and all that stuff.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:16.680]   And so get the find, go into your closet, find the best one, clean it up, peel off the
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.640]   stickers, reinstall high Sierra.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.040]   I don't, it's the whole, I'm still working on getting mine to really run as well as it
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.040]   did before high Sierra.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.720]   Oh, well, that's another story for another day.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.720]   Let's talk about that in a second.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.720]   But first word.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:36.360]   From our sponsor, I'll give you one one guess who our sponsor is.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.080]   I am magnetized lingley.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.080]   This is probably not good for microphones.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.480]   I was going to say, I don't know how, how does Leo sound now?
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:46.040]   It's like a little thing of like, I love my Joe B's.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.040]   These are the original gorilla pod.
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.080]   Do you know when the gorilla pod first came out?
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.880]   Take a guess.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:51.880]   Take a guess.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:52.880]   2003.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:18:00.880]   I can't, I want to say two, 2004 or five, 2003 to then four or five, 2008, 2006.
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.560]   So you guys are pretty close.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.560]   I'm impressed.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.560]   I remember when it came out.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.440]   Like cats go like, you didn't have a little eyes known forever.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.840]   Yeah, these are, these are them.
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:13.440]   So watch, you can, these, oh my God, do not do this at home.
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.640]   But these are socketed joints.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.480]   And they make them, by the way, I want to get the new, there's one that's aluminum,
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.480]   it's metal, right?
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.480]   I have that.
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.480]   Oh, it looks so beautiful.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.320]   It is like, it's like the jaw of life.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:27.880]   A jaw of camera, like you can, you can take an SLR and attach it to a pole.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:33.280]   So these, these are all socketed individually, these gorilla pod legs, which means you can
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.280]   bend them.
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:40.520]   And the one I have, which I really like, this is the grip type one, has magnetic feet.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:45.760]   So like when we were on, we were on the river cruise, I just glanted to the side of the
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.600]   boat and that the camera.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:52.000]   And they said, I have the, this is the camera attachment that holds any camera, right?
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   It's expandable.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.080]   And then on it, it has a little Bluetooth dongle.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.440]   So this is like the perfect selfie camera.
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.840]   10 million sold.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.440]   And they're getting better and better than new, the new designs, of course, feature their
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:08.280]   signature ball and socket joint legs, but now rubberized grip rings, stainless steel
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.080]   reinforced ball heads, a 90 degree tilt, they're getting better and better heads, which is
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.080]   really nice.
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:17.160]   Although these are quarter 20 threads, so you could use any kind of head, I guess you
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:22.040]   want it on these, but they've got some really great 90 degree tilt heads for landscape
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:27.160]   or portrait modes, the flexible legs wrap around objects, unlimited angles, precise
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:33.600]   composition control, stability on, even on uneven surfaces.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.440]   And they have, I mean, they have them for all sizes.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:41.000]   They have them for point and shoots for action cameras, like the GoPros three, if you have
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.560]   a GoPro and you don't have a Jobe, you're missing the boat.
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:49.720]   And I really liked the fact that I can put my iPhone or any phone in my grip type and
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.840]   it's just ready to go.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.840]   It's just ready to go.
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.000]   They have for DSLRs too.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.800]   You come out, you know, it's a really good use.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.280]   I don't know if you've done this.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.520]   You can also mount strobes on these.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.520]   And they're so inexpensive.
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.400]   You could place strobes all over the place off camera.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.400]   Right.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.880]   So you can really have a nice portable lighting setup.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:14.120]   Any device with a quarter 20 mount, grip it, wrap it, stand it, choose the Gorillipod
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.600]   that's right for you at Jobe.com.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.680]   And don't forget if you use the offer code TWIT, they're even more affordable.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.920]   Actually I got to do that because I want to get the metal one.
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:23.920]   Your phone is sliding.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.920]   My phone is what?
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.040]   Oh, look at that.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.040]   It's just sliding.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.600]   You think it'll fall off the table at some point?
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.080]   I better put it in a Jobe grip type right here.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.080]   There you go.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.080]   Now it's not going anywhere.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:38.360]   I can even attach it to the microphone with its magnetic legs.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:42.720]   Now the mic's going to fall over, but the camera phone is going to be safe.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.320]   Jobe.com 15% off.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.560]   Actually, I'm going to take advantage of that and get the nice one.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.200]   I've got them for my God, kids.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.200]   They love them.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.200]   They're great.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.200]   They're so great.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.200]   They just put them everywhere.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.200]   I love them.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:00.640]   I always have one in my bag because whatever it is I need to do by putting my camera somewhere
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.720]   whether I need it to be a tripod, whether I need it to be something that will let me
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:09.800]   hang it from above or it's just I've even often used it for as like an impromptu iPad
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.200]   stand or an iPhone stand.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.200]   Oh yeah.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.960]   You can bend the feet into little hooks and put on the top of the seat back in front of
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:16.960]   you.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.200]   It really earns its money back and it's well worth buying the real thing.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:26.520]   I have used them since the first time they were shown in CES and I have used them on
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.520]   every continent except Antarctica.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.520]   I'm in Antarctica.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.520]   Yeah, me neither.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:31.520]   That's my last continent.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.360]   And then you're right everywhere I go.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.680]   This is what this is the one I carry in my briefcase because I have it at all times and

[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:52.360]   I have an Instagram friend who uses those puts them on something like one mountaintop and
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:56.920]   then runs to another mountaintop and takes is like your opal with his apple watch remotely
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:57.920]   and it's amazing.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:58.920]   Yes.

[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.400]   Let's talk about last week.
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:57.360]   So last week, well it turns out and actually the guy who we mentioned the tweet that Lemme
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:01.480]   Orhan put out the Turkish developer.
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.200]   We saw it Lemme Orhan Ariana.
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.040]   I'm assuming that's how you pronounce it tweeted.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.040]   Dear apple support.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.080]   We notice a huge security issue in high Sierra.
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.560]   Anyone can log in his route with an empty password.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.280]   If you click on the login button several times, are you aware of it, Apple?
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:20.200]   You got a lot of heat saying that's not how you reveal a security flaw.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:25.240]   So he wrote a medium post saying, Hey, let me explain.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:31.320]   We had we had actually found this issue a couple of weeks before there were mentions
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.800]   even earlier November 13th in the apple developer forum.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:40.200]   We informed apple about it on November 23rd.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.720]   Apple either hadn't noticed or hadn't replied or hadn't said anything.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:51.560]   And he found out because he says he works at Turkish software craftsmanship, I guess.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:58.800]   He said that my IT team, my infrastructure staff informed me they had to set up a route
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.240]   password on my Mac.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.120]   So it won't have the issue and he saw it.
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.440]   He said, what?
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.200]   So he decided to tweet it.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.320]   And I'm kind of glad he tweeted it because we were able.
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.200]   During the show, we came up with a mitigation.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.080]   I made a little more complicated and then had to be a couple of people tweeted me, you
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.160]   know, you could just type that all in one line, give your route account.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:28.080]   If it is active, a password by typing pseudo password PASW root and then hit return.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:34.080]   But the issue is normally actually, I think kind of Renee, you went through this all in
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:40.200]   iMORTIC, and you spent a long time, another sleepless night for poor Renee.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:44.800]   The route account isn't enabled on a Macintosh.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:49.720]   So you wouldn't normally even be able, if it were enabled, was it always a blank password?
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:50.720]   I guess it would be.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:51.720]   No.
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:57.360]   Well, if you enable it, I believe it forces you to set a password when you enable it.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.520]   So this was strange.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:04.640]   So it wasn't enabled, but if you, the first time you tried to, like you just pressed return
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:10.440]   or you clicked login, it would then basically burn in that login attempt and make it enabled
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.440]   with no password.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.440]   Oh, that's what happened.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.440]   That's why it was a checkpoint.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.040]   That's why it went, uh, uh, uh, okay.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.840]   And from then on, it would do it with the blank one.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:25.440]   And then I noticed, you know, of course it could be used to log into your machine if
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.320]   you had a multi user login turned on, right?
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.320]   Yes.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.360]   But you had some people were saying, like I tried, I just could not get other to show
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.360]   up.
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.520]   But some people were saying you'd go into guest and then if you were smart, you could escalate
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.520]   from the guest account.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.520]   Okay.
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.720]   If you had guest enabled, like it was just, there were so many things and if somebody,
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:44.400]   if you had file vault, it would prevent it from unlocking maybe, but you never want like
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.560]   a lot of uncertainty around these situations.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:53.720]   And I did, when I set up the 15 inch power book, I noticed the default is to have the
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.920]   other enabled.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:59.520]   So you would have, I think file vault kills that when you turn on fire on fire.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.280]   Uh, so machines that had fun.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.760]   Cause when I before I logged into it, just see what was on there before I, you know,
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:07.760]   refreshed it.
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:11.060]   Uh, and it didn't, it didn't, I couldn't figure out how to get a multiple, another
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:12.060]   user.
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:13.060]   Yeah.
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.060]   So I could try the root password.
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:18.120]   So Apple within 18 hours, thank you for tweeting this because Apple was ignoring it
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:23.000]   and had ignored it for at least two weeks within 18 hours of lemme's tweet.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   They fixed it.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.160]   That was absolutely the right thing to do because we often talk about how there's news
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.560]   that something's been compromised.
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:34.160]   There's a security flaw and it always turns out to be something like, well, if you can
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:39.840]   get someone to do this under their own account and then do this, then you will display this
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.840]   payload.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.200]   This was as simple as just logging his route.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.200]   No password.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.200]   Do it a couple of times.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.760]   It doesn't work the first time and you're in that was so simple that you really had no
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:52.640]   choice but to raise the alarm, make sure people locked down their, their machines.
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:57.240]   Until Apple puts out a bug fix because it was that big a problem.
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.680]   That was the barn doors way open.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:04.880]   We went around the studio and the offices and made sure that everybody with a Mac had
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.520]   fixed it.
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:10.600]   Not with the Apple patch but with the workaround which was to assign a password for the root
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.520]   user which is a fairly easy thing to do.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.560]   I mean, you could do it in just a couple of lines.
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:19.520]   Generally, always look at ways to kind of close up your security holes, you know, like
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:23.360]   getting rid of the other, getting rid of, you know, unless you really need that, turn
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.360]   that stuff off.
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.360]   Turn on the video.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.360]   It's a quick sign.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.360]   It's really tight.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.800]   And like, I'm always amazed people who leave their phone unlocked, you know, like without
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:32.800]   a passcode.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:33.800]   Yes.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.800]   I think it's more than half but Apple's changed that because they now require you to set a
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.200]   passcode right when you set up the phone.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.840]   There are a lot of things for Apple Pay, for Touch ID, for Face ID, which has changed
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:43.840]   the numbers to Bastock.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.760]   And still then I think most people didn't.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.120]   They said, I just want to swipe up.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.120]   I just want to unlock.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.480]   Or they do it when they travel, but they would turn it back off again when they got home or
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.480]   something.
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.480]   I mean, it's just such a huge, I mean, it's just your, I mean, especially if your mail's
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:57.920]   coming in there and everything else.
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:02.160]   And especially now that there's so much tied up there that you can really have a horrible
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.080]   day if someone gets old of that.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.880]   And so that phone especially.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.720]   So then Apple update.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.640]   So Apple pushed out a fix, which it's interesting.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.040]   Oh, Leo, before we go, I should just say that there are.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:17.000]   So it's not that people ignored it.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.920]   The people were actually, like the people who could actually do something about it did
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:20.920]   not know about it.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.680]   They were stunned and surprised like everybody else.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.680]   And there are ways to communicate with them, but they just, nobody was bothering to check
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.680]   that forum.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.360]   And I don't know how he communicated with them, but Apple does have like a security hotline
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.920]   that you can get through to the security team.
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.080]   And they are usually very responsible about that.
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.080]   Had they done that, it probably wouldn't fix sooner.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.080]   They should have.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.040]   But you can't expect everybody to know about those things either.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.040]   So it's sort of a.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:45.280]   But it's, I have to say that there's some part of the infrastructure at Apple that I
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:50.480]   think needs a lot of work is how they communicate with the people who keep their software and
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.400]   systems running.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:57.480]   This is the fact that Apple didn't even reply to say, we have heard you and we're working
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:02.080]   on it, even if they don't get, even if they don't get, you know, reply from Tim Cook saying,
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.080]   thank you, thank you, thank you.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.560]   Here's a thousand dollar iTunes store credit.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.680]   It kind of falls in line with I've been hearing from a bunch of people on a bunch of different
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:17.840]   areas about how there seems to be a thicker wall between people who need to communicate
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:18.840]   with Apple.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.840]   I'm not just talking about users.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:24.120]   We're talking about people at much higher levels and being able to at least get confirmation
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.280]   that what they've said has been heard.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.280]   Okay.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:31.800]   Even when they say, even when they say something that they, that Apple took to heart, not bothering
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:34.360]   to get a response that says, yep, we heard you and we're working on it.
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.960]   So you're basically people are left to think what happened.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:37.960]   Let me just point out.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:38.960]   I just Googled.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.480]   How do I tell Apple about a security flaw?
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:48.920]   And the number two result is contact Apple about security issues with all the information
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:52.720]   you need to let them know there's a problem.
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.720]   Yes.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:57.360]   So it isn't that hard to figure out.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.360]   It's frustrating.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:02.240]   There are people who are like emailing top Apple executives about do it.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:06.880]   Why can't I mean my wife both register face ID and then suddenly they're getting a response
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:11.720]   back from the top person and like, I have some other things to do.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.920]   Although, if you mail Tim Cook, he probably put Senate to the right.
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.160]   You catch him on the treadmill.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.360]   Like he'll respond in a meeting.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.360]   He'll catch back.
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.360]   He's very responsive.
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.360]   Always cleaning his office.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.720]   Clover machine has to be sparkling Alex.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.720]   That's to be sparkling.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:26.720]   Yes.
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:31.080]   Security and privacy researchers to report security or privacy issues that affect Apple
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:35.280]   products, contact product dash security at apple.com.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:41.240]   And if you want to encrypt it, here's our public key for PGP so we can encrypt it.
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:44.040]   There's also a security announced mailing list.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:47.080]   There's ways to tell them.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:51.280]   So no, and it's absolutely the job to do it, but they're red team and they're security
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.280]   team.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:55.920]   They were up all night and they would probably have rather fixed it the week before they
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.920]   had to come in.
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:03.360]   But then, so first of all, the way they patched it was interesting because it was a silent
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.360]   update.
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.360]   Yes.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.280]   Is that how often does Apple do that?
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.280]   Once before.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.280]   Once before.
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.280]   Once before.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.280]   So you didn't have to look for it.
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.280]   You didn't have to know about it.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:16.000]   You didn't even have to re-book your machine.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   It would just appear.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   You could.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.960]   So you could do it right away, but they said later that afternoon it would start pushing
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:22.960]   life.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.400]   Especially because it was tweeted out.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.160]   They were just like, we got to.
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:30.440]   I love it though that they can fix stuff like that silently because that is really an important
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.440]   capability.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:36.120]   It's a capability for instance, when we talk about Internet of Things devices, we say one
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:40.520]   of the critical things that all Internet of Things devices must have, especially routers,
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.960]   is automatic updates that can be pushed out by the manufacturer.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:47.880]   Otherwise, you have to figure it out, check it, update it.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:51.320]   Of course, eventually someone will hack into the thing that's updating them all.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.880]   That has happened in the past actually.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:56.000]   Or there's a bug in the update which has happened in the past too.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   Never the.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.120]   Well, and that's why Apple is very judicious about using it.
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.880]   They've only used it twice now.
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:04.320]   You know, this is a good occasion for using that.
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.480]   There is some discussion about that because you're absolutely right and that security
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:11.640]   updates are super important for IoT devices, particularly as they get cheaper and cheaper
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.240]   and you don't know where a lot of these chipsets are coming from.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:18.880]   But the problem is that if you build in a mechanism so that an automatic update can
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:24.280]   happen, then a bad person can hijack that system to push a malware vested update to
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.280]   the device too.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:30.360]   So it's not quite as simple as that, but I think we're going to have to have a big meltdown
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:34.600]   before people really understand that when they put a smart fridge in their house, it
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:39.040]   doesn't mean that you just get the barcode reader for your food.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:43.000]   It means that you also get another point of access, another point of entry into your
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   house for bad people.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.360]   Well, then I'll point out that you can disable it.
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:49.200]   If you really don't like the idea of Apple being able to force these upgrades, you can
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.200]   go in and disable the.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.200]   Where do you do that?
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.200]   It's in settings.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.560]   I'll pull it up and see where it is, but you can turn it off in your settings.
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:59.200]   Typically, we do that in an enterprise where the IT department wants to really keep an eye
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.200]   on updates.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:04.080]   Yeah, and manage the devices are all other ball of a managed device and their own policies
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.080]   and everything.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.080]   Yeah.
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:10.520]   Well, then Apple updated high Sierra and broke it.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:12.520]   Oops.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:18.520]   Because it went so fast, it probably wasn't in the, it wasn't in the, they reintroduced
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.520]   the field.
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.520]   It's a different team.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.240]   We have one team that fixed it and the other team that's just working on the update and
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.400]   that's a separate pipeline.
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.280]   So where do we stand now?
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.280]   Which should people do?
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.000]   I've done all the updates.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.840]   Is it still there?
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:38.080]   If so, if you did the, if you did the patch before you actually updated to the new version
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:41.560]   of high Sierra, then update new version of high Sierra would reverse the patch.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:45.600]   And I believe you had to reboot and then reapply the patch to make it all hunky-dory
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:46.600]   again.
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.320]   And it doesn't warn you that you have to reboot.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.320]   So that's the word.
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.320]   No.
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:54.200]   So I think the problem here is that what Apple said that it was, the update was required
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.720]   before you run this patch, but they didn't force it.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:00.040]   And I think if they had forced it or said you need to update to, you know, high Sierra
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:04.400]   13.2 or whatever it was first, then they applied the patch.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.400]   It would have been fine.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.240]   But because the patch required it, but didn't enforce it, some people use, ran the patch
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:12.840]   on the older version of high Sierra and then software update did its thing and just overwrote
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.840]   the patch.
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:18.400]   So if you have 10, 13, one, that reopened the root bug, you can then go install the
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.400]   security fix.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.040]   And you'll have, by the way, you have to find it.
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:24.400]   You have to Google, you know, if you had 10, 13, one, it had the flaw.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:29.520]   And then if you updated, so did 13.2, but the patch was for 13.2.
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:34.800]   So if you ran the patch on 13.1, then installed 13.2, you just gave yourself the bug again.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.080]   And you'd have to, you'd have to, I think it wouldn't recognize a patch unless you reboot
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.360]   it first and then it would recognize actually available.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:44.440]   So is everybody fixed or no?
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:48.360]   I mean, for that, there's still the calendar bug that we'll talk about later.
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.360]   Yeah.
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.360]   For that, I believe.
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:54.240]   So should people just prophylactically reboot?
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:59.200]   It'd be one of the downsides of this update in place is that it doesn't reboot.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.400]   Like this update, the patch that hit everybody, it didn't force you to reboot.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.240]   Yeah, it couldn't reboot and it's usually a good practice to reboot anyway when you
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:09.760]   do these sorts of updates because you never know what processes they really hit.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.320]   So reboot, yeah, apply the patch.
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.560]   And at that point, you should be good.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.560]   And you can try it.
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:18.280]   If you have any doubt whatsoever, just lock your computer or just go to settings, security,
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:22.000]   give it a lock icon and try to log in with root blank password and make sure you're
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   protected.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.520]   That's probably a good thing for everybody just to do right now.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.720]   Go to your system preference panes.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:31.360]   And normally they're locked if you can unlock them with root blank.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.280]   And then you might want to.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.360]   But how do you get that patch?
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.440]   You have to search for Apple security patch.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.440]   Yeah.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.440]   Yeah.
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.240]   Or I believe, again, if you reboot, it should offer it up to you if you're not already running
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.240]   it.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.240]   Oh, it should do it.
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.240]   It should say, hey, we've got an update.
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.640]   So it shows up in the update.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:51.400]   I believe, I don't know if it's just a push notification because I ran it right away.
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.400]   That was my mistake.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.400]   And I can't go back and uninstall everything.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.800]   Here's what you should do.
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:59.200]   Search for security update 2017 001.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:11.200]   And or you can even just go directly to support.apple.com and go to the support note, ht 208 315, 208 315.
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.520]   And that will let you down.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:16.840]   It actually has all the information about it, but it will also let you download the update
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.320]   and manually apply.
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:24.640]   And so then in fact, even it even gives you a kind of a roundabout way of seeing if you
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:30.120]   have the problem using a command called what do we think the root thing was just a programmer
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:33.880]   just wanting to make it easy to do something while they were working?
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:37.400]   It might have been a test that they just didn't turn off again afterwards, like just
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.400]   a test condition.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.280]   And then they like they went on to the next thing and didn't go back and reverse it.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.280]   Right.
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:48.840]   Imagine that in inside Apple, they often have root enabled.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:54.000]   Just I don't know why, but sometimes you want to get in there and just like a poke, right?
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.040]   It just seems like it would be something that like you're working on something.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.440]   So you just kind of throw that in so you can just quickly get into whatever you need to
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.440]   do.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:03.760]   And it might be more complicated because the issue I don't know was it might be more complicated
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.320]   than that though, because it was a kind of a strange bug.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:10.320]   And sometimes it's future features that they're testing and they can't they don't talk about
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.880]   them because they're future features.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.880]   So we won't know frankly.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:18.120]   It's supposed to say that over the past few weeks, a lot of additions have been made to
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:23.560]   the standard iOS and Mac OS QA scripts that they run at Apple before they release something.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.960]   This was a profoundly dunder-headed move.
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.960]   And you've got to believe that one of the one of the monkey tests they run where they
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.760]   just run scripts to see if we can break this thing.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:36.720]   It's got to be here is every single dumb thing that we could have done to compromise
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:37.720]   the login screen.
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:41.080]   And they just found another dumb thing they forgot to test for.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:44.240]   I'm guessing they're going to test for that from now on.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.280]   Yeah, that's made it to the list.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:52.440]   So two weeks before they fixed it, it was mentioned in the support forms, but don't count on support
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:56.920]   forms being the way to notify Apple of anything, right?
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:57.920]   Call the security.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.640]   You can Google it.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:04.440]   It's not hard to do.
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.760]   So it should be fixed.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:13.160]   Everybody who's running high CR should reboot, just to reapply that patch in case.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:17.160]   Just test that little lock button until you're secure.
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.160]   Okay.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:27.440]   Apple has acquired a company I'm happy to say as a podcaster that does called Popup
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:33.960]   Archive that does what you call it, transcripts.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:41.400]   Not so not like I gather not for user readable reading, but searching for searching and discovery
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.640]   and categorization.
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:47.600]   This is really, really big because not only allow you to have like imagine having a Google
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:51.880]   style alert for a topic that you want to hear discussed.
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:56.480]   And you find out that someone someone you've never heard of had a two hour interview with
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:01.640]   David Letterman because they happen to live in the same Montana community.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:05.920]   And finally, and this podcast you never heard of is suddenly like front and center for you.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:11.440]   Or imagine it being able to do a Apple music style recommendations for here's here's some
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:15.720]   podcasts that we think you're going to be interested in based on the episodes that you
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.920]   hearted.
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:21.120]   We're not not just saying that not just going by the keywords are here's what here's the
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:27.320]   thing is is is and Macbreak weekly are categorized as but you have you seem to heart a lot of
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:31.720]   shows in which we're talking about Macintosh and Macintosh security flaws here are a bunch
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.480]   of other not just podcast but podcast episodes.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.640]   They're talking about subjects you seem to be interested in.
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:41.720]   So this could be such a cool tool for making the podcast app a lot more relevant than it
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:42.880]   has been for a while.
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:51.280]   Nicholas Kwa who writes a podcast newsletter for a Neiman lab called hot pod discovered
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.280]   this.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:56.000]   Yeah, I mean, we don't know what Apple's going to do with it, but it would be a nice
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.880]   feature to add to it.
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:58.880]   Let's not add.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:03.080]   Well, they're still rolling out the podcast analytics and this could also play into that.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:08.040]   It's just a bunch of data that hurt a podcast and you go when did they talk about this?
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.040]   Right.
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:13.000]   Being able to search for something and just it doesn't have to be it can be 85% accurate
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.600]   and still find what was that thousand dollar thing Alex recommended.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.160]   Oh, there's 900 of them.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.160]   Exactly.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:26.760]   It could also I mean with the little AI, it could auto chapter.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.080]   There's a lot of valuable things.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:31.720]   The problem is Apple often requires technologies and they use a little bit of it or maybe they
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:35.200]   just wanted the engineering team and you don't see it necessarily incorporated into it.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.200]   We'll see it soon.
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.200]   You know, a lot of times facing problem.
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:43.560]   You know, what we now saw in the iPhone 10 with the facial, you know, the an emojis.
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:47.880]   That was, you know, two years ago that they bought the company.
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:54.440]   The Wall Street Journal reports that Ireland and Apple have done a deal.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:41:02.600]   Remember the EU said, Hey, Ireland, you owe us $13 billion in euros, uncollected back taxes
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.600]   from Apple.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.000]   Ireland obviously doesn't want to pay that.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:14.080]   So they went to Apple and Apple has agreed to fund an escrow fund to put $15.46 billion
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:18.120]   in back taxes in an escrow fund pending appeals.
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:21.320]   I don't think the EU didn't say that Ireland owed them the money.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:25.600]   It just said that they had to they had to collect on it because it's I think they I
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.600]   my memory is they said you better give it to us.
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:32.680]   No, I believe the EU just we're going to find you.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:37.360]   But I think the EU is saying is telling Ireland that it has to collect that money because
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:42.720]   otherwise it creates an unfair playing field for European country.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:44.600]   I don't think you're asking for the money.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:48.960]   In its 2016 decision, the European Commission said tax arrangements that Ireland offered
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:55.560]   in April in 1991 and 2007 allowed Apple to pay annual tax rates of get this between
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:42:03.560]   0.005% and 1% on its profits for a decade.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:09.560]   The Commission had given Ireland until January 3rd of 2017 to recover the money.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:14.000]   So I think the ultimate like Ireland doesn't want the money because they want their relationship
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   with Apple.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.720]   They said I don't we don't want the money and this is the EU's that you have to take
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.480]   the money and then I don't want the money and Apple doesn't you know obviously want
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:21.480]   to pay the money.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:27.920]   Well, and Apple's moved away from the Irish the double Irish and to a new system to avoid
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:28.920]   taxation.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:32.600]   So I think that Ireland in the in the big in the biggest way to just get back at the EU
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.760]   should take that money and build payment pennies.
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.200]   No, no, no, no, because they don't have to pay.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.200]   They don't have to pay.
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.200]   It's their money.
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.200]   Ireland's money.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.200]   They're not the use on it.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:45.840]   So the Ireland should take that money and they should invest it into training centers
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:50.640]   that train in swift all over the country to make Ireland like you got 15 billion dollars.
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:51.640]   Yeah, there's a way to do that.
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.480]   I thought you were going to say invest in Bitcoin.
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:57.560]   No, no, no, no, no, but they should do it as a they could take that money and they could
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:03.160]   make Ireland like the center of you know every school every you know like an Ireland is
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.160]   not a very big country.
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.920]   I mean they could actually cover.
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:09.120]   They could build their own EU with that money to spill the second EU with Brussels.
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:15.080]   They could build this whole like Apple development thing inside of Ireland with that money.
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.080]   They won't do it.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.080]   They'll spend it on roads.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:18.080]   Everyone is.
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:23.640]   I mean, you also said that Luxembourg did the same thing for Amazon and owes $294 million
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:26.800]   or Amazon owes them 13 billion.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:27.800]   That's a lot of money.
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:28.800]   A couple cities with that.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.280]   I mean, it's yeah, it's exciting.
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.120]   So right now they don't have access to it.
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.120]   It's in an escrow camp.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:35.120]   Both Apple and Ireland are appealing.
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.120]   You'll take this.
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:37.120]   Well, soon.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:38.120]   I don't think the money is like.
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:40.720]   I don't think the money as long as they go to high school.
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:44.280]   I don't think I don't think an appeal is going to hold much water.
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.280]   It's pretty clear.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.280]   The EU is a very they're not going to bear on this.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.680]   That's an eight point of view.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:49.680]   Yeah.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.960]   So I think that money is shot.
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:55.800]   They're also very, very well invested in making sure that no one of their states can
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.040]   become a favorable tax haven compared to the rest of them.
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.560]   I think that's what's going on, right?
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.560]   They don't want to do that.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:05.840]   So if there are laws that say that that say that that Ireland has to collect these taxes
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:07.640]   but I'm saying, nope, we're cool.
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:11.120]   Any company who doesn't want to pay what they owe us, that's fine with us.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:15.320]   That puts them at a really serious advantage to all the other countries in the EU.
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:16.920]   I love the registers headline.
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:17.920]   The sun rose.
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:21.280]   You woke up and Qualcomm sued Apple three times.
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.280]   Yep.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:27.200]   Qualcomm is suing three more lawsuits pertaining to 16 additional patents.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:30.960]   They say Apple is using in its iPhones.
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:33.680]   And then of course, Apple's countersuing over other things.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:38.240]   And it's just, it's still, I think we concluded last time.
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.120]   It's a negotiating strategy tactic.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:48.840]   Maybe not the, maybe not the friendliest negotiating tactic, but Qualcomm wants to make their
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.640]   own modems and this is the way to soften the ground.
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:56.080]   And Qualcomm's filing, they actually quote Steve Jobs 1994 when he said Picasso had to
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:45:00.360]   say in good artist copy, great artist steel, and we have always been shameless about stealing
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:01.360]   great ideas.
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:04.040]   That's a little bit of a smoking gun.
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.040]   That's daring.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.840]   That's a way to go.
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:10.120]   Can you keep in mind that Picasso didn't run a photocopy machine?
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:11.960]   He was talking about artist draw inspiration.
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:16.720]   Yeah, but, but Jobs says specifically we've always been shameless, we being Apple about
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.160]   stealing great ideas.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.520]   I don't think he meant stealing pens, but maybe he did.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:24.320]   No, it's sort of like making, making the Mac after looking at the Xerox part machine.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:30.680]   And they pay your, there's the, there's the famous when the Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:34.480]   having that argument over, over Windows, like where Jobs like you stole every, you stole
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:39.960]   like windows from, from, from Apple and, and Bill says, as far as we're concerned, you,
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:45.680]   you, you stole from part, we stole your TV after you stole it from park or something
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.600]   close to that.
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:51.320]   Apple is going to stop accepting 32 bit Mac apps.
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:55.040]   They did that, of course, with iOS 11 on the iOS platform.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:58.000]   And now the same thing will happen starting January 1st.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:04.240]   So if you've got a 32 bit Mac app that's still on the Apple store, it might be time to update
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:05.240]   that.
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:06.640]   How hard can that be?
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.240]   It's mostly abandoned apps that are going to be lost.
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.240]   Right.
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:13.600]   Well, but I'll, I'll steal the only thing that I think might affect people is that sometimes
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.760]   you have old hardware that works just fine.
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:20.600]   We're talking about like a document scanner or an industrial piece of equipment that requires
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:24.400]   a piece of software that you paid someone to write for you, like eight or nine years ago.
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:28.360]   And the thing works perfectly fine, but now that you're going to have to choose between
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:33.520]   having all the security updates of a modern Mac or a modern Mac that will not even run
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:38.080]   an old version of the operating system and have being able to still use this document
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:42.800]   scanner or this industrial process or this, uh, this scientific test equipment.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:47.840]   So it can, it can be a really painful thing for people that have not been updating esoteric
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:49.400]   hardware on a frequent basis.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:52.800]   Now, of course, like, you know, Zeta, and the grubbin, when they abandoned, was that
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.440]   car, you hear rich seagull talk about how he's moved BB edit from every year of the
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:57.440]   Mac.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.440]   The same thing.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:00.360]   I mean, this, of course, you could download it.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:03.160]   You don't have to get it in the Mac store, but Apple does say the lack.
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:06.480]   This is the last Mac OS release to support.
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:10.120]   And I don't know what this means to support 32 bit apps without compromise.
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:14.240]   It doesn't mean they won't support it in going forward.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.240]   But this happened.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:18.840]   Remember that when you, when you loaded a 32 bit app on iOS 10, it said, oh, you better
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.080]   tell the developer this is good.
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:23.440]   This could slow down your iPad, which it didn't, what they should really say in that message
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:27.240]   is this app is going to stop working in the next version of iOS.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:29.480]   But I wish they had been a little clearer about that.
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:30.840]   Anyway, that's the warning now.
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:35.460]   We don't know what will happen in the next version of Mac OS, but, uh, there'll be some
[00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:36.460]   sort of compromise.
[00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:38.120]   Don't know what that is.
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:41.880]   Emulating it takes a small performance hit could be, could be emulators, could be that
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:45.300]   certain frameworks will not work anymore because they just not interested in keeping
[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:46.300]   you compatible.
[00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:50.100]   A lot of bad stuff can happen.
[00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:53.260]   So it's, it can be again, when I hear about problems like this, usually the reports I
[00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:57.700]   hear back are from education, medicine and science research.
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:02.220]   Because again, a lot of these, a lot of these organizations using custom built software,
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:05.060]   even custom built hardware to get things done.
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:09.900]   And now all of a sudden the system that they use to, to run a, to run a trained system
[00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:14.300]   has to be, is going to have to live with a bad vulnerability because I don't think it
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:15.300]   won't run at all.
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:16.860]   I think it won't run in the app store.
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.340]   So I think they just won't let you sell it.
[00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:20.100]   So if you're building your own, I think you're fine.
[00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:22.260]   I think that it, you just can't, you just can't.
[00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:24.900]   But, but it's, so there's that one thing, there's one sanction.
[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:29.780]   You can't get it in the app store, but they do say 32 bit apps will not, will run with
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:30.780]   this.
[00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:31.780]   Cause they're going to put an em, compromise.
[00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:32.780]   I bet you they're going to wrap it into an emulator.
[00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:35.780]   And so then it's going to be probably half the speed.
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:36.780]   Okay.
[00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:37.780]   We don't know.
[00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:38.780]   No, no, but yeah.
[00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:44.580]   If I'm running a power, if I'm running a 60 to a 40 processor, I'm kind of used to.
[00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:45.580]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:49.140]   The slow, the slow cookery, uh, contemplation.
[00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:54.060]   I showed it a brought to you by video blocks from story blocks.
[00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:56.060]   This is another product we are happy to use.
[00:48:56.060 --> 00:49:02.260]   We used to spend hundreds of dollars a month on, uh, on, uh, royalty free images and video
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:06.540]   clips and after effects, uh, templates, things like that.
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:14.780]   Until we found video blocks $149 a year, a year for unlimited stock media, including
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:21.580]   150,000 videos, a hundred thousand audio clips, 400,000 images, all the stock media you need.
[00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:25.020]   They have after effects, templates, motion backgrounds.
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:28.380]   And you also get that's, by the way, that all that content royalty free.
[00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:31.020]   You can use it for commercial or personal projects.
[00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:38.900]   You downloaded it's yours to keep and use forever $149 a year, but there's more.
[00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:40.940]   You also, they have a marketplace, which I love.
[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:41.940]   This is really nice.
[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:47.580]   This allows creators to sell directly to you and they keep a hundred percent of the money,
[00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:49.460]   but you will get discounts as a member.
[00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:53.020]   That's five million additional marketplace clips.
[00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:58.820]   So if you're doing, I mean, any kind of video, if you need a helicopter view of, of San Francisco
[00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:04.620]   at sunset, if you need motion backgrounds for your lower thirds or whatever, you use video
[00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:08.420]   blocks as we're even using no more footage with an ugly watermark.
[00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:10.060]   That should never happen.
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:11.940]   No older outdated footage.
[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:18.020]   Join the 90,000 customers, including NBC, National Geographic, the history channel, the
[00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:19.020]   travel channel.
[00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:22.220]   I've actually kind of made it a habit now to watch the credits at the end.
[00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:25.740]   They'll often say additional material provided by video blocks.
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:29.740]   I know what that means.
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:30.740]   Save yourself time effort.
[00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:32.140]   Save yourself a lot of money.

[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:38.380]   $149 a year unlimited.
[00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:40.260]   One flat rate.
[00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:41.260]   That's the way to do it.
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:43.060]   It's amazing they have not enough.
[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:44.060]   After Effects templates.
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:45.700]   So you're looking at it.
[00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:50.380]   You know, and it's just, it's really not worth trying to recreate the wheel most of the
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:51.380]   time.
[00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:52.900]   Like we throw, we use this stuff all the time.
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:55.700]   Anthony loves this because he's, we're always saying, Anthony, we need to know.
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:59.140]   We need to know motion background for the holidays or whatever.
[00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:00.140]   Yeah.
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:02.300]   Videoblocks comes from Storyblocks.
[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:07.500]   And it's available right now at videoblocks.com/macbreak.
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:11.540]   Great price.
[00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:12.540]   Let's see.
[00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:15.700]   Oh, lots of stuff here.
[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:21.780]   We got a lot of little stories here we'll go through.
[00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:24.140]   I, I don't know where it was.
[00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:25.140]   Oh yeah.
[00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:30.260]   So, I think it says 1.8 million developers in China.
[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:33.420]   1.8 million developers in China and Apple has paid out.
[00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:34.420]   What was the number?
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:35.700]   I'm trying to look 17.
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:36.700]   Some huge number.
[00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:38.300]   Am I looking at the wrong story?
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:39.300]   16.9 billion dollars.
[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:40.300]   Whoa.
[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:41.300]   There he is.
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:42.300]   17 billion from the Chinese.
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:43.980]   That's a lot of dim sum.
[00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:45.940]   That's a lot of dim sum.
[00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:50.220]   25% of total global app store earnings coming out of China.
[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:52.860]   And this is why it's such an important market, isn't it?
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:58.300]   Because if, by the way, if they've paid 17 billion, that means Apple's made what?
[00:51:58.300 --> 00:51:59.300]   Three or four billion?
[00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:00.300]   Five.
[00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:01.300]   Five.
[00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:02.300]   That's right.
[00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:03.300]   Five billion.
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:04.300]   I'm moving one by five and some change.
[00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:05.300]   From China, but it's not changed.
[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:06.300]   It's a billion.
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:07.300]   Yeah.
[00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:08.540]   That's a lot of pennies.
[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:09.540]   Yeah.
[00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:15.340]   And, you know, it's a two way street because Apple obviously wants to be in China benefits
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:17.940]   from China, but Apple's an important brand in China.
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:27.060]   So I think Tim is using some of that leverage to encourage China to maybe open up a little
[00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:28.060]   bit.
[00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:31.300]   Well, I mean, Apple hasn't made their hardware available to China than any more than any
[00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:32.300]   more than they do have in the United States.
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:36.260]   In fact, this is one of the big reasons that Apple fights the US requirements for--
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:38.020]   They don't want it to have to do it for others.
[00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:39.020]   Yeah.
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:41.940]   As soon as they allow it, as soon as they help the FBI, they're going to have to help the
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:42.940]   Chinese government.
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:47.460]   Like it's-- it is-- they won't be able to get past that.
[00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:52.980]   Tim was at a conference-- well, it's funny because the headline from Bloomberg says,
[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:58.020]   "China promotes censorship at this conference."
[00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:02.500]   Tim Cook speaks a China event that promotes censored internet, but Tim said, "The theme
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:08.380]   of this conference developing a digital economy for openness and shared benefits is a vision
[00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:09.380]   we at Apple share."
[00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:12.900]   And you can debate the policy or not, but Apple is pretty consistent about they believe
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:15.540]   that they have to engage, that they cannot affect change if they don't engage.
[00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:17.100]   And I know people have different opinions on that.
[00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:19.100]   Some people think that you're reinforcing it if you engage.
[00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:22.660]   Some people believe that it's better if you starve them out, but everywhere in the world
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:25.940]   that Apple possibly can, they try to stay engaged and move things in the direction that
[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:26.940]   they want.
[00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:30.020]   It's just what Tim Cook's Apple believes is the right thing to do.
[00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:32.980]   Google, interestingly enough, was also at this Wu-Jian conference.
[00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:36.700]   Google, as you know, has taken kind of the opposite road like, "We're not going to
[00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:38.260]   deal in China.
[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:39.260]   We're not going to-- we're not going to--"
[00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:40.460]   It's harder when you're a service.
[00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:42.660]   Like, Apple's had some of their services blocked as well.
[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:46.260]   It's easier to sell atoms than it is to stream bits in China.
[00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:47.260]   Yeah.
[00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:52.060]   It's-- I think this is going to be a really big problem for Apple in the future, maybe
[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:57.340]   even the near future, because China, they are putting journalists in jail.
[00:53:57.340 --> 00:54:02.540]   China is scrubbing, trying to-- there was a-- earlier this year, someone named a speech
[00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:09.100]   as a beetle after the leader, and they try to have all that scrub because it's an aggressive
[00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:11.020]   form of beetle.
[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:16.900]   They're trying to create support for a-- they've mentioned about a idea about having a-- every
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:19.220]   citizen on the internet has to be identified.
[00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:20.580]   They have to use their real names.
[00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:24.660]   And also, developing a sort of a social rank for each one of them.
[00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:27.460]   And that's-- we're not just talking about, "Oh, no, you didn't just-- you didn't post
[00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:28.460]   Nazi things.
[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:30.420]   You didn't attack people on the internet."
[00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:33.180]   We're also including things like, "How loyal are you to the party?
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:39.660]   How have you been visiting sites that we regard as a threat to the current leadership?"
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:43.780]   And that sort of stuff can affect your ability to get housing, to get-- to get jobs, to get
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:45.500]   medical stuff.
[00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:50.300]   And all this-- a lot of this stuff is going to require devices and services to support
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:53.860]   whatever protocols, whatever APIs they're going to need to support it.
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:58.020]   There's going to be a time when their-- Apple is going to have to say, "We are perfectly
[00:54:58.020 --> 00:54:59.020]   fine.
[00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:00.020]   We really want to sell apps.
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:03.660]   We really want to sell iPhones in your country, whatever you want to do to your journalists,
[00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:05.180]   whatever you want to do to your citizens.
[00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:06.180]   We are perfectly cool.
[00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:08.140]   We will help you out with that."
[00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:11.180]   Or they're going to have to say, "No, you're going to have to stick it."
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:15.180]   This is a little bit worrying the speech that he gave because, you know for a fact that
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:20.620]   he gave the keynote and you know for a fact that that had to be screened carefully before
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:23.460]   he was allowed to give that presentation.
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:30.620]   And he didn't say anything-- there were words that were carefully chosen that basically
[00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:35.500]   said that we are partners with China.
[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:41.260]   There was a taste of support for what China is doing and that there is room for Apple's
[00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:45.380]   point of view and China's point of view in the same marketplace.
[00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:51.860]   But at the same time, China was giving the wrong keynotes there and talking about how
[00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:57.380]   we will never allow the internet to create a situation that will harm China.
[00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:00.380]   And by China, they were talking about the leadership and the party.
[00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:05.380]   So I'm not willing to vilify Apple for participating in this.
[00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:11.940]   I'm just saying that as much as I respect the point of view that you have to work-- there's
[00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:19.900]   a point-- you have to start off by trying to work with an opposing force or a government
[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:24.820]   to see if you can influence them positively, but there is going to be a point at which you're
[00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:27.260]   going to have to tell them to go stick it.
[00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:34.260]   And I want this point to happen before Apple decides that this is way too big a market
[00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:38.740]   because at that point, I'm not going to believe them when they say that we can affect positive
[00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:40.020]   change from within.
[00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:43.860]   I'm going to start to suspect that they just don't want to say no to all the money they're
[00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:48.140]   making in a market and they don't want to say goodbye to-- they don't want to lose sales
[00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:52.300]   to Huawei and other actual Chinese manufacturers at this point.
[00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:56.580]   It's a very, very tricky line and they can't try to play both sides of the fence.
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:59.820]   But it's interesting.
[00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:05.140]   This kind of mirrors the way we deal with North Korea.
[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:13.180]   I think that it is better to be in conversation than to be at odds and to recognize that China's
[00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:17.460]   interests are specifically for China's needs.
[00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:23.300]   You say it's to support the Chinese Communist Party and the Politburo, but I think it's become
[00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:30.340]   clear as China makes this gradual turn towards capitalism and openness that the leadership
[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:35.460]   there-- and I'm not sure about the new premier, but the leadership there understands that it
[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:40.540]   would even like to have an open society but is worried about the risks and such a thing.
[00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:45.020]   They talk about cybersecurity and so forth.
[00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:51.460]   I think that the best way to do that is to help them understand the value of openness
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:52.460]   in terms of--
[00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:55.140]   I think that's what people are trying to do.
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:58.140]   They're not going to change it.
[00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:05.300]   The general secretary is not a moral leader and he's not a cult of personality by any
[00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:06.300]   side.
[00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:07.300]   No, Mao.
[00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:11.180]   No, ex-an, again, it's not a situation like that.
[00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:16.460]   But nonetheless, the fact that you can quash something on the internet that might be interpreted
[00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:21.700]   as-- Xi Jinping, I'm sorry, I'm mispronouncing his name.
[00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:24.500]   I read about it, but I don't hear people talking about it.
[00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:25.500]   Xi Jinping.
[00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:26.500]   Xi Jinping.
[00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:27.500]   I'm sorry about that.
[00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:31.900]   But yeah, it's the fact that they would want to censor something innocuous like someone
[00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:34.740]   named a beetle after him.
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:37.980]   And I know there are more dimensions to that, but that's the sort of thing that a more open
[00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:39.220]   society would shrug off.
[00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:41.620]   I don't think that they want to become more open.
[00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:45.780]   I think that they want to continue their current system, but while acknowledging that
[00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:48.940]   the internet is going to make that much, much more difficult, and they're not going to answer
[00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:50.740]   to that by becoming more open.
[00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:55.060]   I think they're going to answer to that by creating more technological solutions that
[00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:59.220]   allow them to control what happens, what their citizens do with the internet, within
[00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:02.060]   their own borders, and even to some extent, outside of their own borders.
[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:03.060]   Xi Jinping.
[00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:07.740]   So do you think Tim Cook should not have done the keynote at the WIC?
[00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:11.060]   I don't think that he should have used that opportunity.
[00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:18.740]   Again, I have to guess that his words were screened by outside parties, and he was allowed
[00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:20.220]   to say what he wants to say.
[00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:26.100]   I think delivering the keynote is problematic in that the entire conference, this internet
[00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:31.540]   conference they hosted, gives credibility to the Chinese government's point of view on
[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:36.900]   what can happen to the internet in China, what they're allowed to do.
[00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:42.220]   I do think that if it means that he can have meaningful talks with party leadership about
[00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:46.860]   what they can expect from their partners, or what they certainly can't expect from their
[00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:47.860]   partners.
[00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:51.060]   We got to hear the keynote, but we didn't get to hear about any of the conversations behind
[00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:52.900]   the scenes that led up to it or followed it.
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:55.860]   I don't think at this point it was a bad thing for him to have done.
[00:59:55.860 --> 01:00:00.500]   But like I said, there's going to have to be a time where Apple makes it really, really
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:05.380]   clear that there is a line somewhere we will not cross, and we are willing to abandon this
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:09.900]   market if they ask us to do something that is against our principles and the principles
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:12.180]   of our users worldwide.
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:14.180]   Xi Jinping.
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:15.660]   Well said.
[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:24.380]   Apple has classified the Mac Minis released through mid 2011 as vintage and obsolete.
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:26.180]   These are the first Mac Minis.
[01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:28.700]   It's because of the acid wash.
[01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:34.940]   The bell bottom Mac for the first with the thunderbolt port, the first without optical
[01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:38.700]   disk drives, but not the most recent Mac Minis.
[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:40.700]   So those are most recent.
[01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:42.620]   They're getting closer.
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:45.180]   They haven't really they haven't updated the Mac Mini in one thousand.
[01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:47.180]   The last one is obsolete.
[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:48.500]   That would be that'll be amazing.
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:49.500]   Yeah.
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:50.500]   That way.
[01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:56.540]   So what it does though, yeah, it starts the clock ticking for the three year old, almost
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:59.460]   four year old Mac Mini.
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:03.180]   Since this six year old Mac Mini has now been obsolete.
[01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:06.540]   Pouring one out for it.
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:09.340]   Tim Cook said it's an important part of the product lineup.
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:10.340]   Yeah.
[01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:11.420]   I hope he means it.
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:14.580]   I think we're going to see new Macs next year.
[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:20.780]   We're going to see, I hope sometime this month, the iMac Pro and then maybe a new Mac.
[01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:24.860]   We know a new Mac Pro in 2018 and maybe a new Mac Mini.
[01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:26.540]   I want a new Mac Mini.
[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:28.940]   That's all I'm going to say.
[01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:29.940]   I'm hoping to see.
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:30.940]   It's important product.
[01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:31.940]   Yeah.
[01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:34.420]   I mean, I think that we use a lot of Mac Minis.
[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:36.220]   They're just great glue for us.
[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:37.300]   I don't think we use them as a regular.
[01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:42.980]   Would you buy today the most recent Mac Mini, which is three years out of date?
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:43.980]   Yes.
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:45.780]   It's because it's still useful.
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:47.060]   So we rack them.
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:49.460]   So a lot of them are.
[01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:54.340]   The other thing that I've used them for in the past is basically an Apple TV on steroids.
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:57.820]   It's just like you throw it and you connect it to your TV and now you've really got a
[01:01:57.820 --> 01:01:58.820]   full on computer.
[01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:01.580]   In fact, that was the first use I had for the Mac Mini.
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:05.980]   The Mac Mini was just, I want to have all my video and everything else and I want more
[01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:11.820]   than what my Apple TV provides and it works great that way.
[01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:17.500]   What we use them for, they've been even going back to 2011, they do what I need them to
[01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:18.500]   do.
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:21.180]   I mean, I'm not expecting them to be a high performance machine.
[01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:23.540]   I'm expecting them to do relatively straightforward.
[01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:24.540]   Yeah.
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:29.460]   For general users, I wouldn't recommend buying one for because only two things are possible
[01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:30.460]   in my mind.
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:33.340]   Either Apple is going to come up with something to replace the Mac Mini and it's going to
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:37.420]   be so much, it has to be so much better than something that's that old.
[01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:41.620]   Or Apple is never going to do anything with the Mac Mini ever again, which means that maybe
[01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:47.060]   you should, this is an opportunity to think about other little computers that cost not
[01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:51.020]   so much money that can take the place of a Mac Mini that maybe don't run the Macintosh
[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:55.740]   operating system or even switching to an iMac for that situation.
[01:02:55.740 --> 01:03:00.700]   I just don't think there's a lot of real return there because it's, I think it's so important
[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:06.620]   because it's, you don't know what you're going to use a computer for even when you think
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:08.140]   you know why you're buying it.
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:12.060]   You think that you, you're buying this Mac Mini because you need a good desktop computer
[01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:15.300]   because you don't want to keep, you don't want to do what I did and keep your MacBook
[01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:18.900]   plugged into the desk for so long that it kills the battery because it never gets the
[01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:20.700]   chance to discharge.
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:24.620]   But then you find out then that actually what you needed a small computer for this other
[01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:28.700]   room in the house or something that you can actually throw into a suitcase if you had to.
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:33.980]   Or you have upgraded to something else and you've decided that it would be nice to have
[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:39.180]   a Mac Mini in the living room that's running a Plex and running a media server and can run
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:40.940]   games on the big TV.
[01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:43.900]   And that's the sort of flexibility that you can get with a headless Mac.
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:50.060]   I don't think that, I don't think that the Mac would be quite as good an ecosystem if
[01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:54.300]   it did not have something in the lineup to take the place of a Mac Mini.
[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:58.060]   So I think that if Apple doesn't come up with something to replace the, to either upgrade
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:02.740]   or replace the Mac Mini in another year, I'm going to be so worried about the future of
[01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:03.740]   the Macintosh.
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:08.780]   But if they don't come up with something new for the Mac Mini in the next 12 months, I'm
[01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:13.260]   going to start really believing that somewhere in Cupertino there is a date circled on a
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:16.660]   calendar as a EOL for the entire Mac line.
[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:18.860]   Excuse me, the entire consumer Mac line.
[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:24.860]   I mean, for what, for what we use if Apple opened up the Apple TV slightly, we would be
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:26.660]   able to use Apple TVs to do what we do.
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:27.660]   Interesting.
[01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:31.220]   You know, like it wouldn't, you know, it's, it's a force generation.
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:37.500]   So we're, we're at the coffee, like is an eighth generation Intel processor.
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:43.060]   They're still selling the fourth generation dual core I7 in here for a thousand bucks
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:44.060]   on my dad.
[01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:45.060]   I don't think you buy it.
[01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:46.060]   I don't think you buy it.
[01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:47.060]   That's not even spec bumps.
[01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:50.220]   Not just this is a four year old or four generation old processor.
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:54.500]   If I look, I can understand them not replacing it until they really have a strong opinion
[01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:57.220]   about what to replace it with, but I just don't understand those spec bumps.
[01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:58.220]   Yeah.
[01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:01.140]   It's, it's terrible because remember that when they, when they upgrade processors, it's
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:02.780]   not just a faster processor.
[01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:07.260]   You get things like encryption and decryption happening on the CPU.
[01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:10.780]   You get things like video transcoding happening on the CPU.
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:15.540]   You get things like low power states on the CPU Intel builds these things to take as much
[01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:20.900]   of the load off the operating system as possible to make it as, as 2017 a computer as you can
[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:22.580]   build around the CPU.
[01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:28.180]   So when you're using it with earlier generation CPUs, it might benchmark as the same, but it's
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:29.900]   not going to be the same computer.
[01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:34.340]   And that's why you start when I met someone else's house and they're showing me their
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:40.020]   Intel nook and the, and you see computer and I'm like, Oh, wouldn't it be nice if my
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:41.020]   Mac could do that?
[01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:47.020]   Oh, wouldn't be my nice if my Mac mini was that power non hungry and it's like, Oh, please
[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:49.580]   don't make me get another Windows machine.
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:50.580]   Please don't.
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:54.340]   I do think that, and I think that does come down to, I mean, we, there are some incredible
[01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:59.020]   PCs now that you can buy on a board that are, I mean, I'm kind of amazed.
[01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:00.580]   And you can do all kinds of high end.
[01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:02.860]   It's just, we should run Mac OS on them.
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:03.860]   Exactly.
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:08.100]   I mean, this is, this gets back into me wishing that Apple would just let the OS, you know,
[01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:11.420]   let, let it fly free and just let it go.
[01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:12.420]   Let it go.
[01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:15.700]   You would revolutionize all these little, all these little computers that are like 200
[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:17.620]   per bucks and you can suddenly throw it on there.
[01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:21.580]   And you know, I think that, uh, because it's such a small part of Apple's, you know, income
[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:22.900]   and they'd still make the standard.
[01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:27.100]   I mean, people like us would still buy, well, I wouldn't, I'd buy, because I would want
[01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:30.780]   to buy beefy computers that I have five, you know, GPUs in and everything else and then
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:31.780]   throw the Mac on it.
[01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:34.500]   I mean, that would be cool.
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:38.140]   But, uh, but we have Linux and Windows for that.
[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:40.140]   Uh oh.
[01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:43.420]   We're being played off.
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:44.980]   So thank you to my agent.
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:54.620]   Thank you to my, uh, we dedicate this to the Mac OS.
[01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:57.980]   Let's make sure we talk over this so we don't get a YouTube take down.
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:59.580]   No, no, no, no.
[01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:02.580]   It's a single song as we say.
[01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:03.580]   Go on.
[01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:04.580]   We're learning this is educational.
[01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:05.580]   What's it?
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:06.580]   Keep it here.
[01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:07.580]   Evan knows I tried.
[01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:08.580]   Dude, let them be.
[01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:09.580]   Dude, let them be.
[01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:10.580]   Dude, let them be.
[01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:11.580]   Be the good girl.
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:12.580]   You always have Mac break.
[01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:13.580]   Please brought to you by.
[01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:14.580]   And shield.
[01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:15.580]   Dude.
[01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:16.580]   Feel.
[01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:17.580]   Everybody sing along.
[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:24.580]   Well, no.
[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:27.580]   Let it go.
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:32.580]   Hot holes of bark.
[01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:37.700]   I'm sorry.
[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:41.380]   And to all the parents who've heard that song one time too many.
[01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:42.380]   I have no children.
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:44.940]   I never heard that song all the way through.
[01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:47.940]   Or even the uncles who've heard that song one time.
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:48.940]   Yeah.
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:49.940]   Thank goodness.
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:50.940]   Yeah.
[01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:53.980]   My, my, my, well, Idina Mazzell just sings, she sings that loud enough for Andy to hear
[01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:55.740]   almost every opera.
[01:07:55.740 --> 01:08:03.060]   According to KGI securities, being she quote again, Apple will ship 25 million air pods
[01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:04.060]   in 2018.
[01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:05.620]   That's double its 2017 sales.
[01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:06.980]   Again, this is complete speculation.
[01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:09.660]   We don't know what Apple has sold.
[01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:10.660]   They have it.
[01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:11.660]   He's sitting there at the supply chain.
[01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:12.660]   He's counting them Leo.
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:14.220]   He's counting with the line.
[01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:19.540]   It has been, for at least was for, can you get an air pods today by going to the store?
[01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:20.540]   I know that is.
[01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:22.940]   It was a week last week on a checklist because it was about a week.
[01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:24.260]   But some of the stores have them in stock.
[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:26.220]   You can go to some stores and just get them.
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:31.620]   You know, and now having tried pretty much every Bluetooth headphone, including the horrible
[01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:38.620]   Google earbuds, that Apple did something magical with the, the air pod.
[01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:41.020]   And what's interesting is that because of beats and they haven't, I don't think Apple's
[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:42.380]   really taken advantage of it yet.
[01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:45.860]   But because of beats, Apple could be, you know, keep the W one to themselves and just keep
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:46.860]   on putting out.
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:50.060]   I mean, I would really prefer Apple to give us a couple of more choices.
[01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:53.100]   I don't, I know beats has one that is got the cable.
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:54.100]   Even just different sizes.
[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:55.100]   Yeah.
[01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:56.900]   Well, the over the ear, they have the noise canceling.
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:59.740]   They have the around the ear and they have the in ear and then the round and neck.
[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:00.740]   The canals are not.
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:01.740]   Those are all W one.
[01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:02.740]   So those are all wireless.
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:03.740]   Okay.
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:04.740]   Then I maybe I do have Pete's choices.
[01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:05.740]   Yeah.
[01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:06.740]   This is the job.
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:07.740]   These are the job.
[01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:08.740]   These are the job relates.
[01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:10.340]   These are for sport for runners.
[01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:11.340]   But they're very similar.
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:12.340]   It's got a case.
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:18.940]   It's got a Bluetooth headset in it, but these come with six, three different sizes of, you
[01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:24.420]   know, buds that you put in your ear plus three different sizes of the little inserts
[01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:26.060]   that go in your ear to hold it in.
[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:29.380]   They really hold in well, but what's interesting about these, they work much like the ear pods.
[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:32.900]   The sound quality is actually much better than the air pods and they're less expensive,
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:35.100]   but they do heart rate and they will do coaching.
[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:39.380]   So if you're a runner, you could put these in your ear and it will tell you what your
[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:40.380]   heart rate is.
[01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:43.500]   It will say you're at max, you're below max, you need to run harder.
[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:48.980]   And in fact, when you first install it, you have to change the ear buds and the inserts
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:51.980]   until you get a good fit and it can measure your heart rate.
[01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:53.140]   They say stand still.
[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:54.140]   Okay.
[01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:55.140]   That worked.
[01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:56.140]   Now run around.
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:57.140]   Jule your head.
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:58.300]   Let's make sure we can do it.
[01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:00.020]   And then they want to do a VO two max.
[01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:04.780]   So there's these things have some really interesting sensors in here.
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:08.620]   I would like to see Apple, you know, this is Jabra.
[01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:11.220]   I would like, I think Apple, there's the technology exists.
[01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:14.420]   Apple could do a little more health sensing in those air pods.
[01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:19.820]   I hope that next year we'll bring not just, you know, sales of the existing air pods,
[01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:21.020]   but new models of air pods.
[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:25.140]   It's interesting too, because there's an AR path where they can, because audio AR is
[01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:26.820]   probably more advanced than video AR right now.
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:30.380]   There's a lot that Apple could do with it, but there's also like health aspect that you
[01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:31.380]   mentioned.
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:33.460]   And it'd be interesting because Jeff Williams doesn't just run watch it Apple.
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:36.340]   He runs all of health and there's probably a lot of stuff that they're playing with.
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:38.580]   And I think my thing is with the beach ones is that they don't make any ones.
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:40.900]   They don't, that aren't connected, which drives me crazy.
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:41.900]   Like, I don't want to.
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:42.900]   Yeah, these are not connected.
[01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:44.820]   These, those aren't, but those aren't W one.
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:50.060]   Like that's, you know, I, W one doesn't make that these, you, once you pair them, it's
[01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:51.060]   no different.
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:52.060]   It's the same.
[01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:56.100]   It doesn't, you can, they have a Jabra app and use Bluetooth L8 to tell it the battery
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:57.100]   level.
[01:10:57.100 --> 01:10:58.100]   Right.
[01:10:58.100 --> 01:10:59.900]   I mean, you have, you have, you know, I don't know.
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:04.340]   I feel like, and these are, these are less expensive.
[01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:07.460]   I think the quality of the sound is much, much better too, especially if you get the
[01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:08.460]   inserts.
[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:09.460]   Right.
[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:10.740]   My, my only problem is I'm not a runner.
[01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:14.660]   So this also has something that the AirPods don't have here through.
[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:18.460]   So these seal much better than the AirPods and you can push a button that gives you
[01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:20.260]   background noise as well.
[01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:22.340]   I just feel like they could do better.
[01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:23.740]   There's, this stuff exists.
[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:24.740]   It's out there.
[01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:32.100]   Um, you know, I, I, I, yeah, I don't know why Jabra doesn't put the W one in, but, um,
[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:33.540]   it's funny to j.
[01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:37.340]   These are two 49, but yeah, the Elite Sport, but I was able to get them at one 49.
[01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:39.220]   I guess that, that deal is off now.
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:40.220]   Yeah.
[01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:41.220]   It must have been the cyber.
[01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:42.220]   Yeah.
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:43.220]   That was their black Friday deal.
[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:44.220]   So 149 was a great deal.
[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:45.820]   And is it come with all the inserts?
[01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:46.820]   Yeah.
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:48.620]   So you, that's the only negative.
[01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:53.460]   You have to spend some time matching the inserts to your ears to get the perfect fit.
[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:55.140]   But that's what you want to have the perfect fit.
[01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:56.140]   I know.
[01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:57.140]   Once you do, it's amazing.
[01:11:57.140 --> 01:11:59.980]   These things, they're as good as molded headphones.
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:03.460]   I can, I can dance around, run around.
[01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:05.740]   And you know, Apple, I think Apple is.
[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:14.140]   I wish I wish downable was here to give you music.
[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:15.140]   And they don't fall out.
[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:17.820]   And actually they don't look as dopey as the airpods.
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:20.820]   You know what I haven't tested is the microphone because it's not, it doesn't have anything
[01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:21.820]   coming out of your ear.
[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:25.100]   There's no real degree of dopiness when you have giant, but it's a plastic shoved in
[01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:26.100]   your ears.
[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:28.300]   It just looks like I have gauges in my ear canals.
[01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:30.940]   That's all it looks like you have those, one of those big loops that they play.
[01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:31.940]   Yeah.
[01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:35.060]   Like the, that the kids are, yeah, that would look like one of the kids.
[01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:37.140]   I'm, I love the basis.
[01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:38.340]   The base is amazing.
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:41.700]   It really points up where Apple could have done perhaps a little bit better with the
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:43.980]   air, air pod, not to knock the airpods.
[01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:44.980]   You're right.
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:46.660]   I mean, everything that the airpods do is great.
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:48.420]   You know, I got these two.
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:52.940]   What I would love to see though is what Google did with the Google buds, the earbuds.
[01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:56.100]   I would like to see Apple do the earbuds as you're walking around.
[01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:58.780]   If you get a notification to say, you got a notification, would you like me to read
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:12:59.780]   it to you?
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:00.780]   Yes.
[01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:01.780]   Would you like me to reply?
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:02.780]   Yes.
[01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:03.780]   You can do all of that.
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:07.660]   I would like to see in Apple's airpods.
[01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:08.660]   That is amazing.
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:13.140]   That stuff works extremely, and not, I'm not talking about the Google's product.
[01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:16.140]   I'm talking about the concept works extremely well.
[01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:17.140]   Yes.
[01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:19.700]   And something that you kind of wish, you kind of wonder why it hasn't happened to it three
[01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:23.900]   years ago, because we have all these assistants and it should be able to do more than just
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.580]   do a tap and then ask a question.
[01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:28.740]   It really should, you really should have the ability to tell it.
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:32.900]   Please do interrupt me for certain things because I just want to be taking a walk, but
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:37.700]   still not missing out on the house that I put a bit on because I was taking a walk
[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:41.540]   instead of sitting by the phone.
[01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:45.940]   I would want to, I talked about this on Twitter on Sunday and I wanted to ask you, Renee,
[01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:54.140]   about Elcom Soft's post, the iOS 11 horror story, the rise and fall of iOS security.
[01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:58.980]   If I can bottom line it, it's just, there've made some changes, particularly to the encryption
[01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:05.820]   password when you restore an iPhone or an iPad that favor convenience a little bit more and
[01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:07.100]   security a little bit less.
[01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:09.300]   Would you agree or is that not the case?
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:10.300]   No, absolutely.
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:11.300]   There's two areas.
[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:15.820]   One is the iTunes encrypted password because some people were saying, "Oh, I saw on the
[01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:16.820]   Internet.
[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:17.820]   It's a good idea to encrypt it."
[01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:20.740]   Or, "I want to do a quick setup and I know it'll bring passwords while I encrypt it."
[01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:24.980]   And then, at a password quickly, never remember it because the passcode is stored on the device.
[01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:26.900]   It's not as simple as switching a computer.
[01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:29.940]   It's very hard to make another backup after that.
[01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:33.060]   Also, a lot of people were just, there's so many passwords now.
[01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:36.500]   They were continuously forgetting their Apple ID because they made it a better password
[01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:37.500]   or something.
[01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:41.980]   What Apple did is with iOS 7 and the iPhone 5S, Apple went to what Steve Gibson called
[01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:43.380]   a crypto brick.
[01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:46.740]   They made it incredibly secure, but they started running into problems.
[01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:50.220]   This is that classic debate that I have to credit Dave Nainian for giving me sympathy
[01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:51.220]   to words.
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:53.500]   Originally, I was like, "No, security, Uber, everything.
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:54.500]   Just make it more secure."
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:56.140]   And Dave stopped me and said, "Wait a minute.
[01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:59.460]   For most human beings, they're not worried about their photos being stolen.
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:02.780]   They're worried about losing their photos or losing access to their photos."
[01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:05.620]   Yeah, we're not all under investigation by the FBI.
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:06.620]   No.
[01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:09.340]   So the changes here are entirely towards data preservation.
[01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:12.020]   You can have fail safe or you can have fail secure.
[01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:13.980]   And Apple, previously, everything was fail secure.
[01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:17.980]   Now, they've made several specific things fail safe so that there's a better chance
[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:18.980]   to recover.
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:23.020]   I was thinking that maybe I preferred, like for example, you can use passcode to unlock
[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:27.640]   your Apple ID and ElcomSoft was panicking saying that gives you the keys to everything.
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:32.220]   But if you have physical access to somebody's iPhone and their passcode, you can already
[01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:36.300]   go in access their email, access their SMS, get tokens, reset their...
[01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:38.460]   You have the keys to the kingdom.
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:43.500]   So this is just a slightly more convenient way for people to do those resets.
[01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:47.060]   And then I realized that I use a password instead of a passcode anyway, so I wouldn't
[01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:50.460]   even bother turning it off because no one's going to get my...
[01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:55.500]   It's really hard to get a passcode, ask the FBI in San Bernardino, but to get a strong
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:59.580]   password like Andy was talking about a couple weeks ago, there's just...
[01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:02.180]   Unless the nation's data is after you, you're probably...
[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:08.540]   And so what ElcomSoft says, and I think that this is great advice, regardless, is because
[01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:16.180]   now your passcode is that single barrier, make sure it's at least the six digit passcode
[01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:21.540]   and really we should all do what you do Renee, which is to use a password, the problem is
[01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:22.540]   you've got to enter it.
[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:25.700]   And especially with Face ID, I find myself entering my passcode a lot.
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:29.540]   Yeah, and also there's mobile device management that you can do.
[01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:33.580]   And for some people, it's an enterprise thing, but Apple also has iOS configurator in the
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:34.580]   Mac App Store.
[01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:38.540]   And if you're sophisticated enough to worry about this, you can probably download that
[01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:40.860]   and just play around with the settings and put it more to your...
[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:43.220]   So you could make it more secure, in other words, if you wanted to.
[01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:44.220]   Yeah.
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:45.220]   I mean, you can remove all sorts of the ability.
[01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:47.700]   You can remove the ability for people to change all sorts of things.
[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:53.980]   What I would suggest is, at least have a six digit passcode and consider having a password.
[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:56.820]   My kids' iPads are over-secure.
[01:16:56.820 --> 01:17:00.740]   As a parent, if I put them underneath my thing, I feel like I should be able to log in and
[01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:03.100]   reset their password because of course what they did is my kids...
[01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:04.580]   They forget it all the time.
[01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:10.380]   Well, my son was looking at my daughter's iPad because he changed the passcode and then
[01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:11.380]   he forgot it.
[01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:12.380]   Yeah.
[01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:16.060]   Rich Mogul, who's a really good security expert, he wrote an article for tidbits the other
[01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:20.220]   day on the same topic and he said, "As a security guy, and this is how I feel too,
[01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:23.340]   I don't like intellectually, I don't like some of these changes."
[01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:27.660]   But he had locked himself out of his daughter's iPad because he set it up and then did something
[01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:30.340]   else and didn't back it up and did this.
[01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:33.300]   And at some point, you have to realize that humans are on the other end of it and you have
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:34.300]   to try and get the best balance.
[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:36.540]   I mean, they've been sitting there on my couch for six months waiting for me to go to the
[01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:37.540]   Apple Store to get them reset.
[01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:39.540]   Like, I was just like, "There's no other way to do it."
[01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:40.700]   Well, you have an iPad on our ticket.
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:41.700]   You just...
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:43.380]   Same thing, I got to bring it to the Apple Store.
[01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:47.300]   And I'm like, "When am I going to have time to take it to the Apple Store?"
[01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:49.060]   You mentioned this from A in passing.
[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:55.820]   There was a little flaw in iOS 11.2 that if you had notifications turned on for certain
[01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:58.820]   third-party apps on December 2nd...
[01:17:58.820 --> 01:17:59.820]   Boom!
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:05.620]   It was iOS 11.1 and what happened was it was the calendar in the calendar system, which
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:06.620]   we've seen before.
[01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:10.740]   We've seen like daylight savings time bugs and we've seen some other bugs like...
[01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:13.620]   Apple Y, lowercase Y, your problems.
[01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:18.140]   But with this one, because of this error, local notifications would just send over and over
[01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:20.180]   again, fill up the...
[01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:21.900]   Fill up memory and crash springboard.
[01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:22.900]   Is that what happened?
[01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:25.100]   Okay, so it was a springboard crash.
[01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.460]   Yeah, most people can't tell the difference.
[01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:28.460]   Right.
[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:30.660]   Because it looks like it's spinning and coming back at you.
[01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:31.660]   So like, it's real...
[01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:35.300]   Whether the phone actually turns off or on, it's impenetrable to most people.
[01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:39.700]   So springboard would crash and then, depending on how often you had local notifications,
[01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:41.060]   and people are confused by this too.
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:45.100]   They're remote notifications, which is like Facebook Messenger, Twitter, things that
[01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:47.460]   sport score, things are coming off the internet.
[01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:50.660]   Local notifications are like your meditation app reminding you to meditate.
[01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:54.480]   If you have like, do you or a multiple to-do list app reminding you, it's things that
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:57.540]   originate from on your device that's being sent to you.
[01:18:57.540 --> 01:19:01.860]   Those would crash and you could either set back the date, which had a lot of issues associated
[01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:05.540]   with it because that breaks a lot of things, or you could go through and sort of laboriously
[01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:06.540]   turn off.
[01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:08.740]   If you know what are local notifications, it was quick.
[01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:12.620]   But if you didn't, you'd have to turn off a bunch of stuff because do not disturb didn't
[01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:13.620]   work.
[01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:14.620]   Do not disturb does not stop notifications.
[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:15.860]   It just mutes the dialogue.
[01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:17.820]   So you'd still have the error.
[01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:20.020]   And then Apple again moved really quickly.
[01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:24.140]   They could have branched 11.1 and tested it and put out an update.
[01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:28.460]   But instead, since 11.2 was ready to go, the Gold Master had already shipped earlier that
[01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:32.500]   day, they just pushed it out immediately on very early Saturday morning.
[01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:35.260]   11.2 also adds Apple Pay in messaging.
[01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:36.260]   I've tried it.
[01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:37.260]   Somebody sent me $5.
[01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:38.260]   I sent it back.
[01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:39.260]   It worked great.
[01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:40.260]   Nice.
[01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:43.300]   If you have Apple Pay already set up, you have to go through one extra step to turn it
[01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:44.300]   on for messages.
[01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:48.260]   And it actually seemed like I just pressed a button and it was working.
[01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:52.020]   And if you're using Apple Pay Cash or you're using a bank card, there's no transaction
[01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:53.020]   fee.
[01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:55.980]   If you're using your credit card, there's a standard, I think, 3% transaction fee.
[01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:56.980]   Yeah.
[01:19:56.980 --> 01:19:57.980]   So I like that.
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:01.060]   And I didn't want to take the $5.
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:03.620]   I just considered it a test, a proof of concept.
[01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:04.620]   You can send it back.
[01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:05.620]   I did.
[01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:06.620]   That's cool.
[01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:13.060]   So the minute this was announced, Georgia just sent me $5, $5, $5 in a test.
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:14.380]   Luckily, that doesn't work.
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:16.260]   You have to enable it.
[01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:17.780]   That's terrible.
[01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:18.780]   I know.
[01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:20.580]   Did she know what she was doing or she was teasing?
[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:22.260]   Oh, she absolutely knew it.
[01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:23.620]   I don't think she thought it would work.
[01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:25.140]   But you know, we need to get the money.
[01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:27.380]   It's in like an Apple account now, right?
[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:28.380]   Apple Pay Cash.
[01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:30.700]   It's like a buffer so that you there's no transaction fees on that.
[01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:34.700]   So you can sort of withdraw that if you want to do a client apps or whatever.
[01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:35.700]   It's like your paypal.
[01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:36.700]   It's a buffer.
[01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:38.300]   But you can pay other people cash.
[01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:39.300]   You can pay it.
[01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:43.700]   Use Apple Pay to pay it retailers or you can buy it on Apple's, you know, whatever.
[01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:45.620]   And I guess you could pull it out if you needed to, right?
[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:47.060]   And to turn it into real cash.
[01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:50.780]   And now I think I can update my watch to do the same, right?
[01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:51.780]   I haven't seen it.
[01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:55.300]   I wasn't paying attention, but the watch update wasn't out this morning yet.
[01:20:55.300 --> 01:20:56.740]   It was all supposed to come out this week.
[01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:59.820]   It's just the iOS 11.2 came out early.
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:04.220]   Apple neglected to update the release notes to say that Apple Pay Cash because it was
[01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:05.740]   supposed to all come out together.
[01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:07.380]   But he went out early, they neglected to update it.
[01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:09.540]   Everyone's like, where's my Apple Pay Cash, dude?
[01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:11.540]   And so he had to wait a few days for me.
[01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:17.220]   Just let me just look on my watch here and see if there's an update, software update,
[01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:25.260]   checking for updates and the survey says, I think it's out, but I'm waiting to see.
[01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:26.820]   It would be 4.2.
[01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:29.100]   Still thinking about 4.2.
[01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:33.740]   And then that would then that would allow me to use my watch to send money to.
[01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:35.620]   Yeah, and you can use messages or Siri.
[01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:36.620]   You can use either one.
[01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:40.060]   Can I just add money to my Apple wallet or how does that work?
[01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:45.100]   No, so when people send you money, it goes in there and I think you can add iTunes cards,
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.100]   but I'm not positive.
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:51.220]   I can't actually test it because I have my phone is at the US, but it made me, instead
[01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:54.420]   I had to confirm with the US financial institution, which was a step.
[01:21:54.420 --> 01:22:01.180]   I just want to point out that when you think about progress, 30 years ago, you could not
[01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:05.700]   get cash on Sunday and now you can send people cash from your watch.
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:06.700]   It's amazing.
[01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:07.700]   I know.
[01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:10.300]   I think that is an awesome.
[01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:17.780]   So I am getting update 4.277 megabytes, new features, improvements and bug fixes.
[01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:19.820]   All right, so we're going to let that run.
[01:22:19.820 --> 01:22:20.820]   That's going to take 43 minutes.
[01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:23.620]   This show is not going to take 43 minutes.
[01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:26.580]   Oh, I like this.
[01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:31.540]   I've mentioned before a live core, this is a Vic Condotra's new company.
[01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:37.780]   This is a company that made the first FDA certified EKG.
[01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:41.940]   You just hold in your hand and you could use your iPhone or your Android phone and you
[01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:43.100]   could send it to your doctor.
[01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:46.460]   Now they have an FDA certified Apple watch band.
[01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:51.420]   A live course, Cartia Band is an EKG meter in your watch band.
[01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:52.780]   How about that?
[01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:57.580]   This is particularly useful for people who have AFib because that's a kind of a silent
[01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:59.500]   killer you may not know.
[01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:04.620]   So if it fits all ages, we have someone that has worked with us that had it and he had
[01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:08.900]   it way more healthy than me and had a heart attack.
[01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:15.580]   Jeff Jarvis told us about this because he's been in the hospital for arterial fibrillation.
[01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:20.460]   So this is something you can have and you put it in your band and then whenever you want,
[01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:27.420]   you can put your thumb on it and send an EKG, send it to their doctors or send it to your
[01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:29.580]   doctor for a fee.
[01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:36.020]   And does that use that secret port on the band margin or does it use like Bluetooth
[01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:37.020]   LT?
[01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:38.020]   That's an interesting question.
[01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:39.020]   The other one is Bluetooth.
[01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:40.020]   Yeah.
[01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:44.260]   If it doesn't have any physical connection, so I would guess it's a more convenient form
[01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:45.260]   factor.
[01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:49.500]   It'd be interesting if you have these sort of smart watches for extra sensors that doesn't
[01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:52.980]   need to have their own battery, doesn't need to worry about pairing or anything like that.
[01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:56.660]   That really does show how if that's true, it really show how forward looking the design
[01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:57.660]   is.
[01:23:57.660 --> 01:23:58.660]   Yeah.
[01:23:58.660 --> 01:23:59.660]   See how it works.
[01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:00.660]   Stay one.
[01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:01.660]   [inaudible]
[01:24:01.660 --> 01:24:04.580]   Oh, it would make, oh wow.
[01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:07.840]   It also monitors to let you know if unexpected heart rate conditions.
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:11.860]   So that is a big step forward since you're wearing it all the time.
[01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:16.620]   It can keep an eye and say, Hey, you may be going into AFib.
[01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:17.620]   You know, Wow.
[01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:19.340]   What's interesting about all of this stuff.
[01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:22.460]   Is that as the sensors, and they've already talked about the fact that the sensors can
[01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:26.460]   see a lot of things, high blood pressure, sleep apnea.
[01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:29.620]   Those are all things that the sensors as they are already 96%.
[01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:35.340]   And as you start talking about, this is what Apple talked about randomizing your information.
[01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:39.900]   As Apple, as Apple gets all that information in a randomized form, not specifically to
[01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:47.740]   you, but to an overall view of things, their ability to see things about you is going to
[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:51.300]   be pretty profound as far as that goes.
[01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:56.060]   And then everyone will really realize that they should need anything with corn syrup.
[01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:57.060]   Yeah.
[01:24:57.060 --> 01:24:58.060]   Is that the way?
[01:24:58.060 --> 01:24:59.060]   Is that the way?
[01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:00.060]   I'm going to be.
[01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:01.060]   Corn syrup, the cause of a terrier arterial.
[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:04.580]   No, no, it's not that the cause of arterial, but I'm just telling you that as we use these,
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:07.740]   these things, we're going to realize that corn syrup is as bad as they say it is.
[01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:08.740]   And we should not have it in our home.
[01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:14.100]   Well, we know that $199, although the chair, I'm saying if you're in the stop AFib community
[01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:21.980]   in the US, you can get a 25% discount with the code stop AFib25.
[01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:24.100]   So that makes it even more affordable.
[01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:27.380]   This is, I think this is, this is a big deal, this device.
[01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:29.020]   I really think this is interesting.
[01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:30.020]   Absolutely.
[01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:33.620]   And I think that all everything that I've been seeing is that Apple would be very, very
[01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:38.820]   pleased if it, in the next five years it became as well known as a healthcare company as it
[01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:41.260]   is grown as say a music provider.
[01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:44.500]   They don't want anything to make it more well known than as an iPhone seller.
[01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:49.020]   But in terms of their, in terms of their second tier products, this is not just, hey, this
[01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:50.820]   is a way for us to sell watches.
[01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:55.540]   It's like, no, the Apple watches a healthcare product and we want to continue to increase
[01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:58.180]   the portfolio of stuff that it can do.
[01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:05.620]   It was a great interview with Jeff Williams on CNBC talking about the Apple Heart Care,
[01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:08.900]   the health studies or heart study app that they're putting out with Stanford and the
[01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:10.980]   telemedicine movement.
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:14.940]   And he just said, we spent almost no time discussing how to monetize health.
[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:16.660]   It's stuff that they feel deeply about.
[01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:24.620]   You can, after you get the recording, you can then record, you can record how you feel
[01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:28.100]   as well in an audio and send it off to your doctor.
[01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:31.660]   That is, but I think what's most interesting is unexpected heart rate, would you like to
[01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:35.260]   take an EKG showing up on your watch?
[01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:38.820]   I think that's really, this is, that's life saving.
[01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:43.180]   At this point, yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's just the ability to say, well, what if you
[01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:48.140]   could just simply have like a flight recorder recording the past 30 minutes of whatever's
[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:50.980]   been going on where it just keeps looping, looping, looping.
[01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:56.220]   And if there is an incident, your first responder can through Bluetooth and hopefully you're
[01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:58.900]   conscious and can give permission for this.
[01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:02.300]   Basically say here is what your heart has been doing for the past 30 minutes.
[01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:05.660]   So it knows what, what, what triggered it off or what's, what it's looking at.
[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:08.780]   Boy, I tell you, if I had a fib, that'd be a reason to go out and do it.
[01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:09.780]   I'm buying Apple Watch.
[01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:13.180]   But I think even, even if you think you might be at risk, you might, my father had a heart
[01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:17.820]   attack earlier this year and you know, he just felt bad.
[01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:20.180]   You know, like, like, you guys, but this is the kind of thing that will tell you that
[01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:21.180]   you need to go to hospital.
[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:22.740]   There's a reason you feel bad.
[01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:28.500]   And we do know the sooner you get treatment, the higher your chances of our full recovery.
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:30.940]   So time is of the essence.
[01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:37.060]   It's not, it's not just that, but sometimes people there, if all of a sudden my heart rate
[01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:40.260]   went to 200 beats per minute, I would freak out.
[01:27:40.260 --> 01:27:42.060]   I would know that something's very, very wrong.
[01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:43.860]   Even it went back down to normal.
[01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:48.380]   Like after 10 minutes, I would say that next time I can get the next appointment, I can
[01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:49.740]   get to have myself checked out.
[01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:50.740]   I'm going to do that.
[01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:55.500]   But what if for the past five years, that's just been happening off and on and you're sort
[01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:59.100]   of used to the, oh, well, it's just something my heart does, whatever, because you know,
[01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:02.820]   that this happens every couple of months and it's never, you know, startling for about
[01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:04.780]   five minutes, but then it goes away.
[01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:06.380]   You just don't pay attention to that.
[01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:10.620]   It would be wonderful if you had a device that tells you this is something you should,
[01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:12.780]   you should choose to correct this problem.
[01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:15.500]   This is something you really really want to have them checked out.
[01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:16.500]   It's a number.
[01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:20.460]   So it's the deviation from the norm that calls our attention to the fact that this is not
[01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:23.860]   something that we can just simply say, Oh, well, that's a blip in the system.
[01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:27.100]   No, this is something that's been happening to you every three to five weeks.
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:28.100]   And this is not normal.
[01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:31.460]   Of course, the dangers, once you start measuring it, it starts creating another behavior, you
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:36.340]   know, like when, when, when stationary bikes came out with heart sensors and I was, um,
[01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:42.980]   in high school, um, we used to have competitions on how far I could get to 212 before I fell
[01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:43.980]   off the bike.
[01:28:43.980 --> 01:28:48.020]   So it was the stupidest thing.
[01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:49.260]   Not the stupid thing I've done.
[01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:50.820]   I've done a lot of stupid things.
[01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:53.580]   Um, but that was getting up pretty high up there.
[01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:55.980]   But you know what?
[01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:57.140]   You're probably a little healthier now.
[01:28:57.140 --> 01:29:01.020]   At the time, my, my, my resting heart rate, I was a wrestler at a time, my resting heart
[01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:03.300]   rate was in the high thirties low.
[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:04.300]   What?
[01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:09.100]   40, really about 42 43 was about where this man is dead and my watches stopped, but, but
[01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:12.020]   it was, uh, but yeah, it's definitely not that now.
[01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:16.300]   Quick before we take a break for our picks of the week, Mark German, another scoop.
[01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:23.500]   This one, not about Apple, but about Google, YouTube and Amazon's streaming devices.
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:27.700]   Remember a couple of weeks ago, Google pulled YouTube from the Amazon Echo.
[01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:29.420]   It's off again.
[01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:34.180]   Uh, Google has pulled support for its YouTube video service from all of Amazon streaming
[01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:37.300]   media devices, including the fire TV.
[01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:43.180]   Uh, actually that'll start January 1st, but you can't watch YouTube videos anymore.
[01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:47.580]   We really appreciate that feature because you could watch our show on the, uh, Echo
[01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:48.580]   show.
[01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:49.580]   Right.
[01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:50.580]   I ask you for it.
[01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:53.260]   That was back briefly, but now Google says it's taking action because YouTube apps on
[01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:58.780]   the Amazon products aren't made by Google, uh, like the, uh, YouTube app on the iPhone
[01:29:58.780 --> 01:29:59.780]   is.
[01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:04.140]   And, uh, because Amazon doesn't sell some Google products on its store, it's, it's,
[01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:08.700]   it's not only, I'm trying to understand it's not only does Amazon have a YouTube product
[01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:10.980]   they shouldn't have, but I don't have an Apple TV product from Amazon.
[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:11.980]   I should have.
[01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:12.980]   Yeah.
[01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:13.980]   It's a mess.
[01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:17.860]   Um, that's, I would say, I understand why Google's doing it.
[01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:21.660]   Uh, they said Amazon's implementation of YouTube violates our terms of service, creating
[01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:24.340]   a broken user experience.
[01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:31.860]   They fixed it in November, but now then Amazon pulled, uh, nest devices, uh, from their store
[01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:33.940]   when they put their own device up.
[01:30:33.940 --> 01:30:37.580]   So what Amazon be happy if Apple just made prime video for Apple TV?
[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:38.580]   Cause they didn't.
[01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:41.300]   Well, I, I just have to say, if Amazon wants to be retail to the world, they've got to
[01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:44.780]   stop these kind of weird, anti-competitive practices to sell everything.
[01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:46.780]   This is how you get yourself into an antitrust.
[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:47.780]   Yeah.
[01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:50.940]   You know, you know, they're not there yet, because they don't have enough of the market,
[01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:53.820]   but if they continue to go down the path that they're going, you know, eventually they're
[01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:55.180]   going to, it's going to cost a lot of money.
[01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:58.260]   What's amazing to me is like a couple of years ago on the show, we discussed horizontal
[01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:01.820]   lock in versus vertical lock in a lot of people gave us feedback saying, no, no, that
[01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:03.540]   silly, that'll never happen.
[01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:05.580]   Amazon would never do this kind of stuff.
[01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:09.100]   And here we are, because any company eventually wants to see to their own best interest.
[01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:14.100]   Once you own the market is now the, the Apple TV app, uh, for Amazon Prime Video was supposed
[01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:15.340]   to come out by the end of this year.
[01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:16.340]   Still not out.
[01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:17.340]   Yeah.
[01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:21.060]   It was announced at WWDC and then Amazon actually tweeted out that it was coming and we still
[01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:22.060]   haven't seen it.
[01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:24.860]   Some people, every time there's a new Amazon premiere, people are like, that's, this is
[01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:25.860]   it.
[01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:26.860]   This is where it's finally going to come out.
[01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:29.340]   And now a grand tour is coming out, I think tomorrow or the next day.
[01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:30.500]   So people are hopeful again.
[01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:35.340]   But engineers on Reddit have said that it's been done and it's just Amazon has not released
[01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:36.340]   it.
[01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:39.900]   And as TVOS apps are, I don't want to speak for developers, but they're ridiculously
[01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:40.900]   easy to make.
[01:31:40.900 --> 01:31:43.580]   Netflix was there at day one and Amazon is not clear.
[01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:47.860]   And what makes it clear is Amazon refuses to sell the Apple TV as well.
[01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:51.420]   Yeah, because it would be a bad experience because it doesn't have Amazon Prime Video.
[01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:52.420]   Yeah.
[01:31:52.420 --> 01:31:54.380]   And they're, and they're really cute too.
[01:31:54.380 --> 01:31:58.660]   If you do a, if you do an Amazon search for the Google home, that will take you right to
[01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:01.380]   the right to the echo dot.
[01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:08.420]   It's like, the hard part was like, the hard part is that they, that, you know, it's, I
[01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:09.980]   think Amazon obviously is playing hard.
[01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:13.740]   Once you get something into the house, it's really hard to get something else in there.
[01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:17.420]   I mean, once people are tied into that, I mean, I have, I have both because we do these
[01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:18.420]   things.
[01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:20.220]   I have both too, but I use the echo a lot more.
[01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:21.220]   The echoes more.
[01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:24.180]   It does the responses are 10 to be better.
[01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:25.860]   And you're doing.
[01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:31.420]   My kids are, they just thought as soon as the show came out, they just ignore the Google
[01:32:31.420 --> 01:32:33.820]   home doesn't even exist because they sit there and look at the screen and they're
[01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:34.820]   watching TV.
[01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:36.460]   My kid, I don't even know how to run the echo.
[01:32:36.460 --> 01:32:39.460]   I mean, the show, my kids just sitting there playing games or watching movies.
[01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:41.460]   They're like, they know how to use it.
[01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:42.460]   They know how to use it.
[01:32:42.460 --> 01:32:43.460]   Sitting in this corner and our kids.
[01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:44.460]   It's a seven inch TV.
[01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:45.460]   Yeah.
[01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:49.020]   And I'm like, I'm like, you know, I'm like, we got a big one in the living room.
[01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:52.580]   It's got a 70 inch over there with surround sound.
[01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:55.380]   I mean, you could like, you know, and they're like, well, they couldn't find it on, they
[01:32:55.380 --> 01:32:59.620]   couldn't find whatever they're watching easily on the, on the Apple TV and, and, you know,
[01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:01.260]   we got anyways long story.
[01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:03.420]   We're going to take a break.
[01:33:03.420 --> 01:33:04.980]   Your picks of the week folks coming up.
[01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:06.820]   But first word from texture.
[01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:11.060]   Here's a product that everybody who has an iPhone or an iPad or for that matter, an
[01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:15.300]   Android phone or an Android tablet ought to get the texture app.
[01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:21.820]   Imagine it's kind of Netflix for magazines over 200 of the nation's best magazines for
[01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:25.860]   a very low cost $9.99 a month.
[01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:26.860]   That's our special Twit price.
[01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:29.740]   I'll explain that in a second.
[01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:33.460]   On your iPad, the next time you take a flight, you don't have to worry about it.
[01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:35.540]   You favorite the magazines you want.
[01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:36.780]   They'll automatically download.
[01:33:36.780 --> 01:33:42.780]   You have every page that's in the current newsstand issue plus all the backages plus
[01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:46.140]   features you can't get in print like video.
[01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:50.100]   And by the way, if you're a photographer, you'll love the quality of the images and magazines
[01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:55.300]   like Shutterbug and National Geographic, they just look better because they're not screened
[01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:56.300]   and printed.
[01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:58.820]   They're right there on your iPad.
[01:33:58.820 --> 01:33:59.820]   The New Yorkers there.
[01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:00.820]   So is Vanity Fair.
[01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:01.820]   So is wired.
[01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:03.620]   So so so is everything you'd want.
[01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:05.060]   Bon Appetit and real simple.
[01:34:05.060 --> 01:34:11.060]   If you like to cook, if you are into a following the political scene time magazine, the Atlantic
[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:17.300]   when the cold winter hits because winter is coming, let a far an Airbnb mag take you away
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:22.340]   and inspire next vacation over 200 premium magazines.
[01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:26.260]   And you know, I love about it is I don't have to subscribe to the trade magazines like
[01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:29.700]   Billboard that I would normally have to pay a lot of money for.
[01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:31.540]   They're right there.
[01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:33.100]   They're right there.
[01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:34.820]   This was the end of me getting magazines.
[01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:35.820]   Yes.
[01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:36.820]   You're like getting paper magazines.
[01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:37.820]   Why?
[01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:38.820]   Why have all the clutter and the guilt?
[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:42.300]   There's guilt associated when I subscribed to the New Yorker, the weekly, they would pile
[01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:44.620]   up and I'd feel bad about it because I didn't read it.
[01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:48.180]   And then I feel like, well, you got to read the November one before you start the December
[01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:53.260]   one that golf goes away with texture, texture, I travel and for me to be able to have the
[01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:54.260]   magazines.
[01:34:54.260 --> 01:34:56.580]   I don't I want to have I don't read a whole magazine.
[01:34:56.580 --> 01:34:57.580]   I dabble.
[01:34:57.580 --> 01:34:58.580]   Yes.

[01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:23.340]   Is soldier fortune in there?
[01:36:23.340 --> 01:36:24.340]   I don't know.
[01:36:24.340 --> 01:36:25.340]   Let me check.
[01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:26.340]   I'm secretly.
[01:36:26.340 --> 01:36:27.340]   I'm secretly.
[01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:28.340]   I'm secretly.
[01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:29.340]   I'm secretly.
[01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:30.340]   I'm a career change.
[01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:31.340]   I'm a fan of.
[01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:32.340]   I'm a fan of.
[01:36:32.340 --> 01:36:33.340]   I'm a fan of.
[01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:34.340]   I'm a fan of.
[01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:35.340]   I'm a fan of.
[01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:36.340]   I'm a fan of.
[01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:37.340]   My mom would always buy.
[01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:38.340]   She also cared about this that we read.
[01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:39.340]   So if we went to the bookstore.
[01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:40.340]   Whatever you want.
[01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:43.420]   Which you could buy whatever you wanted and just hand it to your mom.
[01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:44.940]   You know when I was a kid.
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:45.940]   Because you're reading.
[01:36:45.940 --> 01:36:46.940]   Because we're reading.
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:47.940]   And she just cared that we just got good at reading.
[01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:50.340]   You know she didn't care what we were reading.
[01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:56.700]   And so I was I remember being home and and I had you know I had us 12 years old or 13
[01:36:56.700 --> 01:36:58.540]   years old or whatever I had sold for fortune magazine.
[01:36:58.540 --> 01:37:03.900]   I was reading and one of my friends said they're like did you did your mom know that you
[01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:06.340]   read this and I was like she bought it.
[01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:07.340]   Okay.
[01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:13.940]   I'm sad to say they do not have either guns and ammo or soldier and fortune magazine.
[01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:16.420]   So don't don't get texture for that.
[01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:21.460]   They do have sailing world saltwater sportsman ski the best of outside outdoor life Marlin
[01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:22.460]   flying.
[01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:27.780]   They got a little amazing boating biking backpacker.
[01:37:27.780 --> 01:37:28.780]   Maybe I'm looking in the wrong way.
[01:37:28.780 --> 01:37:31.820]   I should look in men's men's interests.
[01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:34.380]   Most most gerunds are covered.
[01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:35.380]   Most the gerunds.
[01:37:35.380 --> 01:37:38.780]   Annie and I go your pick of the week, sir.
[01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:40.540]   What a good pick this week.
[01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:43.620]   Daniel Jalka just released a new version of Mars at it.
[01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:45.980]   Mars at it for drops today on Tuesday.
[01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:48.540]   Oh I love Mars at it.
[01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:55.100]   And it's a that's the blogging it's the blogging app that had sort of what is the opposite
[01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:56.100]   of a renaissance.
[01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:59.380]   It's nothing it's it's been around for years and years and years.
[01:37:59.380 --> 01:38:01.620]   Daniel bought the rights to it 10 years ago.
[01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:03.580]   He's an amazing developer.
[01:38:03.580 --> 01:38:10.780]   And there was a time when WordPress's own online web based editor kind of outpaced it
[01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:14.700]   a little bit in terms of creature comforts and there were some features you could do
[01:38:14.700 --> 01:38:16.860]   for WordPress blogs inside the online editor.
[01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:18.860]   You couldn't do in Mars at it.
[01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:22.780]   And in addition to a whole bunch of other really cool features, Mars at it for takes
[01:38:22.780 --> 01:38:29.900]   and leap now back leapfrogging beyond the online editor that WordPress gives you by
[01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:34.620]   it's a much much more it's like the difference between an online editor and a desktop app.
[01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:36.580]   This is a desktop Mac app.
[01:38:36.580 --> 01:38:38.020]   It's much more it's much prettier.
[01:38:38.020 --> 01:38:39.020]   It's much cleaner.
[01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:42.340]   A lot more editing features that you had before that are more familiar to you if you're
[01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:44.900]   used to using a word processor.
[01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:48.620]   But also a bunch of stuff where that things that were a little bit more difficult and
[01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:51.220]   previous versions are a lot easier now.
[01:38:51.220 --> 01:38:57.660]   More of what modern WordPress features like are supported directly inside the app itself.
[01:38:57.660 --> 01:39:02.300]   We no longer have to go into the WordPress editor in order to set some things about how
[01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:05.940]   you want this deployed and how you want things marked that sort of stuff.
[01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:10.220]   Editing if you're using markdown it will translate markdown excuse me it will let you type markdown
[01:39:10.220 --> 01:39:13.300]   and basically interpret what you're doing visually on the fly.
[01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:17.420]   If you got custom templates it will automatically find those templates and make sure you get
[01:39:17.420 --> 01:39:21.900]   a wizzy wig editing experience as you go having things like featured images is now something
[01:39:21.900 --> 01:39:24.420]   that's built into the app itself.
[01:39:24.420 --> 01:39:30.580]   They freshen up the interface to make it look used to look kind of 2002 ish 2003 ish and
[01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:33.700]   out really looks like a modern modern modern app.
[01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:39.580]   One of my favorite features is it's always had the ability to act as one of the things
[01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:44.780]   I liked about the online editor is the ability to edit a post anywhere because no matter
[01:39:44.780 --> 01:39:46.820]   where I log in it's going to be there.
[01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:51.780]   Wordpress excuse me and Mars editor has always worked where you can edit it locally on your
[01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:56.420]   you can create something locally on your Mac and decide not to put it onto the blog even
[01:39:56.420 --> 01:39:58.420]   as a draft.
[01:39:58.420 --> 01:40:03.300]   But the way that it works is that it will always maintain that your drafts folder as
[01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:05.140]   being the same thing between each one.
[01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:09.660]   So I can start editing I can start writing something in Mars edit get 3000 words in and
[01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:13.660]   then go on to the online editor on a Chromebook for instance and have it exactly there because
[01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:15.380]   it's keeping both things synced.
[01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:20.380]   But they think the new twist that they added is the ability to back up your entire WordPress
[01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:21.380]   database.
[01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:25.420]   So every single post all these hundreds and hundreds of posts that put on my blog it will
[01:40:25.420 --> 01:40:27.660]   just simply download it and keep it locally.
[01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:34.060]   So a I can do I can spend my six hour flight going through and fixing typos on stuff I've
[01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:36.180]   been writing for the past two or three years.
[01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:40.580]   But it also means that if my site goes down or if it gets hit by a bad person trying to
[01:40:40.580 --> 01:40:46.260]   be mean to me by taking down my site and and ripping apart my wordpress database all these
[01:40:46.260 --> 01:40:51.740]   hundreds of posts that I've written will be safely backed up in Mars edit on my Macbook.
[01:40:51.740 --> 01:40:54.100]   It's 50 bucks but it's a professional piece of software.
[01:40:54.100 --> 01:41:00.300]   If you do if your medium of publishing is WordPress or another popular blogging platform
[01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:02.820]   you've really got to have Mars edit.
[01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:07.300]   I'm guessing that you're about to say well that's 50 bucks and I think that the online
[01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:09.420]   editor I have is works just great.
[01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:15.420]   You will come to appreciate how much freer you can be when you have the ability to write
[01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:20.980]   completely offline and write in an app environment as opposed to an online environment and plus
[01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:24.780]   it'll give you free for the first two weeks all features are unlocked.
[01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:25.980]   It's a demo version.
[01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:30.340]   Excuse me it'll work it won't ask you for money for two weeks and for those two weeks
[01:41:30.340 --> 01:41:31.500]   everything just works.
[01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:35.660]   All you do is just give it a URL of your of your blog it will pause for a second I'll
[01:41:35.660 --> 01:41:39.740]   ask you what's your username what's your password and then it'll just simply start downloading
[01:41:39.740 --> 01:41:45.300]   your downloading all your posts and you can post immediately it's perfect perfect perfect
[01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:50.300]   cannot record it's not only a really useful tool it's one of those beautifully crafted
[01:41:50.300 --> 01:41:56.780]   pieces of software where you know that this is some some old world craftsman in a shop
[01:41:56.780 --> 01:42:02.140]   deep deep deep in the woods somewhere doing nothing but forging swords doing nothing but
[01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:08.740]   binding books they do this one thing and they just they just go left I hope so I mean
[01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:14.380]   but I'm going to tell us how you really got to left you'll get old worlds craftsman he
[01:42:14.380 --> 01:42:18.380]   shipped today so he's going to be sleeping until at least Friday or Saturday I'm not
[01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:22.380]   going to hear from him until Monday he has to relearn the names of his what name of his
[01:42:22.380 --> 01:42:26.660]   wife and his kids we love Daniel he's a great guy he's been on the show and I agree with
[01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:30.860]   you a hundred percent in fact I'm thrilled to hear that it's out in fact the perfect
[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:36.340]   tool on your Mac for blogging would be get that and get the new my pick pixelator pro
[01:42:36.340 --> 01:42:41.780]   which just came out just come out just came out you can now install that and man well
[01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:45.740]   I think it's sixty bucks it's not hugely expensive right now I don't I can't Photoshop money
[01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:52.500]   yeah it's not Photoshop money yeah sixty bucks and a whole host a new features massive update
[01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:58.020]   we've been waiting for this for a while it is out so if you've been waiting I've used
[01:42:58.020 --> 01:43:03.620]   the original pixelator forever and it is a perfect complement to Mars at it because
[01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:08.260]   you often have an image that you want to resize or get in there as your hero image and you
[01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:13.380]   need a little editor pixelator pros a great choice so the two of them should be on your
[01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:19.260]   shopping list this week we I put we have like a handful of Photoshop licenses I have one
[01:43:19.260 --> 01:43:23.220]   we've got maybe four or five other ones in the company because there are a couple things
[01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:26.380]   people send you a Photoshop file or whatever and and you want to make sure it's compatible
[01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:33.460]   and and and I've been using Photoshop since 1992 like a little muscle memory issue but
[01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:38.140]   all the rest of our machines are all pixelator like so we basically you know unless you really
[01:43:38.140 --> 01:43:41.580]   need something that's in Photoshop we'd rather you know we'd rather have you do pixelator
[01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:45.020]   it's to be honest with you it's faster you know a lot of the responsiveness of the you
[01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:48.740]   know you're able to watch all the plugins in real time you're able to do all those things
[01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:54.780]   and it supports raw which is great yeah it's great camera raw which I do and now they say
[01:43:54.780 --> 01:44:01.500]   they have some machine learning involved in the enhanced image editing including automatic
[01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:08.980]   naming of descriptive names to your layers so his layer one two three and four automatically
[01:44:08.980 --> 01:44:13.980]   straighten images using horizon detection magically remove objects recreating image areas with
[01:44:13.980 --> 01:44:17.740]   stunning realism this is something we're starting to see Mac funds doing that to in lumenar we're
[01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:25.020]   starting to see this get better and better thanks to a I so yeah pixel made a pro couple
[01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:30.740]   of things to buy today Renee Richie your pick of the week so first I want to just echo what
[01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:36.460]   Andy said jalcy did a heck of a job on this can I call it jalcy to you can I took me forever
[01:44:36.460 --> 01:44:40.780]   to pronounce it properly but yeah jalcy did a heck of a job really really outstanding
[01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:47.380]   work pixel meter as well I my god kid my oldest godson he went to high school now and they
[01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:51.100]   do even though it's in Quebec they're doing Spanish each school has a thing one school
[01:44:51.100 --> 01:44:55.620]   does Mandarin one does Spanish one does Italian he went to the one that's doing a Spanish
[01:44:55.620 --> 01:45:00.700]   program or testing a Spanish program so he's been using Duolingo to help him as to
[01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:07.060]   sort of fortify what he's learning in school the my youngest godson is is in he's still
[01:45:07.060 --> 01:45:12.500]   in primary school so he's using it to help him with French their father is of Italian
[01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:16.580]   descent and while he got yelled at a lot in Italian as he was a child he doesn't speak
[01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:21.940]   it fluently so he's decided to work with them and pick up his Italian I did two years
[01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:26.900]   of Mandarin in college but I haven't used it very much over the last few years so I started
[01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:31.180]   doing when they joined it again I started doing the Mandarin course and it's just there's
[01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:36.460]   so many languages now so many more than what they launched with originally and the programs
[01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:40.780]   are really great and I was confused at first because I started doing it and it started
[01:45:40.780 --> 01:45:45.860]   throwing words at me that I didn't that it had never explained and I if I had just
[01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:50.660]   done that program like I knew them because I had a very very very basic idea from college
[01:45:50.660 --> 01:45:55.380]   what it what the words meant but it was under like I was getting everything right so it
[01:45:55.380 --> 01:45:59.580]   was ramping it up and if I did it wrong it would be ramping them down so it was sort
[01:45:59.580 --> 01:46:03.540]   of intelligently adjusting to my level and it does all these things like it gives you
[01:46:03.540 --> 01:46:07.740]   little rewards and it tells you if your strength bar goes down you should review that course
[01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:12.420]   and it's just it's a really fun way out before I go to bed when I woke up I used to just read
[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:17.260]   Twitter or look at Instagram or check out news dot app all those things now I just I make
[01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:21.420]   sure that I start the day with a few minutes you know one to three quick programs on Duolingo
[01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:26.580]   and I finish the day the same way and it's just I think that language is the way that
[01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:31.140]   we think and the more languages you know the more ways to think you know we're going
[01:46:31.140 --> 01:46:38.300]   to Japan in the spring and I used Duolingo to brush up my French I don't know any Japanese
[01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:43.740]   but I want to be ready I have no idea this is the I think you're learning here a Ghana
[01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:48.380]   right up front I don't know why but I figure I'm going to do this until we go in Japan
[01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:52.900]   to Japan in April and maybe all my kids love it yeah it's the best way to learn like eight
[01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:55.940]   and ten just sitting there fiddling with languages and finding the ones that they like
[01:46:55.940 --> 01:47:03.180]   and it's it's amazing I'm just going to guess nope wrong it's knee okay see I gotta I gotta
[01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:10.060]   learn okay continue so now I'll know that's knee what's that is this make eat eat eat eat
[01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:17.020]   oh got yeah got that one it I liked a little bidding it just makes you feel good about this
[01:47:17.020 --> 01:47:30.940]   oh crap me oh this was neat then I'm the night to say me okay good see see I'm learning
[01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:40.100]   Japanese right now just like that what kind of a star on Jensan it is now thank you Renee
[01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:44.860]   now time for your pick of the week Alex Lindsay so let me get my wallet no this isn't too
[01:47:44.860 --> 01:47:50.900]   bad oh good in fact I think might be free so so this is how these these pics sometimes
[01:47:50.900 --> 01:47:55.580]   evolve so Stu Mashowitz who I used to work with it at ILM posted something on Twitter
[01:47:55.580 --> 01:48:01.460]   and then one and then I think either Ken Nichols or Brent Schnare my inner company put it in
[01:48:01.460 --> 01:48:05.180]   our our little internal list and slack and then I looked at it I was like oh my gosh this
[01:48:05.180 --> 01:48:14.740]   is amazing it it's called focus F O C O S focus and what this does is it takes advantage
[01:48:14.740 --> 01:48:21.220]   of the depth sensor and lets you re like play with it but only in the like it is selfie
[01:48:21.220 --> 01:48:25.820]   only the ones you said you shot in portrait mode oh so if you set it in portrait mode and
[01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:31.500]   it captures that 3D information you can change the the Boca you can play with it make it
[01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:36.780]   sharper out of and you can actually play where it's placed as well so you can you can look
[01:48:36.780 --> 01:48:40.780]   you know you can change all those little bits and pieces and you can actually preview it
[01:48:40.780 --> 01:48:44.820]   you can hit a button and it cuts it and shows you all the slices that were part of the photo
[01:48:44.820 --> 01:48:48.020]   so you can fix it well you can fix it and you can just seen it I think they have there
[01:48:48.020 --> 01:48:52.780]   is the slices there so you can see that's the slices that the iPhone took as far as depth
[01:48:52.780 --> 01:48:55.980]   goes right a figurine stuff out and you can also see where it's going to have trouble
[01:48:55.980 --> 01:49:00.300]   you can see like in that cat one that's on here that the ears didn't get read very well
[01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:04.500]   and everything else I don't think you can fix that but but you can at least see it you'll
[01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:08.580]   know where you can open it in Photoshop and edit the depth map you really want to yeah
[01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:13.060]   okay can you extract the depth map yeah so in the new version of Photoshop it will take
[01:49:13.060 --> 01:49:16.820]   the because there's a depth API now in iOS 11 it'll take the depth API and make it a
[01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:23.380]   channel for you and you can actually go with iOS Photoshop no photo desktop Wow yeah desktop
[01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:29.540]   Photoshop I didn't know that just anyway so but this is this is something you can run
[01:49:29.540 --> 01:49:32.900]   on your you just it literally just finds all your portrait photos immediately it says
[01:49:32.900 --> 01:49:37.140]   can I see the photos and it just shows you all of them and you start playing with it and
[01:49:37.140 --> 01:49:41.060]   I think it's either very inexpensive or free so I think it's like you know they're maybe
[01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:45.660]   down the road they're going to ask you to upgrade to something else but it's it's
[01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:53.380]   O-C-O-S by Xiao Dong Wang free and it's free cheap at half the price dang that's a zero

[01:52:29.660 --> 01:52:35.180]   i was following you because i remember adding you recently i had a few other problems i started it
[01:52:35.180 --> 01:52:40.220]   and then i was like uh i didn't like the idea that i had to take a picture inside of it and i was
[01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:43.420]   gonna be stuck with that little square photo but not anymore and then i stopped using it and that
[01:52:43.420 --> 01:52:48.300]   changed a long time ago but look at this is his first one yeah that that's in those days that's
[01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:52.460]   2011 yeah so it's not like i i did something with it but i was like i don't i don't i don't
[01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:56.300]   want to do it that's when it put frames around it and that way now it was like i didn't like it and
[01:52:56.300 --> 01:53:03.900]   so i just was like you know the heck with this and um uh so so then i a couple weeks ago i started
[01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:09.020]   playing with it again i'm glad you did because you are a great photographer and i love seeing

[01:53:23.180 --> 01:53:27.900]   you're seeing the world yeah it's it's nice so anyway i'm gonna do a lot of that i don't want
[01:53:27.900 --> 01:53:32.380]   let's tell you tell you why i'm in certain places but you can't i'll take a lot of photos of you might
[01:53:32.380 --> 01:53:36.460]   even tell you where he is he doesn't seem to use the uh location tag that's my that's my whole thing
[01:53:36.460 --> 01:53:39.820]   everyone has to guess so i told you on the show i haven't told anybody on instagram so that's all
[01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:43.580]   now monkey with a mission figured it out so yeah by figure out where i am i'm not going to tell you
[01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:49.580]   where any of these places are dosa for breakfast by the way oh what a way to live yeah it was funny
[01:53:49.580 --> 01:53:53.980]   so the little the little um that little soup over there the dip yeah i thought it was on the right
[01:53:53.980 --> 01:53:57.500]   yeah they were supering at me don't drink that for a couple days they were snickering because i was
[01:53:57.500 --> 01:54:01.580]   eating it like soup because it was really good and then i asked and then i asked for i asked for an
[01:54:01.580 --> 01:54:05.900]   authentic indian rest uh breakfast and they brought me this and they brought that over and i was like oh
[01:54:05.900 --> 01:54:13.100]   i've been eating the dip like so said dip yeah it was it does work as a soup um just saying it was very
[01:54:13.100 --> 01:54:17.900]   good it's very good but but it's better as a dip this one i i loved he says this statue is built
[01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:23.420]   from glass used in hd lenses and i couldn't figure out if you were mocking it or not is that true i
[01:54:23.420 --> 01:54:27.100]   asked the person that was there i said is that is that ice and he goes no no that's the glass that is
[01:54:27.100 --> 01:54:33.580]   used in hd lenses is made into the into the buddha yeah so that hd high def buddha it's a high def buddha
[01:54:34.460 --> 01:54:45.020]   wow so shouldn't the cloche trim it wash the uh that hotel was a l e x l-i-n-d s-a-y now on the twitter
[01:54:45.020 --> 01:54:51.820]   and on the instagram yes nice but i'm not sharing it like i don't like the whole like i do cross twitter
[01:54:51.820 --> 01:54:56.700]   to facebook but i've decided that that is everywhere in old deli like oh it's like this organic it's
[01:54:56.700 --> 01:55:02.220]   so this the wires that's uh you want electricity will hang another wire no no just yeah but this is
[01:55:02.220 --> 01:55:07.980]   just electricity that's like everything tv like it's all just yeah kind of add it on top and it's
[01:55:07.980 --> 01:55:12.780]   put another wire in but it was interesting about it is the beauty of it is it's like it's like vines
[01:55:12.780 --> 01:55:17.580]   it's like uh like technology vines that are like it's growing all over the beauty in the city oh no
[01:55:17.580 --> 01:55:23.180]   i think i just see the crust talk in it yeah that's what i see why has there never been like a spy
[01:55:23.180 --> 01:55:27.820]   movie or an action movie where they fight on a rooftop as the bad guy falls off and gets like
[01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:33.100]   strangled and how and gets strangled by the cables or the or the good guy jumps off intentionally and
[01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:37.580]   thus uses it like a trampoline or they should have it where he hits it it slows his fall on
[01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:41.980]   a land and then they cut to someone all these people's houses where all their tv went out right
[01:55:41.980 --> 01:55:45.900]   and they're in the middle of a cricket match so basically the old
[01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:49.580]   kill and then they're all chasing him so now he's got a whole town chasing after him you know but
[01:55:49.580 --> 01:55:54.700]   i was just one guy it's actually amazing this is what you're looking at is a single cable subscription
