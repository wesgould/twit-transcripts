[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.600]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly and boy is this a big panel today.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.100]   Mostly because Scott Born is eating my chocolate.
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.400]   It's getting bigger every moment.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.400]   How do you like that chocolate?
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.700]   That's a good chocolate.
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.500]   Scott Born, I've lured him up here.
[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.900]   And not only worked really well because I offered him chocolate
[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.500]   and all of a sudden, Liana LaHue came up as well.
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.500]   From Girls' Gunky.
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.500]   I didn't heard there was going to be chocolate.
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.500]   I had to be here.
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.500]   I had chocolate.
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.500]   Those two are in studio with me and also here via Skype.
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.500]   We've got Andy Enoco who is avoiding the big wood chipper in his backyard.
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.500]   Yes, those of you who have been praying for a vacation from the birds.
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:45.500]   It was next door neighbor operating a huge, like, last act of Fargo scale wood chipper in the backyard.
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.500]   That has driven me inside here to the spare bedroom of my mom's house.
[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.500]   You know what's funny is the guy, house wrote me.
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.500]   The guy you were calling house last episode.
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.500]   He was obsessive compulsive.
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.500]   He said that he thought it was artificially induced bird.
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.500]   That's what annoyed him.
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.500]   So, he thinks that I had that kind of technical or AV savvy that I was able to mix in a perfectly synthesized.
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.500]   That's what I did.
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.500]   Congratulations, house.
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.500]   You got me.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.500]   I thought it was so perfect that no one would be able to get it, but you got me there.
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.500]   Not AV savvy, AV and savvy.
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.500]   The cool thing is that on Twitter, I keep getting emails from, or emails from Twitters from people saying,
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.500]   "You know, I believe that you have three different birds in your backyard.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.500]   One is a Thompson's warbler in next year.
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.500]   Oh, no.
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.500]   I believe warbler."
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.500]   Oh, that's funny.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.500]   They're actually identifying the bird.
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.500]   Yes.
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.500]   So, I now know more about my mom's backyard than I did before.
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.500]   So, thank you.
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.500]   Thank you, Leslie.
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.500]   Thank you, birders.
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.500]   Merlin, man, were you ever a birder when you lived in Florida?
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.500]   Never been a birder and I've never been electronically confronted by bird nerds.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.500]   So, I look forward to that.
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.500]   We do have some very mean scrub jays in our yard.
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.500]   They're awful.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.500]   They're awful to the other birds and they terrorize the cats.
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.500]   They do.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.500]   They take over.
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.500]   Crows are like that.
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.500]   They don't bring a lot of value.
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.500]   They're just mean.
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.500]   Alex Lindsey is also here.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.500]   Mr. Pittsburgh, there are no birds in Pittsburgh, I don't believe.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.500]   There's lots of birds in Pittsburgh, especially where I grew.
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.500]   It was like the birds oftentimes act.
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.500]   Actually, those huge blocks of birds that would come flying up and geese, which, you know,
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.500]   are really good to eat because otherwise they poop everywhere.
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.500]   You know, the geese are flying over Petaluma right now.
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.500]   They're going, they're heading, let's see, I guess it'd be heading south, coming back
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.500]   from their winter holiday.
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.500]   And I saw one roadkill the other day.
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.500]   I almost stopped to pick it up.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.500]   I don't know how though.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.500]   It's flying south.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.500]   I don't know how, maybe it got tired.
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.500]   Maybe a polligator.
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.500]   I'll say is that if they start stopping at your pond or at your lake or whatever, you
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.500]   know, you need to act quickly early by the way.
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.500]   They've ruined, they have ruined the park here in Petaluma.
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.500]   They said, hey, this is a nice place.
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.500]   And it's just, it's awful.
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.500]   There's thousands of geese.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.500]   They hired dogs in Minneapolis.
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.500]   To chase the geese?
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.500]   They chased the geese away from the lake.
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.500]   Even though the dogs would have been, since there are 10,000 lakes in Minnesota, they
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.500]   required huge dog packs.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.500]   Did you guys see the guy who's making, he's remaking birds, he's taking the birds by
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.500]   for Hitchcock and he's removing all of the birds?
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.500]   So people just look crazy.
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.500]   It looks like there's some kind of unseen terror.
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.500]   The guy's last name is Hendrix, H-E-N-D-R-I-K-S.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.500]   Search Google on Hendrix without birds.
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.500]   And it's kind of awesome YouTube video.
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.500]   That's hysterical.
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.500]   That's a really cool idea.
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.500]   So long as there's no one in his community who is hungry or unclothed or needs a
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.500]   volunteer to come by and do work on the house.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.500]   I don't think you understand how cultures move forward.
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.500]   I think we're moving birds from video.
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.500]   I'm just going to have to move backwards.
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.500]   You're probably the kind of guy who says, "Why are we landing on Mars when there's
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.500]   so much to do here at home?"
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.500]   No, I'm saying, "Why are we landing on Mars when unmanned probes can do so much
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.500]   better?"
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.500]   I think it is an unmanned probe.
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.500]   Are there humans on Mars?
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.500]   No, it's an unmanned probe.
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.500]   All of my probes so far have been entirely manned.
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:13.500]   You know what this thing that Merle and his talking about has in common with us?
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.500]   This is Mac Break Weekly and someone's taking all the Macs out of it.
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.500]   It's with all the Macs have been removed.
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.500]   I'll give you some Macs.
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.500]   Here's a picture of an iPhone or the new 3G iPhone.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.500]   It looks oddly like the old iMac, the Bondi Blue iMac.
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.500]   It's got a plastic back, not the metal back.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.500]   Alex, you posted these on Mac Break Weekly Ideas.
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.500]   Do you believe these are credible?
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.500]   Your Photoshop whiz.
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.500]   They look pretty good actually.
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.500]   There's a lot of other ways to do it other than Photoshop as well.
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.500]   And that would be to build something that looked like it.
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.500]   Well, this is pretty good if somebody fabricated this because it's got the aluminum around.
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.500]   The front looks pretty much the same, right?
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.500]   It's the back that looks different.
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.500]   Yeah, I mean they look relatively credible.
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.500]   You know, if they are, somebody's getting fired.
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.500]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.500]   If you were going to do this 3G phone, you might want to have a plastic back instead of a metal back
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.500]   for better radio reception, right?
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.500]   So this actually would lead some credence to this.
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.500]   And it's also, notice it is a little thicker, but by kind of gracefully curving the back,
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.500]   they've hidden that fact.
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.500]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.500]   They don't show the jack.
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.500]   Right.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.500]   And I think it's less credible because of that, because all the reports we're getting is that
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.500]   the new phone will not have the recessed headphone jack.
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.500]   Oh.
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.500]   And had they shown that, we would know, I would be more likely to believe.
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.500]   He's got the jack, jack, jack, jack.
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:39.500]   Now what they could have done is, you know, build some sort of plastic case and set an
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.500]   a regular iPhone in it.
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.500]   And that would look good.
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.500]   It has that kind of iMac, the old iMac looked at.
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.500]   Yeah, I got to tell you, if this is the new phone, I'm not very excited.
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.500]   Well, the other rumor again, I like the old phone looks beautiful.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.500]   Well, go ahead, Sagan.
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.500]   The other rumor is that there'll be a black version.
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.500]   That's the rumor we've been hearing that there's going to be black.
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.500]   Well, you could do colors.
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.500]   If you're doing that classic, it's easy to do colors.
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.500]   You could have red.
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.500]   Yeah.
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.500]   And I thought that this also would lend some credence to maybe a less expensive phone.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.500]   This looks like a less expensive phone.
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.500]   It sure does.
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.500]   Maybe that's what you don't like about Mr. Born.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.500]   It's not the Rolex.
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.500]   It looks like the freaking clamshell thing.
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.500]   Yeah, it does.
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.500]   I mean, that's, that's so, you know, down market.
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:31.500]   The iPhone software development fund, the $100 million iPhone that client Perkins, Cofield,
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.500]   and buyers was going to do.
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.220]   In fact, Steven asked it in January when he did that speech, is and has now picked its
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.500]   first two companies to receive funding.
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.780]   1700 submissions.
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.580]   You'd think they could have done better than this.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.420]   The first one is from Palago.
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.500]   It's called, "Whirl, WHRL, WHRL, WHRL."
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:59.500]   Ties the iPhone's mapping capabilities to help find restaurants and services in your area.
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.500]   Yeah.
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.500]   Can't we do that with Google Maps already?
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.500]   Well, why do we need that for?
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.500]   I think the thing that they're pumping about that is the social side.
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.500]   You would use that?
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.500]   Yeah.
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.500]   I would use that all the time.
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.500]   Man, I don't think you can do it with Google Maps.
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.500]   Try and do it on your phone now.
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.500]   It's a pain.
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.500]   You're jumping around.
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.500]   You're in the maps app.
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.500]   You're back in Safari.
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.500]   I mean, if you actually try to do this, if you travel, you have to deal with their describing
[00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.500]   here, it's not that easy.
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.500]   Yeah.
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.500]   Maybe you're right.
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.500]   I do it on my dash GPS because it has Yahoo on it.
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.500]   I could say she should get me a Starbucks and it'll find me the Starbucks and stuff like that.
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.500]   Well, you can do that.
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.500]   Most GPSs will do that.
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.500]   You can do that pretty simply on the iPhone if you know where you're at.
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.500]   Well, those in the iPhone, the map now know where you're at within 1,700 feet.
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.500]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:45.740]   If you know that you're at ZipCode94107 in San Francisco and you just go to Google and
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.500]   type, you know, Starbucks 941 or 7.
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.500]   Do you know why you're driving?
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.900]   I mean, like, I'm looking for something where I'm going down to 80 at, let's say, a safe
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.940]   70 miles an hour and I want to know where the closest coffee place is.
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.340]   I can do that on my newbie, like, OK, but like to have that, to basically say, I'm
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.700]   imagine on my home page, I can say I can have a bookmark for coffee.
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.700]   No matter where I am, show me where the nearest coffee.
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.700]   You're desperate, aren't you?
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.460]   Well, it looks like with this one, though, you're integrating social networking as well,
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:15.300]   so you're getting recommendations from your friends and it's not just a random list of
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.300]   right.
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.300]   That's why they said it right there.
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.260]   But there are two different levels of problem with this when you're doing it on an iPhone.
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.860]   When you're doing it on a car GPS, you know that the person who's asking this question
[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:29.100]   has a car, so you can be a little looser on the recommendations.
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:33.060]   If I actually have to beat shoe leather to know where to walk to this place you're recommending
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.060]   to me, it'd better be exactly what I'm looking for.
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:41.100]   Not just a coffee place that used to be here three years ago and still doesn't have Wi-Fi.
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.820]   That's a big problem with the GPS results, is there often out of date?
[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.020]   Because I mean, these things move fast, especially coffee shops.
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.420]   I got really zing by the newbie when I was in Florida and I know you hear this, "Oh,
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:54.620]   the crazy German guy drives this Mercedes into a lake because he tries to do this."
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.020]   I'm like, "I'm not that guy."
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.620]   First of all, my wife is really ready to kill the newbie woman.
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.540]   She is so tired of being corrected by this pedantic newbie.
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:06.700]   They calculated.
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:07.700]   This is why I like the dash.
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.540]   It doesn't ever say recalculating.
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.620]   It just says, "It doesn't say anything.
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.300]   You just keep driving and then it gives you a new route."
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.300]   That's what my car never did.
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:15.300]   That's how it should do.
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.100]   It doesn't say recalculating is such a guilt inducing.
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:23.540]   It's like, "Well, the one I used to have, is it the newbie is what you have Merlin?"
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.620]   The newbie, the one that's the smaller screen.
[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:26.780]   Yeah, I got that one too.
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.380]   At first it says, "Make an immediate U-turn."
[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.380]   Yeah.
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.380]   Like, "You bew idiot."
[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.980]   Then it says, "Okay, recalculating."
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:34.980]   Yeah.
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:35.980]   It says it with a resigned voice.
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:36.980]   That's where I'm just projecting.
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:37.980]   I swear, I swear.
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.860]   I think it's if she has to repeat herself, if she has to say it more than a couple of
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.780]   times, I swear to God, she starts sounding more exasperated.
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.220]   What voice do you use that moment?
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.980]   My question is, "Do you have it said to the German voice?"
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.780]   Mine is said to Australian and it's very easy going.
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:52.780]   Recalculating.
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.780]   It's a little bit of a chime.
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.380]   I tried the English woman for a while, but I went back to, I think it's a Karen or something
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:02.100]   like that, whatever the generic, a panantic American woman is.
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.860]   Anyway, I don't know.
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.660]   I'm going to have to see how this thing works, but you're right, Scott, everything is on your
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:08.660]   iPhone.
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.580]   If you don't mind, all the clicky, click, click, click, make stuff happen.
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.020]   I think what's, I don't know, for me, I'm just now starting to really get into what I do
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.940]   with the buttons on the home page.
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:22.340]   That's really starting to turbo my use of the iPhone, is having shortcuts into stuff
[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.340]   I use a lot.
[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.780]   I also said there's going to be a what's going on around me right now button.
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.620]   You're one button away from context.
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:33.100]   In other words, now this reminds me a little of Jai-ku because Jai-ku knew via Bluetooth
[00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.260]   which of your Jai-ku friends were in the area.
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:37.260]   That would be kind of cool.
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:41.460]   If it has that social networking feature and it said, "Oh yeah, Leana is at the Starbucks
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:48.060]   down the street right now having a double-comer-makiado and she's with a cute friend," then that
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.060]   would be useful.
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.060]   It's amazing.
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.900]   There's 10 people near me who are looking at Jai-ku right now.
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.940]   I should Twitter about this right now.
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.580]   Twitter does that kind of manually, right?
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:03.140]   What I like about it would be that Brightkite actually offers this feature.
[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.980]   You can make people trusted friends.
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:11.060]   If it's somebody that I actually know, then I would go, "Okay, I'm going to go join Leo
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:15.860]   and his cute friends at the coffee shop versus somebody random in my neighborhood."
[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.260]   No, I think that's a good point.
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.260]   Do you have a good friend?
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.300]   I don't understand how you would use that.
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.660]   If I'm out and doing something, am I just going to stop when I'm doing it and go, "Oh,
[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.980]   I want to go hang out with somebody from a social network?"
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:26.980]   Who uses that?
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.540]   Well, you're married and you have a kid's now.
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.540]   No, I'm serious.
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.540]   I'm not trying to be contrary.
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.540]   I'm just someone.
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.540]   Kevin Rose does that.
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.020]   Well, I would do that.
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.500]   See, I think younger people would do that who are single and hip and lonely.
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.500]   I think it's creepy.
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.620]   I think Merlin says, "I think it's creepy."
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.700]   Well, the other one, it's not creepy.
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.700]   It's social, but you have to be in a city with a large group of friends who are also using
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.020]   the same platform.
[00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.620]   And then it's like Twitter or anything else.
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:52.620]   It's a community.
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.260]   Without that, it's just a bunch of strangers and you're right.
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.260]   It's creepy.
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.900]   The second company they funded, I think, actually seems more commercially viable.
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.780]   The home automation stuff.
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:06.300]   I've been reading a lot of analyst reports that they think that the overall market's
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.300]   going to move towards looking at automation as one of the next big investment areas.
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:16.500]   Home automation, particularly as it relates to security, has some interesting possibilities.
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.860]   I mean, I was 10 years ago, I was in Bill Gates' home and they had the little pin that they
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.140]   gave you that would control where you could go in the home.
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.860]   Whether or not you could go in this room or that.
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.500]   When you did, it would adjust the lighting and the music and the electronic paintings
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.580]   for you.
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.260]   And imagine having your iPhone be the trigger for that.
[00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.540]   Okay, you can go into a public building with your iPhone because it gives you this much
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:38.540]   clearance.
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:43.780]   You can't go into the bank vault, but you can go into the Starbucks and the common area
[00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.460]   and those sorts of things.
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.460]   I think that's very interesting.
[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:51.060]   There's a long line of some of the push stuff that we have talked about over at Apple
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.100]   Phone show that we think needs to come onto the iPhone.
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.100]   We're going to do that.
[00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:59.860]   There's a company in Petaluma threshold that's going to come in here and put motion sensors
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.300]   and heat sensors and all sorts of stuff in here.
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.260]   Humidity controls, a big panic button.
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260]   Because Dan's worried.
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:12.700]   You could come in off the street and he says, "You won't get shot.
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:13.700]   It'll be me."
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.580]   So I'm going to put a big panic.
[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:16.580]   So I think that'll be fine.
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.980]   Because Petaluma is a hub for crime.
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:19.980]   Dan's a little parent.
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:20.980]   I like to crime.
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:21.980]   Dan's a little parent.
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:22.980]   Yeah.
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:23.980]   And given the buildings, what, about 2,000 square feet?
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:24.980]   I mean, it's...
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.420]   Well, that's why he's there, so he'll get shot.
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:28.860]   I can dive out the window.
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.380]   All that matters is which one of you can run the most quick.
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.380]   Who's the fastest runner?
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.180]   I don't have to run the bar.
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.900]   I just have to run my friend.
[00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:37.900]   I know that's right.
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:42.300]   You need an ejection seat below you with a little slide.
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.300]   A little water slide.
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.300]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:48.620]   It's a twig evacuation capsule countdown.
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:49.620]   One million dollars.
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.660]   You feel a little like Dr. Evil in here.
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:55.900]   I just need a little cat, a hairless cat to stroke on my lap here.
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:56.900]   So those are two companies.
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.860]   Yeah, I guess, I mean, you kind of think with 1,700.
[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:00.860]   There's another one coming.
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:04.420]   There's a couple that they said that they're giving about a hundred million dollars.
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.220]   You know, but have you been in front of a VC company?
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.220]   No.
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.220]   Let me tell you something.
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.140]   Their job is to say no, and your job is to convince him to turn it around.
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.140]   Right.
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:16.060]   So it's not unusual for them to be very, very particular.
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.700]   They're looking for something that scales.
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:18.700]   Right.
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:19.700]   That's all they care about.
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.180]   They don't care if it'll make $10 million dollars here.
[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.180]   Oh, really?
[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.180]   They really don't.
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.180]   In fact, I've had many of them say that.
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.180]   What does that mean then?
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:26.180]   Scales.
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:31.180]   They want something that will have the potential to become YouTube or Twitter or Facebook.
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:35.980]   They're only looking for stuff that can feed their 14th generation great grandchildren
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:37.700]   removed because these guys already have more money.
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.180]   They wanted an annuity.
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.180]   They don't want a big hit.
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.980]   Yeah, they don't care about 10 or 20 million bucks.
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.500]   It doesn't do anything for us.
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:47.580]   They want to prove that that can generate a billion later on, then they'll invest in
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:48.580]   it.
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.260]   So how did Twitter get all that money?
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:56.860]   Well, Twitter, they're paying a per subscriber fee as the basic model VCs are using.
[00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.740]   Oh, each subscribers worth a buck 50 or whatever.
[00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.540]   Yeah, actually the numbers are a little bit crazier higher than that.
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:02.540]   Really?
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.340]   Yeah, they're paying multiples of whatever those numbers are, which is how some of these
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:06.980]   guys are getting these crazy valuations.
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.100]   Now, who knows if that's...
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:14.380]   I, having lived through internet 1.0, I remember when Netscape was valued, he's like a billion
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:15.980]   dollars and that company's gone.
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:16.980]   Right.
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:20.420]   So, I didn't know this but 10.5.3 came out today.
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:21.420]   I didn't know that either.
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.620]   Yeah, well, let's do a software update right in the middle of the show.
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.620]   Let's please not.
[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.620]   Come on, it's fun.
[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:26.620]   We'll see what happens.
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:27.620]   Check this.
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:28.620]   It was nice talking with you guys.
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:29.620]   Yes.
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:33.620]   Mac very quickly, we'll be back next week right here on the Twiit Network.
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:34.620]   Ball.
[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:39.860]   Of course, Apple is always very tight-lipped about what is in a new update but it says
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.940]   10.5.3 is recommended for all users running Leopard.
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:47.460]   It includes general operating system fixes and enhanced stability, compatibility and
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:48.460]   security of your Mac.
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.660]   There is a big I-Cal flaw which Apple has not fixed.
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:56.660]   In fact, the security company that discovered this flaw several months ago finally got pissed
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.300]   off at Apple and said, "You guys aren't fixing it.
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.060]   We're going to tell the world, I'm willing to bet that this is one of the things that's
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.060]   fixed because they just..."
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.260]   I saw that there was one of the fixes.
[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.500]   Actually, there is a pretty good document on what all is in this more than usual.
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.700]   One of the things they mentioned is you can make events private now.
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:11.940]   Is that related to what you're talking about?
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:12.940]   Possibly.
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:14.100]   I don't know.
[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:18.580]   The I-Cal security flaw comes from putting a link.
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.580]   You've seen I-Cal links.
[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:23.500]   We have one on the bottom of our Twiit Live.TV page where you would add our calendar to I-Cal.
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:30.420]   A malformed link can basically send you to a website that will invade your system.
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.700]   It is a serious flaw and I understand why the company...
[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.340]   Actually, a little of mixed feelings.
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:39.180]   This company didn't give Apple a whole lot of time.
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:43.780]   What finally pissed off the security company is that Apple said, "Oh, we're going to fix
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.900]   it in May and they didn't."
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.140]   The security company finally said, "We'll screw you.
[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:53.220]   We're going to tell the world which means now it's really a problem because hackers know
[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.220]   about it."
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:59.740]   I'm not sure how I feel about it.
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:04.060]   The company that did this, I'll give them credit, is Core Security Technologies and they announced
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.620]   this last week.
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:08.180]   The most severe bug is a memory corruption.
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.380]   By the way, that big loud noise is not...
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.900]   It's not somebody's cocking the shotgun.
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.900]   Exactly.
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.100]   Scott getting ready to shoot the hackers.
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.180]   That's his new Mark I.
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.140]   I mean EOS 1D Mark III, right?
[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.140]   1DS Mark.
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.140]   One pardon me.
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:29.340]   Well, there's about a $5,000 difference in the price, okay?
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.060]   If the S, you pay $5,000 for that S?
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.060]   No, actually it's $3.
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.580]   You are a big S.
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:37.260]   So it must be a really big S.
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.340]   So the most severe of the bugs involves a memory.
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:40.340]   You can still take pictures.
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.820]   I just want to tell people what the clicking was.
[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.820]   Okay.
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.180]   We'll talk about this later.
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.180]   The most...
[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.100]   What's on the noise at that thing?
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.100]   You pay for that, don't you?
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.100]   J-Lo!
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.100]   Ms. Lopez over here.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.100]   J-Lo!
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.460]   That's what the S is for, the loud click.
[00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.620]   Actually, it does have a quiet mode.
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:58.620]   You can enable it quiet.
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:18:59.620]   But I thought that was physical.
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:00.940]   Isn't that the mirror popping out?
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:01.940]   No, you can actually change the...
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:02.940]   What's the point?
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:03.940]   You can change the mirror.
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.460]   No one will know what kind of an expensive camera you have.
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.460]   It's so funny.
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:08.460]   For that, I might just say, $3,000!
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.460]   $3,000!
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.460]   $3,000!
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.460]   $3,000!
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:12.460]   No, that's more than $3,000.
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:13.460]   That's more than $3,000.
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.460]   That's just the body too.
[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.460]   That's just the body.
[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.460]   I just can't hear that.
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:17.460]   I'm sorry.
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:18.460]   Is that bothering you guys?
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:23.340]   I'm waxing my yacht.
[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.980]   I really, this is something I've got a couple of yachts.
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.980]   I hope that I'm stuck.
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:28.980]   Listen, no.
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:29.980]   I'm almost done.
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.940]   It sounds like you're using a pump bottle, Merlin.
[00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.620]   I don't know if that's really the wax.
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.620]   I knew it's a special...
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.180]   Well, the kind of yacht that I've got.
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:41.780]   It's a very special kind of clamp on wax.
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.580]   It's very costly.
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:44.580]   Actually, my single...
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:45.580]   The frugal men on it.
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:49.220]   A single canister of yacht wax costs more than the...
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:50.220]   No.
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.940]   Anyway, you guys go ahead.
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:56.260]   I'll just need a couple more minutes.
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:20:00.060]   The most severe of the three ICal bugs involves a memory corruption that can be taken advantage
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:05.020]   of by getting an unsuspecting user to run a malicious.icscalendar file.
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:09.260]   You can put that on the web and people click it and automatically opens an ICal.
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.860]   And then it jacks malicious code.
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:13.020]   This is very serious.
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:16.180]   The other two are null pointer errors, which basically cause a crash.
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.140]   But the crash is a first step sometimes to a hack.
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:25.100]   So these guys said, "We told Apple about this some time ago.
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.900]   The fact that Apple hasn't done anything makes us mad.
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.300]   So hackers have added."
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.660]   And I think that that probably stimulated the 10 point...
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.900]   Oh, they don't really say that that's what they're fixing specifically, do they, Merlin?
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.540]   Effect Google calendars as well, because they've got tons of those links out there.
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:42.220]   No, it's a flaw in ICal.
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:43.220]   Although if...
[00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.220]   That's interesting.
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.060]   You can generate an ICal.
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.060]   Yes, you can.
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.820]   In fact, that's how we do our .ics file.
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:52.900]   It calls the problem protocol or with the servers that Apple's run.
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.500]   It sounds like it's a problem with ICal.
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.500]   The application.
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.500]   The application.
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:02.540]   So it wouldn't cause a problem if you click on an ICS and it goes to Outlook or it goes
[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:03.540]   to Google Calendar.
[00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:04.980]   It is if it launches ICal.
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:09.860]   And you know when you click on a link like that, Safari says, and Firefox too, say, "Hey,
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.700]   we're going to run an external program.
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.980]   Do you want us to do that and do you want us to make that a regular habit?"
[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:19.060]   So you don't use ICal anyway, do you, Merlin?
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.580]   Yeah, I use actually ICal and GCal with Spanning Sync.
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.580]   Yeah, I love Spanning Sync.
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.740]   I thought you hated ICal.
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:30.980]   I just like ICal in a lot of ways, but it's nice to be able to edit stuff locally when
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.980]   I don't have access, like on a plane or whatever.
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:33.980]   Oh, okay.
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:34.980]   So I like that.
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:35.980]   But yeah, it's funny.
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:36.980]   It's funny.
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.220]   I hate to say this because I love Apple.
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.460]   I love my friends at Apple.
[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:43.860]   I actually I mostly moved to GCal for even creating events.
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.500]   It's just so much easier to use.
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.820]   I actually love GCal.
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.380]   I use it now almost all the time.
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:49.380]   You're right.
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:53.460]   And with Quick Silver you can actually have a GCal event, you know, keystroke, which is
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:54.620]   really handy.
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:58.460]   Additional raw image support, probably for your 1D X Safari.
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:21:59.460]   It's been 4D.
[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.460]   Hey Leo, do you see anything in there about my yacht?
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.460]   No, yacht.
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:07.100]   Now, clients can now change their password when they log in their yacht.
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.100]   Safari.
[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.300]   You know, here's a good one.
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.300]   This is a fun issue.
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:15.340]   This could be terrible that results in using Helvetica narrow instead of Helvetica.
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.340]   Well, I'm Jeez.
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:19.980]   I'm really sorry to hear about that because I fired that kid because he used that font.
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.140]   You used narrow.
[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:22.140]   I told you.
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.140]   Sue, I'm an ethical man.
[00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:24.140]   He used Helvetica narrow.
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.140]   You deserve what you get.
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.140]   That's awesome.
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.580]   Oh, and also resolves a stability issue with Word of the Day.
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.180]   I think this is worth mentioning.
[00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:32.180]   You're right, Rowan.
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:33.660]   This is an incredible amount of data.
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.940]   They don't usually give us this much information.
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.940]   As you're right, you're right, Scott.
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.820]   John Gruber frequently reminds us when he posts this single line.
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:43.820]   What is this?
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:47.020]   There's one like that you can hear the chorus singing along on the one line that they ever
[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:51.540]   post, which is like, you know, increases, updates to improve stability.
[00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:52.540]   And that's it.
[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:53.540]   Yeah.
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.540]   I know.
[00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.540]   This is good.
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.540]   They must have listened to John.
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:57.540]   Do you think this is something they might do regularly now because they're tired of getting
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:58.540]   hammered for it?
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:00.780]   Do you think this is just a one-time deal?
[00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:01.780]   This is like a huge update.
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:02.780]   It's much more eye-to-date.
[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:05.900]   It's funny because I clicked through the link when I saw on the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:06.900]   channel.
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:07.900]   Where do I see it?
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:08.900]   On one of the, uh, uh, the...
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.460]   Resinhovs an issue where mail sucks.
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:11.460]   Oh, go ahead.
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:12.460]   [laughter]
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.460]   Dress.
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.300]   I think what it says it addresses that issue.
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.140]   Mail does not sock.
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:18.140]   Okay.
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.780]   Um, spaces, that's good time machine voiceover.
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.900]   I mean, there's a lot of stuff.
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.340]   There are a lot of eye-cal fixes, but they don't specifically mention that security.
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.340]   I bet you anything that, uh, it's fixed there.
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.340]   I have to.
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.420]   Like you, I just caught it right before the show, but I was interested in that one.
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:35.060]   It's like there's a bit you can flip to make an event private and I'd never seen that
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.060]   happen.
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:37.060]   Yeah.
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.420]   Is that, uh, private from what?
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:43.260]   Well, see, that's what's interesting because I mean, I have to say for the longest time,
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.260]   many reasons.
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:48.740]   Last time I avoided using Google Calendar because I was confused about, it wasn't always
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.820]   clear what was public and what wasn't.
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:56.580]   Um, so I wonder if that's a way that on an otherwise public calendar, you can show up
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.580]   and use the stuff.
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:58.740]   You have the private bit.
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:03.620]   So if you have like, you have like, so like, you know, if you really have a church, you
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:07.180]   know, I bought a couple of events, but then it could be one thing that you don't want
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.180]   or need people to see.
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:10.460]   We've got this.
[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.820]   I think we dialed 911 again by accident.
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:15.100]   This morning, I'm not kidding.
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.820]   The nine one one operator called said, did you dial 911?
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:19.820]   It's a game.
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:20.820]   Say, Dave.
[00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:22.380]   He took a piece of my car.
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.380]   He swears he didn't.
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:28.180]   And then the cops came and they said, is there anybody else in this building?
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.180]   And you flaked.
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.940]   Dain said, I'm running.
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.260]   Um, yeah, so I guess they're coming again.
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:36.580]   So anyway, um, I don't know what's going on.
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:40.060]   Can a phone accidentally dial 911?
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:41.700]   Maybe they fixed that in the OS 10 fix.
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:42.700]   I don't know.
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:48.340]   So I guess as always with a security update like this and a major update, you know, it's
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.220]   always a mixed bag.
[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:52.340]   You I know Scott don't install these right away.
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.580]   We don't install them on our production machine.
[00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:58.220]   We wrote we wait when I'm just my machine that I use for email and such.
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.660]   It's given that there's this known security flocca.
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.900]   You know, just don't click on a tiger on our production.
[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.780]   You don't know how that works.
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:05.980]   It works really well.
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:06.980]   Thank really.
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.220]   Yeah, I'm running into more and more stuff that won't work on Tiger.
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:11.380]   Well, all we need to work on Tiger is soundtrack.
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:12.380]   Right.
[00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.380]   Right.
[00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.380]   Right.
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.380]   Right.
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.820]   I'm going to stick to six and six and six and seven for a while because I got bid on 604.
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:22.060]   And yeah, don't go to system seven.
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:24.020]   You'll be so sorry man.
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.720]   We're running into things where we're having compatibility issues between Intel and Power
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:34.080]   PC where our power PC machines are not handling certain things nearly as well.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:36.240]   The Intel and it just looks like they're just kind of on behind.
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:40.800]   I mean, we're I kind of feel like we're going to have to move our last remaining power
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.720]   PC machines out of the office soon because it's just the stability seems to be dropping.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.880]   I don't think we have any power PCs in here.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:47.880]   Oh, we do.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.000]   We have one G5 in the corner.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   It's so lonely.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.280]   We don't know is do anything with it.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:26:00.200]   So a new patent application from Apple says Apple's investigating the use of solar power
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.280]   in both handheld devices and portable computers.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:07.320]   So they're talking about putting that underneath the LCD and the only thing I could think of
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.160]   is I don't think I really want to lead my iPhone out in the sun.
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.160]   Isn't that weird?
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:15.680]   It's an LCD layer and then the solar cells and then the flex PCB.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:20.240]   So it would kind of be a I guess the sunlight would come through the back or come through
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.240]   the LCD.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.480]   It looks like it was designed for it to come through the front.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.480]   So you see my area.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.480]   Yeah.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:30.360]   I think this falls into the category of an engineer who's been ordered to say the following
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.360]   words.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:35.120]   I think this could be viable to the legal team who then patents.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.120]   They've patent everything.
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.720]   In fact, I generally don't report these stories because you know every and I'm only going to
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:44.400]   mention it this time so that you know in going forward if we don't talk about these
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.320]   because several times people say you didn't mention the Apple patent for the you know,
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:54.240]   the touch screen nose hair remover and it's like Apple doesn't they patent everything.
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:59.040]   It's the IT department's you know intellectual IP department, intellectual property department
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.760]   job to patent every and I'm on the same idea.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.600]   They got to do something because if that ends up in something successful, you know what's
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.600]   going to happen.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.760]   It's like right now we're still in the midst of iPhone lawsuit of the week.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.160]   You know, there's like 700 lawsuits against the iPhone.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.680]   Everybody claiming that oh I invented the number seven.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.360]   So you can't use that on the phone.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:20.440]   The Kindle price drops 40 bucks.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.440]   That excite you.
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.440]   That's it.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.440]   I got to go.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.440]   Have you been waiting?
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:30.000]   He'll spend $3,000 for an ass on his camera but a 50 cut 50 bucks of the Kindle and he's
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.200]   excited and he's and you're still a Kindle fan.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.200]   I've got my Kindle in front of me right now.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.000]   I thought you were reading.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.800]   Well, I've just been you know, I've got the Spreeto in front of me.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.800]   I've got a soda.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.520]   You know, I'm just following the Mr. Ed rule that Mr. Ed should never speak unless he
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.520]   has something to say.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.960]   A little burr or he's got peanut butter on his teeth.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.480]   It's part of Web 3.0.
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.080]   Do you still like the Kindle?
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.560]   I still really, really like the Kindle.
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:59.920]   I find myself surprisingly buying a lot of books on the Kindle instead of going to the
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:05.400]   bookstore chiefly because it allows me to really address an impulse immediately rather
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.320]   than having to wait, you know, a week for Amazon or wait three hours to get down to the
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.320]   bookstore.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:15.560]   I still think that it is there is such a thing as perceived value.
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:19.440]   And I think that until they design this thing so it doesn't look like something you got
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.360]   at the dollar store.
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:26.480]   They're going to it looks like something where Apple comes up with the iPod and then
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:31.960]   like from Venezuela, you know, you see this the the L rod that you know, sort of plays
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:37.800]   music, but it's, you know, chunky and it makes your own photo with lead.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.880]   The L rod is like the Mexican equivalent of the iPod.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.880]   Is that what that.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:46.400]   And rudo rudo musica.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.360]   I bought one last night.
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.360]   So I finally.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.360]   What what?
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:55.360]   I went and I reread Andy's stuff about this and I weighed it and I sat there and I realized
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:58.960]   that my copy of the divine comedy was going to take two days to arrive and I thought,
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.200]   you know, I'm going to give this spin.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.720]   I feel really, really stupid about spending this much money on something like that.
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.440]   But I'm going to give it a spin just really to be honest.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:11.520]   You may find an expensive camera and you buy a $450 book.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.520]   $300.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:13.520]   $359 now.
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:15.520]   Did you get the cheaper?
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.000]   Did you get the better price?
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.360]   And so I was at the cut that kind of put you over the top.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.360]   I don't know.
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.680]   Well, to be honest, Amazon can, you know, put a check mark by this one.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.000]   I became I started thinking about it again.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.640]   I hadn't thought about it for a while and then the price hearing about the price cut
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.640]   maybe.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.640]   That worked.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.160]   And I looked and I want to do a little bit of quick flipping around like are the books
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.640]   that I want available.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:41.000]   I'm still trying to figure out how I guess you email them the stuff that you want to
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   get.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   You have a special address.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   You know, merlin@kindle.com.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   I give it a spin.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.800]   I think as I said on the Twitter earlier today, I think it'll increase my reading in about
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:53.120]   the same way that the both like six pack my abs.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:58.800]   I'm 50 years old and yet I'm in the prime condition of my life.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.800]   I'm making a round of rules.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.800]   It works me out.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.800]   I don't even have to do anything.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:07.960]   The fact that I shaved my head and died my dirty means that the ladies are completely
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.200]   oblivious to my actual trudge bleed.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.200]   They look very goulé.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.200]   I'm the wiser.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.000]   And so I'm going to give it a spin.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.600]   Do you see pictures on it?
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.000]   Yeah, not very well.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.320]   I mean, they're kind of grace.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.320]   So the illustrations in the book do make it into the Kindle?
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:29.560]   It looks very much like HTML 2.0 in that you don't get really fancy formatting.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.600]   You don't get a wide variety of fonts.
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:36.440]   You can scale fonts up and down whenever you see an illustration, usually it appears on
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.640]   its own page.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:41.720]   If it's a very small one, it might be centered between two paragraphs.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:45.520]   But I found that it took me, it didn't take me long to get used to reading books on the
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:46.520]   Kindle.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:50.960]   I like the fact that I have, you know, right now I've got three books in process on the
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.960]   Kindle.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.920]   I like the fact that I can grab this one thing when I travel and I've got everything that
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.280]   I'm really, really reading.
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:01.440]   I mean, and we still come back to the idea that you get free internet access anywhere
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:06.520]   in the country for life without having to pay an extra, you know, an extra fee per month.
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.680]   Again, I would love to see this at less than 200 bucks.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:13.480]   At that point, a lot of people who are on the fence or didn't, a lot of people will
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.880]   put the coin in the air at that price.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:20.280]   At this price, still at $360, you really have to want it in order to go get it.
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:25.200]   So what if Apple were to come out with a competing product and announce it at WWDC?
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.640]   That would be interesting.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.360]   I wonder if they want to go against Jeff Bezos in this.
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.360]   It also doesn't make sense.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:33.520]   I mean, it makes sense for Amazon to do this because I was the other thing you said, Andy,
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.040]   I think you mentioned in one of your articles about the cost.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.520]   I have to say, I was really surprised that one of the books I looked at, I think it was
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.520]   actually getting things done.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.040]   I wanted to see if I could have a copy on there.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:49.480]   I think it was $9 for me to get it, you know, in two days in a book format or $9 on my
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.480]   Kindle.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.760]   And I was like, "Wow, that seems like kind of a ripoff.
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:57.760]   Seems like really, like seriously, it should cost about half to a tenth of the price."
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.520]   And I would gobble books down.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.360]   Yeah, and they're going to make money on the books, right?
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.360]   I mean, that's the whole premise.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.920]   They could almost give this away at some point, except for, well, they have some cost.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:06.920]   Eventually, I think you're in Andy.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:11.200]   I wonder if at some point they debated a Polaroid type model but found that it wasn't sustainable
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.200]   with the publishers.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.360]   They're paying for whatever it costs for the piece.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.360]   They're paying a lot of money.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.720]   So that's going to cost them money.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.360]   And the publishers get the big chart.
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.360]   The publishers are getting a big chart.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:22.440]   Well, a normal bookstore pays 50% the cover price.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.440]   That's correct.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.520]   So do you think Amazon's paying 50% of the cover price?
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.520]   No.
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:27.520]   Amazon's paying 40.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.840]   Okay.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.120]   And they're charging less than the cover price on these e-books.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.160]   Now they're probably making a better deal because there's no printing and there's no truck and
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.160]   there's no, yeah.
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.320]   So presumably they're making 60% on this.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.200]   That's why Apple's, that's a good amount of money.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.520]   And also it gets you again.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.080]   This is the iTunes thing and I don't have any proof for this because I'm not a business
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.080]   school guy.
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:48.160]   But my sense is that this gets you in the habit of going to, you know, thinking about
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.680]   Amazon as somebody you buy stuff from and even though you're doing it over your Kindle.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.440]   Like again, that's part of your whole Amazon experience.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.840]   I buy so much music from Amazon now that it's unbelievable.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.440]   And that brings me back to the site.
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.440]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.560]   For Apple to do that, it doesn't make as much sense because there's nothing, there's no
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:07.240]   like economies in the mail to you visiting the Apple store as much.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:10.320]   They didn't make that much money or they don't make that much money on music.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.320]   It's about selling iPods.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:15.120]   So their model is exactly the opposite of what Amazon's model presumably.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.480]   I'm saying like sell books through the iTunes.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.040]   I think that I don't think that Apple, I think if Apple builds something that's the
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:22.960]   same form factor, I don't think it's going to be to read books.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:23.960]   I think it's going to be a media player.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.200]   I think it's going to be a larger media player that.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:30.320]   Do we still think they'll announce that at WWC, something like that?
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:34.120]   I think it would be very, it's a long shot, but I think it would be a very good thing
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.880]   to announce because what you want to do is tell the developers that there's this whole
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:37.880]   platform to develop.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:38.880]   Right.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:44.000]   And well, presumably the platform SDK is the same as the iPhone or close enough.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.520]   It is, but more factor would be different.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:50.480]   So I mean, if it's bigger, you wouldn't make all the buttons just bigger.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.880]   You'd want to be able to have more control over how that works.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:57.880]   And I think that, I mean, the other thing that I think with the Kindle, because I started
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.480]   thinking about it when I saw the price drop, it came back into my mind.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.160]   And I started thinking about whether I wanted to get one, just like Merlin.
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:06.600]   And my whole thing is, is that I think that if you start looking at like what Adobe does
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:11.680]   with something that nobody's done much work with or very few people, which is the, these
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:17.320]   kind of hyperactive PDFs, I think that an electronic player becomes interesting to me
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.760]   when you add some little pieces to it.
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:23.480]   And so I can click on pictures and maybe see a video or I can have more linking between
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:28.120]   stuff or add 3D elements that I can rotate around while I'm looking at something.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:33.880]   These are all things I think that are possible in version three, four and five, or version
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.240]   one of what Apple's releasing.
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:39.280]   And I think that's going to be an interesting thing.
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:43.040]   I think the Apple one will be a lot more expensive than one of the Kindle is.
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.040]   If it comes out.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.720]   And if it's more functional, I don't mind.
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:46.720]   Right.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:51.680]   Now I'd be happy to pay $6.99, $7.99 for something like that.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:58.280]   So the iPhone is going to almost every country now in the world except Russia, China, and
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.280]   I think Japan.
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:04.800]   They've just announced that Telia Sonera will sell the iPhone in Sweden, Norway, Denmark,
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.840]   Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:08.600]   It's kind of the Baltic region.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.200]   Well, the Estonians have been lining up for months.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.120]   Don't knock Estonia, baby.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.960]   You know, I went with the line with paper.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:20.080]   Were you with me, Andy, when we went to visit the Wi-Fi king of Telene?
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:23.680]   Yes, well, it was more of a pilgrimage, really.
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:28.480]   You have to pay respects to the local warlords before you can use web on any device.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.160]   No, that's how you do business.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.160]   They're very proud.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.280]   The study is very proud that they are really wired and there's Wi-Fi everywhere.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.760]   So it's actually pretty hip.
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.840]   It ain't bad when you only got to go seven blocks.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.680]   Well, it's not such a huge country.
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.800]   It's bigger than Rhode Island.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:48.840]   So Scandinavia indicates, according to the New York Times, that a 3G model must be coming
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:56.400]   because it would not be wise to release a phone without 3G, according to Leif Olaf Wallin.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.400]   Leif is the man.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.280]   Leif says this would not be wise.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.880]   I would never argue with Leif.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:01.880]   Yes.
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:06.280]   And again, you can't-- we're not seeing any iPhones in stock at the Apple Store, so it's
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.920]   pretty clear that that's going to be a new phone.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:08.920]   June 9th.
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:09.920]   June 9th.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.640]   And it's going to look like an iMac.
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.400]   I'm going to put my money right back in my pocket if it does.
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:16.400]   We're going to do it.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.400]   Whoa.
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:20.760]   That's going to be the ninth and not a special press event near the end of the month.
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.800]   It could be sooner.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:25.880]   There's some speculation that it might be soon.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.720]   Has anybody received an invitation?
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:32.760]   Well, just I hear everybody saying that, oh, well, June 9th, June 9th, June 9th, so much
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:38.800]   so that there are some, you know, shall we say enlightened Apple pilgrims who lined up
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:45.200]   at the New York City Fifth Avenue store, like just like a week ago, betting on June 9th.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.040]   I just haven't seen any other information that makes me know that that's going to be
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.040]   the date.
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.880]   It always seemed to me as though they would do that as a special event.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.280]   That's interesting.
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:56.520]   Even with a Steve Jobs keynote coming up so close.
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:03.080]   I see him announcing the phone, June 9th, taking orders immediately after the keynote,
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:06.800]   and I see the phone hitting on June 10th, June 29th.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.800]   Why 29th?
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:08.800]   The one-year anniversary date.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.320]   No, I tell you why not.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.320]   Okay.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.320]   Couple of things.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:16.740]   AT&T is told its employees you may not take a vacation June 9th through June, whatever
[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:17.740]   15th.
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:18.740]   Through July or August.
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:21.280]   But they, but they're, but that when they do that, right, that means we can, we expect
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.380]   a lot of business.
[00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:27.240]   And what about those 88 electric computer containers coming in from the ships?
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:28.240]   Did you see that?
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:29.240]   I did see that.
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.240]   I mean, that sounds like they've got them in stock.
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:34.480]   It's going to be just like, it's going to be just like on the wire.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:38.160]   That's all you are saying we're going to all buy burner iPhones.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.560]   I want a burner iPhone.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.560]   Chinese prostitutes.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.560]   I'm telling you.
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:42.560]   Oh, you mean those containers?
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.560]   They're not full of phones?
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:44.560]   That's right.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.560]   Oh, no.
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:46.560]   You can watch the wire, Leo.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.560]   I love the wire.
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.560]   I'm on episode four.
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:50.040]   I'm halfway through episode four.
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:53.360]   And then I, and then I made a terrible, terrible mistake.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.720]   I ordered disc four from Netflix ahead of disc three.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:57.720]   Uh-oh.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.960]   So I put in disc four and I said, wait a minute.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:37:59.960]   He's, what?
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:00.960]   He's that.
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:01.960]   He's Omar's out of jail.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:02.960]   What happened?
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.480]   And my wife and I were watching and she says, I don't care.
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.480]   Let's just watch it.
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:06.480]   I said, no.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:10.560]   I have to see disc three before I, Omar's out of jail.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:11.560]   Really?
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:12.560]   I mean, get out of jail.
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.000]   So I'm waiting for that.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.880]   You're still like it, episode, season two, right?
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:17.880]   Merlin?
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:21.080]   Uh, no, I've, I've, uh, batted around.
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.960]   You've batted around.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:23.960]   You've gone all the way.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.320]   No, so for seasons one through four, I've been through it three times.
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.320]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:30.920]   I've been through season five once, but I, I've batted around.
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.960]   What's the best wire season?
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.560]   This is, you know, you'll get in a fist fight over this with people.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:39.840]   I, uh, I tend to follow conventional wisdom, which says season one and--
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.840]   Awesome.
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:43.000]   We are close to being the best.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.440]   A lot of people think season four is the best.
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:45.440]   That's the school season.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.320]   I'm enjoying the school season, but I like the doc season.
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.320]   I thought that was pretty good.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.320]   Here's the thing.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:54.360]   Then you got people like Jason Kocky who are very big advocates of, of season two.
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:55.360]   And--
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.040]   See, if you start talking about Lost, I'm going to tune out.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.400]   So, uh, stick with the wire here.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.520]   Let's say start with episode one, write it out.
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:02.520]   If you guys are going to be talking about--
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.440]   Not like the wire too often.
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.520]   Can we just get this segment of the show sponsored by PZ?
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:11.160]   Hey, it could be worse if we could be talking about American Idol.
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.160]   That could be worse.
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.920]   Somebody said, are you going to have Dave Cook on it?
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.920]   I said, who's Dave Cook?
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.400]   I have no idea who Dave Cook is.
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.400]   It's a honor.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.400]   Yeah, I don't care.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.400]   So--
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.200]   I mean, I have a separate deal with Satan to actually--
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:22.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.400]   --an idol from when I'm in hell for eternity.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.760]   And that'll be next to Dr. Phil.
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.760]   Leo--
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:28.760]   Leo--
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:32.800]   Leo, apparently the rat hole cassette is one of those boxes you have not unpacked yet.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.800]   Oh, I have it.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.000]   It's a time for a rat hole.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   Oh, it was time a long time ago.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.560]   I think the whole show.
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.560]   I think the whole show is a great role.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.440]   We're just going to rename this to rat hole weekly.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:43.440]   I'm always wrong.
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.440]   It's not.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.440]   It's not prostitutes.
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:46.440]   It's actually iPhones.

[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:11.880]   Be sure to get deacon.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.200]   That's the only way to get rid of your rat.

[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:24.880]   The actual people who are actually-- I'm sure they're thrilled to be mentioned right after

[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:29.880]   Yeah, speaking of rodents.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:33.880]   I got to tell you, I'm bored.

[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.880]   Page three?
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:37.880]   Hello, Americans.
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.880]   Stand by for books.
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:41.880]   That's the name of that little boy.
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:42.880]   That note was?
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.880]   He could never install his own radio.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:51.200]   It was stymied when it was time to change a light bulb.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.880]   Was Steve Jobs.
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:56.160]   Page three.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.160]   And now you know.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.160]   So now you know--
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.160]   The rough.
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:03.760]   Oh, somebody told me once that they were in the-- I guess it-- I don't remember ABC
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.680]   Building and they got in the elevator and there he is.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:07.680]   Paul Harvey.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.840]   And they walk in and he says, "Hello, Americans!"
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:11.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:16.800]   So apparently, you know, he had some sense of humor about his.
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:17.800]   Persona.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:18.800]   Oh, that's good.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:23.600]   We're brought to you today by audible.com/macbreak.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:28.120]   If you want to get your free book, you go there, you sign up and you can get a credit
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:32.000]   towards any of the 45,000 plus books.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.800]   I'd be kind of on a tear and I think-- I don't know why, but I think Mr. Scott Bourne would
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.480]   appreciate this.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.480]   I think you would.
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:43.680]   Do you know that today is the 10th-- I'm sorry, the 100th birthday of Ian Fleming?
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:45.440]   I was going to say he's a little bit older than that.
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.840]   Do you know who Ian Fleming is?
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:47.840]   I do.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:48.840]   Of course you do.
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:49.840]   The creator of James of Paul.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.640]   James Correct.
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:56.400]   And so audible has collected-- I'm just so thrilled about this-- all of the James Bond
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.160]   novels on audio.
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.680]   Can I play a little Doctor No for it?
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:00.680]   Why not?
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.760]   I'm going to add it after the fact.
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:03.760]   No, sweet it.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.760]   Haven't you haven't seen that before?
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:05.760]   Was it "Sweeted Black"?
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:06.760]   No.
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:07.760]   Be kind, rewind.
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:08.760]   Oh, I haven't seen that.
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:09.760]   Is that good?
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.760]   It looked like a really funny thing.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:11.760]   I'll get that on that.
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:16.440]   They make these movies by themselves and they call them being "sweeted" as in "sweetened."
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:17.440]   Makes no sense.
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:19.440]   So they have the "sweeted version" of all the movies.
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.440]   So we could just do the "sweeted version."
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.880]   What's your favorite Bond movie?
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:23.880]   That Doctor No.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:24.880]   It's a great movie.
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:25.880]   I mean, was this the first one?
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:26.880]   I'd really like to.
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:29.320]   The A's and B.
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.680]   You like "Lays and B"?
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.640]   I think that's a wildly underrated movie.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.200]   Because it's got Diana Rig.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.440]   I would watch Diana Rig.
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.440]   That's true.
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:37.440]   That's on her majesty's secret service.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:39.440]   But doesn't have the guy with the hat.
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:40.440]   The guy with the hat.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:41.600]   Odd job with the hat.
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:42.600]   Come on.
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:43.600]   That was "Goldfinger."
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:44.600]   Oh, that's right.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:45.600]   Sorry.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:46.600]   That's my favorite.
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:47.600]   Doctor No is "Dodle" the lady.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:48.600]   I changed my favorite.
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.600]   Doctor No and "Fomresher" were a little more understated.
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.600]   Goldfinger was like a...
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.880]   The Russian lady with the knives and her shoes.
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:54.880]   That was Russia from love.
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:55.880]   That was "Lottie Lene."
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:56.880]   Lottie and Goldfinger's got the gold and girl.
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.880]   My younger who sang "The Breck Wild."
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.960]   Well, the "Shark" deal.
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:05.000]   I was such teeth, dear.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.840]   And he keeps...
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:08.720]   I'm sorry, I better stop now.
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:10.320]   Here's a little Doctor No.
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.960]   "Men were shot."
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:16.320]   The three men were dressed in rags and wore dirty jipper-japper baseball caps with long
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:17.320]   peaks.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:18.320]   The three blindies.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:23.000]   They said nothing, and no noise came from them, except the soft tapping of their sticks
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.960]   as they came slowly down the shadowed pavement towards the group of cars.
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:31.520]   The three blind men would not have been in Congress in Kingston, where there are many
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:33.720]   diseased people on the streets.
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:38.720]   But in this quiet, rich, empty street, they made unpleasant impression.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.880]   And it was odd that they should all be Chinese Negroes.
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.040]   This is not a common mixture of bloods.
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:46.760]   This is 1956 or something like that.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:47.760]   But that is...
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.760]   You remember that scene at the beginning of the movie?
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:50.760]   I remember that.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:51.760]   That's how the movie begins.
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:52.760]   That's brilliant.
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:53.760]   That's so good.
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:56.000]   We should start doing this and let them do this.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.640]   I almost want to just listen to them some more of it.
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:01.720]   In the cardroom, the sun-burned hand reached out into the green pool of the centre table
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:04.000]   and gathered up the four cards.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.600]   There was a quiet snap as the trick went to join the rest.
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.720]   "Hundred honours," said Strangeways.
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:14.760]   And 90 below, he looked at his watch and stood up.
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:19.080]   Back in 20 minutes, your deal, Bill, orders and drinks, usual for me.
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:20.080]   He's not coming back.
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:21.680]   He's going to cook a hand for me while I'm gone.
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.240]   I always spot them.
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.280]   Bill Templer, the Brigadier, laugh shortly.
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:30.400]   I have to stop because if we could do this the whole show, it's just so great.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.120]   Simon Vance reads all of these and he's so British.
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.520]   It's so very good.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:37.320]   Anyway, I just thought I'd mention that because today's the day.
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:41.800]   "Hundredth birthday of Ian Fleming, the man who created James Bond."
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:43.560]   Andy, did you want to do a book too?
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:46.720]   I just wanted to give you a chance because I know you'd like to have pics.
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:50.160]   Yeah, I just wanted to...I had sort of an odd pick.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.160]   The God Delusion.
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:53.800]   Oh, is this the week you want to talk about that?
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:59.880]   Yeah, but I hope people aren't let down because, again, I was surprised that I got so many emails
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:04.320]   from people who wanted to make sure that I'd seen this interview and wanted to make sure
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:10.360]   that I read this piece of criticism and wanted to make sure I read this defense.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:15.120]   Realize that whenever I recommend a book on Audible, it's not a review.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:16.440]   I'm recommending the book.
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:21.960]   I'm saying that either I read it in paper or I listened to it as an Audible book and I enjoyed
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.800]   the process of reading it.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:27.120]   That doesn't mean that I agreed with everything that was in the book.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:30.760]   I love the intellectual process of reading.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:34.960]   And I found that...I read the God Delusion a couple of years ago when it first came out
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:41.360]   because for reasons that are probably too boring, I decided to really decide on whether...I've
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:44.760]   been a lifelong agnostic and I decided, "Well, look, let's stop."
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:46.520]   I've been sort of a default agnostic.
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:52.240]   Let's try to figure out if I just haven't...I've just too boring, just too dull, too lazy
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:57.760]   rather to become an atheist or to don't have whatever conviction takes to go back to whatever
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:59.800]   church I ran away from.
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:04.800]   And so I wanted to read all I could about other people's opinions and other people's
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.080]   takes on it.
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:13.280]   I found that it was as entertaining as a Michael Moore documentary in the sense that it's entertainment.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:18.840]   You really enjoy the process of seeing someone who's this passionate about a subject, prosecute
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:22.000]   that point of view and damn the torpedoes.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   It doesn't mean that you think that the arguments are particularly convincing.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.080]   Now, this is going to be another advertisement for the Amazon Kindle.
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:35.640]   One of the cool features of it is that you can dog ear digitally any page you want and
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:38.880]   if there's a particular page that you want to return to later on, you can actually sort
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:39.880]   of clip it.
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:44.280]   So attached to each digital book you have will be a list of all these notes that you collected
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:46.160]   and all these bookmarks.
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:49.680]   And every time that I came to a page, you're like, "Oh, that's bull.
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.440]   Well, that's kind of a circular argument.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:56.560]   Oh, well, that's kind of an arrogant point that you just...G Richard, you've just actually
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:01.200]   mentioned something that sounds like a statistical fact, but you're not backing it up with any
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:02.520]   proof whatsoever.
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:05.760]   And so there are so many of these dog ears and notes that it's actually kind of pointless
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:09.520]   because every second or third page is a dog ear or a note.
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.400]   But that's exactly the sort of relationship that I want to have with a book.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:17.480]   I don't want to just turn on an audio book and fall asleep an hour and a half later without
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:19.440]   really engaging with it.
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:22.960]   Again, I don't think he makes a really good argument one way or another.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:29.840]   I think that the sum total of the statement that Dawkins makes in this book is that I
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:34.300]   personally don't understand how there could be a traditional God and therefore that means
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:37.520]   there can't possibly be a traditional God.
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:41.800]   That's what I've gotten after two readings of this book because anytime that he comes
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:47.840]   close to making a really forceful point, he either parries away from it or clouds it
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:53.480]   in a personal opinion or disengages by changing the subject before he really gets to the point,
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:56.680]   which is what I found a little bit disappointing.
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:01.280]   He does make a couple points that are absolutely incontrovertible that make me glad that the
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:03.280]   book is out there.
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:11.840]   I agree with him 100% when he says that religion should not get a free pass from critical thinking.
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:16.240]   This was actually brought to mind another complaint I had about the book.
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:21.160]   He has all these, what he actually refers to as conscious elevating points inside the
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:22.160]   book.
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:25.840]   I'm sort of like making a list of them saying, "Okay, you've got 12 of these conscious elevating
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:26.840]   points."
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:31.760]   You do know that Pope John Paul II agrees with you on at least six of these.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:38.360]   At least not quite the bomb throwing radical treatise that you might have thought it was.
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:42.480]   But one of these points is that you should be able to, you shouldn't just say, "Well,
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:45.200]   I respect all religions no matter how silly they might seem."
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:47.240]   You can actually discuss these things.
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:52.360]   As I've learned in the past two or three years, if you ask somebody, "What do you believe
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:54.200]   and why do you believe it?"
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:57.800]   People who have thought this out can really give you wonderful explanations that make
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.320]   perfectly good sense to them.
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:03.200]   It might actually make some sense to you even if you don't agree with it.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.840]   I'm sorry, I'm being distracted by the damn thing.
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:06.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:08.800]   We don't hear it at all, so don't worry about it.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:09.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:14.480]   I've got one year talked to whatever is happening outside and one year on actually what I'm
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.480]   talking about.
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:18.080]   The bottom line is that it's a great book.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:22.440]   It's a book that will take you about three times as long to get through it in the car
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:25.360]   as it will if you're actually reading it.
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:26.360]   You raise it.
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:27.360]   You do talk back to it.
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:28.800]   I did talk back to it quite a bit.
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:32.640]   You'll end up pausing and saying, "Well, let me think."
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:33.640]   It's like, "Okay, fine.
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.280]   3,000 people killed in 9/11.
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:40.360]   We compare that to 800,000 people killed in Rwanda, 1.2 million killed by Paul Pot,
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:44.800]   10.5 million killed by Mount Seitung."
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:46.640]   It really does get the neurons firing.
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:50.680]   You feel as though you've had a very, very satisfying protein-filled book experience
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.240]   when you're at the end of it.
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:53.240]   Yes.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.960]   I really enjoyed it.
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.480]   I thought it was an excellent book.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:00.920]   Again, another very thought-provoking choice from audible.com.
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:07.640]   You can listen to Dr. No, or you can listen to the God-delusion.
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.640]   They're very different.
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:14.160]   One's candy and one will get you talking back to your radio.
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:20.520]   If you're in an MRI machine and you want the entire brain to go green and red, go for
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:24.880]   one in each ear because all sectors of your brain will be on fire with both of these books
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:25.880]   going at the same time.
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:26.880]   You bet.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:27.880]   No kidding.
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:28.880]   It's very simple.
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:29.880]   All you have to do is go to audible.com.
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:34.920]   If you're not already a member, if you go to audible.com/macbreak, you could sign up and
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:37.200]   you can get a credit toward a free book.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:40.240]   If you're already an Audible member, and I know now most of our audience, I believe,
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:42.960]   is an Audible member.
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.280]   These are a couple of great recommendations.
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:47.000]   I love doing these recommendations because that's one of the fun things about being an
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.200]   Audible member is suggesting books.
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:50.600]   There's so many great choices.
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:52.600]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:56.160]   We thank them so much for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:00.520]   Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is time for our picks of the week.
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:01.760]   We've got such a big panel.
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:02.760]   We better get right to it.
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:03.760]   Do you want to start?
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:04.760]   I mean, ladies first.
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:05.760]   Sure.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:06.760]   Thank you.
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:07.760]   I appreciate that.
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:09.600]   Leila Leila, with her pick of the week.
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.600]   Well, I definitely picked this chocolate.
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:12.600]   Chocolate.
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:13.600]   Okay.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:14.600]   You can say yes on it.
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:15.600]   Yes.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:16.600]   This is great.
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:17.600]   I like the Matty Ascar.
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:18.600]   Do you like that better than the Venezuelan?
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:19.600]   I do.
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:20.600]   Okay.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:21.600]   That's actually not my pick.
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:22.600]   If this is a grand group.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:23.600]   If this is a grand group.
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:24.600]   Yes.
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:27.600]   We had Gary Vee's in town and we should have some wine with the chocolate.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:28.600]   She's in town.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:29.600]   Why isn't he here?
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:30.600]   I don't understand.
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:33.760]   He's going to be, we should mention that if you're in the Bay Area that you can go see
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:39.400]   Gary at one o'clock this afternoon, which is Wednesday, May 28th.
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:40.400]   Is that what that day is?
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:41.400]   Yes.
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.400]   Today?
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:43.400]   Yes.
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:45.560]   At the book passage in Corta Madeira, which is in Marin County, and actually my friends
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:46.560]   own the store.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:51.560]   It's a wonderful independent bookstore where they still have authors come in and talk
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:53.560]   which is a great thing.
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:54.560]   So go see Gary Vee.
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:57.560]   One o'clock this afternoon, he's worried because it's a weekday and he thinks nobody's going
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:58.560]   to show up.
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:51:59.560]   Yeah.
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:00.560]   Bring chocolate if you can.
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:01.560]   Bring chocolate.
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:02.560]   And he'll have the wine.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:03.560]   Yes.
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:04.560]   So your pick.
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:05.560]   So my pick is actually, it's a free, there's zero Alexes.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:06.560]   I like that.
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:08.560]   It's a software called Cam Twist.
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:14.760]   It's a software switcher or video switcher, excuse me, software based that works on the
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:15.960]   Mac.
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:20.760]   And I know it supposedly works with Skype for example and Stickcam, which I know you use.
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:22.760]   I've only used it with Stickcam.
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:23.760]   Yeah.
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:28.720]   And it's great for adding elements to give your broadcast a little bit of kind of professionalism
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:31.560]   in terms of adding banners and- Or flames.
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:32.560]   Right, flamethlight.
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:33.560]   Oh yes.
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:34.560]   No.
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:35.560]   Bullet holes.
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:36.560]   Yeah.
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:37.560]   Yes.
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:38.920]   So effects like that as well, but being able to screen capture your desktop.
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:44.560]   What I haven't tried it with, what I was just thinking of was to use it with iMovie and use
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:47.880]   it as kind of a free version of a screencasting.
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:48.880]   So I want to try with that.
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:49.880]   I've never tried it that way.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:50.880]   It's a good idea.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:51.880]   So Cam Twist.
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:53.880]   And actually I don't remember what the link is.
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:54.880]   I can pull that word.
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:56.480]   But if you just do a Google on Cam Twist.
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.840]   It's a little weird because he doesn't have like a website.
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:52:59.840]   It's like- Right.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:01.640]   It's kind of a strange thing, but it is free.
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:03.600]   So you can't really blame him for that.
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:05.000]   And it works well.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:09.240]   Sometimes there are delays with any software switcher or video switcher that is software
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:11.840]   based or any software based program.
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.080]   But it works well.
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:15.720]   I've had good luck using it with Estream.
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:19.560]   Alocinit, A-L-L-O-S-C-I-N-I-T.
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:23.560]   Alocinit.com.
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:24.560]   And that's where you can get it.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:25.920]   Yeah, I've used it for a long time.
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:26.920]   Mac only.
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:30.360]   And all the Windows people just drool when they say it.
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:32.760]   They say, "Wow, I want to do that."
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:33.760]   Right.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:34.760]   Some really fancy stuff.
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:36.680]   You can import a Flickr photo set.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.440]   So if you wanted to show your audience, yeah.
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:39.440]   I wouldn't know that.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:42.880]   So you can just paste in the URL from that or drag photos into it.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.800]   And it creates a slideshow.
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:52.240]   You can show your desktop, use a webcam, either USB base or I use a firewire camera plugged
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:54.200]   into my laptop.
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:57.040]   And one of the things we've started doing with Girls on Geek actually is we're taking
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:02.080]   the feed out of our board and going into the computer that we're recording from so that
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:05.480]   people can hear the audio and we're getting really good audio.
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:06.480]   Using Camtwist.
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:07.480]   Right.
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:08.480]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:12.360]   I don't know if I'm getting the effects that I want to get here.
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:14.120]   Let's see if I can put bubbles on you.
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:17.440]   If you could add at the bottom of that window there.
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:18.440]   Right.
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:20.040]   But can you do it in like photo booth?
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:21.040]   Oh, there it is.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.040]   There it is.
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:23.040]   How do you like that, Scott?
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:24.040]   I think it's wonderful.
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:25.040]   It's the bubbly.
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:26.040]   The bubbly.
[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:27.040]   And I could put bullet holes in there.
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:28.880]   We should change the graphic on girl one.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:31.480]   We can use those for dane, the bullet hole ones.
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:32.480]   Yeah, right.
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:35.080]   It's kind of fun.
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:36.560]   Anyway, that is a great program.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:37.560]   I'll send it.
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:38.560]   That's that.
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:39.880]   And it's called Camtwist.
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:40.880]   Scott, born.
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:41.880]   You're also here.
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:43.120]   Might as well get to you next.
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:44.360]   Okay.
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:46.920]   My pick is not free.
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.400]   But is it a canon?
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:49.400]   No.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:50.400]   It's less than half an Alex.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.160]   Oh, well, that's good.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:56.320]   The giant filter company from the old days, those of us who did photography and carried
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:57.320]   filters with us, Tifen.
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:58.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:01.800]   They make filters of all kinds, including, by the way, most people don't know this, motion
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:02.960]   picture filters.
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:06.880]   They make a lot of the filters used by motion picture operators.
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:09.280]   And they have a new product that works in aperture.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:10.560]   It also works with Photoshop.
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:11.920]   And it also works with standalone.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:13.760]   It's called DFX.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:16.800]   And it's a plugin for aperture that I'm using.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:17.800]   It's $2.99.
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:20.440]   It's $100 more than aperture.
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:25.800]   But let me tell you, it's got almost 100 filters, anything you can think of.
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:31.560]   And it's really kept me from going to Photoshop as much as I used to because you can do just
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:35.120]   unbelievable things to your photographs with this filter set.
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:38.040]   There's the conventional stuff like black and white and all that.
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:40.360]   But there are some cinematic quality filters.
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:43.800]   In fact, they used the Roscoe gels by number.
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:48.640]   So if you wanted to like pre-visualize a cinema shoot, you could use a still photograph
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:54.000]   from the set, throw the gel on in these filter effects plugins and then go, "Okay, call the
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.680]   guys and order the Roscoe 3425 gs."
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:57.920]   Oh, so you know what it looks like?
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:59.480]   It's exactly the same filter.
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:00.480]   Wow, that's interesting.
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:02.480]   And it's very easy to use.
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:03.680]   It works right from aperture.
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:09.120]   In fact, I'm going to be demonstrating this Saturday in Los Angeles at Mac Day LA.
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:10.120]   Wow.
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:11.400]   So I'm going to be talking about photography there.
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:14.560]   I'm going to have this plugin and a couple of other plugins to the aperture.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:16.320]   There's a lot of cool stuff you can use.
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:17.320]   I can say it's spendy.
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:22.640]   That's my only downside because even by aperture for $199, this is more than an aperture.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:24.720]   But they do have a free trial.
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:26.040]   I think it's a 15 or 30-day trial.
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:27.840]   I'm looking at the website.
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:30.560]   It's hard to find because Tiffin makes glass filters as you say.
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:31.560]   Right.
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:33.440]   Tiffin and then DFX.
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:37.280]   But they do have demos of every picture, every filter.
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:40.520]   They have an incredible help file that really explains what the filters do.
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:43.520]   They're presets that come with each filter and you can make your own presets.
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:44.520]   Look at that.
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:45.520]   So that's a color correction for fluoresce.
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:48.160]   Tremendous color correction stuff.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:53.640]   But they have the cool features like the fog and the diffusion and the vignetting and
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:58.800]   the graduated neutral density filters that are multicolor.
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:00.200]   These are addictive.
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:01.920]   These programs become really addictive.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.480]   You start playing with them and then you need more and more.
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:06.720]   I spend about two minutes with each shot in aperture and about 20 minutes with each
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:07.720]   shot in this.
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:08.720]   Right.
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:09.720]   Oh, look at that.
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:10.720]   Yeah, look how it makes this portrait really soft.
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:11.720]   This is called glimmer glass.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:14.280]   Is that an actual filter that Tiffin as well sells?
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:15.280]   Probably.
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:17.880]   I mean, most of these are based on various filter combinations.
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:20.960]   That's probably basically what they would call a soft focus number one.
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:21.960]   Right.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:22.960]   Right.
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:24.480]   Here's the gold diffusion which warms it up and softens it.
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:25.480]   Well, that's pretty.
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:27.480]   It's an amazing product.
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:29.040]   You can download it for free if you like it.
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:30.040]   There you go.
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:32.080]   They even have a gold reflector.
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:35.080]   So if you just have a gold reflector, you just put it in.
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:38.200]   If you lose your gold reflector, you can just bring it in here.
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:43.040]   Now, the important thing is I'm using this in aperture, but it does work in Photoshop
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:48.880]   and it works as a standalone program and includes a very cool masking tool that makes
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:52.760]   it unnecessary to even own Photoshop if these are the kinds of corrections you basically
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:53.760]   make.
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:54.760]   Oh, interesting.
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:55.760]   Okay.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:56.760]   Yeah, because they say specifically this is for aperture.
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:58.240]   Yeah, they do make it for Photoshop.
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:57:59.560]   But they also make it for others.
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:01.440]   And they also make it as a standalone app.
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:02.440]   Cool.
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:04.960]   DFX, Macintosh and Windows, by the way.
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:05.960]   Free 15-day trial.
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:06.960]   All right.
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:07.960]   There you go.
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:08.960]   But it won't work on Windows and aperture.
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:09.960]   No.
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:10.960]   Because aperture won't work.
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:12.960]   I just want to point you.
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:13.960]   And I think we're really seeing an explosion of these plugins.
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:15.760]   I think we're going to see a lot more for aperture.
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:18.160]   It's starting to turn out to be a really great place.
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:22.560]   I know we've done a couple and they've done real well for us so far and we're working
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:24.360]   on a couple.
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:27.200]   And I think we're going to see a lot more coming out for aperture.
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:28.600]   So it's an exciting time.
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:33.000]   It's a really smart thing for Apple to do is to make that open and easy to write plugins
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   for it.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.400]   Because you don't have a big enough development team.
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:39.080]   You just let the world develop for you.
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:41.960]   And they're going to do great stuff and interesting stuff that you've never thought.
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:46.120]   And we often complain on this program about Apple being a little too closed.
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:49.400]   Here's a place where they're not open about and it makes a difference.
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:52.440]   Let's get Alex Lindsey's pick as we continue on with Mac Break Weekly.
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:53.440]   Hello, Alex.
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:54.440]   All right.
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:59.640]   So mine is my pick is just about a 16th of an Alex.
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:01.480]   So it's not super expensive.
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:05.040]   I haven't looked at this application for a little while and I came back to there's a
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:10.880]   new version and this is delicious library version two.
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:12.960]   And does anyone here use delicious library?
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:13.960]   I love it.
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:14.960]   You know what?
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:15.960]   It's funny.
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:16.960]   I don't use it.
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:17.960]   I love it.
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:18.960]   It's the most beautiful thing ever.
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:22.120]   I've been watching Will Shipley on Twitter as he's slowly been getting too done.
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:26.200]   I just don't, you have to be the kind of person who wants to organize everything.
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:31.680]   We have an issue where we have a growing library of books and a lot of it is just kind of trying
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:33.840]   to keep track of all of this stuff.
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:38.800]   Where is it and what do we have so when we're making requests or we're going out and getting
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:41.440]   stuff, is it actually here?
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:45.800]   And the earlier version I have to admit the eyesight worked okay.
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:53.160]   But I got to say with the new version of the little library two, the it's barcode scanner
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:54.660]   is amazing.
[00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:58.240]   So you can just throw that book right up and you don't have to have a barcode scanner.
[00:59:58.240 --> 00:59:59.640]   You use the camera on your Mac.
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:00.640]   No, you just have your eyesight.
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:04.120]   I just keep on showing these books and I tested the new one and I couldn't believe it.
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:08.640]   There was like two that foiled it but there was, I put like 40 of them up in like three
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.640]   or four minutes.
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.920]   I mean it was just, you just put it up there and hear this boom and it reads out loud.
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:18.280]   It reads what you just did and it pours into the piece and then you have all, and it's
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.840]   not just that you have a representation of all the books.
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:25.320]   It has the, it has, you know, all the details that are downloaded from Amazon.
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.320]   It has ratings.
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:29.560]   It also has other books that you might like, you know, all that recommendation stuff is
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:32.040]   all built into the application.
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:35.280]   And so once you've collected it and shows you which ones you already have versus the
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:39.600]   ones that are still there in the grouping that you might be interested in, definitely
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.880]   worth downloading the demo and playing with it.
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:49.400]   It's $40 so it's not that expensive if you decide you want to actually buy it.
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:55.000]   But no matter what, it's worth, go download the demo version and just try it for yourself
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.240]   because beyond all, beyond everything else, it's real eye candy just to play with.
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:02.600]   Well, it's, it created a new generation of Macintosh software.
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.320]   They call it the delicious generation.
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.320]   Yeah.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:08.960]   I mean they really revolutionized what software can look like.
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:10.880]   And I've been very excited watching 2.0 come on.
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:13.800]   So you really think 2.0 is a well, is a worthwhile upgrade.
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:15.720]   Yeah, I definitely think so.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.840]   It's considerably better than the earlier version.
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.600]   It definitely worth it.
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:21.720]   If you're using it already, you definitely want to check it out.
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:25.640]   If you haven't used it, at least download the demo and play with it because it's really
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:26.920]   just a lot of fun.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:29.760]   From delicious-monster.com.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:33.000]   And the great story about this, of course, is that they wrote the original version in
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   a coffee shop.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.080]   They didn't have offices.
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:39.280]   They all just went to, I think it was a Seattle coffee shop and they worked on this
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.280]   together.
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:41.280]   And it's really-
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:42.280]   It's like Harry Potter books.
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:43.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:49.160]   Did you see that Amazon bought the tales of Beatle the Bard?
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.360]   Did you see that whole story?
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:51.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:52.360]   That was wild.
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:59.040]   JK Rowling did something like Six Hand Written, beautifully leather-bound with silver chasing
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:03.000]   and stuff, editions of this Tales of the Beatle the Bard.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.440]   And, and, and sold them an auction for charity.
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:08.080]   She has a charity for institutionalized kids in Britain.
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:11.800]   Amazon spent, I think, almost $2 million on these things.
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:17.400]   And they just auctioned, I'm sorry, had a contest to give it away.
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:22.640]   And a young, a 17-year-old girl wrote it, wrote in wonderful, I thought, little poem.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:25.960]   And she won a copy of it, which is so cool.
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:30.920]   Anyway, that's "Appropole of Nothing," but I thought I'd mention it.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:31.920]   Andy Enoch.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:32.920]   Cool.
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:33.920]   You got a pick for us?
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:38.680]   Yeah, I have a pick that's actually very, very relevant when I'm using Skype.
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:42.840]   There are times when I'm in the middle of like three different projects that use five,
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:50.200]   six, seven different hugely memory and process hogging apps like Photoshop and Aperture and
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:55.680]   Safari that's decided that's going to use about 50% of all CPU cycles to play a flash
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.680]   video on and on and on.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:02.000]   And then it's time for me to do something via Skype, which is another big power hungry
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   app.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.120]   And suddenly the whole performance of Skype degrades because all these other apps are
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.120]   in there.
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:12.080]   So what I wind up doing is having to quit all of those other apps, even though I'm right
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:15.640]   in the middle of different things, then having to relaunch them later on just to get that
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:17.240]   CPU power back.
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:21.560]   I found a little app that's called Boke.
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:24.040]   Boke in OKH.
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.040]   This just came out.
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.480]   I was very interested in this.
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:28.480]   I just tried it a couple of days ago.
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:29.800]   What it, it's a very, very simple thing.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:33.760]   All it does is it freezes other apps that are currently running.
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:38.360]   So for instance, right now what it does is it puts this little tulip icon in the menu
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:39.360]   bar.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:47.120]   And so if I want all, if I want as much of my Mac's resources to be thrown at Skype as
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:51.720]   possible, I could just simply select Skype from the list.
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:56.600]   And every other app, including the Finder literally blurs behind it.
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:01.160]   If you take up process, if you do a process watch, you can find that every other app is
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:03.360]   now using 0% of the CPU.
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:06.720]   And now Skype has every bit of CPU that it wants.
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:09.720]   You can also just selectively freeze individual apps.
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:14.320]   So just freeze GarageBand and just freeze Photoshop, but have other apps that are still
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:15.840]   available behind you.
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:17.720]   Now it's not a magical app.
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:22.920]   It's not like this is suddenly I've got an 8-core processor behind Skype all of a sudden.
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:26.600]   But I do find that it does speed things up, it does clear the bottlenecks.
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:30.520]   Unfortunately, one of the best uses I found for it in the past couple of days is when
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:36.480]   I've got those 20, 30, 40 windows open in Safari and two of them are Google Reader.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:40.640]   And for whatever reason, Safari and Google Reader are having their usual, you know,
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:47.480]   Hatfield and McCoy, you know, barn fight and just really slowing the entire machine down.
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:51.160]   I can just freeze out that one app without having to figure out how to close it down just
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.360]   temporarily.
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:55.080]   And I get those CPU cycles back.
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:58.560]   You get to use it unrestricted for 10 days, it's just 17 bucks.
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:02.760]   So you get to spend a couple of weeks trying to figure out if it's of any help to you.
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:06.000]   And if it is, it's definitely worth the 17 bucks because just the amount of time that
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.800]   I get back and not having to quit all these apps and then relaunch them and reopen all
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:13.000]   my documents, that's worth 17 bucks for me.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.880]   Daniel's going to get mad at me because he got mad at me when I said Puka, I couldn't
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:20.280]   understand why Puka Puka was not free.
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:23.400]   I looked at Boca, I thought, I think this could be useful.
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:25.560]   I don't know why it's 17 bucks.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.680]   Doesn't it seem like this is like a, is like nice.
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.200]   It's like a Unix utility almost.
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:31.480]   Just telling it.
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:32.600]   Have you ever used nice Leo?
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.840]   Do you use that in the shelf?
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.360]   I don't.
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:37.360]   But I mean, you could, I mean, but I know how to use it.
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.840]   And I certainly would use it if I felt like I needed to.
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:40.960]   Machines are so powerful now.
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:44.280]   I don't really ever feel like, Oh gosh, I need some more horsepower.
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:47.960]   Yeah, but if you have do a lot of stuff on a Mac book, especially if you're doing stuff
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:52.920]   on Power PC Max, this is the utility like this is going to get more and more important.
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:56.800]   And frankly, maybe there is a way to do this from a command line.
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:00.640]   I'm certain that someone's going to email us to let us know how you can do that.
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:04.240]   But I would much rather be able to click this jolly little tulip and select a jolly little
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:09.480]   icon from the, from the menu bar and have a rice, the nice little user interface.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:11.040]   I mean, it'd be nice if they were 10 bucks.
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:12.040]   It'd be nice if we were free.
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:14.400]   But I don't think that's $17 is a ridiculous.
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.120]   And nice, nice is not nearly as friendly.
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:18.720]   I guess you're just basically going in and saying I haven't used it.
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:22.920]   I'm actually just looking at the page here, but you just tell it to.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:23.920]   It's kind of the opposite.
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:26.080]   It says, give up your cycles.
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:28.280]   If you don't, don't be a high priority application.
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:31.360]   But I'm sure I would think that there's somewhere in here that you could say you get
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.360]   all the cycles.
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:33.360]   It's a neat idea.
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:34.360]   You know what I would love?
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:35.360]   I was afraid of paying.
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:36.360]   Let me put it this way.
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:42.360]   I was afraid, which is lame, but I was afraid of paying 17 bucks for an Apple script.
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:44.360]   You know that this, this is really just an Apple script.
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:48.120]   I remember back in the day on nine when you go to get info and you could say how much
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:49.680]   memory you wanted to allocate.
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:50.680]   Yes.
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:54.360]   And so if you wanted to run, I actually quirk's not a good example, but what was it?
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:57.800]   What was some of the, I want to say some of the layout programs in Photoshop and you
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:03.600]   don't have to just go in, okay, change it to 15, 15 megs of RAM or whatever.
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:07.520]   And you could sort of, it was a version of this by saying, you know what, take as much
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:08.520]   as you want.
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:10.360]   Right, right.
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:13.040]   They only did that because they had no memory management and always nine.
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:15.360]   So you had to do it kind of manually.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:16.360]   Yeah.
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.480]   So you had to launch Photoshop first.
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:19.480]   Seems so weird to me.
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:23.440]   I'll watch sometimes sit there and if I'm feeling things are getting a little, you know, tight
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:27.640]   in terms of memory, I'll start watching some activity viewers.
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.640]   That what it's called?
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:29.640]   I don't think it's a long time ago.
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:30.640]   Yeah.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.240]   So it's amazing to me.
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:38.080]   What ends up occasionally I'll get runaway tasks, but a lot of the times it's Safari or
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:39.080]   it's I-Cal.
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:41.840]   I mean, maybe this is just symptomatic for Firefox.
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:42.840]   Firefox.
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:44.320]   I mean, I just turn it on.
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:47.120]   I'm like, it's taking up like a hundred and ten percent for some reason.
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:49.240]   You're using two or three?
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.680]   I'm using whatever the current version is.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:52.680]   Three.
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:53.680]   No.
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:54.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:57.440]   Two was had a nasty memory problem, which they claimed was a feature, not a book.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:02.240]   Now, if you run Flash, just watch Stand Back because, for instance, if you're watching this
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:05.280]   stream, your CPU cycles will peg.
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.520]   Flash is a huge hog.
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:08.240]   It'll eat CPU like crazy.
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.240]   Right.
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:12.680]   And a lot of the video technologies that we're using, whether it's HTML, or HTML, or
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:13.680]   it's H.264, or...
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:14.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:15.680]   That's right.
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:20.200]   All of these things, they're expecting you to have a very faster processor than expect
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:22.040]   you to use it if they're going to play it back.
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.040]   That's how they make it smaller.
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.040]   Right.
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.040]   I like the idea, man.
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.040]   These pick a lot.
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:32.560]   You know what would be really neat would be to have an application where you provide
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:36.040]   just a little bit of logic and say, you know what?
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.040]   Whenever...
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.200]   So, like, let's say, for example...
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.840]   Well, you can do this with bokeh because it's Apple Scriptable.
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:44.520]   Oh, so you can always say, like, okay, so, like, give as much...
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:47.560]   Sort of like you can allocate bandwidth and stuff like transmission or something like
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:48.560]   that.
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:51.960]   It'd be kind of cool if you could say, except when the S and such app is running, always
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.640]   give priority to these apps.
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:56.680]   If you could do the logic in Automator or Apple Script, you could do it because this is
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:57.680]   Scriptable.
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:58.680]   That's pretty cool.
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:00.440]   Not to look at that.
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:04.560]   And it's bokehappabb.com.
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:07.800]   I just wonder if you could do something similar with ReNice and just...
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:10.040]   I mean, I'm pretty sure you could.
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.040]   Not your time worth, Leo.
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.040]   You're right.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.040]   Seventeen bucks, isn't it?
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.880]   And that's exactly what Daniel...
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:16.960]   When I said, "Pucka should be free."
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:22.800]   Daniel, Red Sweater, a software, wrote a big, long article saying, you know, Leo's crazy.
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.160]   People put a lot of work into this software.
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.160]   Why should it be free?
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:26.960]   You know, I've given away software.
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:28.400]   When I was a younger man, I was writing software.
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:29.400]   I gave away software.
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:33.920]   I just feels like there's a threshold that software has to go over to be able to charge
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:34.920]   for it.
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:37.400]   I'd pay $17 for the shipping to get it.
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:38.400]   You're right.
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:39.400]   It's not that much money.
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:40.400]   Thank you.
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:43.080]   One thing that's really tough about that, and I'm just...
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:44.520]   I have never made software.
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:47.880]   I've made some really insecure PHP apps, but apart from that...
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:53.120]   All right, let's just have the insert statement.
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.680]   You know, I look at somebody like...
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:57.920]   Again, I'm always mentioning him because I think he's such a paragon of fine Mac development.
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:02.000]   But look at somebody like Buzz Anderson who's charging crazy small amounts of money for
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.960]   his amazing iPod app where you could go to Mac Update or you could go to Wherever and
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:10.000]   find like 15 applications by day.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.280]   Your random dude basically wrap a Unix script or whatever.
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:17.040]   But the thing is, support is such an invisible seeming invisible cost.
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:18.600]   And you know, good support.
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:21.200]   Like God willing, it's like insurance and you'll never need it.
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:24.960]   But when you really need somebody to answer your question, Buzz Anderson will answer your
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:25.960]   damn question.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:26.960]   Hey, I buy his stuff.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:29.000]   I don't mind paying for stuff.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.520]   I think you're talking about Podworks, right?
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:31.880]   I'm saying this is what's complicated though.
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:36.360]   It's hard to know until you need help, how awesome some people are about support and how
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:38.320]   other people suddenly just disappear.
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:40.600]   Like they'll just have a stroke and you never hear from them again.
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:44.480]   And like other people who are like just like support developments, just part of it.
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:47.040]   The amazing amount of energy that goes into having to support.
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:51.240]   So I just feel like this program, I don't, it's more like I don't want to be taken advantage
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:52.240]   of.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:53.240]   I'm going to buy you a copy.
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:59.320]   It's possible that this program is four lines of bash script wrapped in cocoa.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:00.320]   That's how it is.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:06.240]   And if it is, I would feel like I'm just flashing back to like the 80 minute conversation
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:10.280]   we had about four weeks ago, about a $30,000 mixer and a $40,000.
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.280]   Yeah.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:12.280]   Hello.
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:13.280]   We're sitting here.
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:14.280]   What you pay for?
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:15.280]   That's a good example.
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:16.280]   That's a good example.
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:18.120]   We're going to afford a large cheese pizza.
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.280]   God forbid.
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.280]   You know, here's the problem.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:21.280]   Here's the problem.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:24.440]   Many of our listeners don't know this about Leo, but he's tighter than a bark on a tree.
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:25.880]   I'm not right.
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:27.600]   I'm very generous and I give away.
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.160]   I mean, when I made software I gave it away.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.480]   I gave away all this programming.
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:31.480]   I'm buying you a copy.
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:34.360]   I'm going to give away my PHP apps now.
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:36.960]   I'm just going to be, I'm going to tell you right now.
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.440]   I'm sending you a software license today.
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:40.560]   Going to be some MySQL injection problems.
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:41.680]   I'm not going to lie to you.
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:46.040]   I have a little PHP app that a hacker left on my server.
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:51.080]   You can have a little later on the next few weeks once we get, you know, the set, the
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:54.240]   Twit Live stuff settled and the TriCast are working.
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:56.520]   We're going to actually spend some time going through that code line by line.
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:00.960]   It's a hacker script that I inadvertently left a hole on my server.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.680]   This kid uploaded the script.
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:06.920]   What you did, you probably left an images directory 777 just like I did.
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:08.080]   Essentially, that's what I did.
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:09.520]   It was worse than that.
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:13.760]   Pretty much every forum application tells you to do things like your avatar directory
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.680]   777, which back in the day wasn't that big a deal.
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:21.040]   But now I got pegged as a phishing site because for like morning somebody got something into
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:22.040]   a 777.
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:29.000]   The reason is PHP, you know, the server will execute a PHP program from any open directory
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   like that.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.080]   If they can find a way to get something on your server, they can use a browser to execute
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:35.080]   it.
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:36.080]   So that's what he did.
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.360]   I actually had a directory that people I was allowing people to upload.
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:40.880]   Let's start a campaign Leo 755 to stay alive.
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.480]   755 to stay alive.
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:43.480]   I like that, Merlin.
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:44.480]   Bumper sticker.
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:45.480]   I like that.
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:46.480]   That's a key.
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:47.480]   That's a key.
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:49.920]   That sounds like you can make a really good gang signal out of that.
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.720]   You know, you can be at a sign.
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:52.720]   755.
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:53.720]   I'm going to rap songs.
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:54.720]   I'm going to rap songs.
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:55.720]   Stay alive.
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:56.720]   Why don't we do that?
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:57.720]   We could do that.
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:58.720]   Can you get the girls together?
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:12:59.720]   We'll do a 755 to stay alive.
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:00.720]   I'm still alive.
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:02.000]   You know, it would be a public service.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.360]   I'd run it on Twit Live all the time.
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:08.560]   And now a public service message from the 755 to stay alive coalition.
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:09.560]   Remember.
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:11.600]   It would be like we are the world.
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:12.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:19.000]   Can we get a couple of really burnout old rock stars to sing it a special thing for
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000]   us?
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   I'll tell you who we could get.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000]   And he's not burnout.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   We get the Tron guy.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000]   We get the Tron guy.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000]   He's available.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   Roger McWinnad do it.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   He's totally into it.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000]   He's a Unix geek.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   We can get a few people to do that.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   We'll have to write that.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000]   Jonathan Colton to it.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   Jeff Smith, we can get some.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   We can get.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000]   We are 755.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   You should.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:43.000]   When you need direct access, but you don't want to change ownership from the root level.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   I love it.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000]   We can do a jingle too.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.800]   Andy's pick is Boca App B-O-K-E-H-A-P-P dot com.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:59.120]   I'm going to send him $34 just because I feel so bad about saying that.
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:00.120]   It's a couple of guys.
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:01.120]   I got a big hat there, Leo.
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:02.120]   A big hat.
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:04.240]   I got to go over to the bubbler and get a drink.
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:06.960]   Ollie Wagner and Jeff Paddo.
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:07.960]   Thank you so much.
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:09.160]   I'm sorry.
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:10.840]   I slined you.
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:16.920]   I just sometimes you feel like, gosh, that really could be a bash script wrapped in cocoa.
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:17.920]   That's the beauty of them.
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:18.920]   That's my biggest fear in life.
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:19.920]   I get up in the morning.
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:23.240]   Is somebody going to try to sell me a bash script wrapped in cocoa?
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:24.240]   You better not.
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:25.240]   I'll do it.
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:27.680]   I think Merlin Mann's the only one left.
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:28.680]   Yeah.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:31.360]   Well, speaking of, you get what you pay for.
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:34.920]   Mine is-- it's more than usual.
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:36.120]   It's 200 Alexes.
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:38.480]   It's about $14,000 an ounce.
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:41.080]   It's Monocle Pete's fancy yacht wax.
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:42.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:46.720]   The thing is, if you've got a really, really, really nice yacht and you're going to want
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:52.680]   to be inclined to shortchange yourself by buying the less costly waxes, Monocle Pete makes
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:54.440]   a fancy wax.
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:55.440]   It'll blow your doors off.
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:57.280]   Can I come over and take a picture of your yacht, Merlin?
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:59.840]   Yeah, you can actually wax my yacht right now.
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:01.640]   No, I want to take a picture of your yacht.
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:02.640]   Is it Carneuba?
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.200]   Is it-- what is the wax?
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.200]   What is the product?
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:10.720]   No, actually, there's some very exotic animals that we raise, very small kennels.
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:11.720]   I'm not going to lie to you, Leo.
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:12.720]   It's a very cruel product.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:13.720]   And it is the limit.
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:17.400]   It's fun animals even when we know it's safe, just because we like hurting them.
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:22.280]   My pick is-- I'm in the midst of a thing right now where I'm going through this thing
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:25.360]   that a lot of people go through where you struggle with trying to think about where
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:26.360]   stuff goes.
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:31.720]   And my where stuff goes dilemma right now is thinking about how to capture stuff that
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:35.280]   I want to write about, but I don't want to write about right now.
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:38.240]   And so previously, I've used things like Delicious for that.
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:40.320]   A lot of people like things like you Jimbo.
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:44.360]   There are things obviously like Devin thinks and very sophisticated applications.
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:46.560]   Devin thinks, I mean, Devin thinks it's a lifestyle.
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.840]   It's not even an application.
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:51.040]   So anyway, I'm very interested in looking at these.
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:52.400]   And there's one that I've just started looking at.
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:56.200]   I don't know if I'm going to stay with this forever, but it's called WebNote.
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.200]   Happy?
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:58.200]   WebNote.
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:15:59.200]   Happy?
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:00.200]   Are you kidding me?
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:01.200]   I'm serious.
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:02.480]   Happy apps, I think, is the name of the company.
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:04.880]   And they have this funny little way they name things.
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:05.880]   Happy apps.
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:07.680]   That's also my favorite Japanese game show.
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:08.680]   WebNote.
[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:10.720]   It sounds like it.
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:13.480]   And I just think it's kind of cool.
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:15.360]   I noticed it because why.
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:20.160]   I noticed it because it's one of the options if memory serves for sending something to
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:22.320]   Delicious from within Net Newswire.
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:24.280]   And it was the one that I didn't recognize.
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.440]   So I've just been playing with it.
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:28.880]   It's $24.95 for a single user license.
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:33.280]   And it's just kind of a neat app for if you've used things like Coco Delicious, another
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:37.800]   Buzz Anderson joint, you could use it for managing your delicious bookmarks.
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:39.760]   It syncs up and stuff like that.
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:43.560]   A couple of things I like about it is it's pretty, from a service standpoint, it's pretty
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:46.640]   easy to send stuff to this from wherever you are.
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:51.000]   So in that way, it's kind of like notational velocity or your jumbo.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.320]   But I also like that it's got a really nice surfable tag.
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:56.880]   Well, I'll just say it's got good searching.
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:57.880]   I'll say that.
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:01.320]   So you can go in and enter a term and then filter by whether you want that term to be
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:04.960]   shown as just notes, tags, title, URL, or what have you.
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.920]   And it also has smart folders.
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:11.880]   So if you wanted a way to go in and say, OK, show me every-- so very much like iTunes,
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:12.880]   right?
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:16.600]   Go in and say, show me every note I've ever taken, every bookmark I've ever had in Safari.
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:22.400]   It has the following-- that has this term in it that has this string and was from this
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:23.400]   date era.
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:24.400]   So I don't know.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.400]   It's kind of handy.
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:26.400]   I'm just playing with it.
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:27.400]   But it's pretty.
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:28.400]   It's cocoa and it's lovely.
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.400]   And it's called WebNote Happy.
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:31.920]   You can get it at happyapps.com.
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:33.320]   And it's $24.95.
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:40.760]   Well, Merlin, that's very Merlin-like of you to pick that.
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:41.760]   I don't--
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:42.760]   It's happy.
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:43.760]   What does that mean?
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:44.760]   Well, you know, because it's organizational.
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:45.760]   And it's happy.
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:46.760]   Yeah.
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:47.760]   It's happy.
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:48.760]   We like that.
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:50.160]   It's something I struggle with.
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:55.680]   Because I'm looking for something that's somewhere between Mars Edit, a delicious app.
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:56.680]   I want something synced.
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:00.480]   You know, Jimbo is one of the very few notes apps that syncs really well.
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:01.480]   But I still haven't found it.
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:02.480]   You know what?
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:03.480]   I'm going to put it out.
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:04.480]   Ever know, baby.
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:05.480]   Have you--
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:06.480]   I love, ever know.
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:07.480]   I ever know.
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:09.280]   It feels like it might be too much firepower, but I will look at it.
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:11.240]   Oh, didn't I send you an invite?
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.240]   I've used it.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:13.240]   I've used it.
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:17.120]   And it feels like something where once I get into it, it's going to be like something.
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:18.120]   It's the best.
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:19.120]   I'm going to have to read a book.
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:20.120]   And they've added-- they've upgraded.
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:22.760]   They've added encryption, PDF support.
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:25.400]   They're really-- I mean, they're listening to the Mac users.
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:26.400]   All right.
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:27.800]   Eddie will have another look.
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:32.040]   And it syncs-- what's nice is it's not only syncs, you know, to your other computers, but
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:35.760]   it syncs to the web so you can go to the web and anywhere you are on a PC or a Mac and
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:36.760]   see it.
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:37.760]   It seemed pretty magical.
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:38.760]   And just playing with it a little bit.
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:39.760]   I love it.
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:41.760]   It's one of those things a little bit-- I don't mean to sound disparaging, but it's a little
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:45.200]   bit curio where I was kind of like, oh my god, this is the most amazing app that I would
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:46.200]   never use.
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:49.120]   Like, it's got so much stuff in it, but I don't understand how to get semantic data
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:50.120]   out of it.
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:52.160]   I understand that I can make a pretty picture show up here.
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.160]   No, no, no.
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.720]   I mean, I use it just purely for notes.
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:56.840]   I mean, it's-- well, let's put it this way.
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:02.280]   I was on a website last night, 10 Japanese customs you must know before a trip to Japan.
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:04.240]   And I said, boy, I really want to remember that.
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:07.000]   And I thought I could bookmark it on a delicious-- oh, I've got Evernote.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.600]   And I just press a button and it copies the contents of the page.
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:10.600]   And it's there.
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:11.600]   And it's synced.
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:12.600]   It's already on my PC.
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:13.600]   It's on the web.
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:14.600]   It's always going to be there.
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:15.840]   Bookmark for it.
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:19.320]   It gives you a bookmark, but it also takes the contents and puts it in there, including
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:20.320]   all the images.
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:21.320]   All right.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:22.320]   I really like it.
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.000]   I just give it a chance, Merlin.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000]   Please.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000]   Phil, Phil, I will.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.240]   It's got an elephant on the icon.
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:29.120]   Just remember, we're cutting my sin.
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:30.120]   What cutting my sin?
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:31.960]   And they said there's something else you're supposed to say a lot.
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:32.960]   It just means I don't understand.
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:34.120]   You say that all the time.
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:35.760]   Well, they know that you don't understand.
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:36.760]   I'll touch my mustache.
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:39.280]   That's all I know.
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:44.120]   You're supposed to say when they offer you something somewhere here, when they offer you
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:48.360]   food, you're supposed to say something, you will receive a small wet cloth.
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:50.840]   I know that's something else.
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:52.040]   Here it is.
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:53.640]   How do you say that?
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:54.640]   Tada.
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:55.640]   Where are you looking at?
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:56.640]   Itada kimasu.
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:00.280]   Itada kimasu, which means I will receive.
[01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:03.720]   He says, just before digging in, whether it be a seven course dinner or a sample at a
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:05.400]   supermarket, it's polite to say it.
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.400]   Tada kimasu.
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:07.400]   See, I didn't know that.
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:09.400]   But now I know that I'm going to fit right in.
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:10.400]   Look good.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:11.400]   Business cards.
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:12.400]   I heard you got to be really careful with business cards.
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:13.400]   Yeah, you kind of present them.
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:14.920]   The whole ceremony you got to do.
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:15.920]   Two hands.
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:17.680]   You got to look at the one they give you really carefully.
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:18.680]   Yeah.
[01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:19.680]   Somebody gives you their business card.
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:21.160]   You can't do it on the front or anything, right?
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:22.160]   You got to be careful.
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:23.160]   Humacloud would have such a problem.
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:26.120]   And you have to learn how to say moshi moshi if you're going to pick up the phone.
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:27.120]   And not hello.
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:28.120]   Moshi moshi.
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:30.360]   Hey, I've got some really good news.
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:34.600]   Remember we were talking about Drobo and how crazy we were about Drobo and all that stuff?
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:36.720]   Did that spur some sort of activity on Drobo's part?
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:37.720]   Did.
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:38.720]   They're sponsoring the show.
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:39.720]   Oh, what equipted it?
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:42.280]   And they've done something that they've never done before.
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:50.040]   They're offering the first time ever a $50 off discount at the time of purchase.
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:52.080]   And it's to Macbreak audience members only.
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.080]   It's a Macbreak only offer.
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:55.080]   Right.
[01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:57.240]   What about a super discount for hosts?
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:00.400]   You'll have to take that up with that.
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:01.400]   Listen to me sucking up.
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:02.400]   You are.
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:03.400]   That's hilarious.
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:04.400]   I never do this.
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.080]   We talked about the Drobo on a show for quite a while.
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:08.080]   I mean, who has a Drobo?
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:09.080]   I have a Drobo.
[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:10.080]   I have a Drobo.
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:11.080]   We are.
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:12.080]   I have two Drobo's.
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:13.080]   Has access to a Drobo at work.
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:14.080]   I have access to a Drobo.
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:17.080]   Wouldn't you like to have a Drobo too?
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:19.920]   Maybe we better explain what Drobo is.
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:23.120]   I mean, it is a very, very cool technology.
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:24.520]   It's basically a drive enclosure.
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:26.920]   You could put any drive in there you've got lying around.
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:31.600]   If it's a SATA drive and unlike RAID 5, it'll add the total amount up.
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:33.880]   You get every byte you put in there.
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:35.840]   It gives you data redundancy.
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:40.080]   So if any drive, it has a nice little, it's Windows and Mac, which is really nicely on
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:41.080]   the Mac.
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.680]   It's a nice little application that will sit on the Mac and say, "You're running low."
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:47.800]   So when I run low, I buy a new larger drive because drives are getting bigger and cheaper
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:48.800]   all the time.
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:52.360]   And all you have to do is you pull out the old drive, the smallest drive you put in there's
[01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:53.360]   a little one.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:54.840]   There's a little light that's blinking to tell you which drive you're going to want.
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:55.840]   It tells you which one.
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:56.840]   It's got a little orange light.
[01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:59.200]   The instructions can sit out while I was copying.
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:01.520]   I was copying some other files and I said, "You're getting low."
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:02.680]   And I pulled it out.
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:03.680]   I threw another one in.
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:04.840]   I was like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."
[01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:09.840]   The instructions sets five lines printed on the inside of the faceplate of the device.
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:10.840]   That's it.
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:11.840]   Yeah, that's all you need.
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:14.640]   It's got a nice, I really like the magnetic faceplate.
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:15.640]   So it's very easy.
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:16.640]   You just pull it off.
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:17.640]   It's very droovy.
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:18.740]   It's droovy, is right.
[01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:20.240]   And then you pop out the drives.
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:24.640]   Look, if you're looking for a lot of USB storage, now they have Drobo share, so you also have
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.040]   the capability to put this on the network.
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:29.480]   But if you're looking for a lot of storage, if you're looking for flexibility, if you're
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:33.720]   looking, most importantly, for reliability and data redundancy.
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:35.360]   So you never at risk of loss.
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:36.840]   You want to look at a Drobo.
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:37.840]   A Drobo Drobo?
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:38.840]   A Drobo Drobo.
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:39.840]   They do.
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:41.840]   They call it the storage robot.
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:42.840]   Yeah.
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:44.800]   So go to Drobo.com/Macbreak.
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:45.800]   There's more video.
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:48.440]   In fact, Callie Lewis has a little video on there of how the Drobo.
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:50.200]   And you're going to see some more videos.
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:51.200]   Are you doing some?
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.200]   We're doing some videos.
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:53.200]   You like Drobo that much?
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.200]   Yeah.
[01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:55.200]   Well, they're panning.
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:56.200]   Oh, okay.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:58.680]   This is the first time we've ever done that.
[01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:01.160]   $50 off, first time they've ever done that.
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:02.840]   Now, that's my phone going.
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:04.560]   That's probably the Drobo people saying.
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:07.720]   Leo, you know, it's a mail-in rebate on the site.
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:11.600]   But we're going to offer you that rebate instantly when you check out.
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:14.920]   You type in the word Macbreak or you go to the page, I guess.
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:19.120]   Go to Drobo.com/DROBO.com/don't go at once.
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.120]   Yeah.
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:21.120]   Okay, go ahead.
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:22.120]   Go all at once.
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:23.120]   Break their site.
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:25.000]   Just want to say my aperture vault.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.040]   This is my retirement.
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:32.320]   The 450,000 photographs that I planned to sell when I can no longer move out of my wheelchair
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.320]   are sitting on my Drobo.
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:35.200]   I can't trust it anymore than that.
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:36.200]   It's great.
[01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:37.200]   Love my Drobo.
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:39.120]   That's where my 401K is.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:47.520]   DROBO.com/MacBreak and don't forget to take that $50 discount only available for Macbreak
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:48.520]   listeners.
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:49.520]   Don't tell anybody.
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:52.760]   The other thing that we've looked at is the first Drobo I kind of just threw in whatever
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:54.640]   drives I have and you can definitely do that.
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:57.800]   And after a while, you just realize, you know what I'm going to do is I'm just going to buy
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:59.200]   four, one terabyte drives.
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.200]   Yeah.
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:02.000]   Because I just want to have a whole bunch of storage.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.520]   The great thing is you're not sitting there worried about whether the drives are 100%
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:07.520]   reliable or whatever.
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:08.520]   Does it matter?
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:12.200]   You're like, if one goes bad, I'll place it.
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:13.200]   Yeah.
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:19.880]   So it's really, and it's not that you couldn't, I mean, our RAID 5s on our X-rays do something
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:23.720]   that's similar to this, but it just doesn't require any setup.
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:24.720]   It doesn't require any thought.
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:25.720]   This is a better RAID 5.
[01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:27.560]   You don't want to learn about drive theory.
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:28.560]   Yeah.
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:30.120]   So you're going to use it.
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:31.400]   Just plug it in and just make it work.
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:32.400]   That's going to be their new motto.
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:35.240]   So we just got born to news.
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:36.920]   They say up to 16 terabytes.
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:37.920]   We haven't got to four terabytes.
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:42.320]   That's because a lot of the manufacturers are promising four terabyte drives very soon.
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:43.480]   Oh, man.
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:46.320]   That's the beauty of something like this is you kind of expand on it.
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.320]   It's a game with you.
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:48.320]   DRO.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:51.440]   Living in a world in which we talk about a limit of 16 terabytes.
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:54.680]   No, it's amazing, isn't it?
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:58.520]   Oh, one weekend in Las Vegas with Scott's new camera.
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:24:59.520]   Oh, man.
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:01.160]   Hey, I didn't do my pick yet.
[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:02.720]   By the way, we thank Drobo.
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:04.880]   We really appreciate the support.
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:08.840]   And this was one where we had done, we talked about it for about 10 minutes on one show.
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:10.040]   And then they decided to sponsor.
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.040]   So I have an idea.
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:14.800]   Can we talk about Learjet Corporation for a minute?
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:17.920]   Here they have Max.
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:20.560]   I tell you, I only take sponsors.
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:24.320]   I'm sincere about this that we can say all of us confidently.
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:25.320]   This is great stuff.
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:26.320]   And so that's why when you hear something.
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:27.320]   We turn down stuff.
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:28.880]   Oh, I've turned down.
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:31.760]   I'll tell you off the air what I turned down the other day.
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:32.760]   Oh, I told you already.
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:33.760]   It was a big buck offer.
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:38.480]   And I just said, I can't get behind that because we believe in our audience.
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:39.480]   We want to protect them.
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:42.440]   We don't want to say anything we don't love.
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:43.440]   So my pick is something.
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:45.800]   I do love Learjet.
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:46.800]   Just to be just a matter.
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:47.800]   No one is in any doubt.
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:49.600]   You sure you don't want to G3 or--
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:51.760]   Assessment citation is another possibility.
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:52.760]   Okay.
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:53.760]   There are other--
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:56.080]   There are enormous wheelbarrows full of quarters.
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:00.520]   They really brighten up that corner of my office.
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:04.760]   So I don't know where I saw this.
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:08.880]   I don't know if one of you told me about it or if I saw it on Twitter or something.
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:11.640]   But I saw this ATV product.
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:13.560]   It's a USB drive.
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:20.920]   It's only 256 megabyte drive that you plug into your Apple TV in the back.
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:22.800]   And you reboot the Apple TV.
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:24.040]   Actually, here's the steps.
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:25.040]   I'll tell you the full steps.
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:26.040]   It's by the way, 60 bucks.
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:30.160]   Now, if you're a hacker, Leon, you could probably get all the software together.
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:32.240]   It's all open source available software.
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:34.520]   Put it on a USB drive and do this yourself.
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:37.120]   But I'll tell you, this is an example of how much is my time was worth.
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:41.560]   I was willing to pay 60 bucks for this because I wanted to hack my Apple TV.
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:43.240]   In fact, I tried to.
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:44.480]   And the thing is so tight turned up.
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:45.480]   Wow, that turned up.
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:47.200]   It didn't turn out well because it's so tightly done.
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:49.800]   It was overheating after I put it back together again.
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:54.880]   The tolerances on the heat, especially in the Apple TV, are really razors then.
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:56.680]   So I wasn't going to open another Apple TV.
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:57.840]   I said, I'm not going to do this again.
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:00.760]   I'm not going to hack it until I could do it without opening it.
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:01.760]   So here's what happens.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:04.640]   I think this is a really interesting product.
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:05.640]   You get this USB key.
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:09.680]   Now, I should warn you, the first thing you have to do, and I think this is prudent, is
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:11.960]   restore your Apple TV to its factory stay.
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.800]   So all of your stuff is going to get erased.
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:16.080]   If you've got stuff on there, you might want to back it up or whatever.
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:17.560]   It's all going to get erased.
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:21.440]   I didn't bother me because I'd synced it to the iTunes anyway, so it's okay.
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:22.600]   Then you put the key in.
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:25.200]   Oh, actually, you erase it, then you update the latest version.
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:28.560]   It works with the current most recent version of Apple TV.
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:31.600]   Then you unplug the Apple TV, put the key in, plug it in.
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:33.960]   It boots from the USB drive.
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:38.520]   And the USB drive is running a small Linux distribution, runs the scripts, installs a
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:40.120]   bunch of software.
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:42.720]   You then turn the machine off, unplug the drive, plug it back in.
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:43.920]   It boots normally.
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:45.920]   It changes the Apple TV menus.
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:47.960]   Now all of a sudden you've got a bunch of stuff on here.
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:49.360]   You've got Sapphire.
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:50.480]   You've got Jommen movies.
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:52.800]   You've got MediaCloud, Catch Surfer.
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:56.640]   Needo TV is a whole bunch of stuff that's been out there for a while.
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:58.680]   All that you've got Perian on there.
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:00.360]   You could download the M-Player codecs.
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:02.360]   First thing I did, so it plays Divx.
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:05.440]   XVIT, AVI, every file you could think of.
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:07.640]   Suddenly, you now don't have to sync stuff.
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:13.120]   You can use FTP or SSH to get into your Apple TV over the network and just copy files
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:14.360]   into the movies folder.
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:18.680]   It shows up and you could play it back with any of these players, but get this.
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:22.600]   There's a menu you can turn on that says Order Pizza.
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:26.960]   And you can order Papa John's or Domino's Pizza from your Apple TV.
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:29.360]   And they deliver it.
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:33.600]   This does pretty much everything required to ensure you're untimely dead.
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:37.960]   I'm never going to leave the house again.
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:40.760]   There is in fact Couch Surfer, which is Safari.
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:42.440]   So you can even surf with Safari.
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:48.480]   There are menu items that have like peapod.com, send over adult diapers so you never have
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:49.480]   to do that.
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:51.240]   They only have Papa John's and Domino's.
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:55.760]   But if they could do that, I don't see why they couldn't have peapod on there.
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:58.200]   Actually, you could do your own diapers and you're good to go.
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:28:59.200]   Johnman's kind of interesting.
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:01.160]   Johnman is a movie site.
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:04.680]   It's a legitimate movie site, J-A-M-A-N.com.
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:05.680]   Very Mac focused.
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:07.240]   In fact, they only have a Mac player at this point.
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:08.440]   They don't have a Windows player.
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:09.520]   The movies are weird.
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:11.000]   There's Bollywood stuff.
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.880]   There's a lot of indie stuff.
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:15.520]   It's not major Hollywood stuff, but it's interesting stuff.
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:17.360]   It's very inexpensive to rent.
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:19.160]   A high def.
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:20.680]   So that player syncs up with me.
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:25.160]   Last time I watched a Bollywood movie, it made me feel like I really wish I used drugs.
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:26.160]   Yeah, because it would be great.
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:27.160]   Yeah, because it would be high.
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:28.160]   Yeah.
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:29.160]   It would have been great.
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:31.120]   I feel high when I'm watching it.
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:34.920]   I showed it to my wife and said, "Look, honey, now the Apple TV will be even more difficult
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:35.920]   for you to figure out."
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:40.720]   Instead of just saying movies, TV shows and podcasts, it now says Sapphire.
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:43.360]   This isn't going to do anything bad to my Apple TV.
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:44.600]   They say it doesn't void the warranty.
[01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:45.600]   It's true.
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:46.600]   You don't open it up.
[01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:49.160]   If you ever decide you don't want to use this anymore, you just restore your back to
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:51.160]   the way you were before.
[01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:54.320]   As far as I can tell, it is- And you order this off a website.
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:56.720]   Yeah, it's called ATV.
[01:29:56.720 --> 01:30:01.480]   It's 60 bucks, which is not bad.
[01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:04.400]   You get it from, I think it's Apple Core LLC.
[01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:06.640]   Let me find- Free shipping.
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:07.640]   Yeah.
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:08.880]   That got it right away.
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:10.680]   I ordered it a few days ago.
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:12.960]   I've been thinking about hacking it for a long time.
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:15.960]   I'm never going to get it around to doing this.
[01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:20.040]   I've got to say, Leo, that's the sweet spot.
[01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:24.320]   It's like there's- If you think about that, what's that book where they talk about early
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:25.840]   adopters and crossing the chasm?
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:26.840]   Is that what it's called?
[01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:27.840]   Yeah.
[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:30.360]   It's like I'm not even exactly near the middle.
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:33.560]   I'm just to the right of the middle where as Janine Garoflis says, "I want someone to
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:35.280]   start my orange for me."
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:37.480]   Feel me a great bula.
[01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:40.440]   Really interested in this stuff, but I'm really into eunuch scripts.
[01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:42.520]   I really wish somebody else would run them for me.
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:44.480]   It's kind of, well, I did it.
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:45.720]   I got SSH working.
[01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:46.720]   I imaged my drive.
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:50.200]   I did the whole thing, and then I put it back together again, and it was too hot.
[01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:53.920]   I said, "I'm not going to hope this thing is Apple doesn't care if you hack it.
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:56.040]   Play's DVD files without converting them."
[01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:57.040]   Oh, yeah, that's another thing.
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:58.040]   You can rip DVDs.
[01:30:58.040 --> 01:30:59.040]   It'll play the VOB files.
[01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:00.040]   It'll be V-s.
[01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:02.040]   We verify if it does MKVs.
[01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:05.720]   I think it does MKVs.
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:06.720]   Let me see.
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:07.720]   Yes, it does.
[01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:09.280]   It does AVI, FLV, which is Flash.
[01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:10.280]   It does MKVs.
[01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:19.360]   MPEG-4, Divx, Thrivx, H.264, FLV-1, FSB-1, VP6, H.263, I mean, I go on.
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:21.200]   I mean, it's suffering from acronym Overload.
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:22.200]   Well, these are all the codecs.
[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:23.200]   It does FRAPS.
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:24.200]   Sure.
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:26.360]   But I mean, these are really those mean things to lots of us.
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:28.000]   I mean, MKV is pretty sweet.
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000]   Like--
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.000]   Well, if you download--
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.800]   Alex, why is Alex not doing this?
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:33.360]   Alex, have you tried this?
[01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:34.360]   I have not tried it.
[01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:35.360]   I'm going to try it.
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:37.000]   We have an Apple TV here.
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000]   I'm going to get one.
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000]   I had already ordered it.
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.920]   I ordered 160 gig drive Apple TV.
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:44.160]   So I have a lot of space on it.
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:45.640]   Now, I would love it if this--
[01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:46.640]   I don't have to do something like that.
[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:48.400]   I stopped using the Apple TV.
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:49.720]   It's just kind of sitting there.
[01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:51.880]   Well, notice I'm using the Mini over here as my media center.
[01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:52.880]   And that's--
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:58.800]   In fact, next week, I'm going to talk about the ITVH 250 HD, which is incredible.
[01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:00.360]   That's what I'm using on the Apple TV here.
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:01.880]   But this is rather the Mini here.
[01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:04.080]   But this is at home.
[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:05.920]   And I like the Apple TV.
[01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:09.360]   I don't necessarily want to have all the complexity of a Mac Mini.
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:12.520]   I think the Apple TV-- Leo, I think for people like you and me, the Apple TV,
[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:15.160]   I have this weird feeling is going to be my newton.
[01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:16.800]   Like long after people have moved on it--
[01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:17.800]   I still love it.
[01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:19.480]   I'm going to be that guy who's like, you know what?
[01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:21.720]   Actually, I still really like the Apple TV.
[01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:24.760]   Because it really-- there's a couple things that don't even get me started.
[01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:25.840]   Don't give me a couple drinks.
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:28.600]   Get me talking about transcoding and the ass.
[01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:32.600]   But with this stick that I just bought on your recommendation,
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:34.400]   this is pretty close to what I need.
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:36.000]   You no longer use visual hub.
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:41.080]   You know, I spent a lot of time downloading and re-encoding for the iTunes.
[01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:42.240]   You don't need it anymore.
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:46.040]   Last week, I went to dinner and spent literally an hour talking to five people
[01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:51.480]   about the optimal automator style workflow getting up from the cloud onto an Apple TV.
[01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:51.920]   No more.
[01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:53.680]   You don't have to do it.
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:59.480]   The S-FTP that it uses is SSH1, a little technical note here, which means,
[01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:02.440]   as far as I could tell, transmit doesn't allow you to force SSH1.
[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:04.760]   So I downloaded Fugu, which does.
[01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:08.280]   And you use Fugu as kind of a dedicated FTP client.
[01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:12.960]   You could easily automate this so that when you do a folder action,
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:15.800]   when there's something new in this folder, FTP over to the Apple TV.
[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:18.200]   You know what Fugu means in Mongolian?
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:18.720]   No.
[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:19.480]   You better be careful.
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:20.520]   It's blowfish.
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:22.280]   It's a deadly blowfish.
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:24.960]   And I hope that's what it means in Mongolian too.
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:25.360]   I don't know.
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:26.720]   Get up.
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:29.280]   The Mongolian Americans listening to this show might be great.
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:30.280]   Are you kidding me?
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:30.720]   Yeah.
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:31.920]   No.
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:35.200]   He's very credible when he's sitting across from eating eating your chocolate.
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:39.520]   I love that it lets you view local weather forecasts until never be going outside ever
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:42.280]   again because you're going to get peace to deliver to your house and watching it.
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:43.440]   It's going to go out too high.
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:44.440]   It's too cold.
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:45.440]   Yes.
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:47.600]   I can't say this is why I buy all weather sitting pants.
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:52.280]   Don't spend a lot of money on a seasonal pant that you're going to have to change.
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:57.440]   I think the icon for this solution should be an empty snapple bottle.
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:59.400]   It practically is.
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:01.200]   It's Applecore LLC.
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:05.160]   That's the company that makes it Applecore LLC.com.
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:09.320]   They recently dropped the price from $70 to $60, which I think was a smart move because
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:12.040]   it somehow that triggered it.
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:13.040]   It's like going, yeah.
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:14.840]   It's right at that point where I'm willing to pay for it.
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:16.000]   Well, again, because nothing--
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.000]   Nothing on a bash script.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000]   It just can't be a bash script.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.240]   There's stuff you're starting really like to me would have just bought the company.
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:21.240]   You know what?
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:22.240]   This is a bash script.
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:23.240]   I have bad news for you.
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:28.880]   You're being $60 a bash script, but moments ago you wouldn't pay $17 for a bash script.
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:31.760]   What seems to me Leo is the typical guy that marketers reach.
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:32.760]   It's $17.
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:33.920]   He's not a buyer, but at $60.
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:36.560]   No, this is a really complicated bash script.
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:38.280]   I've tried this before.
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:39.520]   All of these programs are available.
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:42.080]   You could easily cobble this together.
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:43.080]   You've tried this, Leo.
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:44.080]   No.
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:47.560]   It's a lot of work and finding all the documentation.
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:51.680]   What you're really paying for is somebody who spends a lot of time automating the process.
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:54.400]   I think that to me is well worth it.
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:57.440]   And funny thing is, you only use it once.
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:58.840]   You don't know what you're doing with Unix.
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:00.880]   I mean, it's like juggling knives.
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:05.440]   I've got all kinds of no-clobber stuff in my profile to keep me from doing dumbass stuff.
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:08.800]   You start fiddling around with Unix and you don't know what you're doing and you're going
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:09.800]   to have really--
[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:12.720]   Hey, I know what I'm doing and I still don't want to mess with this stuff.
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:13.720]   I know what I'm doing, too.
[01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:15.720]   I'm staying away from Unix.
[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:17.520]   No, Unix is great.
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:18.520]   I love it.
[01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:19.520]   In fact, I love doing this.
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:23.720]   If I had about a week with nothing else to do, I would do this.
[01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:26.520]   $60 to me is a worthwhile price to save a week.
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:28.080]   It's saying that about learning VI.
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:30.760]   I keep saying I'm going to shut everything off and I'm not going to use anything with
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:32.000]   VI from now on.
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000]   Quarterly.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000]   It's like in sync with my creative job.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000]   Why?
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000]   Why?
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.000]   Because you can do it via--
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.000]   I love VI.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000]   It's VI.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.160]   If you watch somebody use VI, it's like a magic trick.
[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:43.160]   Yeah.
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:44.160]   Unbelievable what you can do with VI.
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:47.200]   Don't you think, though, if you're going to spend that time, you should learn Emacs?
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:49.560]   Emacs and Lisp.
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:50.560]   Let's do it right.
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:51.560]   You're going to do it, do it right.
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:52.560]   Small talk.
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:53.560]   Actually, I've written--
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:55.040]   Small talk, not good enough for you, huh?
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:58.960]   You know who we had on and you should listen to this on Floss Weekly this week?
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:04.040]   Dan Ingalls, the guy who co-wrote Small Talk with Alan Kay and then later created Squeak
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:08.640]   when he was at Apple and an amazing fella.
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:13.000]   If you haven't listened to Floss Weekly this week, Dan Ingalls is a must listen to.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:20.200]   He's the guy who with Larry Tesla, she demoed Small Talk for Steve Jobs when they went to
[01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:21.200]   Xerox Park.
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:22.200]   He was at Xerox Park at the time.
[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:26.200]   Larry Tesla did the demo that Steve Jobs, the light bulb went on and said, "We should
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:28.160]   do something like this."
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:33.080]   So this guy is-- if you're a Mac fan, listen to Dan Ingalls talk because it's fascinating
[01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:34.080]   stuff.
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:35.520]   Little geeky, you've got to be in a small talk.
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:36.960]   Anyway, that's my pick.
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:42.480]   The Apple TV-- or A TV, I guess, the Apple TV hack version 2.2 works with the current version
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:43.480]   of Apple TV.
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:45.640]   I don't know what will happen if an update comes along.
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:47.000]   Oh, I forgot to say.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.640]   You get one-- for 60 bucks, you also get one year of upgrades.
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:54.640]   So should something come along with Apple TV in the next year, presumably they'll make
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:57.440]   the patch and I can get an upgrade for it.
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:00.560]   Okay, kids, are you all done?
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:01.560]   Good show.
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:03.560]   Anything to say?
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:06.120]   We've got classes here.
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:08.000]   That's all I have to say.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.200]   Pixelcode.com, we could find out about there.
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:11.200]   You can find them there.
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:15.520]   We're doing green screen classes, podcasting classes, visual effects classes.
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:18.200]   And we've got, I think, five seats left.
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:20.800]   So come have fun.
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:21.800]   That's about it.
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:23.800]   P-I-X-E-L-C-O-R-P-S dot--
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:25.300]   S, S.
[01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:26.300]   Corpse.
[01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:27.300]   It's not core.
[01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:28.300]   It's not-- it's not core.
[01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:30.600]   It's not like stealing Stephen Colbert.
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:32.080]   No, it's core.
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:34.680]   It's core, like Marine Corps, Peace Corps, or--
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:36.600]   Like it's the real spelling.
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:37.600]   Exactly.
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:41.320]   And if you're bored out of your mind and got $15, which is $2 less than the program
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:47.320]   Leo Won't Buy, come Saturday to Mac Day LA, you can go to the Googles to find out what
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:48.320]   that's about.
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:51.720]   It's so the best segue you have ever done.
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:54.080]   Mac Day LA, it's 9 to 9.
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:56.320]   This coming Saturday, I am one of many speakers.
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:57.320]   Leon is also speaking.
[01:37:57.320 --> 01:37:58.320]   There's a lot of stuff.
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:37:59.320]   I spoke of the first one.
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:00.320]   Did you know that?
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:01.320]   I did not.
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:02.320]   via iChat.
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:03.320]   Yeah.
[01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:04.320]   Well, I'm going to be there in person.
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:06.600]   So if you want to stand by and say hi, and if you'd like to have your photograph made
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:08.720]   with a 21.1 megapixel image maker--
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:09.720]   Ooh, you're going to be in the camera?
[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:10.720]   I'm going to bring the camera.
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:11.720]   Hand-clicker.
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:14.000]   And I'm also bringing my Bring Security team.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.960]   Do a click real quick just so we can hear it.
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:17.600]   I have to turn it on.
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:18.600]   Takes a while for the--
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:19.600]   Takes a while to boot up.
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:21.680]   It tubes to warm up.
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:25.880]   And you've got that really nice 1735.
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:26.880]   It 2.8 on that.
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:27.880]   Is that the 1735?
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:28.880]   1740 L.
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:29.880]   Ooh.
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:30.880]   Oh.
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:35.320]   I'll do the damage you did sitting next to him with my little G9 that doesn't register
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:36.320]   a noise.
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:37.320]   I like the G9.
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:38.320]   She's been taking pictures all along.
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:40.520]   Are you driving down or are you flying down?
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:41.880]   We're going to drive.
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:43.680]   You want to go?
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:44.680]   It's curious.
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:45.680]   Scott's going to go.
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:46.680]   There you go.
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:47.680]   Mac Day LA.
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:48.680]   I got room in the bins.
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:49.920]   Anybody wants to come with us?
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:50.920]   Really?
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:51.920]   Yeah, just come on.
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:52.920]   And I sit in the way back?
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:54.560]   You can sit in the way back with Leanna.
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:55.560]   It's up to your other.
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:57.400]   Ooh, party in the bins.
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:00.200]   I should say it's up to her and your wife.
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:02.120]   Oh, that little thing.
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:05.400]   General admission $20 that is coming up this Sunday, right?
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:06.400]   Saturday.
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:07.400]   Saturday.
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:08.400]   Okay, this Saturday.
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:09.400]   All day Saturday.
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:10.400]   Get out there.
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:11.400]   Mac Day.
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:12.400]   If you register now, it's 15.
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:13.400]   Deal.
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:14.400]   If you do it online today, it's 15.
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:16.120]   If you do it at the door, it's 20.
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:17.120]   Okay.
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:18.120]   I mean, it's crazy cheap.
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:19.280]   I think she charges too little.
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:23.320]   And by the way, I'm bringing like a thousand dollars where the door prizes can give away.
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:24.320]   You could win.
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:25.320]   Big.
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:26.320]   A lot of fun.
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:27.320]   Yes.
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:32.800]   Mr. Andy Inacco is the man who creates the celestial waste of bandwidth website, cwob.com.
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:35.800]   That's what it was.
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:39.120]   Yes, we were a little bit lofty, but we're still down to earth.
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:43.320]   We keep reaching for the stars, but our feet are firmly planted.
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:44.800]   And you could still visit the old site.
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:46.400]   I like that on the front page.
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:47.400]   Visit the old site.
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:48.400]   Oh, God.
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:51.800]   For God's sake, I was blogging there under my own steam for 15 years.
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:53.680]   I think I'm just going to like remove that directory.
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:55.840]   They weren't even blogs 15 years ago.
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:57.240]   We didn't have a word for it.
[01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:03.680]   We had a build-emforation TML with a toothpick by moving electrons into data registry.
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:05.920]   Three guys with gopher were reading your blog.
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:07.880]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:09.120]   Is that just your M.L.?
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:11.400]   And I couldn't even get it onto a computer.
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:12.400]   No.
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:16.040]   It was JTML when I was using it.
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:17.040]   What's that?
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:18.040]   Jurassic.
[01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:20.680]   I protect smart, up language.
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:25.680]   My original word processor had an eraser on the end of it.
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:26.680]   Merlin.
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:28.040]   I remember that electric pencil.
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:30.480]   Merlin, man, as you look nice today.com.
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:33.680]   Nice, nice today at .com.
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:37.880]   Right now, a lot of our effort is going toward raising attention about sex, menelia
[01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:42.920]   disease, and this is as many as one to five people a year are diagnosed with sex, menelia
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:43.920]   disease.
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:47.680]   And so you can learn more about that at sexmeneliafoundation.org.
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:53.400]   And if you want to follow us in the dream for the cream, please do what you can to get
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:54.400]   out there.
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:58.360]   What are the symptoms of sex, menelia disease?
[01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:00.600]   Unfortunately, there's really only one symptom.
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:02.320]   And by the time you have it, it's way too late.
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:06.080]   And that is, if you try, if you sound like Oliver Sacks impersonating Lads and Menelia,
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:08.080]   you probably already have signs.
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:13.240]   And for our resources, but right now, we're working to develop a cream that'll help people
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:14.320]   with this.
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:18.680]   And you know, I promised myself I wasn't going to cry, but once you've seen a thrown
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:21.640]   man with a beard, trying to impersonate Lads and Menelia, you know what?
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:22.640]   I can't do this.
[01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:25.160]   Is there video anywhere?
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:26.160]   We could see this?
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:27.360]   Now, there's no video site.
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.840]   There's a lot of videos out there now, people doing the fish stick, which is our new dance
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:30.840]   group.
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:32.200]   Yeah, I want to talk about the fish stick to you.
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:33.200]   Yeah.
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:38.200]   You can learn all about this.
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:43.920]   The fish dip is a very subtle dance craze that's going around right now.
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:44.920]   It's very strong.
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:46.920]   Did you create this dance?
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:50.600]   You know, in concert with Lonely Sandwich in Scott Simpson, we suggested that for the
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:52.640]   U of I say, call it the fun.
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:53.640]   And for it?
[01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:54.640]   I said, "fun bunch."
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:55.640]   There should be a dance.
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:42:00.880]   And so the fun, the fish stick is our attempt for dance.
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:03.280]   It looks like it can be popular in the Mosh pits.
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:04.280]   And you're right around.
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:05.280]   And you're baked.
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:06.280]   It doesn't sound like our fish.
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:10.280]   No, this is Steven Jensen Pons fish stick.
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:11.280]   Merlin?
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:12.280]   Yes.
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:14.640]   You're a very bad person and you need to be punished.
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:16.480]   Oh, from the last episode?
[01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:18.280]   I'm just saying.
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:23.360]   From the first eight minutes of the last episode, that was a tough one to be listening to in
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:24.880]   the front seat of a mid-priced car.
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:27.240]   I'm just going to say that from personal experience.
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:28.720]   Did you get it all?
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:34.400]   Okay, here ladies and gentlemen, a little demo of doing the fish stick in instructional
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:35.920]   video.
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:39.840]   Is this Scott or is this Lonely Sandwich doing this?
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:40.840]   That's tight enough.
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:41.840]   I actually bell him the drill.
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:42.840]   I do recognize that.
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:43.840]   Oh, good.
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:45.840]   He's doing that right now.
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:47.840]   He's doing the facial cake-alls, right?
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:50.040]   Yeah, it may not seem like he's moving much.
[01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:51.880]   That's because a lot of the fish stick goes on in your head.
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:52.880]   We don't know the thing.
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:53.880]   Are we dancing?
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:54.880]   We're going to do one.
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:58.320]   There's a lot of showy dance crazes that involve a lot of...
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:42:59.320]   This is not one of them.
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:00.320]   It's tight enough.
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:03.320]   This is the music we're tied up with.
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:04.320]   Uh-huh.
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:07.320]   Does it get more exciting later?
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:11.600]   You know, Leo, it's not for everybody.
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:15.520]   Maybe you want to do some kind of fancy chicken noodle dance or something, but...
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:16.520]   The finny stick.
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:17.760]   I'm not here to pimp the show.
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:19.480]   I'm here to talk about Saksmanelli.
[01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:24.080]   Are we going to have a Labor Day telethon maybe for Saksmanelli?
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:27.920]   You know, if it will help, I will get up there and I will get up there with Tuxedo
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:29.840]   and the giving and the love and the thing.
[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:32.320]   And I would just be up there with 20 pounds.
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:37.160]   Let's do a telethon right here on this stage for Saksmanelli.
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:38.160]   I think that's a great idea.
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:39.160]   I still under construction.
[01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:40.160]   Can we get a sec?
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:41.160]   Later.
[01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:42.160]   Not right now.
[01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:43.160]   You've got to go to the bathroom.
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:44.160]   I understand.
[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:45.920]   He's doing the potty jig.
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:48.480]   We better get going here.
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:49.880]   Youlooknicetoday.com.
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:54.000]   Just go there and learn all about the tragedy of the Saksmanelli disease.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.200]   There is a Saksmanelli Foundation.org site.
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:44:02.600]   Yeah, that's where a lot of the resources are going.
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:06.200]   Leanna Lehua, you can find her at girlsgongeek.tv.
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:07.200]   Yes.
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:13.520]   Any admission to get into the bins to go down to LA, by the way, I've decided to chart admission.
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:19.320]   So you can come as a chocolate and I've decided that the V.I. talk was really kind of sexy.
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:20.320]   That's how geeky I am.
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:21.320]   You want to talk about V.I.?
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:22.320]   You got to talk sexy to me.
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:23.320]   You got to talk to V.I.
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:25.840]   So we'll spend four or five hours learning V.I. and eating chocolate.
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:28.240]   It's going to be great in the back of Scott's car.
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:30.720]   That's date over.
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:32.380]   That's girlsgongeek.tv.
[01:44:32.380 --> 01:44:36.880]   Scott Bourne is of course the Apple phone show at applephoneshow.com.
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:39.480]   And then every Friday with Alex over at this weekend photography.
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:40.480]   I'm glad that's true.
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:41.480]   You have the photo.
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:42.480]   That's so great.
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:43.480]   Yeah, let's not forget that.
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:44.480]   We got a Q&A question.
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:45.480]   Q&A this week.
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:46.480]   So we have answering listener questions the whole show.
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:47.480]   Oh, I really like that.
[01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:49.400]   Because they build up and we can't get to them.
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:50.400]   Yeah.
[01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:51.400]   I know that feeling.
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:52.400]   Itch and itch.
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:53.400]   Itch.
[01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:54.400]   You can't get to them.
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:57.200]   Who have I not plugged yet?
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:58.200]   Anybody?
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:44:59.200]   No, I think we plugged everybody.
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:02.000]   We've got to plug something here.
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.000]   I don't know.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.480]   What about Twit Live?
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:05.480]   Yeah, Twit Live.
[01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:06.480]   Twit Live.
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:07.480]   You can watch the video of it.
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:10.160]   You watch Scott's back right now because he won't look at the camera.
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:13.640]   I'm a radio guy for a reason.
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:17.160]   But a couple of thousand people were watching the show today and we thank them.
[01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:21.840]   And of course if you want to watch us produce the shows live you can do that by going to
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:27.240]   twitlive.tv or twitlive.com and we're doing about 25 hours of programming a day, a lot
[01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:28.240]   of stuff.
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:30.960]   And the new widescreen I think really looks extra special.
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:34.600]   And it's only a twit that you can get 25 hours in a day.
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:36.240]   I want to see the numbers on that.
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:37.240]   Yeah.
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:38.240]   I think he meant 25 hours a week.
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:39.240]   Yeah.
[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:40.240]   It feels like a day.
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:41.240]   I understand that.
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:43.440]   Well, yesterday I came in at 10.
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:44.840]   We started we have a new podcast.
[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:45.840]   Ros Rose the Pacific.
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:46.840]   I know I heard it.
[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:48.840]   The solo rowing across the Pacific Ocean.
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:52.960]   I talked to her via a sat phone at 10 AM and I shut the thing down about 7 AM.
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:53.960]   7 PM.
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:55.120]   So that's nine hours.
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:58.000]   So we're I don't know why can't stop.
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.520]   Anyway, that's a lot of fun.
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:00.560]   I thank you all for being here.
[01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:01.560]   We'll see you next week.
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:03.120]   Another Mac break is broke.
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:05.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:07.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:09.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:11.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
