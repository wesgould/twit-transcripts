[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that covers all things Mac and Tosh,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   all things Apple, the iPod, and all of that stuff.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Alex Lindsey is in studio with us from the Pixel Core.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Hello Alex.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Good to see you.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   It was good to see you virtually last week.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   That was fun.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Oh yeah, that's right.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   For the event, we did our live coverage of the event.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   You were at the Pixel Core in your dark room.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   In the dark room.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   I like the dark room.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Andy was great because Andy was in Boston.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Was it Boston Commons Park?
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   What was it called?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   The Public Guard.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   The Public Guard, which is adjacent to Boston Common.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Oh, that's how you spot a foreigner.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   It's foreigners will say Boston Commons.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   It's actually the Boston.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Common.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Common.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   The bonus question is, if you're in the place with the Swan boats,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   are you in Boston Common?
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   No!
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   We're in the Public Guard.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Okay.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   So he was in the place with the Swan boats.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I've been there.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Good to have you back.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   And I don't know where, actually, I do know come to think of it, where this cat was.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Mr. Will Harris was in a brewery somewhere in England.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Ah, for change.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Will was at the Apple satellite event.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Was that in London?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Yeah, in the centre of London.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   So they do a satellite so that all the English journalists can get together and watch the
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Apple event as it happens.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   The most pointless thing is when some of the slightly dumber journalists all try to
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   claw at the same time, not realising the satellite link is only one way.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Was there standing O for the jobs when he came on screen?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   There wasn't.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   There was some hefty clapping.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   There was some hefty clapping.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   That was pointless because Steve had no idea.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Well, exactly.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Well, it's good to have you.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Will is, of course, from Channel Flip.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   He's a regular on This Week in Tech and has been on Mac Break Weekly sometimes because
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   he's a Mac fanboy, self-described.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   And you can find him on Twitter with 1L, twitter.com/will1LHarris.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   So in the aftermath, first of all, did anybody buy a new iPod this week?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   I did.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   You did?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Which one did you get?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I bought the Nano.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   You got to test it.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I had to do my duty for the show.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   And?
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   It's pretty cool.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Do you have it with you?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I don't have it with me.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I realised over the weekend that I do left duty that I didn't do it very well.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   But I took it out shooting.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   You failed.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I left it at the office because we were going to test it against the flip and the iPhone.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   And we didn't quite finish that test on Friday and so I didn't get it done.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   So anyway, but I did shoot some video.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   It's on YouTube.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.800]   And my initial reaction was, and I have to test it like, you know, I was going to say
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.720]   apples to apples to apples, but they really would be apples to apples if I tested it against
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.880]   the iPhone.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.360]   It felt like what we call the rolling shutter of the little CMOS chip was really rolling.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.160]   I mean, it was a problem that even like the Canon 5D Mark II has where if you move the
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.000]   camera while you're shooting.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.800]   Yeah, it's more so, it would seem more so in the Nano where it was what we call kind
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.800]   of Jello video where now what I'll say when you're not walking.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.800]   It's great.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.880]   So we did a bunch of stuff where we kind of walked through the office and we did and we
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.120]   kind of zoomed around and moved, you know, moved our hands through it and then it looked
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.680]   great.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.560]   But when you're walking that high frequency jiggle is what really causes this crazy Jello
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:40.320]   video that's that as that was a little disconcerting at first.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.080]   What I will say is that it handles the low light better than I expected.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.080]   The positioning of the camera is going to be a problem for everyone.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.640]   Almost every video that I saw on YouTube had the same problem minded, which is you can
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.800]   see my finger, the inside of my finger because of where it's at.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.600]   And when you hold up the Nano to do it, it's very hard to hold it without putting your
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.280]   finger in front of the camera.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.160]   So that that's going to be kind of until we will get kind of a good style or some kind
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.520]   of handle for it.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.480]   It's going to be a little bit of a challenge.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.760]   I thought the FM worked great and but I didn't use it very much.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.440]   I turned it on and said, yeah, it works.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.000]   I don't really listen to FM radio that much.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.560]   So the, well, I don't think we can even get FM radio here.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.880]   Yeah, I have no idea.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.640]   I was down in San Francisco and in '93.973.3 came in great.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.640]   So Alice.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.640]   Yeah.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.960]   So anyway, so I think that, you know, I think it's going to be great.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.560]   I think that it is a, I don't think, I think there's a lot of advantages because we're doing
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.560]   some work with a flip.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.920]   We're doing a project on a flip right now.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.760]   And so we were playing with it.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.760]   I think that there is, I think they really are throwing the gauntlet down in some ways
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.240]   because it's just as easy to use as the flip.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.240]   Right.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.400]   And you have FM radio and music and being able to watch shows and everything else that you
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.080]   can't do, you know, on a flip.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.280]   You can't load, I mean, this is the one that you can't load video onto the flip, you know,
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.920]   which is, you only take it.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.920]   Right.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.280]   Andy, I presume you also have one of those.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.200]   Yeah, I, you see, unfortunately, ask the question, did I buy one and no idea?
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.200]   No, I know you didn't.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.200]   You got to review you.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.200]   And I'm sure.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.200]   I got to review you in it.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.360]   When you consider that they kept the price of the Nano the same and now there is a video
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.360]   camera in it.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.360]   It's a very good free video camera.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.280]   I think that if you set your expectations at the level of this is a fun video camera
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.080]   that again got thrown into the Nano, I think you'll be very satisfied with it.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:35.520]   I wasn't as, I sort of have a split opposition with Alex.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.680]   The first thing I shot was a little trip to my friendly neighborhood comic store and
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.600]   I uploaded that to Vimeo and to my blog like Friday night.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.280]   And I thought it was moving pictures.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.680]   I didn't think it was all that bad.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.960]   It wasn't worse than what I would expect from a cheap little handheld, a hundred fifty dollar
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.120]   video camera.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.760]   I thought it was actually thought it came out very, very well, especially considering when
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.120]   you take a look at, you know, what's the size of the aperture through which this lens
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.120]   is shooting.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.160]   And we just realized that this is a thin video camera.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.720]   How good could this possibly be?
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.760]   You're going to be very, very pleasantly surprised.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.760]   Low light.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.920]   I thought it was just terrible though.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.920]   There were in exactly.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.920]   It was dark.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.320]   I was about to say, yes, here we are.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.520]   It's like, I've seen that.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.160]   I'm seeing Andy's video and I am seeing that rolling or at least some tearing as I moved
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.160]   it around.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.160]   Exactly.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.160]   But I mean, it's certainly not bad.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.160]   I mean, this looks pretty darn good.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.960]   See, and you'll see some panning around.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.040]   You also see which we get inside the shop when you see all kinds of comics, all kinds
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.560]   of statues, all kinds of magnets, all kinds of detail.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.520]   And that's really what impressed me when looking at the footage when I dumped it into
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.520]   the iMovie.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.480]   And actually, even better, you don't even need to sync this up as a regular camera.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:54.000]   You put the nano into target disk mode and then you just simply have a quick time file
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.960]   that you can then simply copy wherever you want to go.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.360]   As a matter of fact, I edited this using just QuickTime10.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.360]   That was it.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.360]   I just trimmed the star clip at the end.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.360]   That was it.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.760]   What do people think when you're holding up an iPod?
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.320]   Do they even believe you're taking video?
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.680]   This guy seems like he's a little non-plus by the whole thing.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:17.720]   Well, Steve is used to my coming in with video cameras and other things I need to test out.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.640]   The outer limits on wall fan on Moody Street, ask for all your bad land geeky needs, is
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:29.160]   my standard test bed for a lot of different video and photo projects because, again, it's
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.400]   a target-rich environment, lots of colors, lots of detail.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.400]   So I was actually not looking for...
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.320]   I actually thought it would be a lot worse than this.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:43.080]   When there is a certain appreciable amount of light, it does very, very well.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.120]   The outer limit, one of the reasons why I love it is that it sort of bucks the stereotype
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.600]   of the cave-like Simpson-style comic bookshop.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.440]   It is very, very well lit.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:57.840]   But I shot some quick video just to send this video to a friend about an hour after I got
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.840]   it.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.840]   It was inside...
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.720]   Not inside my office here, but imagine what the lighting is like in here.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.600]   There's a window here.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.400]   There's a light here.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.320]   There's a room that has poorer light, or lighting than this.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.320]   It's not enough light that you could really comfortably read in, but enough light that
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.400]   you could walk around in easily without bumping around.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:22.400]   And so I just walked from my driveway, holding up the camera, facing myself, and then walked
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.880]   into this room and just went completely black.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.440]   The occasional flashes of something that was not black, and I was very, very surprised
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.440]   by that.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.200]   Again, I admit that it was a very dark room, but this is a room in which a flipped video
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:40.480]   camera, even the $150 one, it knows that it's a video camera and it knows that, okay, screw
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:45.600]   it, let's just put more and more juice into the video sensor and just up the gain.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.000]   The grain will go way, way up, but at least we'll have a visible image.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.520]   I'm kind of wondering how well this will work in a party environment, in a bar environment
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.920]   where the lighting is just not going to be good to begin with.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.280]   So bright sunlight, as always, it's a champ.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.120]   Decent room lighting, again, it works just fine.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:06.040]   Non-optimal lighting, boy, you're going to be taking your chances with it.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.880]   That's pretty much the case, though, with any of these little cameras, right?
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.160]   I guess when I said it was better than I expected, I think that they actually meant I think
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.400]   that they all pretty much look like crap under, well, you're so serious.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.120]   I think different people have different standards.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.000]   I think the people like us are going to compare it to the flip phone.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.440]   I think a lot of consumers aren't even going to compare it to the flip phone.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.520]   They're just going to look standalone and say, "Hey, it looks good.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.520]   I'll take it."
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:34.640]   Again, I think Apple made the right choice by claiming they've made no bones about the
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.720]   fact that this is designed to be a fun camera as opposed to a...
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:44.440]   This is not going to be something you'll be mounting in the car at NASCAR to have the
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.360]   OmniMax presentation of Dale Earnhardt's Jr. Big Cup Challenge or whatever.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.120]   It's a fun camera for people who are just playing around.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.680]   Again, if you have a skateboard and you're not wearing a cup, this is a good camera in
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.640]   which to do that wonderful assaults upon the handrail at your public park.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.880]   Otherwise, just don't expect that much out of it.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.760]   It's free, as you said.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.680]   I think this is an attractive value proposition for consumers.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.560]   We're just going to get it and they're stocking.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:20.200]   I don't think anybody would think of replacing a camcorder with it, but I don't think people
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.920]   are buying camcorders much anymore.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:26.680]   I think really people are either getting still cameras with video or they're using flips
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.680]   or something like that.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.160]   I mean, my kids certainly don't care about camcorders.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.120]   Again, it's a good free camera.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:37.920]   One simple feature that I wish Apple had added to iTunes, every time I get a new iPod,
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.320]   I just do the same thing that I always do, which is click the button, says, "Please fill
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.320]   this up with music."
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.840]   Or after about a week or two, I'll build a couple of playlists that says, "Well, I
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.040]   got 16 gigs worth of space.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.040]   Great, let's fill it up.
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.040]   Let's not waste any space."
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.560]   And of course, it didn't occur to me until after I started playing with the Nano that,
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.560]   "Oh, wait a minute.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.000]   This is going to be creating video files at 15 megabytes per minute."
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.600]   When I took into the comic shop, I realized that, "Oh, I only have two minutes for the
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.120]   video left because I filled the thing up pretty much to the capacity."
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:08.800]   I really wish that there was a feature in iTunes that says, "Please preserve at least
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.040]   X minutes worth of space on this device for video."
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.440]   How many megabytes a minute?
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.840]   I believe it comes down to about 15 gig, excuse me, 15 megabytes per minute.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.840]   Okay.
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.840]   Not a whole lot.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.840]   No, but that could use up your space.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.840]   But I think...
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.720]   Yeah, well, I guess not so much that so much as, again, by default, you're like, "Why am
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.120]   I carrying around an iPod that has half of its capacity?"
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.120]   Right.
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.320]   I have so much music and video that I could be thinking to it.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.760]   So, again, without thinking, it was my fault.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.280]   That seems like a really good feature to have an extra tab in the video tab or something
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.360]   that says, "Please preserve two gigabytes just for video space just to make sure I don't
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.360]   run out of space."
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.640]   Well, Harris, have you had a chance to see the new Nana at all?
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.200]   Yeah, so I had a play with one.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.680]   And I thought, in terms of the video stuff, it's never going to set the world on fire.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:00.160]   But I think the reason that I thought it was really quite nifty is just that it's just
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.240]   a bonus.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:07.480]   It's a... you've got the iPod, you've got all the music and all the functionality that
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.640]   you want.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:13.920]   And hey, if you happen to need to take a video at some point, you can now do that too.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.400]   I don't think anybody's ever going to look at this as a video camera.
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:22.400]   It's just a really nice little additional win when you get it, as you say, and you're
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.400]   stalking.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.560]   I mean, it seems like you're almost getting to a point where you can't buy something electronic
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.360]   that doesn't have a camera in it.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.360]   Right.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.360]   I'm just seeing the touch.
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.520]   Okay, let's talk about the touch.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.720]   Not that I'm bitter.
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.720]   Hold on.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.800]   Let's talk about the touch.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.800]   The touch does not have a camera.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.120]   Nor does it classic, nor does it shuffle.
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.880]   We should point out that it's not the whole line.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.680]   The only one that has a camera is the iPod.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.680]   Now, the shuffle would be absurd.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.680]   Obviously, the shuffle would be odd.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.680]   The shuffle would be absurd.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.680]   You'd have seen something that direction.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:55.320]   Especially since you could wear the shuffle as a tie-tack, and people would think, "Oh,
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.520]   it's just fresh and jewelry."
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.920]   I'm certain that it's not going to be recording our conversation as I explain what I promise
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.760]   to do with this car if I sell it to this person.
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.760]   Right.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.040]   I'm going to point it out that in the state of Massachusetts, Andy, it appears to be illegal
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.040]   to carry a device that you can record conversations with.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:13.440]   It's certainly illegal to record the conversation without warning the other party, but even having
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.440]   the device seems to be illegal.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.560]   First of all, sir, we are not a state.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:18.560]   We are a commonwealth.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.080]   Commonwealth, pardon me.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.680]   Second, I believe Massachusetts does have what's called the two-party rule that says
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.280]   that both parties involved in a conversation have to be informed that there is a recording
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.760]   device in operation.
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.480]   I saw a blog post from somebody who was...
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:40.520]   There was some Bruhaha, somebody recorded an auto repair company they thought was being...
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:46.520]   Yeah, you often hear it coming up when usually when situations like that where Channel 5
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:51.160]   found out that someone was ripping off little old ladies and they put a kid hammer in and
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.400]   they managed to get the footage blocked from broadcast because, "Oh, well, you didn't tell
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.400]   us you had a hidden camera."
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.400]   Which is fine.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.520]   I don't have a problem with that, but this...
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:03.520]   But the criminal charges against this guy were not merely recording the conversation, but
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.800]   having possession of a device that could do that, which would now pretty much include
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.800]   everything he...
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.800]   Yeah, everything he...
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.800]   A limous recorder with it.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.800]   I'd have to check on that.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.800]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.800]   That's news to me.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.800]   I do know they have the two-party rule.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.800]   I'd be very...
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.080]   It would be news to me if it's unlawful to have possession of a device and you're not informing
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.080]   someone.
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.080]   I mean, how do you...
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.680]   Well, I do that all the time.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.880]   I use my live scribe a lot, you know, the little one that records.
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:25.880]   You're recording everything.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.320]   But I just go, "Hey, I'm gonna make sure I don't forget anything and I'm just gonna
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.320]   watch this.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.320]   This is really cool."
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.320]   And then we record everything and then we go back to...
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.720]   Make sure you record their permission to record.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.720]   Well, I hit it and then I tell them and then I...
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:38.720]   And then I...
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.720]   Is it okay with you if I record everything?
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.720]   So...
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.720]   Go ahead.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.760]   Oh, no, no, I was just gonna say, see, now if you were less than morally upright, Alex,
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.440]   what you would do is that you would keep like the live scribe, let the pen in your pocket
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.400]   and recording, you would produce like an iPhone thing.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:57.560]   Is it okay if I record this and then visibly turn on the record button and then turn off
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.560]   the...
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.560]   Visibly turn off the record button.
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:05.160]   Because they didn't ask what device is it upon which you're recording our conversation.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.160]   Why?
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.880]   And then say, "No, if I record this..."
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.280]   And it's a little magician type sleight of hand.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.560]   Is it okay if I record this, you know?
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.560]   Right.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.720]   I'd like to record this, but secretly you're really recording it on that.
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:17.720]   That's good to know.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.720]   I'm gonna use that, Andy.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.720]   You're obviously a crook.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.720]   It could be cool.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.720]   [laughter]
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.320]   Daniel in the chat room has a really good point, which is that in this era of modern technology,
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.400]   does recording mean the same as live streaming?
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.600]   It's getting there.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.640]   Yeah, 'cause I could live stream.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.640]   You could get around the world.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.640]   Is that recording?
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.640]   Oh, that's interesting, Andy.
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:42.000]   Well, would you check with the Commonwealth authorities and get back to us?
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   What if I live stream...
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.600]   Get the land of the quad.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.640]   As always, champions of liberty.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.600]   Homajaw Adams, template for every Constitution, not only for the United States of America,
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.320]   but for the entire world.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.160]   I'm certain that we allow personal liberty in all places.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.600]   And the maker of a fine beer.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.200]   Oh, no, that's his brother Samuel.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.200]   So the touch...
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.200]   So the touch...
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.200]   So the touch...
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:06.000]   Talking about the touch, 'cause, you know, after the event, the New York Times got an interview
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.680]   with Steve Jobs, and Steve said, "Oh, no, no, no.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:13.760]   We never intended to put a camera in the touch because our goal is to make the touch
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.200]   the ultimate gaming machine, and we want to keep the price point low.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:22.000]   So in order to keep that $199 price point, we just said no camera."
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   'Cause there's a couple of problems with this.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.800]   'Cause they have a 64 gig, which is $500, $400.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.800]   So they could...
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.160]   And they have $149 of device with a camera.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.040]   So the camera can't be that expensive.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.040]   It's like a...
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.600]   Yeah, it's like a dollar.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.280]   And we saw then the...
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.800]   You remember the famous picture of the...
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.800]   Before the event of the internals of a...
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.960]   I love the space.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.440]   I love the touch.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.200]   With a camera in it.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.320]   And no one knew it was Photoshop or not, but you could see the guts and the internals.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:58.120]   If you compare that to the iFixit picture of the actual iPod touch as shipped, it's
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.800]   exactly the same internals.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:04.040]   Not an iPhone, it's a unique, sui-generous, this is it.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:08.120]   And there's a hole, there's a space right where the camera would be.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:12.840]   And that's exactly where all these leaked cases had openings.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.000]   So put all of that together, it really does seem pretty clear that Apple intended to make
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   an iPod.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.240]   Now Apple now releases it, of course, they will react to our complaints.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.240]   We heard you.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.040]   Oh, Steve's never had a problem with that.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.040]   We heard you.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.040]   No, Steve does that all the time.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:31.120]   He said, "Oh, no one will ever watch video on a portable device that's small."
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.680]   No one would ever want to read a book on a device.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.360]   I mean, he does that all the time.
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.360]   Right.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:42.080]   So I just think it's insane not to have it because it's really how long before you think
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.080]   they release it?
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.080]   January.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.080]   I bet, I bet October.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.080]   So why January?
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.080]   I think by January.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.240]   That's why do we think they couldn't do it then?
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.240]   I mean, what was the rumor?
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.080]   The rumor was that the technology, they had chip issues.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.560]   But it wouldn't be the same chip as was in the nano or the same chip as was in the
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.160]   I think so, wouldn't you?
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.160]   You think so?
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:06.360]   Oh, maybe they would be saying we want something better than 640 by 480 or maybe we want something
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.360]   that might not be the same chip.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:12.800]   But we aren't saying the iPhone video chip can do better than 640 by 480 though, allegedly.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.280]   And furthermore, you would be in 7.25, right?
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.480]   Yeah, you would like to have stills.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.840]   You'd like it to have the same, wouldn't you want it to have the same capability as
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:20.840]   the iPhone?
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.680]   I mean, ultimately, are you going to make, don't you want to make the touch the everything
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.840]   but the phone, right?
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.000]   Isn't that the goal?
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.840]   I think it'd be a great goal to have.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.480]   Especially at that price.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.760]   Well, the thing is, I think one of the problems is especially as we get into the augmented
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.320]   reality and we get into a lot of the other things, I think you're going to, you get
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:40.400]   into this weird situation on the app store where there's a bunch of, there's a lot of
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:45.240]   great applications that can work on only, you're going to start segmenting the app store
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.200]   where it doesn't work on this phone.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.680]   Touch is working on that for, you know, and that's going to make it confusing.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:55.840]   This is going to be an even huger issue when you get the, you know, the higher end iPod
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:59.480]   touch, the higher end new iPod touch has different internal hardware.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.480]   Right.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.880]   The lower end one, the higher end one, it's got all the kind of open GL integration and
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:08.360]   things, so you're going to end up with games that will work on the high end new iPod touch,
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:12.680]   but not the old or the new low end iPod touch.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:17.760]   It's just, it ends up with these huge spec lists on these games as to what models specifically
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:21.320]   gen year revision iPods it will work on.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.920]   It's going to get really complicated.
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:23.920]   I didn't know this.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.760]   So is the 199, does it not have open GL to?
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:28.760]   Yes.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:34.560]   The 199 is basically the old, the cut or the old touch, but with the higher storage or
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:40.320]   the big or the lower price, the new one has got all the fancy faster processor, the better
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.920]   graphics capability, et cetera.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:46.480]   So that could have, you know, Steve, you could have made the old one not have a camera.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.320]   It's hit that 199 price point.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:53.960]   Of course, that does cause the problems you guys are talking about with too many SKUs,
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.800]   but if he, but if the price point was important, you could still have done that and still put
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.800]   a camera in the 399 one.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:20:59.800]   In the high one.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:07.520]   Well, it's also, it's also possible that they're girding for future battle because the, the
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:13.600]   iPod touch is probably the most vulnerable item inside Apple's iPod line or in their,
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.200]   their consumer line.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.520]   There are a lot of different devices coming up starting today and going through the holiday
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:24.100]   season that that the, the, the touches really going to have to compete against.
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:29.980]   Next week, I got a briefing on a device that cleared embargo just like less than an hour
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:30.980]   ago.
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:31.980]   So I can talk about it.
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:32.980]   Oh, good.
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:33.980]   Finally.
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.820]   A company called Arcos has a, is coming up with a new line of internet tablets.
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:40.300]   They have one called the Arcos five.
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:45.960]   Imagine an iPod touch running the, running the Android operating system, a screen that
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.100]   is about the size of a three by five card.
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:53.100]   So it's still very pocketable without being like ridiculously big tablet size.
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:58.000]   But imagine that it has every single limitation that we have to suffer from by it being an
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.980]   Apple product has been lifted.
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:05.380]   So it has Bluetooth, it has a USB mass storage.
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:08.120]   It has a built in HDMI port.
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.620]   So if I want to watch video on the train on the way home and then simply plug it into
[00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:14.760]   my TV and watch video from there, I can do that too.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.340]   It has built in GPS.
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:17.340]   It doesn't.
[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:22.220]   It, I have to, right, right now I'm double checking on the, the official, the official
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:27.820]   specs because sometimes I had an engineering sample to play with last week.
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:33.260]   And sometimes when they give you the run through, they're a little bit hazy on the details.
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:40.780]   I was told and wrote down, but told myself to follow up on that it's the Bluetooth will
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.620]   support an external keyboard.
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.740]   It has a USB port built into it.
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:49.820]   So you can attach a mass storage device to the device and all as well as plug in an external
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.300]   keyboard to it.
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.500]   It will have its own special app store.
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:58.980]   It will, it won't run like a Google G1 phone apps, but it is again, regular Android operating
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:22:59.980]   system.
[00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:03.300]   So you start off with every feature and every advantage of the Android operating system,
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:06.420]   then you add on to it the ability to write more applications.
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:10.780]   So it does, it's certainly not going to have the same cool range of apps that are available
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:12.380]   for the iPod touch.
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:16.740]   But again, as I'm, as I'm getting my thoughts together, walking, walking back to the train
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.020]   after this demo, I'm thinking, do I really need 10,000 apps?
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:24.700]   Or would I just like to have a word processor that I can touch type on?
[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.340]   And what way of getting those files on and off that device?
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:30.780]   Yes, this doesn't have 3G built in, but that's okay because I have the MyFi.
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.900]   So that clears away the internet everywhere problem.
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.500]   Do I just want to have a couple of different media browsers?
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:37.500]   Yes, I do.
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.020]   Do I need to necessarily have iTunes sync?
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.020]   No, I don't.
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:43.140]   I just need to have the ability to copy files easily on and off.
[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:47.580]   And I have that ability because again, it docks as a mass storage device on and on and
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.580]   on and on.
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:54.260]   So I was, I was a truly, yeah, see, it has, I'm sorry, I'm reading the specs.
[00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.180]   It does have USB 2.0 host.
[00:23:56.180 --> 00:24:00.140]   So again, I can very easily attach like a card reader to it.
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:03.220]   I can attach a one terabyte hard drive to it if I want to.
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:09.140]   I can simply travel with this and a pocket drive that has 160 gigabytes, 250, 300, 500
[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:14.660]   gigabytes of my media files on it, just simply copy files on and off of it as I want.
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:18.260]   And again, there is the idea of when I got as soon as I got home, I was Googling for
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:23.980]   like foldable USB keyboards, foldable Bluetooth keyboards, because you know what?
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.660]   There's a reason why I carry a netbook with me oftentimes when I know I'm going to be out
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:32.140]   of the office for a couple of hours, is because I know I don't have any real work planned,
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:36.660]   but I do want to have the ability to quickly get a column out if I decide that if I get
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.700]   a piece of news, I want to react to it quickly.
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:41.660]   Or if an editor gets in touch with me and says, hey, we need you to make a quick fix
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.300]   to fix to this.
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:48.260]   If this thing in my pocket plus like a little folding keyboard, that would be even better
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:50.180]   than having a netbook with me.
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:54.340]   It's basically what it comes down to is I was right there holding this thing in my hand
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.860]   and imagining me holding like my iPod touch or my iPhone.
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.580]   On the other hand, thinking, I've got two or 300 bucks.
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:04.020]   I want to buy I can buy one of these two things.
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:07.140]   Would I necessarily go for an iPod touch?
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.020]   I don't know if I necessarily would go for it.
[00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:12.260]   It depends on what kind of software becomes available for this in two or three months
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.260]   of time.
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:17.700]   That's the first time that I really thought Apple could be in trouble here because again,
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:18.900]   this is Android.
[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:22.300]   So it would presumably run many Android apps, right?
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:26.060]   Well, Android is just a core operating system.
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:27.060]   It won't run.
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:31.900]   You can't simply go to the Google phone store, for instance, and download apps from there.
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:36.980]   But they have I was promised that they have 300 to 400 apps already set to go.
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:40.700]   Not 300 developers who have promised to start a store look into it, but I'm saying that
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.220]   they're telling me, again, this is one of the things that I'm saying.
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:45.340]   Some of those questions were what's the price on this?
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:46.580]   I have to double check.
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:50.820]   It is within line for what the price of the iPod touches.
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.140]   It's not like a $500 thing.
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.140]   It's a free one.
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:58.860]   800 by 480 screen, it's running an ARM Cortex, a eight processor, which is a very fast processor.
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.340]   That's I think the same processor in the Zoom HD as I remember.
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:03.820]   I may be wrong on that.
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:09.340]   I said her megahertz processor, 128 megs of RAM and hard drive 60 to 250 gigs.
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:10.340]   This is very interesting.
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:11.340]   Isn't it?
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:15.140]   It has a hard drive based version and also a flash based version.
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:18.940]   So obviously, and like I said, it has a built in HDMI port.
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.420]   So it will work with external.
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.420]   It will work just fine with external video.
[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:27.900]   So in a sense, this could be the I'm just if I know that the if I let's say I have a
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:32.020]   overnight business trip and the hotel and checking into, I know that it has a flat screen
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:36.900]   TV in every room with H and I can get access to the HD HDMI port.
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:39.100]   Maybe I would leave everything at behind at home.
[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:43.420]   I would just simply take this in my pocket, get a portable keyboard, put that in my pocket,
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:47.740]   use that as a big screen monitor to do a full evening's worth of work and then just simply
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:51.620]   upload my stuff back into the cloud or simply save it onto a hard drive or a flash drive
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:54.020]   that can then use with my MacBook.
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:59.180]   It's a very, very intriguing device, not because it's such an incredibly slick thing, but because
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:03.860]   it gives you all the power that I wish I had with the iPod touch and very, very, very
[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:04.860]   nice touch.
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:09.660]   The simplest, stupidest thing, the back of it actually has a little kickstand so that
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.780]   you can actually watch movies and not have to prop it up against something.
[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:18.580]   It is a said that thing, but man, there's always all saying about if you want to find
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:21.780]   out if a restaurant is any good, your first stop should be in the bathroom because of
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.300]   the bathroom is clean and tidy.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:27.100]   You know that they understand what's important about designing, running a restaurant.
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.180]   And I think that on a device like this, the fact that they thought, no, we have to have
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:34.500]   a little kickstand in the back so people can watch, watch TV, watch shows, watch programming
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.180]   on it while they're eating and while they're off-light.
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:41.380]   That means that, oh, that gives me a lot of good, good feelings about what they did with
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.380]   this.
[00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:43.380]   Yeah.
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:44.380]   So the RCOs.
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:45.380]   The GPS.
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:46.380]   They've been around for a while.
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.860]   In fact, we gave RCOs a best of CES about seven years ago or eight years ago.
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.260]   The RCOs 5 is what, $2.99 for $2.99.
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:54.180]   Oh, that's very interesting.
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:55.180]   $2.50.
[00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.180]   $2.50.
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:00.420]   And I think though, the point really of this isn't that this is the competitor is that
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.580]   there are going to be lots of competitors in this space.
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.780]   This is going to be a very crowded space.
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:05.780]   Yeah.
[00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:12.260]   Also, you realize the trouble that the Android operating system represents to Apple, not
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:15.980]   simply the fact that there's a Google phone, that there's a phone that might compete with
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:16.980]   the iPhone.
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:23.820]   I'm saying that Google is the demon who spawns other demons with which to torment Apple and
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:24.820]   infest the world with.
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:25.820]   Not just Apple.
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:26.820]   They're like yourself too, we might point out.
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:30.780]   Not just everybody, but Apple is going to feel the pinch even bigger.
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:34.900]   Any company that wants to create a really cool tablet or a really cool phone, they don't
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:38.300]   have to go out and license out a really big new operating system.
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.740]   They don't have to build a brand new operating system.
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.140]   And they also don't have to convince developers.
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.660]   Here is a brand new concept we've come up with.
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:49.660]   Please, please, please invest your time in learning this, this software, these, these
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:53.660]   software APIs, even though if this thing fails, you'll never go ahead with it.
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.660]   Yeah, again, yeah, there'll be other.
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:29:01.140]   A slight tangent, but it really feels like Android is becoming the kind of default mobile
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.940]   operating system for everything that is in Apple.
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.540]   And that's going to be huge.
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:06.540]   Yeah.
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.540]   Not Microsoft.
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:08.540]   Let me correct myself.
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:13.980]   The Cortex AA is in the 3GS, but it's the A11, the ARM 11 that's in the HD.
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:19.100]   So, but it is, it is the pre and the 3GS are using the same processor as the Sarcos.
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:20.100]   Yeah.
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:25.060]   I believe Toshiba has a new tablet.
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:26.060]   They made the UMPC.
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.060]   Right.
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.980]   There's new, there, well, there's a bunch of people that are making these.
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.940]   And so these, these, a lot of Dell tablets.
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:31.940]   They're going to do it.
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:32.940]   A lot of companies.
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:33.940]   Yeah.
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:38.300]   A lot of companies that are at the 7 inch multi this, it's the Journey Touch Multimedia
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.340]   tablet by Toshiba.
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:45.580]   And I saw this and you know, again, it's, it's in that same vein where there, you know,
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:46.900]   a lot of people are coming into it.
[00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:50.900]   But I think that this is pretty typical of Apple to they're not trying to be the first
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:51.900]   one out.
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:52.900]   They're always trying to figure out.
[00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:53.900]   Just the best.
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:54.900]   Yeah.
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:59.900]   Well, and the thing is, is I spent an afternoon in a, in a phone store looking at other phones,
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.660]   you know, just as a, you know, cause I was, we were talking about, you know, talking about
[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.340]   it and looking at like, is there anything close?
[00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:08.900]   And the problem is, and I, I can say this on this show, is that the problem with all
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.900]   these other phones is they're designed by people who use PCs.
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:11.900]   Right.
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.300]   You know, the thing is that the, the interface is so, well, you'll, the archives will feel
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:16.300]   the same way.
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.940]   Upside down, inside out, you know, you're just like, what are they thinking?
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:23.220]   You know, you're just, you know, and that's the, and, and it's just, that's the primary
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:27.980]   problem with all of these is they, it's kind of, they just don't have any, there's no ease,
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:32.820]   real ease of use style that goes into the interface and that's going to kill them every
[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:33.820]   single time.
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:34.900]   I mean, that's why they can't compete.
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:40.900]   And let's face it, the, you know, Android is designed in house by Google, which is renowned
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.500]   for having apps to grab the interfaces.
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:44.500]   Yeah.
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:45.500]   Yeah.
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:46.500]   That's the people that work at Google about.
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:51.940]   I mean, I mean, you know, it's my, my wife always said, you're not going to read the, the
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:53.860]   shampoo reviews and consumer reports are you.
[00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:56.300]   That's a bunch of engineers who use soap to watch their hair.
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:31:00.100]   You know, there's just, it's, there's certain standards that are, you know, that, that are
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.100]   different.
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.300]   And that's what they lie.
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:06.460]   And I think that that's why the iPod rolled over everyone because it had a great interface,
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:07.460]   a simple interface.
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:08.460]   Now it's easy to get to everything.
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:12.060]   I'm going to raise it even bigger than the point before we move off this.
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:17.140]   I, I use this thing for about a half an hour and the interface again, it certainly wasn't
[00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:21.740]   more elegant than the iPod or the iPhones, but it was good enough.
[00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:22.740]   Okay.
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:28.660]   And Apple can get steamrolled by the rest of the market by, by going after perfection,
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:31.540]   when 95% of the market just wants good enough.
[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:34.900]   They want the features they want, but they want a price they want and they want it to
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.260]   be useful enough.
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:38.580]   But the problem is that's what that, that was the argument.
[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.100]   That was the argument with the iPod.
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:43.500]   That was the argument with the iPhone that was always like people just went good enough.
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:47.460]   And now you walk around in San Francisco and everyone in their brother has an iPhone and
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:51.780]   you know, the iPod, which was much more expensive than its competitors when it came out, crushed
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:55.780]   them because it was a, it was a better interface, you know, and the thing, you know, that's
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.020]   the issue.
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:58.780]   The iPod wasn't just about the iPod.
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:03.700]   It was about the iPod and the iTunes store, the only digital music marketplace that would
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.180]   work with this player and vice versa.
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:10.140]   The iPhone, well, it's had a lot of success, but it hasn't crushed BlackBerry.
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.980]   It hasn't crushed all of their opposition.
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:16.980]   And they've done a very good job of it and they've carved out a very, very good market
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:17.980]   for themselves.
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:18.980]   Can I take it?
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:21.780]   But it's not that they've heard themselves and realize that this is the first, this is
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:27.620]   the first type of device that has been made to compete with something like the touch.
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:31.540]   It was something that really hit home with me just last week because I'm, again, I've
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:37.740]   deepened thought after, after playing with this device that Apple, it happened with the
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:42.020]   Macintosh that they had a perfect, elegant, wonderful, useful solution.
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.980]   And then it took a few years for everybody to figure out, okay, well, here's how do we
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:49.020]   get the really good key features out of this and make it in a solution that is, once again,
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:53.300]   good enough that will be cheap, effective, and will serve the needs of most people.
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.260]   And then Apple got hammered from it.
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.380]   Can I take a day out?
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:00.700]   They also, they also lost Steve Jobs, but this, I mean, this is a, there's a real potential
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.180]   here for Apple to start to lose the card here.
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:07.980]   Can I take a step back though and ask a question and you guys can shout me down if you want?
[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:11.420]   I still don't know if the tablet is going to take the world by storm.
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:13.380]   I don't know if this is a form factor the world wants.
[00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:15.260]   I know you, you, you want it, Alex.
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:18.540]   I think I'm not convinced that I've seen these devices before.
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:22.580]   Archos has been making, you know, this kind of product for a long time.
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:23.940]   Well, I don't think it's never taken on.
[00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:26.260]   I think by itself, it's not it.
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:29.980]   Again, I think it goes right back to what Andy said is that, you know, it's the mixture
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:35.820]   of the tablet with iTunes, the iTunes store with, you know, an app development, a mature
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.100]   app development pipeline.
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:40.340]   It's not going to be the same, exactly the same, but I bet you it'll be very, very similar
[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:45.300]   to either OS 10 or iPhone production, which means tons of app developers.
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:49.100]   And this is missing for all these other guys is there's no app store.
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:53.620]   When they open up that iPad, there will be a thousand applications available in 30 days.
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:57.460]   You know, and that's the, you know, for that iPad, I know we're going to write R3.
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:01.700]   You know, and so I'm still, I know I'm alone in this.
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.500]   I'm just skeptical about this whole category.
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.060]   I can see the whole thing flopping.
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:08.780]   I mean, I think where this gets really, where you can say, you know, can I will dominate
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.860]   these markets or not on whether good enough is good enough.
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:15.220]   And it's all, you know, eventually comes down to a factor of price.
[00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:20.420]   I wonder if we'll eventually see in the kind of medium to long term what we see in the
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:26.500]   cell phone market, which is that I mean, certainly over here because every phone, every
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:31.260]   cell phone that's bought in England is basically given away in exchange for the two year kind
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:34.100]   of service contract.
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:39.540]   And consequently, there's no incentive to buy anything other than the absolute best phone
[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:44.220]   because if second best is free and the absolute best is free, then you know, you can take
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:45.460]   the absolute best every time.
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:50.460]   And I wonder if we're moving into these kind of tablet markets and the kind of touch market
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:56.180]   where everything eventually ends up with always on cellular data, whether when those end up
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:35:04.060]   being subsidized by data plans, if they all just end up being free and so Apple wins anyway.
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:05.940]   I mean, that might be the case.
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:09.780]   I mean, it is one of those things that I think that when I suddenly saw that everybody had
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:14.540]   an iPhone is when the iPhone dropped to $99 and suddenly everybody, and if you do any
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:19.140]   of the math, the reason I just buy the best iPhone that's out there when I get it is because
[00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:23.980]   I'm doing the math on my monthly bill and knowing that whatever I'm buying as hardware
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:28.980]   is such a small slice of what I'm paying for the phone that is exactly true.
[00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.540]   That it's cost is irrelevant.
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:34.980]   It's pretty close to I have an international plan because I'm out of the country a lot.
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:38.980]   And then I have a bunch of people on it and it's $2,000 or $3,000 in the two year contract
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:39.980]   at least.
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:40.980]   Yeah.
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:41.980]   Yeah.
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:42.980]   I don't know.
[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:44.700]   I could see this whole category being it.
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:48.860]   You know, it's not like Apple has always, you know, despite, I mean, the Newton was a
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:51.660]   great product, right, but didn't wasn't a cat.
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:52.660]   Didn't win the category.
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:55.180]   I think it has to do with though.
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:58.180]   I think it has to do with there's a bunch of things that are happening at the same time.
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:04.660]   When you look at 4G, when you look at, you know, sell you the speed of 60 megabits a
[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:05.660]   second.
[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:06.660]   I think you're right.
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:07.660]   But I think you might want a net book.
[00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:08.660]   You might want something with a keyboard.
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:09.660]   I don't want a keyboard.
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:10.660]   I mean, I want to keep.
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:13.740]   I want the ability to have a Bluetooth keyboard, you know, when I want it.
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:14.740]   But I don't want to.
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:18.220]   There are tons of times now, and I find more and more that I'm walking around with my
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:22.020]   iPhone and I'm posting to Facebook or I'm posting to Twitter or I'm, whatever.
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.460]   And I'm quite, I'm quite comfortable with it.
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.180]   I don't like a sign that keyboard.
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:26.180]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:28.220]   I'm talking about the Zoom because that came out today too.
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:32.140]   And that is another competitor to the iPod touch and the iPhone.
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:33.620]   And we have other stories.
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:35.620]   There's a lot to talk about today.
[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:37.620]   We're going to have to move pretty quickly because we're already pretty deep into the
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:38.620]   show.
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:41.300]   But let me mention before we get too farther, too much farther in the show, our friends
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:44.740]   at Citrix and their great product go to meeting.
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:48.100]   They may say, wait a minute, go to meeting.
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.100]   That's a PC product.
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:52.900]   No, you don't go to meeting works on Macs and Windows and works swell.
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:55.260]   It's the best way to have an online meeting.
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:37:00.700]   Just go, if you can verify this yourself, go to go to meeting.com/macbreak right now.
[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:02.380]   And you'll see that you can download it.
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:03.380]   You can install it.
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:04.680]   In fact, it just takes a couple of minutes.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.620]   You get 30 days free so you can really see how you can use this thing.
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.700]   Look, we've all got people we got to meet with.
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:13.420]   I mean, this is universal in business these days.
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:18.620]   But who wants to jump in the car and drive across town for, you know, spend two hours
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:21.940]   in the car for a one hour meeting or fly across the country for a five minute meeting?
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:23.820]   I mean, it just doesn't make sense.
[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:24.820]   It's not a good use of your time.
[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:26.340]   It's not a good use of money.
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:29.420]   You can have a meeting that is every bit as effective, maybe even more effective than
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:30.540]   in person meeting.
[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:32.980]   You could show them the keynote presentation.
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:37.060]   You could show them the drawings, the websites that you can even collaborate together on
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.060]   documents.
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:40.420]   It's great for training too.
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:44.500]   It's called go to meeting and it's Mac as well as Windows and I want you to try it free
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.100]   for 30 days.
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:50.420]   By the way, the $49 a month that this will cost after those 30 days includes phone and
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:52.020]   voice over IP conferencing free.
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:53.740]   So you're getting this is a great deal.
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:38:01.660]   Go to G-O-T-O, go to meeting.com/macbreak, try it free for 30 days.
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:03.620]   We use it for so many of our shows.
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:04.780]   I use it for all my meetings.
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:05.780]   In fact, I'll be honest with you.
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:08.540]   I've actually told people I'm not going to meet with you unless you're using go to meeting
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:11.500]   because I just don't want to install some weird piece of software.
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:14.620]   I know go to meetings easy, fast or the easy for your clients.
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:15.860]   This is really the future.
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:16.860]   It's the future.
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:20.220]   We're really integrating both go to meeting and go to seminar is one of the other things
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:21.220]   we're testing, which is their larger.
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:22.220]   Oh, they really had that.
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:23.220]   Yeah.
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:27.220]   I think it's up to a thousand people or something to do stuff within the Pixel Core where we
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.220]   can have a lot.
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:31.540]   That's something we've been doing a lot of testing of right now.
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:34.620]   There's distributing this kind of stuff.
[00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.020]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:41.060]   Whether you believe in the environment and carbon footprint or whatever, it's just from
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:42.460]   a pure time standpoint.
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:45.300]   It doesn't make sense to be trying to get everybody into the same office at the same
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:48.220]   time anymore, especially with the new bandwidth and everything else.
[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:49.940]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:53.900]   We thank them so much for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:38:53.900 --> 00:39:01.620]   Now Andy, you and I both have a Zoom HD, which we couldn't use until Microsoft activated
[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:05.020]   at 12.01 AM this morning.
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:06.540]   So I haven't really had much of a chance to play with it.
[00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:07.540]   Have you had a little bit more of it?
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.020]   I heard Patula Clark playing earlier.
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:13.500]   Yeah, but it finished doing its first sync just about 20 minutes ago.
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:15.740]   So now I got the web browser up.
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:19.180]   Now the thing that's most interesting, I think to a lot of people is that it is an OLED screen
[00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:20.180]   and OLED screen.
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:27.820]   Very, very, very, very, very pretty screen, a very, very pretty user interface, which
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:31.060]   I'm not quite adept at doing upside down and backwards.
[00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:33.100]   So like Ginger Rogers.
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.100]   Yeah.
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:36.020]   So I like the UI on the zoom.
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:39.340]   I'm not crazy about the UI on the zoom software on the PC.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:40.340]   Yeah.
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:41.980]   Well, it's I think it's good.
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:43.140]   It's so different.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:44.140]   Yeah.
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:47.340]   But I mean, it's very, very smart the way that the way that it moves around and the way
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:49.540]   that it updates right now.
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:51.540]   It's I mean, getting it.
[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:53.140]   Oh, look, you're my friend.
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.140]   We're now friends.
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:56.020]   Twitla Port is a friend.
[00:39:56.020 --> 00:40:01.820]   So the thing I thought was really interesting is got Wi-Fi in it and you can Wi-Fi sync,
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:05.860]   which is something that's great long wanted from the iPod, the iPhone.
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:08.740]   You could also say, I like this song.
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:09.740]   What else you got?
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:10.740]   Right.
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:13.620]   And it will via Wi-Fi add more music to your zoom.
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:14.620]   Not for me.
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.180]   I think I think I look at look how smooth that is.
[00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.580]   Very very slick.
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:23.140]   I think the one of the defining user experiences and something I just experienced just about
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:27.620]   an hour ago, the first time that I've really docked it, which is that remember that this
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:30.340]   is cooked into a subscription based model.
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:34.020]   So that the very first thing it does is say, Oh, I see you have lots of cool music.
[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:38.460]   Let me download shovel fulls of other copyrighted music for you automatically that you will
[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:39.860]   not have to pay for than.
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:40.860]   Legal aid.
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:41.860]   Yeah.
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:45.060]   And that's like because I was I don't know if that was part of that.
[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:49.420]   We were recording what had happened, but they I had a I had it set up because I knew it was
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:50.980]   still sinking up.
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:54.940]   And just for for no reason that I could have found them, my my windows notebook started
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:57.620]   playing Petula Clark.
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:00.980]   And I guess what had happened was that at that point it had finished analyzing my iTunes
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:01.980]   library finished.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:02.980]   You know, you like.
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:11.180]   You said, Tevo thinks I'm a Julia Fark, but Petula Fark.
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:12.780]   But yeah, I mean, that that's a great experience.
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:15.620]   I didn't have any of this music before.
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:17.500]   I like some of this music you're playing for me.
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.900]   Wait, you saying that not only did you download lots of music that I didn't pay for, but it's
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:23.420]   also like right on my player right now.
[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:27.700]   219 for the 16 gig, which says 20 bucks more than the iPod.
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.140]   Yeah, but no camera.
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:30.140]   What are you going to do?
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:35.180]   No, $10 cheaper than a 32 gig iPod touch at 289.
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:41.060]   I have to admit, I'm seriously considering getting a Zoom HD because I specifically because
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:45.660]   I just want a subscription that I, you know, this is my like a road my, you know, have
[00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:50.420]   a road, you know, I think that I just can fill it up with something different when I'm
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:51.420]   going on the road.
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:52.420]   I use filling up for it.
[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:55.860]   You know, I don't know on a day to day basis, if I would use it that much, but when I'm
[00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:59.100]   doing a road trip or something, I just want to, I feel like listening to this kind of
[00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.900]   music for this kind of road trip.
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:05.340]   I feel bad because poor Will Harris is sitting here and he's out in the cold because he
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:06.340]   can't.
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.820]   It's US only, sorry to say really.
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:10.820]   It's US only.
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:12.220]   Zoom doesn't exist in Britain.
[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:16.980]   I mean, I, you know, listen to a lot of talk about how, you know, Zoom is Microsoft's new
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:20.380]   brand for entertainment and how the Zoom is going to be the one for the most.
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:21.380]   Right.
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:22.380]   They're replacing the Windows media player.
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:23.380]   They're replacing everything with Zoom.
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:24.380]   I know.
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:27.500]   It's like it's going to replace the iPod in America.
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:28.900]   The rest of the world can't get it.
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:29.900]   But you know what?
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:32.700]   When you get to the pictures of the week, I will give you something that will knock the
[00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:33.700]   socks off.
[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:35.140]   In fact, I bet I think yes.
[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:37.300]   And it's something we can't get in the States.
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:41.980]   So you get your back and I'm very, very jealous.
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:44.540]   I have to say like beer that's 3% non alcohol.
[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:45.540]   Yeah.
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:46.540]   Yeah.
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:47.540]   3% non alcohol.
[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:50.340]   You mean 97% alcohol?
[00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:51.340]   Nice.
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:52.340]   That's all I got to say.
[00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:53.340]   I'll take that beer.
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:59.980]   Anyway, I think that this is one of the reasons I was pretty convinced Apple would put a camera
[00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:04.140]   in the iPod touch because that would be just the little thing that could make the difference
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:06.940]   in something that is actually pretty close.
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:09.420]   Although what the Zoom does like, they do have apps.
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:12.260]   There was some speculation there'd be an App Store.
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:16.100]   There may be apps, but they won't be much better than those iPod apps that you've seen.
[00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:18.380]   There aren't going to be touch style apps.
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:21.260]   As far as I can tell you, Andy, do you think different?
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:25.100]   Well, I mean, that's a great unknown.
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:28.420]   I've already tried to see if there's any apps available in the Zoom App Store and I haven't
[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:29.420]   found anything.
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:31.420]   I think that they're going to go.
[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:36.060]   I bet that there's a whiteboard somewhere in Microsoft that simply says we need to have
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:37.380]   the following 12 apps.
[00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:38.460]   We need to have a Twitter client.
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:39.460]   We need to have a Facebook client.
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:43.060]   They said they told me in the briefing they would do a Twitter and Facebook client.
[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:44.060]   Right.
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:50.820]   I mean, does the Zoom HD have graphics capabilities for games like the like the touch because
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:51.820]   they have open geo?
[00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:54.460]   If it were kill, it would be Halo mobile, right?
[00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:55.460]   Right.
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:57.260]   And who in Microsoft owns that franchise?
[00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:58.260]   Well, of course.
[00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:02.300]   Yeah, but there are things that this has 720p output.
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:06.380]   So once you have your little doc here.
[00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:08.980]   The doc is another 89 bucks, by the way, we should add.
[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:09.980]   Yeah.
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:12.860]   And these are extra things, but at least you can get like HDMI output on this thing.
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:13.860]   That's pretty cool.
[00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:15.220]   So you dock it next to your TV.
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:16.300]   It syncs up.
[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:21.980]   And now you can play back the videos in 720p on your TV and they look good.
[00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:22.980]   They look good.
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:23.980]   Yeah.
[00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:27.100]   And you can watch a downscaled version on your Zoom, but watch the full scale version
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:28.100]   on your TV.
[00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:33.340]   I think there's going to be like a two level series of reviews on this.
[00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:37.740]   I know I'm going to be writing one today or tomorrow that will review it as it is right
[00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:38.740]   now.
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:40.220]   I have to say that already I'm very impressed with it.
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:43.220]   But another one is going to have to come like in three or four months when it has time
[00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:47.380]   to really build up a software library, more importantly, really build up a video library
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:52.540]   because I'm curious to see if they can build up a rental library to really challenge iTunes
[00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:53.540]   in that way.
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:54.540]   Right.
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:45:00.980]   And if I do like the idea of having this in my car and just not watching movies on it,
[00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:04.900]   but having this in my car, listening music from it, going out to lunch and watching a
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:09.780]   movie on it, but then taking it home, dropping this into a dock and then right in my kitchen
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:13.340]   or right in my living room, being able to watch the exact same piece of video without
[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:18.100]   having to re-sync to a central library, reconnect to a central library, just simply, this is
[00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:19.100]   the playback device.
[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:22.940]   I'm putting this in the dock, please, and either using our motor, just pressing play
[00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:23.940]   right here.
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:27.940]   I think there's one thing we can say for sure when it comes to this and the R-co's is whether
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:32.700]   or not these are iPod killers, it's great to have some competition in the space.
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.500]   It keeps apples prices down, it keeps their innovation.
[00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:37.020]   This is important to have this.
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:39.060]   It's very important that Apple gets pushed on this stuff.
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:43.140]   I think that, and I think that Apple, again, and I've been saying this for a long time,
[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:48.060]   but I think Apple, if Apple incorporated an optional subscription model on top of what
[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:51.300]   they already have, so you can have everything you want at a low quality.
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:52.900]   Why, they really, it seems like it's the market.
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:54.980]   It seems like this should push them to do that.
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:58.140]   Well, the only question is whether the record companies would allow them to do that because
[00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:02.060]   it literally would leave no, there'd be nothing standing more than three inches.
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:03.620]   It would be, you know, it would be scorched earth.
[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:04.940]   It would be over.
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:09.020]   And so I think that's frankly the one, I mean, all of the features are nice, but the one
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:12.180]   thing that puts the Zoom over the top is Zoom Pass.
[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:13.180]   Right.
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:14.500]   $15, and it's a good deal, by the way.
[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.860]   It's $15 a month, and you get to download 10 free songs.
[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:21.900]   And I was really impressed because Microsoft, in the past, those 10 free songs expire every
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:22.900]   month on me.
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:26.220]   I keep forgetting to get my songs that you can own, you know, they're in P3, by the way,
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:27.220]   high quality.
[00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:31.180]   And, and Microsoft is now going to warn you as you get closer to date saying you want
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:32.180]   yourself.
[00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:33.780]   And if you don't, they will give you some default songs.
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:35.620]   So I have to say, I'm impressed by that.
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:36.620]   Right.
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:37.980]   You're going to get a great Patula Clark collection.
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:38.980]   Any minute now, Andy.
[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:40.740]   I don't know where this came from.
[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:42.540]   Again, I'm just filling around with it.
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:47.740]   And I clicked on a track from Abbey Road that I know it's synced from my iTunes library.
[00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:51.780]   I don't know if it got this content, like, wirelessly from someplace else.
[00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:53.260]   This is the other thing I really like.
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:56.380]   And this is on the Zoom player on the desktop and on the Xbox too.
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:00.420]   It really does a nice job with the album art and the graphics.
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:01.420]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:03.420]   I mean, I think that's really not.
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:04.420]   That's exactly it.
[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:05.420]   I don't know where that came from.
[00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:07.900]   I have to realize that I'm very, very new with this.
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:10.380]   So I can't say where it came from or where it didn't come from.
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:13.940]   I know I know it didn't sync it down off the, off the Zoom library.
[00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:17.700]   Isn't it interesting though that they have that?
[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:19.100]   It's he's showing, we should mention it.
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:21.060]   He's showing Abbey Road.
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:23.820]   Film art and graphics and text, not Beatles pictures.
[00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:28.420]   Not just that, but it's turned the screen into sort of like a free flowing screen saver.
[00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:32.980]   That photo of the band from the background, I don't believe that's part of what I synced
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:36.620]   to it from when I ripped the disc a while ago.
[00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:40.500]   It's smart enough to say, well, let's take the band name and at least here we go.
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:45.100]   This is essentially like the Apple LP stuff.
[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:48.100]   It's making use of the actual screen.
[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.100]   It's making some use of the real estate.
[00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:53.980]   It's actually better, I will say that this is a song that's currently playing.
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:58.940]   It's showing the band name, the name of the song and the name of the album right now.
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:02.740]   It's doing it in a much better way that even the desktop version of iTunes does.
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:06.380]   The desktop version iTunes just acts as though I'm sitting in front of a computer all the
[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:07.380]   time.
[00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:12.620]   I did buy, I bought the Grateful Dead for the roses just to see the Apple LP thing.
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:13.620]   It's nice.
[00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:17.740]   I mean, it's nice, but the problem is I don't sit in front of my computer and listen to music.
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:21.180]   So I'll be up and glancing up from the other side of the room and see, that's kind of
[00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:22.180]   a cool song.
[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:23.420]   I wonder what album it's from.
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:24.420]   It's neat.
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:29.020]   I use my Steve Austin Bionic Eye to find out what track is actually playing.
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:31.220]   It's been so long, I guess, since we've looked at albums.
[00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:32.580]   We've kind of broken the habit.
[00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:34.100]   It's kind of broken the habit.
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:35.100]   Exactly.
[00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:39.020]   I mean, I now, when I get in the handful of times that I've gotten CDs, I just rip them
[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:41.300]   into iTunes and put them in a box.
[00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:43.260]   I did order the box set.
[00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:44.260]   I knew.
[00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:45.260]   I knew.
[00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:46.260]   I knew.
[00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:47.260]   I know.
[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:52.700]   I didn't like it because EMI was charging more for two records less for the mono.
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:55.300]   And I thought they're ripping off.
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:57.980]   It's a ripoff to people who have better taste.
[00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:00.020]   So I'm going to have more plebeian taste.
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:04.500]   That's going to be one of those defining questions when, if there's a website that
[00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:08.340]   they're not allowed, or a job seeker site that's not allowed to discriminate on the
[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:11.660]   basis of age, they can't ask what their age is, but they'll ask you, did you buy the
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:13.820]   mono set or the stereo sets mono?
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:14.820]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:16.900]   You're a little bit too old for this job.
[00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:20.820]   I like why would he not be serious?
[00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:26.220]   I like the mono Apple TV prices dropped the low end pulled from the store.
[00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:30.900]   This could mean one of two things either at Apple TV upgrade is on the way and they're
[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:31.900]   trying to clear out.
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:36.780]   Given up or they've given up and they said, you know, all right, 160 gigs for 229.
[00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:37.780]   Would you buy it then?
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:38.780]   Right.
[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:40.180]   They've always said it was a bit of a game.
[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:41.180]   It was a test.
[00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:42.180]   Steve said it was a hobby.
[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:43.180]   It was a hobby.
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:45.980]   Now that he's back, he's like, okay, time to get to work.
[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:51.940]   Well, and I think that, you know, I have both an Apple TV and a Mac mini and I just feel
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:52.940]   like the Mac mini.
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:54.180]   I know that it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:55.420]   That's not a lot easy too.
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:59.500]   You have to put, you know, X, B, M, C or Plex on it and you've got to figure.
[00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:01.740]   I mean, it's just not as easy to get to do all that.
[00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:03.380]   What do you mean the mini?
[00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:04.580]   Oh, well, I don't know.
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:08.820]   I like the fact that I can sit there in front of my TV and I can be, you know, I can watch
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:10.620]   all that stuff, all the stuff that I want.
[00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:12.060]   But I use the Roku for that.
[00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:13.660]   Well, now I do.
[00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:16.620]   But I can, but then I can also just click and boom.
[00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:19.740]   I'm surfing the web and then boom, I'm back to whatever I'm doing.
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:23.020]   You know, so to me having like, if you have a Bluetooth keyboard and you're sitting across
[00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:25.180]   the room and you're sitting across the room and oh, I want to, I want to, I'm watching
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:26.180]   something.
[00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:30.620]   Let me stop that and I have a bad habit of I sit a lot of times in front of the TV watching
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:31.620]   movies and searching secure.
[00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:35.100]   I just keep my laptop up open.
[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:37.820]   I know, but I don't always want to see what they have that big screen.
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:41.660]   I have kids, you know, laptops on couches and kids is not such a.
[00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:42.660]   I'm disappointed.
[00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:45.860]   Apple TV was a great product and I really hope that Apple would do something.
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:48.100]   Will do you, are you an Apple TV user?
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:52.220]   Yeah, I have an Apple TV and I absolutely love it.
[00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:57.780]   And the reason I absolutely love it is because, you know, all my, I do get all my media from
[00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:00.940]   iTunes sucker as I am.
[00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:04.700]   But it just means that it's all immediately available on my TV.
[00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:07.700]   And I think, you know, the one thing I would really like is if it had some kind of, you
[00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:08.700]   know, boxy functionality.
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:12.100]   Well, you can put boxy on it by hacking it.
[00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:15.140]   You know what it misses is a tuner so you could watch live TV.
[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:16.140]   Yeah.
[00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:19.780]   And also, again, I mean, I hate to harp on about this stuff, but the boxy stuff is all
[00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:20.780]   US centric.
[00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:24.580]   It's all like it's rated with blue and of course that's no good for us.
[00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:29.900]   So the reason that I really like the Apple TV is because it's a way to get iTunes movies
[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:36.540]   on the big screen and iTunes in the UK is by far the biggest instant rental.
[00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:40.540]   There is Netflix doesn't really exist over here.
[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:44.380]   So I choose so actually, I think the Apple TV in the UK is more compelling because the
[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:48.420]   iTunes store is so much better than anything else that's out here.
[00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:49.420]   That's a really good point.
[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:52.780]   I'm glad we had you on today because a lot of the things, well, no, a lot of things we're
[00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:54.420]   talking about are US only.
[00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:55.420]   Right.
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:56.900]   And it really does change the perspective.
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:52:01.780]   I'd be sad if you know, I hope the Apple TV doesn't go away.
[00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:05.740]   I hope that they because I think it is a great product.
[00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:10.620]   And I hope that what they do is just make it a bit more broadly useful.
[00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:15.500]   I think a lot of people would be much more interested in it if it had more kind of video
[00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:22.300]   on demand options if it could sync up with Hulu or, you know, Comedy Central or something
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:23.300]   like that.
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:25.020]   So I think that would be really useful.
[00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:27.580]   But in general, it's, you know, I do like it.
[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:28.580]   So what's what is this?
[00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:29.740]   Blue ray in it.
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:32.260]   Yeah, that'll never happen.
[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:35.020]   I can tear I could predict that pretty confidently.
[00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:36.220]   You're not going to see blue ray in it.
[00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:41.700]   However, my question is Apple TV dead or is this the beginning of a refresh in the product
[00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:44.500]   line, Andy?
[00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:47.300]   I don't think they're going to bend in this market.
[00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:53.900]   I do think that Apple TV might underscore might be Apple's Vista where they can create
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:57.940]   the next version of this, the same team, same hardware, same software, but they can't really
[00:52:57.940 --> 00:53:01.620]   call it Apple TV because that will associate them with this box.
[00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:05.340]   They just sort of had in the price list for three years without really doing much with
[00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:06.340]   it.
[00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:10.940]   I'd be surprised if they did not have a consumer device that plugs directly into the TV TV,
[00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:15.260]   lives in the living room and streams content from a variety of sources, including your
[00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:16.780]   iTunes library.
[00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:22.780]   Every time you see new infrastructure going into the Mac OS 10 operating system, I keep
[00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:27.260]   thinking, wow, this would be a great feature for Apple TV, the ability to find any Mac
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:29.060]   and Tosh anywhere in the planet.
[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:31.540]   I see how that would be an Apple TV feature.
[00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:35.740]   This new sort of abstract way of switching between applications, I see how that could
[00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:37.780]   be an Apple TV feature.
[00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:41.020]   I can't say that I know what they're going to do one way or another, but it seems as
[00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:46.980]   though they, it seems as though either big revolution is coming or a big cultural devastation
[00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:47.980]   is coming.
[00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:48.980]   I don't know which one.
[00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:49.980]   How about you, Will?
[00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:54.340]   Do you think Apple TV dead or alive?
[00:53:54.340 --> 00:54:00.660]   I think in this iteration, dead, but the concept still due to be zoned, be fired and
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:01.660]   reincarnated.
[00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:06.020]   Alex Lindsay dead or alive, the Apple TV?
[00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:11.140]   I think that it is, I think the, I think kind of like what Will said, I think this
[00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:14.020]   version is dead and I think that we're going to see something different.
[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:18.180]   But I think that the idea of creating the internet box is something that can't go away.
[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:19.580]   I mean, I think that that is the future.
[00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:23.340]   I mean, especially when I look at really what my experience is with the Roku, which is that
[00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:25.940]   that is what I watch 80% of TV on now.
[00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:30.620]   It is my, I love Apple TV and I have a Roku and I use
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:32.740]   the Roku almost every single day.
[00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:35.340]   And I cannot tell you the last time that I used the app.
[00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:36.340]   Exactly.
[00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:37.340]   Same for me.
[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:38.340]   Exactly.
[00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:40.500]   And the Roku's got a painful interface because it really should be a grid.
[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:41.500]   It should be a grid.
[00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:42.500]   Well, it should be a grid.
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:44.940]   But you know, you can always go up arrow and get back where you were.
[00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:46.260]   I think the interface works pretty well.
[00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:50.380]   But if you have, if you have a Netflix account and you have 160 things on your Instagram,
[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:53.420]   it is like a long, I know what they are now.
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:55.420]   I know what, I know the road, the road, I have a 150.
[00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:56.820]   I want to get to Red Dwarf.
[00:54:56.820 --> 00:55:00.580]   I've got 61 clicks before I get to, you know, whatever.
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:01.580]   You know, I could improve that.
[00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:05.060]   If it was just a grid, if it was just a grid or if I could enter a letter.
[00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:09.300]   If in instant I could group them, you know, you know, in my instant movie, it would be
[00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:10.300]   fine.
[00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:13.900]   But it's, you know, because they're making, I think the Roku is actually going to be
[00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:15.980]   the sleeper product of the year.
[00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:17.380]   They're making some really interesting changes.
[00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.220]   I just got the majorly baseball on it.
[00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:20.220]   It's really great.
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:24.740]   Is it conceivable that Roku could be an acquisition target for Apple?
[00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:25.740]   No.
[00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:28.660]   I don't think they, I don't think Apple would buy Roku.
[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:33.180]   If they're the most successful player in this space and Apple wants this space.
[00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:34.660]   Apple doesn't usually buy its way into a space.
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:35.660]   I think that's the best issue.
[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:39.340]   Well, and the other question would be would Netflix maintain its relationship if we're
[00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:43.020]   an Apple company as opposed to a small independent company?
[00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:44.020]   Yeah.
[00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:46.100]   Netflix and Amazon are what powers this thing.
[00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:47.100]   Without that, you have nothing.
[00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:48.340]   It's so great.
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:49.820]   Although you could add the Apple store.
[00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:51.540]   The, this is the real problem, I'll be honest.
[00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:58.180]   With the HD, the Zoom HD, the Xbox, the Apple store in general is that the television and
[00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:02.860]   movie companies are too afraid to put their top quality stuff on there.
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:08.220]   So you're stuck kind of with second tier stuff to watch, I'm afraid.
[00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:10.820]   Look at the stuff that's on Netflix instant play.
[00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:15.980]   It's just not as, how many times have I watched something and said, "Oh, I wish I'd love to."
[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:16.980]   Yeah.
[00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:19.820]   It's just, you're watching second tier stuff a lot of the time.
[00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:25.220]   Well, but I have to admit that I can rarely now carve out enough time to watch a whole
[00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:26.220]   movie.
[00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:27.220]   So I have all the CSI.
[00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:28.780]   It'll have, you know, it's gonna happen.
[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:29.780]   It's gonna happen.
[00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:30.780]   It's gonna happen.
[00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:32.660]   They're gonna realize this is where the future is.
[00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:33.660]   People are gonna read it.
[00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:34.660]   It was Netflix.
[00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:37.220]   I mean, I think that Netflix has known it's been the future since they started.
[00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:40.660]   I think that they're just, they're looking at cokecing everybody towards what the future
[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:41.660]   is.
[00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:46.580]   And so while at second tier, I think the biggest fear is, is that I've lost, I, I went from,
[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:51.260]   I'm now down to Netflix one, you know, the one disc at a time.
[00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:55.260]   Because I don't use, I just keep a disc sitting on my desk saying I'm on Netflix one.
[00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:56.260]   Yeah.
[00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:58.540]   I have five discs that I haven't watched in six months.
[00:56:58.540 --> 00:56:59.540]   There's no point.
[00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:00.540]   I don't return them anymore.
[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:01.860]   I don't bother anymore because I don't care.
[00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:04.340]   You know, you know, all I, all I care about is my instant.
[00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:08.260]   So Apple TV, I think, I think the consensus is with all of us.
[00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:12.700]   And I think we're, I think we're right that the Apple TV itself is doomed as a platform,
[00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:15.940]   but Apple has to have something that connects to a TV.
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:20.620]   In fact, that's what Steve Jobs said when they introduced the Apple TV is in your pocket,
[00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:22.860]   in your living room, on your desk.
[00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:23.940]   They want to own.
[00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:25.180]   And that was Microsoft's goal.
[00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:29.900]   And Apple has a better, you know, as a pretty good wedge into the living room.
[00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:33.340]   Maybe not as good as the PS3 and the Xbox 360 because they don't have those games on
[00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:34.340]   there.
[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:36.740]   You know, it's really natural to hook up an Xbox 360 or TV.
[00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:40.580]   And I got a, I bought a PS3 thinking I would play games and I didn't play any games and
[00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:44.580]   be that is the hottest running device I have in my entire entertainment system.
[00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:48.860]   I'm getting rid of it just because I'm going to use it as a H.264 renderer.
[00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:57.900]   And Apple TV, I mean, to reiterate Will's point is, you know, there is no Roku in Britain.
[00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:02.340]   Apple TV is the biggest game in town when it comes to watching video on your TV set that
[00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:05.460]   you download from the iTunes store.
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:08.100]   So maybe they'll keep it alive.
[00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:13.100]   Roberto Bernini is saying in our friend, Fitchetram, Apple has a $25 billion war chest.
[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:14.100]   So you're right.
[00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:15.660]   Maybe some acquisitions would make sense.
[00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:18.100]   Yeah, I just, they do have a lot of money.
[00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:20.300]   They don't spend by zoom.
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:23.020]   No, I don't think my zoom is what we are.
[00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:24.220]   This is an interesting question.
[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:28.660]   I'd say, again, I'm sorry, I've had actually put the zoom like a way because I just keep
[00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:33.540]   fiddling with it and it's a little, I played a Bob Dylan track and said, Oh, by the way,
[00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:37.100]   here's some here, like 40 other Bob Zillow and Bob Dylan albums and tracks.
[00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:38.500]   Do you want to get some right now?
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:39.500]   Don't even bother sinking.
[00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:40.500]   I'll just get them for you.
[00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:41.500]   Isn't that awesome?
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:42.500]   And now I have like four.
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:43.500]   Oh, that is such a cool.
[00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:44.500]   It's the zoom.
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:45.500]   I'm turning it off.
[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:46.500]   Turn it off.
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:48.500]   I'm putting it with a product.
[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:50.700]   So that outside my reach.
[00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:52.500]   And now I'm going to turn mine on.
[00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:53.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:54.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:55.500]   Now I got some stuff.
[00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:57.500]   I'll let Alex play with it.
[00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:58.500]   Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:00.500]   See, I didn't know what else.
[00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:02.500]   By the way, the radio and this is HD.
[00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:04.500]   So they did it's FM, but it's F.M. HD.
[00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:05.500]   So they did one better.
[00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:06.500]   I don't know if that really means anything.
[00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:07.500]   Oh, I think it does.
[00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:08.500]   No, no, no, no.
[00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:09.500]   The radio is NPR.
[00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:10.500]   How much?
[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:11.500]   How good can I can be?
[00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:12.500]   How good could it be?
[00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:15.500]   The weird thing is though, a lot of these features were in like the very first one.
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:16.500]   Only guess what?
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:17.500]   It actually works now.
[00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:18.500]   Yes.
[00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:19.500]   Right.
[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:20.500]   Right.
[00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:23.500]   Right about right about now, like two hours into my experience, but the for the first
[00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:28.500]   zoom, there is a brown zoom shaped stain on my wall where I thrown it.
[00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:35.500]   Well, you remember that video which will live forever I made on the still on YouTube forever.
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:38.500]   As a zoom hater.
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:39.500]   What would you buy?
[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:45.500]   $25 billion, burning a hole and Steve Jobs, skinny little blue gene pocket.
[00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:46.500]   What would you buy?
[00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:48.500]   Intuit just bought mint.
[00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:51.500]   I think apple could have done really well if they bought mint.
[00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:52.500]   It's kind of out there.
[00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:53.500]   I don't think that's apple thing.
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:55.500]   That makes sense for Intuit.
[00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:58.500]   Yeah, I mean, that was a that was a looming killer.
[00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.500]   I wish they I wish they hadn't bought it.
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:01.500]   Yeah, because I like the competition.
[01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:05.500]   When I have to admit, I was a little more scared that the mentor had all my stuff now that
[01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:06.500]   Intuit owns it.
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.500]   I know.
[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:08.500]   I'm sure it's fine.
[01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:12.380]   But I was the only advantage made into it go free with quicken.
[01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:16.980]   What I like about mine mint is that finding some ways to integrate my phone eat more easily
[01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:20.500]   with QuickBooks, which is what's being used, you know, for the company would be kind of
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:21.500]   cool.
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:22.500]   Yeah.
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:23.500]   What would you buy?
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:24.500]   $25 billion.
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:25.500]   Any ideas?
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:27.500]   You're the entrepreneur, Will Harris.
[01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:33.500]   I would if I if I was apple, I would buy a games company.
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:34.500]   Yes.
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:37.500]   I would buy a games company to make games for my handheld platform.
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.500]   Sony makes the best platforms of the game.
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:40.500]   It makes the best games of the PSP.
[01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:44.500]   Microsoft arguably makes the best games for the Xbox.
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:45.500]   They buy a game.
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:46.500]   Exactly.
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:52.500]   If I was apple, I would go out and find a bungee or a, you know, a high quality developer
[01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:58.500]   going buy them and just set them to task making the best, darned portable games on the planet.
[01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:03.500]   And that could even save the Apple TV platform if you made it playable on the Apple TV.
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.500]   Exactly.
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:05.500]   I like that.
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:06.500]   Buy a game company.
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:09.900]   Andy, you agree or what would you buy if you had $25 billion?
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:15.860]   I'd have them buy some sort of a broad wireless broadband company and make it implicit that
[01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:21.220]   every time you buy an apple handheld or desktop device, it has access to a free nationwide
[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:22.220]   wireless network.
[01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:23.220]   Love it.
[01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:24.220]   Yeah.
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:25.220]   Ooh, that's better.
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:30.060]   Not only one with the with with the existing standard, I'm talking about they get to build
[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:36.860]   their own standard that this Apple to Apple talk 3G or Apple Jack Apple talk 5G or whatever,
[01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:41.340]   where again, it'll be a huge cloud of every device you own essentially is in the same
[01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:46.180]   space at the same time being a work files data and software between each other.
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:47.180]   Yeah.
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:48.180]   Okay.
[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:49.180]   Yes.
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:50.180]   We're genie.
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:51.180]   I'm not done wishing yet.
[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:52.180]   It should work.
[01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:53.180]   It should work.
[01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:54.180]   Well, $25 billion.
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:55.180]   What would you buy?
[01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:56.180]   Give me my zoom back.
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:57.180]   I think you could make.
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:00.620]   You could make a lot of movies for just a billion dollars.
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:04.460]   You know, so, so, you know, the make my content.
[01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:06.500]   The thing is, is you could buy John Lasseter.
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:10.700]   Well, the thing is, is if if Apple, you know, started funding independent films that were
[01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:14.740]   then distributed over iTunes, you know, the, you know, and it could be and there's some
[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:19.420]   danger in that and so on and so forth, but building some independent ability to actually
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:20.420]   create it.
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:23.820]   I don't know whether with music, I think that that would get us them back into trouble.
[01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:25.820]   They'd be back talking to the Beatles again.
[01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:26.820]   Yeah.
[01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:31.180]   But movies, I think that they could do and, and, and, and, or shows or, you know, content,
[01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:36.420]   like, use some of that money for developing some custom, you know, or, or subsidizing some
[01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:38.820]   good custom content that kind of moves things forward.
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:43.180]   I think that the, for me, if I was Apple, I'd be focusing a lot of my energy on figuring
[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:45.300]   out ways to integrate with schools.
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:48.220]   I think that they, that's been a big market for them and I think it's going to continue
[01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:49.220]   to be one.
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:53.580]   I think there's going to be, I think these iPhones and Internet books and, or media pads
[01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:58.940]   or whatever, the opportunity to grow the market into schools where every kid has a media,
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:02.340]   this is where I think the big growth market is, by the way, every kid have an immediate
[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:06.140]   pad that's integrated into a central system that allows them to interact with smart boards.
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:11.380]   You mean you look at like the city of Baltimore has every classroom as a smart board.
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:15.180]   So if you start integrating the media pads and everything else, but Apple spending a
[01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:20.380]   lot of R&D buying maybe the smart board, you know, in building that type of integration,
[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:23.180]   I think is a massive growth market.
[01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:27.740]   I mean, we do some work in education and you suddenly realize how much money is, no matter
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:31.700]   how much we talk about how it's running out of money, the level, the amount of money that
[01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:36.820]   goes into the, into those programs makes the funding of Pirates of the Caribbean look like
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:37.820]   a walk in that part.
[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:43.780]   You know, because it's just, it's just the sheer size of the education market is, is,
[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:45.660]   is a much different process.
[01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:48.980]   And I think Apple investing in that area, and I think they are, but I think they could
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.340]   dive further into it.
[01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:54.860]   There are some acquisitions there dealing with smart board manufacturers dealing with those
[01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:55.860]   types of things.
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:58.140]   I think that that would make a lot of sense for them.
[01:03:58.140 --> 01:03:59.140]   I like you.
[01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:00.140]   I think I'm going to vote for Andy's.
[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:01.940]   If I were, if I were, I think Andy's is the best.
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:04.660]   I had to think of something different, but Andy is the best I can.
[01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:05.660]   Yeah, I like Andy's idea.
[01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:08.300]   But I think you've got enough money to do both, to be honest with you.
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:09.300]   Mine would only cost a billion.
[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:10.300]   Yeah.
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:11.300]   You've got a billion.
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:12.300]   I'm cheap.
[01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:14.860]   Truthfully, you can get a great game company for a couple of billion.
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:21.100]   Andy's, you know, I mean, when they were, when the FCC was auctioning off that spectrum,
[01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:22.380]   it started at four and a half billion.
[01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:27.100]   I think Andy, you could, you could, you could credibly have bought the sub 700 megahertz
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:29.900]   spectrum, set up towers everywhere.
[01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:31.500]   You could have done the whole thing.
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.060]   You could build like an Apple land.
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:34.060]   Apple land.
[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:38.020]   Like a little, you know, it's just, it's just, it's like a max city.
[01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:39.020]   Apple land.
[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:42.220]   It makes my heart hurt that we don't have that already.
[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:46.700]   Well, they won't have it in the U.K. you know.
[01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:48.540]   So just, you know, don't get your hopes up.
[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:49.540]   It's US.
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:50.540]   I know you are.
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:51.540]   How to spell the word color properly.
[01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:54.580]   You know, the thing is that you know, part of Apple land.
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:57.820]   Well, you know, Will has one thing that we don't have.
[01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:00.020]   He's got MMS on his iPhone.
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:01.020]   Yeah.
[01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:05.420]   Have any of you, you know, you've been seeing these, these notes from people saying, Hey,
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:06.860]   my MMS appeared on my iPhone.
[01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:08.420]   Did that happen to anybody here?
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:09.420]   Anybody get MMS on their iPhone?
[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:10.420]   I'm not.
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:11.420]   So I was supposed to come out to the 25th.
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:12.900]   I don't really know how to use MMS.
[01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:14.740]   So I don't even know if I would like you.
[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:15.740]   Yes.
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:16.740]   What would I do with it?
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:17.740]   Yeah.
[01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:18.740]   So I don't know where I would look for it.
[01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:19.740]   I don't know if it's there or not.
[01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:24.140]   There is a way from apple iphoneschool.com.
[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:29.460]   And I put it in our show notes at friend feed to enable MMS.
[01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:31.380]   And you know, it's not the downloadable file.
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:32.380]   I can do it.
[01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:33.740]   It's like, what would I do with it?
[01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:34.740]   Am I the only guy?
[01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:36.220]   I mean, I know we have it over here already.
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:38.620]   Am I the only person that just doesn't get it?
[01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:40.060]   No, no one gets it.
[01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:41.340]   It's for old phones.
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:42.700]   It's for dumb phones.
[01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:49.020]   I think it was you guys that said it last week, which was, you know, why wasn't MMS in
[01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:50.020]   the original iPhone?
[01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:55.380]   Because when Steve Jobs looked at the email function, he would say, you know, why on earth
[01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:56.380]   would you need MMS?
[01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:57.380]   You don't need it.
[01:05:57.380 --> 01:06:00.380]   Built in an email client for you.
[01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:03.620]   And it just seems all this who heart just seems crazy.
[01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:04.620]   Yeah.
[01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:07.900]   Who likes to communicate with other people who don't know?
[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:08.900]   I'm completely not.
[01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:09.900]   Yeah.
[01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:12.300]   If you don't have an iPhone, sorry, right out of your eye.
[01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:13.300]   Yeah.
[01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:17.380]   Seriously, how many of your friends now don't have my phones?
[01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:18.380]   Not many.
[01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:19.900]   A few of them have G1s.
[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:22.620]   I have a lot of friends with the Google phones.
[01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:23.620]   A few with Blackberries.
[01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:24.980]   Quite a few with Blackberries.
[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:29.100]   I find I've been noticing a lot of people in business have their their they have their
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:30.100]   now having two phones.
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:33.060]   They have the Blackberry that the company gave them and they have their iPhone.
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:36.980]   And we find it because when we're recording, we say you got to turn your phone off, you
[01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:40.900]   know, because those are actually the two largest offenders when it comes to audio problems.
[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:43.100]   And you see them pull, you know, they start pulling these out.
[01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:48.140]   And it's almost always the same to it's it's a Blackberry and a and an iPhone.
[01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:49.140]   All right.
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:51.260]   We're going to get to our picks of the week.
[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:55.660]   You've spent Steve's money, Steve's money wisely.
[01:06:55.660 --> 01:07:00.940]   And don't tell them that the wireless network only costs 24.4 billion.
[01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:03.540]   Hey, split the rest with you guys.
[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:04.540]   Okay.
[01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:05.940]   Yeah, we'll keep the you know, we're out of the doors.
[01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:08.860]   We change the skin off the top of it.
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:12.500]   But before we do our picks of the week, which are coming up in just a second, I think it's
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:15.740]   time to do our audible pick of the week, audible.com.
[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:16.980]   You know about audible.com.
[01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:21.860]   I shouldn't have to tell you the greatest online bookstore ever because they're all
[01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:22.860]   read to you.
[01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:28.020]   I mean, imagine a you get all 60,000 wonderful books, wonderful books, and you can just close
[01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:32.540]   your eyes unless you're driving and you can just close your eyes and relax and let somebody
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:33.980]   read these books to you.
[01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:38.500]   And you can see who makes every character come alive, who makes every scene as vivid as the
[01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.020]   most vivid movie you've ever seen.
[01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:43.020]   I mean, these books live in your brain.
[01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:47.500]   I am and I'll tell you, I totally believe it.
[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:53.060]   I've been listening to a game of Thrones, which is part of a five book series, a song
[01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:55.980]   of ice and fire by George RR Martin.
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:59.700]   And I, you know, it's five very long books.
[01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:04.980]   But by the time you're, as I am, almost to the end of book one, these people in this
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:09.060]   life and this world is completely living in my brain.
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:12.940]   And I almost don't, I can't, you know, yesterday I was cooking, I was listening.
[01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:13.940]   I'm walking to work.
[01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:14.940]   I'm listening.
[01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:15.940]   I'm at the gym.
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:16.940]   I'm listening.
[01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:17.900]   I am any moment I can.
[01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:18.900]   I listen.
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:20.500]   And that's what happens with audible.
[01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:21.500]   I want you to try it.
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:22.820]   You're going to love this audible.
[01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:28.260]   And by the way, not just fiction, nonfiction, history, business books, technology.
[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:31.460]   There's a huge variety of listening at audible.com.
[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:36.500]   And you could try your first book is free by going to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:39.740]   You'll sign up for the gold account, which is a book a month.
[01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:45.140]   Now US only, although as many of the audible is worldwide and many of the recommendations
[01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:46.860]   we make are available worldwide.
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:47.860]   So give it a try.
[01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:51.060]   But audible.com/macbreak if you're in the US.
[01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:54.180]   Annie, do you have a recommendation you want to share with us or?
[01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:56.980]   I do have maybe this was not planned.
[01:08:56.980 --> 01:09:00.300]   This was my selection as of last week.
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:07.780]   I love I've always wanted to find a book that is above the United States written by someone
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:09.460]   who grew up someplace else.
[01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:13.700]   And this is someone giving their fresh opinion, their fresh approach to the country.
[01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:16.820]   The things I take for granted each and every day and each and every time.
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:18.460]   I haven't found that book yet.
[01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:23.500]   But I think I found the complimentary book for Great Britain.
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:28.980]   There's a book called The Anglo Files, A Field Guide to the British by Sarah Fajal.
[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:32.900]   And it's not a memoir and it's not a biography.
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:37.220]   It's about this woman who moves to England and has to sort of get used to how things
[01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:38.780]   work over there.
[01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:43.540]   So it's just again, one person's point of view, one person set of stories.
[01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:48.420]   But it gives you the idea of, well, this is how this is the problems that I had adjusting.
[01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:51.180]   These are the things that I noticed were different.
[01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:56.140]   I mean, I'm wondering if I haven't actually gotten past like the first chapter yet.
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:10:01.300]   But I'm already finding a lot of sympathy with my first, I've been to London four or
[01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:02.300]   five times.
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:03.300]   I can't wait to come back.
[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:05.700]   I just absolutely love that city.
[01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:09.780]   But the very first time when I stuck my hand in the back of my pocket for a spot, this
[01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:12.460]   will change to pay for a newspaper and a Coke.
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:17.900]   And I realized there's the same picture on every one of these, the same person is on
[01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:21.540]   every one of these coins and it's a game.
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:23.380]   I've never seen that before.
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:25.980]   Nothing like a game.
[01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:28.300]   And some of these coins are two colors and some of them.
[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:29.300]   Wow.
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:32.100]   I've never had to actually look at coins before the more.
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:33.100]   Oh, you.
[01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:35.700]   So already it's paying dividends.
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:36.940]   I'm enjoying it a lot.
[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:43.700]   That's, as I said, I'm sure that people who actually live in England and Britain will
[01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:46.820]   be the first person to say, well, here's where she didn't get things right.
[01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:47.820]   Here's where she's sort of an idiot.
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:51.380]   And here's where she was expecting a hamburger to be like they are in McDonald's and the
[01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:53.380]   beer to be like Budweiser.
[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:55.980]   But again, as an entertaining read, I'm already enjoying it.
[01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:57.740]   I'm looking forward to getting through the rest of it.
[01:10:57.740 --> 01:10:59.060]   Name again.
[01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:04.180]   It's called the Anglo files F I L E S. Oh, I was spelling it with a pH.
[01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:05.180]   There you go.
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:06.180]   Okay.
[01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:07.180]   Level up.
[01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:08.180]   Level little play on words.
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:09.180]   A field guide to the British by Sarah Lyle.
[01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:10.980]   L Y A L L. All right.
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:11.980]   I got it now.
[01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:15.860]   I was spelling it properly.
[01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:17.740]   You threw it an extra you, didn't you?
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:20.500]   I did the Anglo files.
[01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:24.940]   I said, I out now you were mentioning that you're looking for the book about America
[01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:27.900]   written by you've read Bill Bryson's book, right?
[01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:30.340]   I was a stranger here.
[01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:31.340]   This is a good one.
[01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:32.340]   I think you might like it.
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:33.340]   I'm a stranger here myself.
[01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:37.660]   Bill Bryson is an American, but he went to live in England for, I think, 20 years.
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:42.220]   He has an English wife and four kids and then came back to America.
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:46.980]   And so it's about seeing America again through new eyes.
[01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:49.380]   And I think that this might be the book.
[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:50.860]   It's a wonderful book.
[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:55.500]   I just heard this sort of book has been on my list ever since years ago seeing Michael
[01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:57.700]   Palin's around the world in 80 days.
[01:11:57.700 --> 01:12:00.020]   And I love every single leg of this trip around the world.
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:04.140]   Like on ground level was fascinating, but I was especially paying attention during the
[01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:06.980]   leg when he's taking a train all the way across the United States.
[01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:09.340]   Because what seems weird is to an outsider.
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:13.260]   What seems to be the most fantastic thing that we just walk right past, but someone who
[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:16.300]   did not grow up here did not grow up with all this environment in the city.
[01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:20.900]   I'm so my God, you've got you've got the stoplights in the third order.
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:21.900]   Why is the top?
[01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:23.060]   It should be in the middle.
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:24.060]   I think you'll.
[01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:25.060]   Bill Bryson is just hysterical.
[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:26.060]   I think you might.
[01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:27.060]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:28.060]   I've read plenty of his books.
[01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:31.220]   I have not gotten to that one yet, but yeah.
[01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:33.420]   Also an audible, of course, but that's the thing about audible.
[01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:36.220]   A great selection of books of all kinds.
[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:40.660]   In fact, one of the most fun things to do if you're an audible subscriber is to compare
[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:41.980]   with other audible listeners.
[01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:46.940]   I know when I get together, I have a number of friends like Andy who are big audible fans.
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:51.180]   And one of the first things we say is, oh, listen anything good lately?
[01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:52.180]   Anything wonderful?
[01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:55.100]   You know, remember we talked about pride and prejudice and zombies?
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:56.100]   Yeah.
[01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:57.100]   Yeah.
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:13:01.580]   There's now sense and sensibility and sea monsters.
[01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:03.020]   I guess it's the same guy.
[01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:05.300]   And this is another one of those audible productions.
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:09.060]   There's even a trailer for the book around it.
[01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:10.980]   I got it.
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:16.020]   Here they are walking through the English countryside.
[01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:20.740]   From quick classics, publisher of pride and prejudice and zombies.
[01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:24.580]   Oh, Mr. Willoughby.
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:25.940]   That comes a surprising utel.
[01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:29.460]   You know, Miss Dashwood, that I hold you in the highest regard.
[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:31.420]   As I hold you, Mr. Willoughby.
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:37.260]   And you know too that I am a sensible man and not easily swayed by emotion.
[01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:39.260]   And yet?
[01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:40.260]   Marianne.
[01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:41.260]   Yes, John.
[01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:44.260]   Marianne, there is something I must ask you.
[01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:45.260]   Yes, John.
[01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:48.260]   He's a matter of the highest personal importance.
[01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:49.260]   Pray ask it, John.
[01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:52.260]   When the god would go on with courage to say the words aloud.
[01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:54.260]   I shall find you not with me.
[01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:55.260]   Marianne.
[01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:56.260]   Yes.
[01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:57.260]   Uh oh.
[01:13:57.260 --> 01:13:58.260]   Did you hear something?
[01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:01.260]   I mean, the beating option.
[01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:04.700]   This is the first time I've ever seen a trailer for a book.
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:07.820]   You can find it at audible.com.
[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:10.620]   What could be in the water?
[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:13.380]   I want to think.
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:17.980]   Because it gets my mind thinking about how can we mash up some good stuff.
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:18.980]   They're doing that.
[01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:19.980]   What they're doing?
[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:20.980]   They're doing novel mashups now.
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:21.980]   It's awesome.
[01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:22.980]   I love it.
[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:23.980]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:27.420]   We thank them so much for their support of MacBreak Weekly.
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:30.820]   And folks, try them because you're going to love them.
[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:37.180]   I am sitting here watching Alex just go crazy wanting to show us his pick of the week.
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:40.380]   So I'm going to let Alex start because he's just jumping up and dangling.
[01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:42.380]   I have something that's not an iPhone app.
[01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:43.380]   It's not an iPhone app.
[01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:45.700]   So it's about time we give him a chance.
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:49.060]   So I have to thank the folks that were following me on Twitter when I was complaining about
[01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:50.060]   it.
[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:52.740]   They were listening to the show and then they were sending me stuff on Twitter.
[01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:57.380]   And what happened was that when the new laptops came out, I was pretty excited.
[01:14:57.380 --> 01:15:00.340]   I was pretty upset about the fact that there was no removable battery.
[01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:03.660]   The batteries are attached to it.
[01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:08.220]   And so I was just like, "Oh, this is the last laptop and blah, blah, blah."
[01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:12.580]   And because I have like four batteries for this one and I carry them around and I swap
[01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:15.460]   them out constantly on the road.
[01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:21.380]   So it was suggested to me to look at a product called HyperMac, which I have not only looked
[01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:22.820]   at but bought.
[01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:26.100]   And so this is what I got.
[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:28.300]   So it looks like I thought it was an external hard drive.
[01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:29.860]   It's an aluminum enclosure.
[01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:32.740]   It looks a lot like one of those less C external hard drives.
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:33.740]   That's the same size.
[01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:38.740]   So now what it has is it has a USB here.
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:39.740]   I speak of connector.
[01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:42.460]   So you can plug your iPhone or anything else that will charge USB.
[01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:43.460]   It has a USB charge.
[01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:45.740]   It has DC out and I'll show you that connector in a second.
[01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:47.980]   And then it has a charge so I can charge it in and I can push a little button to see
[01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:50.060]   how much batteries in it.
[01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:54.940]   And so now what this is, is this is rated and I haven't completely tested it yet and
[01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:58.220]   I use my computer a lot harder than the average computer.
[01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:01.740]   I have it on the fast graphics processor and I'm doing a lot of stuff.
[01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:07.260]   So it's rated, it says that for my laptop it should add about 17 hours of charge.
[01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:08.260]   I found it to be...
[01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:09.260]   17 hours.
[01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:12.660]   I found it closer to be for me about 11, which is still...
[01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:15.340]   But add to that you already got two hours in your...
[01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:16.340]   Right.
[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:19.060]   And so the thing is that I need to get this before my trip to Dubai.
[01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:22.700]   Well what I found was is instead of carrying around a bunch of little internal batteries,
[01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:26.860]   you know, that I'm trying to swap out internally and now it's not even possible.
[01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:27.860]   I can have an external one.
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:29.300]   Here's the other great thing about this.
[01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:34.140]   Is you charge it up, you can leave it in your hotel room or wherever you're at charging.
[01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:36.260]   So you don't have to be attached to your computer.
[01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:39.620]   The problem with the internal batteries is you had to be attached to the computer to
[01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:40.620]   keep it charging.
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:41.620]   Like, oh I gotta charge this up.
[01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:44.420]   Now I can be doing whatever I'm doing on my laptop, leave it in the hotel room, leave
[01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:48.780]   it in my house, leave it wherever in the office, let it be charging up while I'm doing whatever
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:53.420]   I'm doing and knowing that I always have this backup that I can use.
[01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:54.500]   Here's one problem.
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:56.540]   The MagSafe adapter is patented.
[01:16:56.540 --> 01:17:01.380]   So Apple has kind of kept us from using...
[01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:06.780]   There's a number of these including Woot was selling one for 99 bucks yesterday.
[01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:09.660]   The energy to go, this has a MagSafe adapter.
[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:10.660]   Yeah.
[01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:11.660]   So they must have licensed it from Apple.
[01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:12.660]   Yeah, so they have...
[01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:14.300]   So it plugs in into MagSafe adapter.
[01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:15.300]   That's great.
[01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:18.260]   And this little plug, it also comes...
[01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:20.020]   Right now I don't know whether this is a demo or not.
[01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:25.300]   When I bought it, it came also with a car charger that has the same DC in.
[01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:27.740]   So now you can plug your laptop into your car.
[01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:28.740]   That's off of your car.
[01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:30.460]   In your car and you have a MagSafe that plugs right into it.
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:32.140]   So it's a car adapter, it does the stuff.
[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:35.660]   And so now it's not...
[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:39.220]   This one costs that I bought, it costs about $400.
[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:43.780]   But when you look at the three batteries, three extra batteries, that's 300 bucks.
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:45.100]   Well that's about the same price.
[01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:47.700]   And so it didn't change.
[01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:54.580]   And what I found is that as I said, the way I was using it, I got about 11 hours of extra
[01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:55.900]   charge with it.
[01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:58.260]   I thought it was fantastic.
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:01.460]   I was very happy with it.
[01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:05.740]   And this really solves a lot of my travel things rather than having tons.
[01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:10.340]   And also this I'm hoping, and I'll know next week when I go to Brazil, that this will look
[01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:12.820]   less like a bomb than my...
[01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:13.820]   Well that's one of the...
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:16.300]   One of the problems is that sometimes...
[01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:19.020]   Well I found stacking three Mac batteries the wrong way.
[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:20.020]   They don't like that too much.
[01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:22.420]   You have to pay attention to which way your bag is going to go when you put it through
[01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:26.060]   the X-ray because if you stack them in a way that they're on top of each other, they're
[01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:27.780]   going to start tripping.
[01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:30.180]   And so this one I'm hoping is not going to look like that.
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:32.020]   And so we'll find out next week.
[01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:33.540]   It's going to be a little aren't you?
[01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:38.940]   From hyperdrive.com it's the HyperMac external MacBook battery.
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:42.860]   And once again, part of what really sold me on it too is that now on the road I can
[01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:45.300]   charge my iPhone, I can charge my Mac, I can charge...
[01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:48.380]   There's a lot of things I can charge and I have this kind of like little battery pack
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:51.580]   that I can keep around.
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:53.660]   So it's pretty nifty.
[01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:57.500]   And anything that takes a USB charge which is just about everything I have now.
[01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:58.500]   It's nice that this...
[01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:01.780]   Yeah, you could charge up your iPhone and your MacBook at the same time.
[01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:03.740]   Which is really nice.
[01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:05.220]   Yeah.
[01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:07.820]   A little pricey but it sounds like it would be kind of a good thing to have.
[01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:10.220]   For the amount of time it's the same...
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:16.020]   And now if I'm on a long flight I see myself being attached to one of these and not having
[01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:19.140]   to think about that battery all the way through a 10 hour flight.
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:23.260]   It supports both the 16 volt and the 18 volt.
[01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:24.820]   And it's 150 watts.
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:26.820]   So it's no minor...
[01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:30.300]   It's not going to do a slow charge.
[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:31.300]   It really will...
[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:32.820]   Well there's different models.
[01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:33.820]   Looks like...
[01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:34.820]   There are different models.
[01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:35.820]   So you can get a smaller one.
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:39.900]   If you just need a little watt hour, 100 watt hour, 150 watt hour which is when you have
[01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:43.020]   but there's even a 222 watt hour.
[01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:44.660]   And really what...
[01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:47.580]   The deciding factor about which one I got, I would have bought the biggest one that they
[01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:52.900]   had except for the fact that it had to fit in my Cotta bag.
[01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:53.900]   Like in the main...
[01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:57.980]   So I literally just measured it and this one just barely fits into my compartment.
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:19:58.980]   It's pretty heavy though.
[01:19:58.980 --> 01:20:00.660]   Well yeah, it's got a lot of battery.
[01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:01.660]   It's got a lot of battery.
[01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:02.660]   It's all a lithium in there.
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:08.380]   Yeah, and I think you could probably use it as probably I was going to say as body armor
[01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:10.940]   but it would probably blow up.
[01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:12.860]   You wouldn't die by bullet, you'd die by burning.
[01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:13.860]   Lithium explosion.
[01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:14.700]   Yeah, you know.
[01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:17.900]   The free car charger with...
[01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:19.140]   When you order now is what it says.
[01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:20.620]   So you do get a charge charger.
[01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:21.620]   And that's a special...
[01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:24.700]   And that charger costs $149 by itself.
[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:27.260]   And so when you buy one of the more expensive ones, I don't know what it cost them to make
[01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:28.260]   them.
[01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:29.260]   But the car charger is great.
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:30.540]   And so I'm leaving out in the car.
[01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:31.540]   Now I know that I can be...
[01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:32.540]   I can charge up.
[01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:33.540]   That's very handy.
[01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:34.540]   Yeah.
[01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:35.540]   Very handy.
[01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:38.740]   So I'm just going to tell you, just having 10, 12 hours with a power inside the house
[01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:39.740]   at all times.
[01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:43.540]   Yeah, you know, even if you don't travel, as Andy never leaves a house, he's in a
[01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:46.420]   gouraphobic but even if you never travel.
[01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:49.500]   I'm not in a gouraphobic, I just have no friends.
[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:50.500]   That's all.
[01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:53.420]   No, but that's a really good point because what you never know in the battery is going
[01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:54.420]   to go out.
[01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:55.420]   The power is going to go out.
[01:20:55.420 --> 01:20:56.420]   And this way you've got to...
[01:20:56.420 --> 01:20:59.300]   And this is, you know, for me this is a big experiment also for what we're going to
[01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:00.540]   do, you know, what we do in Africa.
[01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:04.100]   I've been able to charge this because you'll lose days, you know, sometimes.
[01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:06.900]   And being able to have these available, I think it's going to...
[01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:08.460]   You know, it's got some opportunity.
[01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:12.780]   I don't really need it for the trip to Dubai because of course I'm flying Emirates business
[01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:13.780]   class.
[01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:18.820]   I'm sure that some young woman dressed in a lovely gown will come with another battery.
[01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:19.820]   Should I need one?
[01:21:19.820 --> 01:21:21.380]   You know, they have the great...
[01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:23.700]   They have the little two prong connector in those Emirates business class.
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:24.700]   I have a feeling they might.
[01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:25.700]   It's very nice.
[01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:26.700]   Yeah, I can't wait.
[01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:29.620]   I only know because I walked by it, not that I actually saw.
[01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:32.740]   Somebody sent me a note and actually I feel kind of bad.
[01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:35.140]   I don't have a choice about this is...
[01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:36.940]   People are flying me out to speak.
[01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:40.260]   That's how they're flying me out because Emirates is the local airline, right?
[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:42.220]   You know, we got you whatever we know.
[01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:44.340]   But somebody said, "You don't really want to support these guys.
[01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:45.940]   You know, they're anti-gay and stuff like that."
[01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:48.100]   And I thought, "Well, I don't know."
[01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:49.100]   Emirates is angry, anti-gay?
[01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:54.860]   They said they won't hire gay, lesbian or transgender flight attendants.
[01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:56.620]   But I don't know if that's true or not.
[01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:58.220]   But even if it is, what do you think?
[01:21:58.220 --> 01:22:02.180]   Should I not go because of that?
[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:04.180]   Should I have a bicycle?
[01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:06.180]   I don't know what to do.
[01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:08.180]   I can't win.
[01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:12.140]   Every time I got a protest like that, I always...
[01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:15.220]   In my own head, I'm thinking, "Okay, so I won't fly.
[01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:18.940]   I won't fly on this airline and therefore..."
[01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:19.940]   Nothing.
[01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:21.900]   I need to know that something's gonna happen.
[01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:22.900]   I kind of don't want to...
[01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:23.900]   I understand that.
[01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:26.900]   If that's the case, I feel bad about that.
[01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:29.460]   Yeah, I don't know what to do.
[01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:34.100]   I'd like to say maybe that I'm expanding their horizons or something.
[01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:35.100]   Yeah.
[01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:39.060]   Well, I think we're in a good position though because I have been in sort of that vague
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:40.060]   position.
[01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:45.300]   But the settlement that I've come to with myself is that I'll ask somebody who works
[01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:46.300]   for the airline about that.
[01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:47.300]   Yeah.
[01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:48.300]   And then I'll be able to...
[01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:50.580]   Oh, well, I asked them about it and they said this and they seem to be very, very shifty
[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:51.580]   as they did it.
[01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:54.260]   And then I ask for a second free cocktail.
[01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:57.420]   Maybe I'll wear pumps when I get on board, see what happens.
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:00.180]   I got a lovely gown.
[01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:03.060]   Will Harris, I didn't warn you ahead of time that we do these picks, but I bet you have
[01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:05.700]   a pick, something that you'd like a lot from the...
[01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:09.300]   Well, I listen every week anyway, so I know all about this.
[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:10.300]   You knew.
[01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:11.300]   I knew.
[01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:12.300]   And you know what?
[01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:13.300]   I couldn't resist it.
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:18.420]   I just have to laud it over you all with my pick of the week, which is Spotify for the
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:20.420]   iPhone, which is...
[01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:21.420]   Yeah.
[01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:22.420]   ...vastard.
[01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:25.420]   Possibly the greatest app.
[01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:29.780]   This is where the UK, actually the UK and a number of other countries, get it back for
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:31.420]   us not offering everything.
[01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:32.420]   Yeah.
[01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:33.420]   Yeah.
[01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:34.420]   Absolutely.
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:37.340]   So I had someone I was tweeting about this day and somebody mentioned, you know, what
[01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:39.660]   is this thing of which you speak?
[01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:40.900]   And I said, right.
[01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:42.660]   Here's how you think of it.
[01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:48.260]   Think of it as like, Zoom Pass or Rhapsody, where you've got this huge library of music
[01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:51.900]   that's all available on demand anytime you can just pull it all down.
[01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:57.140]   And then imagine that it's free and you don't have to pay any pass.
[01:23:57.140 --> 01:23:58.740]   You have to pay £10 a month.
[01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:00.220]   You don't have to do anything.
[01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:04.860]   You can just download the client and you can get whatever you want.
[01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:08.780]   And it's been available on the desktop now for, I guess, a few months.
[01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:13.780]   And it's really kind of taken the UK certainly by storm because they've done deals with all
[01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:14.780]   the major labels.
[01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:18.740]   In fact, a lot of the major labels are investors in the company.
[01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:19.740]   That's what's interesting.
[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:25.180]   Because really the music industry is response to this to an anti-Apple play, right?
[01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:28.860]   So they've got all the music you possibly want.
[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:36.860]   I mean, one of my favourite tracks of all time is Red Head Girl by this obscure French
[01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:39.260]   electro pop band called Air.
[01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:41.700]   And you type Red Head Girl into Spotify.
[01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:42.700]   It pulls it straight up.
[01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:44.060]   You double click it and you play it.
[01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:49.220]   And you've got every single song that Air has published available on your desktop.
[01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:50.220]   So that's huge.
[01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:52.980]   But now they've just released the iPhone app.
[01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:58.220]   The iPhone app is free to download, but you have to have a premium Spotify account, which
[01:24:58.220 --> 01:25:00.220]   just means you get it without the ads.
[01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:06.860]   But you can now on the go queue up whatever music that you like into playlists.
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:12.100]   It will cache them locally on the iPhone so that if you're going in and out of signal,
[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:14.660]   you'll always have music to listen to.
[01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:20.940]   And it's basically pretty much every song that's commercially available on your iPhone, wherever
[01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:22.580]   you are for nothing.
[01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:25.700]   So I have a test for it for Spotify for you to check.
[01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:32.540]   I need to know whether it has APB missing you already.
[01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:38.420]   Released in the late 80s or loose released in 1986 by Link Records.
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:40.500]   That is my that's that's like my litmus test.
[01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:41.500]   Well, everybody's failed.
[01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:43.620]   Say the zoom store did not have redhead girl.
[01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:46.140]   So let me see if it has a APB.
[01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:50.140]   P B Spotify doesn't have APB.
[01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:55.220]   And what is the name of the song missing you already missing it looks like we do have APB,
[01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:58.020]   but let me see if it has missing you already.
[01:25:58.020 --> 01:25:59.260]   Does the iTunes have it?
[01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:00.980]   No, everybody failed so far.
[01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:01.980]   Oh, I choose.
[01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:02.980]   I love that.
[01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:04.300]   Oh, I can't find it.
[01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:05.300]   I'm not.
[01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:07.420]   Yeah, no, you should don't have to feel too bad.
[01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:09.300]   It's kind of hard to tell.
[01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:11.060]   You know, I heard it.
[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:15.020]   That's my like I know that it's gotten to everything when that's available.
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:17.100]   It was it was naturally released.
[01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:21.460]   It wasn't, you know, it was on alternative rock stations back in 1986.
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:23.220]   Something to believe it.
[01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:25.220]   No, but that isn't a APB song.
[01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:26.220]   Shoot you down.
[01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:27.220]   Talk to me.
[01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:28.740]   Alice Phil would love rainy day one day summer love.
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:29.740]   It has rainy day.
[01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:30.740]   He had rainy day.
[01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:31.740]   Yeah, that's on the zoom store.
[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:33.300]   You can just download that right now.
[01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:34.300]   Right.
[01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:35.300]   Today.
[01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:36.660]   So a Spotify more about Spotify will hear us.
[01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:38.020]   We didn't mean to hijack that.
[01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:39.020]   I didn't know.
[01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:42.500]   And how is the and how is the iPhone app?
[01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:43.980]   Is it cool?
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:45.580]   It's pretty nice.
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:49.820]   So you can create playlists on your computer.
[01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:51.780]   It syncs them up in the cloud.
[01:26:51.780 --> 01:26:55.700]   The playlists are then available on your iPhone if you just stream.
[01:26:55.700 --> 01:27:00.260]   It will also cash it if you tell it to it will cash those playlists locally.
[01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:03.340]   So that if you're going on a Metro and the brand or something, you'll still be able to
[01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:06.340]   listen to them.
[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:07.660]   And yeah.
[01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:08.660]   So it's pretty easy.
[01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:14.900]   The one downside about the iPhone app and it is a bit of a downside is that because of
[01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:21.180]   Apple's whole background processes thing, you can't listen to Spotify and like browse
[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:27.500]   the web or and play a game because it's an app in itself, which is a bit of a downside
[01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:32.460]   compared to the, you know, the iPod functionality on the iPhone where you can listen to that
[01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:34.220]   and be doing a whole bunch of other stuff.
[01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:35.220]   Right.
[01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:38.540]   Yeah, but if you just want to listen to music, if you want to have it, you know, what you're
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:44.420]   saying Andy about having every bit of music that you ever wanted in your car to plug straight
[01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:46.900]   into stereo and I'm in the mood for this, go and get it.
[01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:49.660]   You can just do that.
[01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:51.140]   And that's really pretty.
[01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:53.700]   Can you choose what you listen to?
[01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:55.460]   I mean, Pandora.
[01:27:55.460 --> 01:27:56.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:56.500 --> 01:28:00.500]   So it's not, it's not like Pandora where you can like choose one song and you can just,
[01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:02.700]   you know, you get stuff that's like that.
[01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:08.060]   It's literally like having everything on the iTunes store to just click and listen to whenever
[01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:09.620]   you want it.
[01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:13.740]   One of the negatives is that you can't do something else while you're listening to Spotify,
[01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:14.740]   though, right?
[01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:15.740]   Yeah.
[01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:20.420]   So on the, on the iPhone app, it, because it's an app, it won't run as a background process.
[01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:21.420]   Thank you.
[01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:22.420]   Apple.
[01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:28.620]   Yeah, which is a bit lame, but it, nevertheless, is, is incredible.
[01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:30.540]   It's one of those things where.
[01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:36.340]   Uh, I always think about, you know, the things, the things that you think are from the future
[01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:40.640]   and it really feels like it's something from the future because it's, you know, it's every
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:47.780]   song practically released that you can just go and get and listen to in seconds wherever
[01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:48.780]   you are.
[01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:55.980]   This is really their, their, their response to, uh, to the, you know, piracy and so forth.
[01:28:55.980 --> 01:29:00.900]   I imagine at some point it'll be available in the US just because this is what the record
[01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:03.500]   industry is, you know, hope to get you using.
[01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:07.140]   Apparently they are working on the US role.
[01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:09.140]   I can't understand why it's not here.
[01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:10.300]   It's pretty harsh.
[01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:12.980]   I mean, aren't these the same companies in the US that they are?
[01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:15.540]   I mean, yeah, I don't understand why it's not here.
[01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:17.140]   There must be some strategic reason.
[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:18.140]   There's strategic.
[01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:19.820]   Well, I think they want it to happen slowly too.
[01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:21.420]   And it isn't the same company.
[01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:25.420]   I mean, it's different, most different people, you know, and I think that there's, and there's
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:30.420]   a whole different set of contracts and so on and so forth.
[01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:33.860]   My pick of the week is poorly named.
[01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:35.940]   Thank you, by the way, Will, for Spotify.
[01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:37.140]   Fabulous pick of the week.
[01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:38.140]   Pleasure, pleasure.
[01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:39.540]   So jealous.
[01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:44.700]   My pick of the week is about the most, at least right now, poorly named product you could
[01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:48.500]   think of because of course, Acorn is getting a lot of attention to news.
[01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:53.420]   It has nothing to do with fundraising or prostitution in Chicago.
[01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:56.020]   It is an image editor, which we've recommended before.
[01:29:56.020 --> 01:30:00.100]   So I'm not telling anything new, but version 2.0 is out of Acorn.
[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:04.700]   So if you've purchased Acorn, you will have to pay 20 bucks to upgrade to 2.0.
[01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:10.260]   64-bit supports raw, but and it has the screen side.
[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:14.460]   I can't remember somebody recommended a screenshot program that did this, but now Acorn does
[01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:15.460]   it too.
[01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:18.580]   When it does a screenshot, every window is its own layer.
[01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:21.860]   So which is a great way to do screenshots.
[01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:24.420]   We've been talking about Pixelmator, which has also been updated.
[01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:28.980]   You might want to check out the new Pixelmator as an alternative to Photoshop.
[01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:32.100]   Acorn uses all the quartz effects.
[01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:38.740]   So it's kind of, I think Alex, you likened it to an interface to quartz on the Mac.
[01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:42.740]   It's a very handy little utility to have.
[01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:45.140]   Well, and I think that there's a huge opportunity here.
[01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:46.940]   Now I'm glad to see someone taking advantage of it.
[01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:53.460]   I think with Photoshop's price being what it is and the fact that Adobe chose to really
[01:30:53.460 --> 01:31:02.140]   tighten up all of its registration processes, there's a huge opportunity for smaller, a
[01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:06.700]   new way of thinking about doing a lot of this stuff at an affordable price.
[01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:10.500]   And I think Acorn and Pixelmator are the two leaders in trying to figure that out.
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:14.980]   I don't know if they figured it out completely yet, but I think for a lot of things, if you're
[01:31:14.980 --> 01:31:18.500]   cropping, doing basic operations and so on and so forth, this isn't going to replace
[01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:20.420]   Photoshop for a professional.
[01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:22.420]   But there's a lot of things you just don't need.
[01:31:22.420 --> 01:31:23.900]   The average person doesn't need in Photoshop.
[01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:28.660]   And for $49, one thing you will notice a lot of times with both Acorn and Pixelmator is
[01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:32.700]   that the performance oftentimes is far better than Photoshop for the things that they do
[01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:33.860]   because they're modern.
[01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:37.700]   It's a modern architecture.
[01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:39.340]   So it's using the OpenGL.
[01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:44.500]   It's using a lot of the things that allow it to just blaze through previews.
[01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:50.420]   It's not doing some of the same bucket operations that are being done by Photoshop, which would
[01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:53.740]   require a complete rewrite of Photoshop, which we probably won't see in our lifetime.
[01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:54.740]   All right.
[01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:55.820]   I use Acorn all the time.
[01:31:55.820 --> 01:32:01.420]   I bought the Acorn 1 and I will upgrade for $20 to Acorn 2.
[01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:04.340]   $49.95 if you haven't bought Acorn before.
[01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:05.340]   I'm flying.
[01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:08.580]   It's hard to find because if you do a Google for Acorn, all you get is all these news stories
[01:32:08.580 --> 01:32:10.700]   about the political Acorn.
[01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:13.260]   Well, the thing I'm really interested in is this improved screenshots.
[01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:14.260]   That's a whole reason to buy it.
[01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:15.260]   Isn't that sound great?
[01:32:15.260 --> 01:32:17.300]   I mean, that's something I want to tell.
[01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:18.300]   Wonderful.
[01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:20.500]   All the windows are different layers.
[01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:21.500]   So you can edit in the layers.
[01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:23.620]   I mean, what a great idea.
[01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:25.100]   It's from flyingmeat.com.
[01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:28.220]   Flyingmeat does great software in general, but I really like this company.
[01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:29.860]   But Acorn is one to look at.
[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:33.660]   They also the folks do voodoo pad, which I've recommended before, but if you haven't tried
[01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:34.660]   it, you must.
[01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:37.220]   And I don't know if fly sketch, that sounds interesting.
[01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:39.300]   And I'm going to have to take a look at that.
[01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:40.900]   It's a drawing tool.
[01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:45.540]   I have to sketching tool.
[01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:47.940]   Anyway, flyingmeat.com, Acorn.
[01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:53.740]   And now it's Andy and I'll go turn for his big, um, the week.
[01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:56.860]   Well, I haven't recommended a lame iPhone app in quite some time.
[01:32:56.860 --> 01:32:57.860]   So it's got time.
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:05.980]   Oh, I'm calling in my lame iPhone app for this week because I've found it's there are
[01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:10.700]   like millions and millions of lame little iPhone apps that you just don't buy just
[01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:15.860]   on principle because you only have 73 home screens to fill.
[01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:20.060]   And by every one of these lame little iPhone apps, you quickly run out of space for even
[01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:21.740]   the music player app.
[01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:30.940]   So that's why I spent 99 freaking cents, all of 99 cents on app box pro from E to E.
[01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:36.300]   The number two, and D design, E to N design.
[01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:40.660]   It's sort of like a child, like a baby's busy box of lame little iPhone apps.
[01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:45.300]   It has battery life, clinometer, currency, dashboard, day calculation, days and two flashlight,
[01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:50.180]   holidays, loan calculator, calculator, price grabber, random number generator, tip calculator,
[01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:55.140]   system info, sale, price finder, ruler, translator, unit translator and Google app
[01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:56.140]   launcher.
[01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:59.660]   So all for 99 cents, you will never have to.
[01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:04.220]   The only it only is missing one critical lame app, which I think was a very tasteful choice
[01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:09.140]   if they had that one popular lame iPhone app, of which that I'm not going to mention for
[01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:10.140]   taste.
[01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:12.140]   It's for ladies, right?
[01:34:12.140 --> 01:34:13.140]   It's for ladies.
[01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:14.980]   It's for the ladies piece.
[01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:15.980]   It's pink.
[01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:21.620]   But yeah, for 99 cents, I'm willing to support this with my consumer dollars.
[01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:25.980]   I would be willing to support this with my tax dollars because, you know, there's so there's
[01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:29.780]   so many people who are putting the, I know that just took a class this morning on how
[01:34:29.780 --> 01:34:34.180]   to build an iPhone app, but there's no reason why this tip calculator can't make $4.99
[01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:36.060]   I'll just put it on the app store.
[01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:37.060]   Yeah, right.
[01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:42.580]   So if all this does is ruin the market for all of these little apps that do one thing
[01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:47.380]   that don't do it in a creative and interesting way or useful way, I think that it's 99 cents
[01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:50.780]   I'm spending on social now for social engineering myself.
[01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:55.820]   Appbox Pro and special sale, 99 cents.
[01:34:55.820 --> 01:34:58.340]   I think it's a very popular application actually.
[01:34:58.340 --> 01:35:02.500]   Yeah, as a matter of fact, I hate to say it, but I found it last night looking for something
[01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:03.500]   else.
[01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:07.340]   It was just like the top rated the top selling paid app as of yesterday.
[01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:10.060]   So he so lead these these end to design.
[01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:13.860]   Well, hopefully they'll take all that money and come up with a better name for themselves.
[01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:14.860]   E second.
[01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:21.100]   See, that's that's you're allowed to do two two modifications to a standard word, one
[01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:22.100]   modification.
[01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:23.740]   It's second design.
[01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:26.740]   I could deal with that something that is the end design.
[01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:29.940]   I can deal with that, but E to design.
[01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:30.940]   No, no, I'm sorry.
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:32.940]   It's like a second design.
[01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:33.940]   See, right.
[01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:39.500]   I don't know what it is.
[01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:40.500]   And thank you, sir.
[01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:44.060]   I'm going to let you get back to playing with your zoom.
[01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:45.980]   I got it all charged up.
[01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:48.340]   I'm taking on its first drive this afternoon.
[01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:51.740]   Oh, I'm very I'm very happy with that.
[01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:54.140]   Baby's first drive.
[01:35:54.140 --> 01:36:00.060]   We're going to let you Mr. Will Harris go play with your Spotify, darn you.
[01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:02.060]   Will is going to enjoy it all the way.
[01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:07.300]   Will is the guy at channel flip channel flip.com, which is right now, I think the UK's number
[01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:11.460]   one IP TV provider by a long shot.
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:16.620]   And and thanks for helping Bobby Llewell and get carpool up there carpool with that I
[01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:18.260]   was in was last week.
[01:36:18.260 --> 01:36:19.260]   He said I did even better.
[01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:21.460]   He's been loving that he's been doing so well, doing.
[01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:24.500]   Yeah, he said I did even better than Stephen Fry's carpool.
[01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:25.660]   It's very happy.
[01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:28.460]   Yeah, you you I think have been the most popular.
[01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:30.860]   You know, big up the twist army.
[01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:31.860]   I don't know.
[01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:33.500]   Yeah, really it's the Twitter army.
[01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:34.500]   Thank you, Will for joining us.
[01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:36.780]   Always great to see you and happy birthday and happy anniversary.
[01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:40.860]   I've been trying to get will on on on Twitter and you know, it was his birthday.
[01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:42.340]   Then it was his anniversary.
[01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:49.660]   Yeah, that's on I will be around now Twitter.com slash will Harris one L. Thank you, Will.

[01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:06.580]   look for his review of the Zoom HD probably today, right?
[01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:07.580]   Probably tomorrow.
[01:37:07.580 --> 01:37:08.740]   I do my first drive around tonight.
[01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:10.380]   So probably up tomorrow afternoon.
[01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:11.380]   Great.

[01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:14.380]   Andy, always great to talk to you.
[01:37:14.380 --> 01:37:20.220]   Alex Lindsay, the man in charge at the pixel core pixel core dot TV for their great podcasts,
[01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:23.460]   including that whole snow leopard series talking about services and we got a lot of
[01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:24.700]   people were very excited about those.
[01:37:24.700 --> 01:37:26.700]   We're going to record some more people have been asking.
[01:37:26.700 --> 01:37:30.220]   Yeah, you know, Sal's off off the radar a little bit, but I think we have a couple that
[01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:31.220]   we want to do.
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:34.340]   But people have been super excited about them and it's just that's why we were so excited
[01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:35.340]   about snow leopard.
[01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:36.340]   Yeah.
[01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:37.860]   Yeah, really, really great.
[01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:41.140]   And of course pixel core.com if you're interested in that guild, a multimedia artist that he
