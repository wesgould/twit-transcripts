[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.480]   This is MacBrige Weekly, episode 25 for the week of January 15, 2007,
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.560]   recovering from the Mac world hangover.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:48.600]   Hey, everybody.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.120]   This is Alex, and we are back recovering, recovering,
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.400]   recovering from Macworld.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.960]   I'm here with John Foster.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.880]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.720]   Hey, and Merlin Mann.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.200]   Hello.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.960]   No one else could make it.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.920]   They were all recovering.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.840]   We had a-- if you guys didn't see the almost three hours
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.680]   of content that we put up last week,
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.760]   you can go to Twit.tv.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.840]   In Macworld, we were all over the place
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.400]   with lots and lots of cameras and lots of hosts and some new hosts.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.560]   And we actually let Merlin in front of a camera.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.080]   I don't think it went that badly.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.240]   I think it went great.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.280]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.040]   I got to talk to a lot of developers, which is fun.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.280]   I mean, so some--
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.200]   Kendra was covering-- Kendra covered iPod stuff
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.760]   and Justin covered, but accessories.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.800]   But yeah, it was fun.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.600]   I went out and talked to a bunch of developers,
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.040]   and it was a really-- it was an exciting week.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.200]   I had a lot of fun doing it.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.560]   It was a lot of fun putting it together.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.480]   And John, did you enjoy--
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.160]   I know my feet hurt at the end.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.960]   And it was-- well--
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.800]   I wore up a domino.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.600]   It was a lot of walking around.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.920]   Yeah, I got in good shape.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.560]   I wore up a domino, and I walked 20 miles in three days.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.120]   Did you really wear a domino?
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.640]   Yeah, I was-- yeah, on that guy.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.240]   I will say that the big disappointment was actually
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.560]   seeing an iPhone in person.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.880]   Really?
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.000]   Yeah, because you know what it looked like?
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.360]   The back of somebody's head.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.640]   No.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.120]   Well, no, no.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.600]   You're standing next to the crystal that looks like something
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.320]   out of Superman, and there's the artifact inside the spinny
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.600]   thing.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.560]   It needed to spin faster.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.880]   It needed to spin a bit faster.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.120]   But anyway, it looked-- I mean, you go up to the thing,
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.480]   and you're like, oh, this is going to be cool.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.760]   And then--
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.840]   That first day was incredible.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.920]   When you were--
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.720]   The people, the look-- actually, I put a photo on 43 folders
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.400]   that Duncan, David--
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.960]   Did you put it on the Mac break, Flickr?
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.160]   It's all asking me to feel uploaded.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.040]   But it's a tremendous photo of just these people transfixed.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.160]   And that's what it was like.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.200]   When they first let people into the expo right after the keynote,
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.600]   it was extraordinary.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.200]   Everybody made a B line for these two phones.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.080]   They're just there now.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.520]   They're looking at the iPhone.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.880]   That's why it looked like the back of somebody's head.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.040]   I think the security guard added a lot to that.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.640]   Right.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.920]   It was standing there, really going, these are mine.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.160]   You can't touch.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.960]   Don't even look at them.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.360]   So the iPhone has-- now the Steve's distortion field
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.200]   is starting to wear off.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.920]   When we saw it on Tuesday, we were
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.640]   ready to pay $10,000 for it right now, right here,
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.640]   ready to have it.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.040]   And now we've had some time to look at it.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.640]   We've had some time to talk about it.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.240]   And there's-- the first issue is that there's lawsuits.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.640]   So what I think is interesting about the lawsuits
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.720]   is that Steve was so out there about we have 200 patents
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.560]   and we're going to defend them.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.800]   And then, of course, other people
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.880]   start defending theirs related to the iPhone.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.560]   And so the first one up on the blocks is, of course, Cisco.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.120]   First, Apple says everything's fine.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.680]   And then a day later, Cisco's suing them.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.400]   What's that all about?
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.160]   Well, Cisco basically had this idea or actually not an idea.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.240]   But they had it on paper.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.720]   It's even in the US patent trademark database
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.880]   that they had the iPhone mark.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.880]   So here's the question, though, is that did they really
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.360]   have the idea or did they buy a company that bought
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.440]   a company that had the idea?
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.720]   Because the iPhone trademark was bought by somebody
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.360]   who was bought by info.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.720]   Now, I don't have it in front of me.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.880]   See, I made the guys put the laptop away now.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.120]   Well, the thing is, it really doesn't matter who they bought
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.760]   and what they got.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.520]   They got the asset of that.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.920]   The trademark got registered to Cisco.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.920]   And it's been sitting in their portfolio since 2001.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.520]   And there's rumors, I mean, a lot of rumors,
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.760]   there's speculation that it actually expired
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.880]   in the middle of 2006.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.960]   Well, the thing with the trademark is that in order
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.520]   for it to be upheld, in order for it to continue to work,
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.760]   is that the company has to be active in its trade.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.440]   They actually have to have stuff in the marketplace
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.760]   that's called that that people can buy.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.080]   They just can't sit on a mark.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.400]   And you can sit on a mark with the intent to use,
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.920]   but that goes away after--
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.440]   Five years.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.880]   Three years, five years, something like that.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.600]   So Vista really does need to get to market soon.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.360]   Maybe seven years.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.000]   But the point is that it came up at the end of 2005
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.640]   that it was running out.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.240]   They filed for an extension, which you can do
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.440]   for another six months, but it was still further out
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.640]   before they announced the iPhone.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.040]   And the iPhone that Cisco announced
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.320]   was literally a phone that they already make
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.920]   and they put a sticker on the box.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.320]   Well, it's basically their VoIP phone product.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.400]   Which is a really cool phone.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.600]   It's a NATO 211 base phone.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.440]   But it already existed.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.040]   I know.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.000]   Well, I mean, I've held one in my hand.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.520]   And you know what?
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.560]   When I bought it, it wasn't called an iPhone.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.560]   It was called something else.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.640]   And so they go, oh, we got to protect this.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.640]   They slap a sticker on it.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.120]   They call it an iPhone.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.880]   It's not an iPhone.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.800]   And people have pointed out that the iPhones--
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.320]   well, the quote unquote, Apple iPhones that we've seen so far
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.520]   do not have the word iPhone etched into them.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.240]   And I did talk to someone from Apple
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.320]   who will remain nameless.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.000]   It was on the floor.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.640]   And my response to what about the suit was mostly a shrug
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.960]   and go, well, change the name.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.120]   It's not about the name.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.620]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.800]   What do you think about that?
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.520]   It seems to me like it's not--
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.000]   Well, they could call it an iPod phone.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.360]   They could call it--
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.200]   What did I call it?
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.520]   --Podphone.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.680]   --a possum phone or something.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.720]   You remember a few weeks ago when we first, when this all first
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.760]   came up, I think it was Scott.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.280]   And I was saying, well, I knew all along.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.720]   It was never going to be the iPhone.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.440]   I don't think that.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.360]   I think he was just saying.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.860]   I know.
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.120]   He's not here to defend himself.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.600]   I'm not sure it really matters.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.200]   I think you know--
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.600]   What's getting people excited is not
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.840]   that they picked the right name.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.720]   What's getting them excited is all the theoretical features
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.000]   that we're going to see when we actually talk about it.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.920]   From the Mac world of vaporware.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.200]   You know, let's underline and put in bold the theoretical part
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.280]   of that statement.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.800]   So what do you mean by that?
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.640]   I mean that, OK, well, the first thing that I was excited about
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.960]   was that it has a browser in it called Safari.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.960]   Well, it turns out that Safari is not Safari is not Safari.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.760]   So when I hear the word Safari, I think WebKit, which
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.440]   means I'm going to have JavaScript, which means I'm
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.320]   going to have Flash, which means I'm going to have Java,
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.720]   which means I'm going to have a whole lot of specific functionality
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.320]   that's been defined by the Java--
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.600]   or excuse me-- by Safari in the Mac being what it is.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.440]   So if they call it Safari, then I'm
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.040]   kind of expecting it to support everything that Safari would--
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.840]   Support.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.360]   Right.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.360]   Safari does.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.760]   Yeah, and at the same time when I was sitting there in the Mac
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.760]   break nerd pit on Tuesday morning and they announced OS 10,
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.960]   a lot of us, of course, immediately maybe naively thought,
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.440]   OK, we're going to be able to take some version of applications
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.160]   that are available for OS 10 and run them on.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.400]   So some of the things that we are now aware that we're missing
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.320]   is A, you're not going to be able to develop applications
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.320]   for the iPhone.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.520]   Well, the word-- as I understand it, I mean, I
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.040]   want to be careful not to overstate this.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.760]   I think what I've heard said is that they
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.760]   are going to control whatever goes on there.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.260]   Right.
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.520]   So you have to work with Apple.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.960]   So Apple is going to be your distributor.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.080]   It's not going to be the Wild West.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.360]   It's not going to be the trio.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.520]   It's not going to be something where it's going to be like
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.960]   shareware 1990.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.480]   Right.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.440]   But if they call it OS 10, if they put the air quotes OS 10 on it,
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.880]   then you're kind of expecting to be able to do OS 10 things.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:03.800]   That means Xcode.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.520]   That means command line stuff.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.000]   That means--
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.360]   No, it's a smaller version.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.360]   It's a smaller version.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.400]   But here's the thing, is this good or bad for iPhone users?
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.160]   Well, this is the interesting part, because I mean,
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.640]   when I first started whining about the apparent inability
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.320]   to run independent third party apps,
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.240]   the retort from a lot of people was, oh, well, you know,
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.880]   all that slack is going to get picked up in the browser.
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.080]   And of course, you'll have this.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.680]   I mean, so I was slightly consoled by the idea
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.000]   that while I might not be able to have
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.680]   Omni-Outliner running on my phone,
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.240]   I would at least have the ability to run things like whatever
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.480]   stick it, backpack.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.720]   You name it, your favorite WYSI Ajax application,
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.440]   because that can be pretty robust.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.600]   And to be honest, it was exciting to think
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.440]   that you could see a lot of movement in the Web 2.0 space
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:47.960]   based on that.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.720]   Now, a lot of this--
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.200]   we still don't really know exactly what's going to come out.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.280]   But if what's just John's describing is correct,
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.720]   that is a karma suck.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.960]   It's a huge karma suck.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.880]   Besides, you know, like when you hear OS 10,
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.920]   you go, oh my gosh, I've got an Apache server in the background
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.120]   that I can run locally, which means that I can run Ruby apps,
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.480]   which means that I can run Perl apps, why would I want to,
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.160]   but I could, you know, those kind of things.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.800]   And so that's all in the background.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.760]   This is the key point is we don't even
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:21.240]   know if we can open a local HTML file for my shared space.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.800]   Like if I put it in hard drive mode, I'm pretty sure 100%.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.680]   No, I guarantee you won't be able to open that thing.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:28.880]   Right, because you can't--
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.200]   Not only do we not know, but developers.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:31.600]   Yeah, so far.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.600]   Well, they don't know.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:39.400]   Now Steve Jobs says that the issue is you don't want your phone
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.920]   to start crashing.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.400]   You know, people start developing for it.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.200]   The phone starts crashing.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.360]   People start-- they're not going to blame the developer who
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.440]   wrote some little applet.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.840]   They're going to blame Apple for their phone isn't stable.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.720]   What do you think of that?
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.600]   What is your answer to Steve?
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.120]   Well, I don't know enough about phone networks
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.440]   to speak intelligently about that.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.080]   But the two things that come to mind are, well, A, well,
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.960]   my trio works pretty fine for me.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.000]   And I'm not sure that any crashes that I've had
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.160]   are directly related to too many third party apps.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.480]   And second, well, then why don't we close up the Mac, too?
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.320]   You know, if you don't want to have people break your China,
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.240]   I guess you should always just maybe not even buy it.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.040]   Well, but it's different.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.840]   I think that people-- when your Mac crashes,
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.040]   one thing, when your phone is crashing and you're
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.400]   on the road and you can't--
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.320]   And I speak as someone who has had trouble with my trio.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.560]   Well, I get boot trouble.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.640]   So I can have my trio-- I mean, just distinguished.
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.560]   I don't get a lot of crashes.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.880]   I think when I get a bad piece of software,
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.440]   that's when you get a big boot problem.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.600]   And you got to do a hard reset.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.520]   But I mean, I don't know enough to know.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.240]   But that sounds a little bit like an excuse
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.360]   to cover up the fact that singular probably really doesn't--
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.600]   But if it is OS 10, then we know that--
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.560]   It's got protected memory.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.440]   It's got protected memory.
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:53.640]   And I think that I guess it seems
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.560]   that there is some sensitivity to--
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.640]   there's a couple of things that Apple has to protect.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.160]   Or we would think that Apple might
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:01.840]   be trying to protect.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:07.720]   Number one is they're protecting iTunes distribution.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:12.440]   So the thing is, is that right now, your iPod is locked to iTunes.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.560]   If anybody could develop any app for the iPhone,
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.360]   they could do a Rhapsody client or democracy.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.080]   Or, well, the democracy, you can move the stuff
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.120]   from democracy into iTunes and then you can watch it.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.800]   But the thing is, is that suddenly you
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.760]   could build an app that would interface with Napster Rhapsody,
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.800]   be able to theoretically play back Windows Media Files.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.800]   All those things on your iPod, it would open the iPod up.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.080]   For that, secondly, you'd be able to bypass a lot of the stuff
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.000]   that singular would prefer you not to be doing.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.840]   Well, maybe that's a reason right there to not embrace this device.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.080]   And one quickie, I think--
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.320]   But are you not going to embrace this device?
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:47.800]   I don't know.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.560]   I mean, here's the thing.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.080]   If I'm going to talk about it--
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.080]   It's hard to know until we can really--
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.400]   So the problem is, we're all sitting here
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.200]   trying to like read the tea leaves.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.760]   And there's some things that we know--
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:57.760]   it's not what Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.000]   There's some things we know here.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.360]   And there's a lot of unknown unknowns too.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.800]   And so personally, I'm out of the Prognostication business.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.880]   I'm going to stop guessing and wait until this stuff actually
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.080]   starts approaching what's going to hit the market.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.280]   I mean, we can get ourselves into a Tizzy about all this stuff.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.880]   But until it comes out, there's no way to know.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:16.640]   So maybe we shouldn't even talk about this until one is melting in our hands.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.920]   Well, one thing we do know, or I think what John knows,
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.160]   is what are we looking at for a data package on Unsingular right now?
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.920]   Assuming we can do this whizzy stuff.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.760]   It's expensive.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.200]   I'm not going to-- I have no interest in using the data package,
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.760]   except for extreme emergencies.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.320]   The big thing is, is that I think what I'm excited about
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.960]   is that a lot of the forward thinking cities are now starting
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.360]   to open up Wi-Fi through the entire--
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.160]   here in San Francisco by the end of this year
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.000]   is what we're promised, is that we're
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.960]   going to be able to have wireless, free wireless
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.120]   throughout the entire city.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.240]   Provided by Google?
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.480]   Provided by EarthLink/Google/thecity.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.000]   Technically, the city is just simply providing access
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.640]   to light poles from Google to put it up in the agreement.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.200]   So what the point is, is that means
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.640]   that anywhere in San Francisco, you're
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.760]   going to be able to open up your iPhone,
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.360]   and you're going to get really fast speeds,
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.760]   and you're not going to be using singular to do it.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.280]   Now, that's not going to work everywhere,
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.920]   and that may or may not be to the singular's advantage.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.040]   It probably is because we get used to using it all,
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.360]   and then we go out of that area, and we still use it because--
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.880]   You go home for Christmas, and you want that data package.
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.400]   Well, holy.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.400]   Well, this brings up the next thing,
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.320]   which is that the huge missing app, as far as I'm concerned,
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.920]   is the VoIP client.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.280]   Well, I wouldn't hold your breath for that.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.000]   Yeah, OK.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.560]   Well, holding my breath till June would just not work.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.680]   Well, I think that not only do we not know all the details
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.960]   between now and the next six months,
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.320]   we also don't know all the details
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.400]   between now and the next two years.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.400]   Apple did not have--
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.600]   Apple 1.1.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.280]   Apple had to bend over backwards to get the record companies
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.920]   to work with them for iTunes, and now they have their--
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.520]   you know, Kohonas and a vice.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.640]   You know, and that's the thing.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.760]   You sell-- Apple sells 30 million iPods,
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.360]   and there's a whole lot of firmware upgrades
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.520]   that can go on two years down the road
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.040]   that can change the reality very quickly.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.840]   Well, I thought that the number that Steve gave in the Steve
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.760]   note was really low, saying that they were going to sell
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.600]   10 million phones in 2008.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.680]   I'm like, that's it.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.400]   Well, it's better to be--
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.520]   it's better to underguess than it.
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.080]   Yeah, I mean, that's way underguess.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.520]   The Apple will sell as many iPhones as they can make.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.760]   OK, so last thing, Quick Pull.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.640]   Did you feel like after the reality storage field was
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.440]   starting to fade away?
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.000]   Did you really feel like, like me,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.160]   that you had filled in a lot of dots,
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.720]   the airspace between the dots on your own?
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.720]   I think that we have this imagination.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.480]   I realize how much I had gone.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.880]   Well, you know, actually, he didn't say that.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.840]   I just assumed that's what he meant.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.600]   It was so Wizard of Oz.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.760]   I think that you-- we all have this imaginary phone
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.800]   in our head of what we really want.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.160]   Apple took us about 80% towards that phone.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.200]   Theoretically.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.640]   I mean, from what they've actually said,
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.600]   that's 80% of what a lot of us would want.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.680]   And most of us in our own special way
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.120]   added another 20%-- the other 20% going.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.680]   And that would be the other phones
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:03.080]   that we've had up until now got to 40% or 50% at best.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.720]   And for many of us, 20% or 30% of what we want.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.080]   And so that's the-- you know, and singular
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.360]   has proven that it will do exactly what the phone companies do,
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.040]   which is a lot of the dumbing down
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.400]   that we're getting some of its Apple,
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.320]   but I bet you a lot of it singular.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.000]   And that's going to be until Apple has market share,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.520]   market power.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.240]   I think that that one's going to be a hard one to get around.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.840]   I think hackers are going to have a lot of fun with it.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.720]   And I'll probably hack my phone to VoIP, like in a heartbeat.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.120]   I bet you it won't take very long before people are hacking up
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.160]   the hacking and VoIP access.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.000]   It should be noted that I still don't have a phone.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.520]   There you go.
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.120]   You could tell because you couldn't get in the building.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.200]   And since John doesn't have a phone,
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:39.800]   I don't have a TV.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.640]   Let's talk about Apple TV.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.320]   So once again, Distortion Field starting to wear off.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.480]   This is our hangover for Macworld.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.320]   So we were all excited last week.
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.240]   This week clears.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.520]   The fog is starting to clear.
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.760]   We want to eat our arm off now.
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:56.640]   I've been pretty meh about this from the time I heard about it.
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.320]   Really?
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:57.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.040]   John?
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.280]   Apple TV.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.840]   What do you think about Apple TV?
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:06.720]   You know, I still say that the Mac Mini is like the bomb
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.880]   when it comes to hanging on the back of a TV.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:09.520]   Twice as much.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.200]   Twice as much.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.240]   But does a lot more.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:13.880]   You have the ID.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.760]   You have a firewire port on it.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.560]   You've got--
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.520]   And I think that makes sense.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.080]   That makes sense for a geek.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.920]   But does it make sense for our mom and dad?
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.000]   Yeah, actually it does.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.960]   Because here's the thing.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.320]   You have the ability to put all different kinds of media
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.320]   types on that Mac.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:35.160]   Not just MPEG-4 formatted movies.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.320]   But do my parents care?
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:36.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.800]   I don't think they do.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:38.600]   Because no, they do care.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.520]   I don't think they do.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:43.320]   But they want to know, I think the target audience for this
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.880]   is people using iTunes.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.520]   Literally, we're geeks.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.880]   We want to use all this different stuff.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.160]   We want to do all this other stuff.
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.880]   But I think that the target audience for this is people
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.680]   who like to buy their songs.
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:58.320]   It's the guy who spent 10,000 songs on iTunes.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.000]   You almost have me sold on this.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.360]   We were talking about this before the show.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.120]   And you've almost got me sold on that idea.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.760]   I'm still mulling that over.
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.680]   Because to me, the devil is in the details
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.720]   with how long it takes to push your movies out and stuff
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:10.320]   like that.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.080]   It is 8.2.11G, or N, rather.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.000]   So it is--
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:14.440]   I'll fastly--
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.800]   --8.2.11N.
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.360]   Pretty fast, apparently.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:17.920]   100 and 10.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.800]   Five times faster than G. Is that--
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:20.680]   110 megabits?
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.280]   110.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.720]   It's basically 2X.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.120]   So we can move 20 megabytes.
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:24.560]   OK.
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.800]   You can move 20 megabytes a second.
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.400]   That's right.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.400]   Approximately.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.680]   Oh, I'm shooting high.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.080]   Well, because it's 15.
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:31.600]   Because the--
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.160]   Let's say 10.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.120]   Because G is 54 megabits.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:34.640]   Right.
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.720]   And--
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.400]   So just kind of put this in perspective.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.280]   Let's say 15 megabytes a second.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:45.200]   Most of what you're going to watch, a 1280 by 720,
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.400]   is going to be probably running in the best five.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:55.960]   So it's loading twice as fast to it as you are watching it.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:56.760]   Theoretically.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:57.400]   Theoretically.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.320]   But what makes up for that is a buffer.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:00.820]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:01.800]   So it's like quick time.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:02.560]   You start watching it.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:03.960]   Seconds.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.440]   My guarantee that I-- I-- TV with a buffer will be able to--
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.920]   you'll be able to watch an HD feed 10 seconds, 30 seconds
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.440]   after you hit it.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.400]   So the reason that you've almost got me convinced of this--
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.080]   and I still-- again, I--
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.120]   my marker for all this now is I actually
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.360]   want to actually see it in use.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.000]   But the reason you've almost got me sold on it
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.880]   is because of the thin end of the wedge argument.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.200]   And we always see the notional dumb parents.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.200]   But I mean, it could be anybody.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.000]   It could be me.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.560]   I've got-- I'm one of those people who's now heavily
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.520]   invested in iTunes.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.520]   And I bought-- so we've got a season pass for 30 Rock.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.200]   And we've got a season pass for Battle Star, Black.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:35.720]   What is it now?
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.800]   There's two billion reasons why people
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.840]   are going to use iTunes.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.560]   Well, you know, the thing is they do have you.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.520]   They do have you buy the media.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.920]   And the ability to have an easy way to hook that up
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.080]   and have it just work is pretty enticing.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.840]   So again, because I am officially, as of this week,
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.120]   out of the prognostication business,
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.840]   I will wait to see what it actually looks like.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.960]   One thing for me-- I don't want to call it a deal killer.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:00.240]   But some of the Creative Commons content that I download
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.520]   from the internet is Divx encoded.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.600]   And it's my understanding that you cannot run
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.320]   Divx on this, John.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.640]   It was just not play on the apps.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.360]   So if you've got some AVIs that you've pulled down
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.320]   off the internet, you're not going to be able to stream these.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.040]   Well, not instantly.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.800]   But if you're pulling the AVIs off the internet,
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.040]   you're probably tech savvy enough
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.240]   to know how to convert them to a quick time.
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.400]   In which case, do I want to spend this much money on a box
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.720]   when I could go roll my own?
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.240]   Right.
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.520]   Well, or you can, like I said, you can use a Mac mini
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.840]   or the net gear thing.
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.360]   Or an old Mac or old Mac?
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.840]   And there's other boxes.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.360]   Cisco's--
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.640]   But I mean, we can't put both sides and stuff on this.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.280]   If you're a geek and you want to hack stuff in,
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.280]   there's going to be other boxes for you.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.280]   iTunes Play's MP3s, right?
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:35.800]   That's the thing.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.320]   Play's MP3s.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.320]   And play it across the ITV.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.160]   But you see my analogy here.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.760]   But it won't do this thing apparently.
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.360]   It's not going to play Divx AVIs.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.320]   So I mean, I think that's--
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:46.800]   I don't know.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.040]   I don't know.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.720]   That's probably not going to be a deal killer
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.840]   for our fake dumb parents that we've made up.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.200]   But I think it's a little bit of a bummer for that whatever
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.800]   percentage that would go, OK, for me, this is--
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.000]   I'll just say for me and a lot of my dorky friends,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.280]   that would be the last mile.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.800]   But I think that I think Apple doesn't--
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:03.360]   Not an issue.
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.680]   I don't think they care.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.080]   We don't know.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.400]   I mean, without actually seeing it, seriously.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.040]   Hey, welcome back to this week in vaporware.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.840]   Well, to the--
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.240]   What did they actually-- just not-- is there anything--
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.280]   what did they put out that we can hold in our hands?
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.280]   At the shop?
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:19.000]   Oh, they released an airport extreme.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:19.560]   No, they didn't.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.280]   No, we can't get one yet.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.480]   We can't get one yet.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:22.840]   But--
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.560]   See, we're talking about nothing.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.240]   It's kind of like my friend's show.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.400]   It's this week in vaporware.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.400]   It's Twiv--
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:34.400]   I got to tell you, though, I am kind of excited about the airport
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.040]   extreme.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.680]   This is the weird little funny Trojan horse product
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.640]   that I think needs a little bit more attention.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.280]   Why are you so excited about this?
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.440]   You got to get-- we walked in in Merlin.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.600]   He was literally hopping on one of my talking about this.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.440]   Well, you know what it is?
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:51.320]   First of all, after all, after Steve's stun ray finally
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.480]   wore off after a few days, I started
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.560]   to read a little bit more about this.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.200]   And it is kind of funny.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.840]   They really snuck this in somewhat under the radar screen.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.480]   Now, this is not going to be for everybody.
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.440]   You've got-- for example, at home right now,
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.520]   I've got a WRT54G, which is the canonical awesome
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.520]   Linksys hackable router, which I love.
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.520]   You have it?
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.960]   Yeah, I just got to say I soft.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.520]   I've got better firmware running on it.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.360]   For those of you who need a router to English dictionary,
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.800]   that's just a way of adding some extra functionality
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.760]   to your router.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.400]   It basically runs on Linux, and you just change the firmware
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.560]   to let it do lots of great stuff.
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.160]   Anyhow, and that's mostly been fine for me.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.000]   But if I want to share a printer,
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.360]   if I want to print around my network,
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.160]   I've got an airport express for that.
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.360]   So if I want to extend that network,
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.280]   I've got to buy all this stuff.
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.920]   So for me, if you are--
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.440]   I've held off buying the airport extreme previously,
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.280]   because meh, right?
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.480]   I mean, it's just a lot more money
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:45.040]   for what the Linksys does for what now, like $60, $80.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.680]   I-- what is it?
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.880]   $179?
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.040]   $179?
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.480]   I'm very attracted at the idea--
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.240]   What are the features?
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.760]   Well, a few things.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.440]   First of all, it's by Apple, which
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.200]   means that my now, as of tonight, five airport expresses
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.800]   should work seamlessly with it.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.320]   When they don't right now with the other--
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.280]   Well, there's a little bit of hackery involved,
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.040]   especially if you want to get--
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.080]   remind me the name of it--
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.640]   WPA.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.000]   WPA.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.960]   Getting WPA running is a little bit over Merlin's head.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.840]   And so right now, yeah, I know.
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:13.320]   Well, I'm not--
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:14.960]   I paid the squint.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.720]   You see, this is why you need to come to my house
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.960]   and fix me.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:18.480]   OK.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.960]   And also-- but OK, so what are the features
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:20.560]   that I love about this?
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.880]   It's got three ethernet ports on the back.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.320]   So you can run straight into--
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.120]   run your Mac.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.840]   So you can have three Macs running just
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.680]   into the airport.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:28.840]   Just hardware, just running from--
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.120]   Well, one of them has to be going to the internet.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.120]   It goes to the router.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.440]   Yeah, but that's a separate port, right?
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.160]   That's a separate port.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.240]   So you have three out.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.520]   You have three RJ45s, so what are they?
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.800]   Yeah, they're RJ45s.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.840]   Three RJ45s.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.800]   You've got a USB-- now, here's where the sexy comes.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.840]   You've got a USB 2 port.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.920]   That, you can plug-- guess what?
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.200]   Go back to four episodes ago.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.200]   Plug.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:52.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.720]   Because that can time.
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:54.800]   You can put your position.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:55.400]   No.
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.440]   You can totally plug a big S drive into it.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.480]   So you can have a network.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.240]   It's got built-in.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.800]   You can have an NAS drive, basically,
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.600]   hanging right off your router.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.320]   It gets better.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:09.040]   You can also plug in a multi-unit hub,
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.640]   and you can run several hard drives off it.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.120]   And apparently, theoretically, it's
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.760]   got very granular control over who can do what with what.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.920]   So think about the Apple server days, Apple file server days.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:19.640]   And that's the idea.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.080]   So I guess I like this because this,
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.800]   without getting into the amount of frippery
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.760]   that John's going to get into with his home-baked NAS--
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.360]   Frankenmacked--
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.200]   Time sink.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.200]   --do more.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.240]   I like the-- that's a price point that I can handle
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.480]   for rigging all this stuff up and having a big S--
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.520]   one terabyte or two terabyte drive on my system.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.120]   Well, this has been something that Apple's
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.600]   needed in the product line since forever, which
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:47.360]   is something that is a home server, where you can easily
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.720]   have one drive being shared amongst everybody--
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.520]   four pictures, photos.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.040]   Back up.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.280]   Wait, that's the same thing.
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.720]   I like to keep my images, my pictures and my photos
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.720]   on a different drive.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.480]   But is this something you think Microsoft has done well?
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.120]   No.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.800]   But it's absolutely a necessity.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.360]   We've gone over this again and again,
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.920]   the need for backup today, and the need for automated backup
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.080]   that you don't have to think about.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.560]   You want to-- I want to quit filling up these 250 giga-giggles
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.120]   C-draws.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.760]   I want some kind of one-stop solution.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:17.640]   Well, the thing is--
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.160]   --read the single spin.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.200]   --read, is that what I need?
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:20.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:21.240]   No, I know.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.240]   The single--
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:27.280]   We go through probably three to four hard--
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:31.240]   we go through three to four raw drives a week.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.600]   They literally just plugged in the raw drive.
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:34.640]   We used the Weeba tech.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.080]   You've seen the Weeba tech.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:36.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.200]   We did a little-- you just hook it up to the port,
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.360]   and it's like its own little--
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.480]   So you take the raw drive and you hook it into this little
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.320]   Weeba tech interface.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.360]   So this is the thing where you've got just literally
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:47.400]   like an internal, like an IDE drive, sitting there naked.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:47.920]   Naked.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:48.920]   You can see them out there.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.960]   There's the places they were shipping.
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.280]   So we just store them in the plastic cases they came in.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.880]   There's stacks of them.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.080]   And but that's our backup.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:57.920]   We label them.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.200]   We put them in a database, and we know where they're at.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.440]   And someone asked me this morning,
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.080]   like, where are we going to store all the DV tapes?
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.520]   Because we've got DV tapes everywhere.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.840]   And we need to organize them.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.240]   I said, I'll tell you where we're going to store them.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.600]   We're going to store them on a hard drive.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.600]   We're going to digitize them all.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.840]   It's easier for me to digitize them all and do a hard drive
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.800]   than it is to keep the tapes.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.320]   Well, I'm just going to chime in here
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.840]   and say that a single spindle drive--
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.600]   is not the most reliable thing.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.000]   So you think get a RAID 5?
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.880]   I think that the forward thinking is RAID 5.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.080]   You've been a little more getting in front or a little more.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.600]   We have a couple of those, too.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.840]   But the idea is that if you have things that are memories
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.480]   or things that are very important to you--
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.000]   No, we don't do this for things that are important.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.400]   These are things that are like--
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.120]   We better keep it.
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.240]   Sorry, this is a production problem.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.880]   So for the kids at home that are saving their home
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:51.360]   movies of their kids for the next 10 years or lifetime,
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.480]   single spindle drives are not the way to go.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.080]   I really think that the future--
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.680]   and I really thought about this when
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.680]   we were talking about ZFS the other--
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.920]   Was that what we can--
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:01.440]   Media.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:05.840]   This week in Media, we went into a 15-minute--
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.040]   incredibly deep and confusing.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:08.560]   Rattle.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.560]   Well, it was one of those things that John and Candy
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.480]   started talking about--
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.040]   I stopped talking about it.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:14.760]   I just stopped talking.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.040]   I just listened because I had no idea
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.040]   what it was like in a row.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.800]   Discovering the cave full of crystals.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.760]   But one of the things that I'm really looking forward to
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.280]   is this idea.
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.600]   I have an idea.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.480]   I have a dream.
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.040]   And the dream is that I just keep a whole bunch of stuff
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.360]   on a big storage system.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.320]   And I'm constantly taking the old drives out
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.920]   and putting the new drives in.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.960]   And the data is just-- it's kind of like a RAID 5.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.680]   It's just migrating forward to the new media.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.040]   So I'm not-- I just have terabytes of information
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.640]   that's sitting there and we just kind of
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.240]   hoax it forward to get rid of the old drives.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.480]   So anything else that was--
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.920]   I just think it's got some sexy.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.640]   I'm going to be anxious to see when it comes out.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.760]   I'm thinking I'll give it a spin.
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.520]   Well, one thing to remember is that you're not
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:00.200]   going to retire your old network.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.920]   You're going to turn it to G. Your airport extremes.
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:07.480]   They're going to be turned to-- you'll turn B off and say G only.
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.320]   I don't know if you want to turn B off.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.640]   You don't want to turn B. So then you keep one airport around.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.400]   It's only B.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:13.900]   All I see.
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:14.400]   Right.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:19.000]   And the idea is is that 802.11 slow or gracefully degrades.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.960]   So if you have one B thing on your network,
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:26.160]   then everything talks B. So you lose all the speed advantage.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.920]   So that means N goes away.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.080]   So you want to have something that's just one.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.480]   OK, you're so coming to my house next week.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:37.480]   Pick so the week.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.800]   Merlin.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:43.160]   Well, I have a friend from college named Aaron Hilliguss
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.120]   who has a really cool company.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.920]   He teaches people how to do cocoa programming at Big Nerd Ranch.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.000]   And he occasionally puts out little pieces of software.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.560]   He just puts something out that I like a lot called--
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.200]   I'm not allowed to have my computer open.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.120]   What's it called?
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.560]   It's called Page Packer.
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:02.400]   And that sounds really bad.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.040]   You know what?
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.120]   I'm not saying anything that you could use against me.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.080]   Page Packer is an excellent little cocoa wrap.
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:07.920]   And here's what it does.
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.320]   You guys might remember that if you're
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.320]   fans of 43 folders--
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.480]   hi, Mom-- you have seen the Pocket Mod, which
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.040]   is this great little flash app where you can go and build
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:21.280]   your own little one page foldable booklet full of little pages.
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.600]   So what Aaron has done is he's taken the idea of the Pocket Mod
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.800]   and combined it with Douglas Johnston's DIY planner.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.680]   This is probably all nonsense for you guys who are not
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.760]   in the hipster PDA culture.
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.400]   But suffice to say, you can have this very robust way
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:37.560]   to build your own little portable one page foldable booklet
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.280]   full of really cool on-the-go paper templates.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.680]   We fold it in eight little pieces.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.840]   It turns into a little booklet.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.120]   And so Page Packer is a really simple way to do that.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:46.760]   Drag and drop.
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:47.560]   Very easy to do.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.880]   You're pretty not your good to go.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:49.600]   OK, so I was--
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.360]   --the big nerd ranch.com.
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:54.160]   I was-- when you started, I was like, whatever.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.320]   It's just one of my old things.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.760]   I'm going to go check my email.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:00.600]   Yeah, if I was allowed to have my computer open,
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.160]   I'd be checking it.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.520]   But I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.360]   And then suddenly I realized what I could use it for.
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.480]   Because I do the same thing, but in a much more
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.000]   rough way, which is when I go traveling.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.040]   When I have long trips, not when I do little trips
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.760]   to Toronto or whatever, but when I have long trips,
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.080]   I take my entire itinerary, all the contact information,
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.160]   all of the--
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.560]   I take all the contact, my approval codes, my rental codes,
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:22.920]   the addresses, phone numbers.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.920]   I have this long list of every phone number of every person
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.600]   I'm supposed to talk to over the next three weeks
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.000]   while I'm on--
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.680]   and I put it all-- I make it all six point.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.880]   And I print it all in this one long line.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.440]   And then I fold it up and I put it in my wallet.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.440]   And that is my--
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.320]   I call it my analog trio.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.320]   You know, I just--
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.800]   Absolutely.
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:40.800]   His is way better.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.080]   Well, what's neat about it is also
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.880]   uses this really cool little method where--
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.480]   which I guess is kind of obvious to people who thought about it.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.720]   But you can take a piece of paper,
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.800]   fold it into eight pieces, make a single cut,
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.040]   and it turns into a booklet.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:51.840]   It's really cool.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.840]   It's awesome.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:53.840]   It's pretty neat.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:54.840]   So if you haven't seen a checkout pocket--
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:55.840]   I'm on my pocket.
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:56.360]   No, it's free.
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:57.360]   It's free-cookle up.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.360]   You know what the cool thing about--
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.040]   If it's not called Page Packer, Aaron, I'm really sorry.
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.880]   Aaron played sax in a band that I was in in college.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:02.880]   So how funny is it?
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:03.880]   You know what's cool about Page Packer?
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:09.440]   You can drag stuff from the cartoon program, Icomic, and--
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.440]   Make your own comics.
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.440]   Make your own comic that's squished.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.440]   Oh, that is sharp.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.440]   Isn't that cool?
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.440]   That's my pick.
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.440]   All right.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.440]   John.
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.640]   John has a piece of paper.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.640]   He's consulting.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.640]   Dash code.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.640]   Oh.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:28.960]   Now I talked about this a little bit at the party when we were drinking beers and changed
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.360]   my mind and then tried to say "Scrivener."
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.320]   Hardest-to-scrivener after all beers.
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.400]   Which is not my pick this week, but Dash code is.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.640]   I got to actually spend some time with it.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.640]   You made a dash.
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:42.640]   What is Dash code?
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.080]   Well, Dash code is a beta tool from Apple.
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.240]   It's from the Apple developer connection.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.000]   How do you become an Apple developer?
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.160]   And you down--
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.160]   Spanking machine.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.760]   It was for the Apple--
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.760]   Apple spanking machine.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.280]   And it lets you make dashboards.
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:59.280]   But you don't have--
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.280]   Do we have developer?
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.280]   You don't technically have to pay for anything.
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.280]   No, you don't have to pay for anything.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.960]   You just have to give up some information, your name, address, telephone number.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:05.960]   This is the $500.
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:06.960]   No, no, the free thing.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:07.960]   Right?
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:11.440]   So anybody can do this, but you have to go and actually make an account on the Apple
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.040]   developer site.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:20.520]   And then once you get there, then you can see stuff like documentation for the Macs,
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.920]   like the iPod connector, that kind of stuff.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.200]   I mean, it's pretty technical.
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.520]   Anyway, but this is not.
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:37.120]   The idea is that with dashcode, you can make countdown, RSS, podcast, photo cast, a daily
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:41.840]   feed, a gauge, like a speed gauge or something like that.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.280]   But the coolest thing is quartz composer.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.240]   So you can put quartz composer stuff in that--
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.240]   Quartz composer.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.680]   What's an example of how you use that?
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:55.800]   OK, so for example, my birthday party is coming up February 6th at a clock either.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:56.800]   Subtle.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:57.800]   Yes, subtle.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:01.760]   Anybody who's listening can come to the party.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.760]   Where is it?
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:03.760]   I'm not telling.
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:04.760]   I'm going to guess zeitgeist.
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:07.440]   Yeah, it's probably going to be a zeitgeist.
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.440]   It's going to be a--
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.440]   Which is kind of a relief on it.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.440]   See, built your own--
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:14.400]   So I built my own countdown timer and it took me all of 10 minutes at the very most.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.400]   How much code did you have to write?
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.400]   I had to write no code.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.400]   No code?
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.400]   Is it a Wig?
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.400]   No code?
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:20.400]   It's a Wig.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.920]   So the thing is if you can drag graphics into it for your foreground and your background,
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.400]   all the other stuff, you can put text in it.
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.160]   And you can have an RSS reader?
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.840]   And you can make an RSS reader in about the same amount of time.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:35.320]   All you have to do is draw the-- you basically drag and drop.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:45.080]   So you draw a scroll box for text and then you aim the feed into that define the type.
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.320]   That's kind of like HyperCard.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:47.320]   A little bit.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.320]   Kind of like HyperCard.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.200]   But that's not HyperCard.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.960]   So a lot of the code is generated for you.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:57.240]   And you can go in-- so there's a bunch of stuff in it that's amazing.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:01.560]   One of my biggest problems when I was trying to develop widgets last year, or dashboards,
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:02.560]   what do they call them?
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:03.560]   Dashboard widgets.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:04.560]   Dashboard widgets.
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.480]   Things that go in that F12 land.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.280]   Because there's no debugger.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:14.280]   So basically-- and you couldn't even do prints, print-offs or whatever, because there was
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.560]   no way of even writing a file.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:22.080]   It was just like this hair-tearing experience that I hated, hated, hated doing it.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.480]   And so this has got a debugger so that you can go and do steps.
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.920]   So you can watch variables so that you can go and actually see the code that's going
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:29.920]   on.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.120]   You can have the dashboard running in the 49.
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.320]   Do you need to install the developer tools?
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.520]   No, you don't have to install--
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:36.520]   You need to install the--
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:37.520]   Just install?
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.520]   No, you don't have to have any of the developers.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.520]   Nothing.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.520]   There goes my Wednesday.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:44.280]   Thursday, I'm on a plain old day, and I'm going to be making it with your three batteries.
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:49.040]   So it's about 18 and 1/2 meg to download the thing, and then it installs.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:52.920]   So the only trick is this, when you go to look for it in the applications folder, it's
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:53.920]   not there.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:58.920]   So you have to go to the root of your hard drive, look for the developer folder, and
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.560]   inside there is the applications where that code goes.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.560]   Sneaky bastards.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.560]   No, no, no.
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:10.160]   If you install the whole Xcode stuff, all the things, the developer tools, which is free,
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:14.320]   which is the most incredible thing that Apple's ever done, is give away the developer tools.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.320]   Here, no church.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:19.440]   I think we should start a Mac break that's just dedicated to writing code.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.960]   Because everybody could have it.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.560]   It's like the application that everybody could have.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.160]   If we could teach everybody how to do how I want it.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.960]   Well, that would be called Mac Break Dev.
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:27.960]   That would be.
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:28.960]   That would be.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:33.960]   And if we did that, we would call it Mac Break Dev, and we would start doing one.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:34.960]   Would you do that?
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:35.960]   Would you be interested?
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:36.960]   I'd be happy to.
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.960]   All right.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.280]   So anyway, anyway, that's my pick of the week.
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.280]   Download it.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:44.240]   I'll post my birthday thing so you can see that.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:50.280]   And if you're listening and you want to see a Mac Break Dev, then come up to the Twitter
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.280]   TV.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.080]   Just go to the public forum for the show and let us know.
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.560]   And we'll do it anyway.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.560]   But we'll do it anyway.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:57.560]   Because I have a big interest in this stuff.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.400]   Oh, don't you want to tell them that way?
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.760]   I'm not going to do it anyway.
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.520]   Okay, convince me.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.360]   People's interest will depend on it.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.520]   How fast we do it will be based on people's interests.
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.520]   So a microphone.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.520]   You got a pick, Alex?
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:10.160]   I have a pick.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.400]   And I would like to point out how much is it, Alex?
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.400]   I would like to point out that it is less than $700.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.400]   Does it have noodles?
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.400]   It does have noodles.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.400]   And it is less than so much.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.400]   I need a pick, Alex.
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:30.600]   I would like to point out that it is less than $700.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:35.680]   Somebody thinks that all I talk about is the other thing.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.520]   You probably could pull like you with it.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.000]   I deserve so much more revenge.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   I will happily take all this revenge.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   I haven't started playing with it yet, but I play with it a little at the show.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.360]   I'm going to call it my pick because it looks so cool.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.360]   I talked about it a little bit on Macbreak last week.
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:52.360]   Let's paint it.
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.520]   No, it's not pen it.
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:57.600]   We got so much flack from people about liking that so much.
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.520]   I believe that you look carefully.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.000]   You will see this technology existed for quite some time.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Yeah, but it's really cool.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   It was really cool.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   It was so dorky.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   It was really well done.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   That's all I got to say.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   It vibrates when you...
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   It's got the little Wii controller.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   It's not my pick.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   Sorry.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Easy draw.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   Spelled with a Z.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   Let me tell you how hard it is to find them on the web.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   This is like a...
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   You have to really look around.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   Easy draw.com.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   It's E-A-Z-Y draw.com.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   These guys are like in Wisconsin.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   It is a...
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.320]   If you want to do stuff that you would do in Illustrator, but you don't want to pay for
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:38.000]   Illustrator, and you don't want the complexity of Illustrator, I have to say.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.720]   I know that we probably have some people out there from Adobe that are going to...
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.360]   I haven't really needed anything.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.360]   I'm not a print designer.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.760]   I mean, I used to be, but I don't do it anymore.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:57.640]   I used to know every quick trick that was inside of Illustrator, I now need about all
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.000]   the features that were in Illustrator 3.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   I know.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Actually, it was Illustrator 6.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   6 was the magic.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   That was the 7, the 1 where they made the easier.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   7 was the worst Illustrator release.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   But there was one leap where it got so much easier to use.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   That was 6.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   6 was the one that really...
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   Before that, the big hit first stuff was just like another language.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   It had everything I needed.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   It had everything that I wanted.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   It still does.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   The word 5 of drawing progress.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   It is word 5-1.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   Word 5-1.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   It was a word or 6.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   But there's a classicness to it.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   When it made that turn, and then 7 was the worst release of Illustrator ever.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   Then 8 continued this complexity where I can't use Pathfinder correctly.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   You can never figure out how to make this stuff work.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   It just became something that is...
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   It became this like...
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   Here's the problem that software companies have is that they have to keep on adding features.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   It has like the 20% of features that you actually need.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   Well, the worst feature that they ever added in Illustrator was changing the document format
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   to PDF and they didn't tell anybody that they did that.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   They still do Illustrator exports.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   No, no, no, but they changed the default.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   The default.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   They've gained the native format.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   So anyway.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   So anyway, so...
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   If you're doing print design, you need Illustrator.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   I mean, it is the app that you have to have it.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   But if you're like Joe Schmo at home and you want to just do some EPS files, you want to
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   do some print ready...
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   Technical drawing.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.500]   Or just technical drawing or you're a sign or something else that's going to print really
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:29.500]   big.
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.640]   If you do it in Photoshop or you do it in Photoshop, whatever, elements, it's going to be
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.000]   pixelated and it's going to look soft when you make it bigger.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.240]   But if you want to make something that is infinite resolution, it has the nice smooth
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:42.480]   Bezier curves, but I think actually the Bezier curves are done better in easy draw.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.960]   Which is this app, Alex?
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:44.960]   $130.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:45.960]   You should buy six copies.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:49.440]   I think I have to buy six copies now because...
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.640]   Your finance people are going to think there's something...
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:52.640]   What?
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:56.240]   He's talking about software that is less than $700.
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.240]   You're not Alex at all.
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.920]   The coolest thing.
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.920]   So the only story I have about it is...
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:01.920]   Alex was...
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:02.920]   He was tired.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:03.920]   Mac world was hard.
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:09.720]   I saw it easy draw four years ago or five years ago at Mac world and I was like, "Why
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:17.000]   in the world are these guys dedicating themselves to making Mac draw all over again when nobody
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.200]   wants Mac draw?"
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:21.800]   But it really turns out there's a need for this tool.
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.440]   I think that as I said, I don't know where it was.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:27.600]   It wasn't on my radar until literally this year when I walked in, I looked at it and
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.240]   I was like, "I know what that is because I'm always looking for ways that have this stuff
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:34.040]   be less expensive, not be $700."
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.040]   And it is...
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.280]   Anyway, they got a download.
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:40.440]   You can go to their website and easydraw.com and just download it.
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:43.280]   You can play with it, figure out if it's enough for you.
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:47.440]   But it'll also bring in, by the way, it'll open EPS files from Illustrator.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.000]   So someone made Illustrator files.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.080]   Now it won't open like the brand new one with all the residue.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.080]   It would do export to EPS.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:55.840]   Yeah, or export to PDF and it'll open up in the vector file so you can go back and edit
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:58.320]   those vectors as well.
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.320]   So I think that...
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.320]   You've made with the pennant, you can open?
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.200]   The things that you made with the pennant.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.560]   Yes, I think you can open it.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:07.560]   Sweet!
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.560]   Okay, one more thing.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.560]   We're almost done.
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:10.560]   How we do?
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:11.560]   We're close.
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:12.560]   Yeah.
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:15.800]   We need a wine list.
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:18.000]   And it's not from Napa.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.240]   Alex, tell us what the wine list is.
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.240]   The wine list...
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:22.240]   Because this is a brand new thing for the back.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.400]   Well, we've done this once before.
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.400]   The wine list is...
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.400]   The Apple wine list is...
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:30.440]   Is this to inoculate ourselves against being called fanboys?
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:31.440]   No, no.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.440]   It's that we've done a lot about...
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:33.440]   We've done a lot about...
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.440]   We've done a lot about...
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.920]   It's just that there are things that we don't like.
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.720]   I think that we need to tell people these are the things that they need to know that
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.360]   we don't like about the Mac.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:43.920]   And I think that it's not anything more than just...
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.760]   There are things that really...
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:50.680]   When I think about this wine list is when I raise my hands in fury, every...
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:55.400]   You know, there'll be something I raise my hands in fury about the Mac once a day.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:02.280]   And Ben Durbin, who's been on TWIM, he always gives me a hard time because he primarily
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.600]   uses a PC but knows how to use Macs really, really well.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.240]   And I primarily use Mac and yeah, I don't really use PCs.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:12.520]   And so Ben always gives me a hard time about the fact that, "Oh yeah, it's supposed to
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:13.520]   work.
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:14.520]   It just works."
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.520]   Because that's what I always say.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:20.520]   So what are your wines about the Mac?
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:26.240]   You know when you have a flash drive and it's sitting there on the computer ready to go,
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:30.280]   there's not a single file open but the directory's not even open, it's just sitting there.
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.080]   And you go, "I gotta go."
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:35.400]   And you pull the flash drive out and then the Mac goes, "Hey, device removal."
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.560]   And does it really matter?
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:40.960]   It doesn't matter because here's the thing, if that hasn't been used for 30 minutes, just
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.520]   be ready for it to go away.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.040]   I really want that message I have to admit.
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:49.720]   My wine related to that is I would like that message just to have one of those little buttons
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:51.080]   that says, "Don't warn me next time."
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.080]   I don't care.
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.080]   I can't decide.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.040]   I mean, I care if there's a file open.
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:01.440]   You know, if I have something that's open on it but if it's just there, then be smart
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.440]   about what that is.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:06.600]   I mean, geez, if you're looking at that, accessing it, saying, "Did anything change?
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:07.600]   Did anything change?
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:08.600]   Did anything change?"
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:09.600]   And then nothing changed.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.600]   Nothing's open on it.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:11.600]   So just like, let that go.
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:15.360]   I don't know if this is the same wine but we were talking about the SoftMic.
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.680]   This is maddening to me.
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:22.280]   I've talked before about how I've started using Amazon S3 for backup because it's crazy
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:24.480]   cheap and you can do this amazing backup.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:27.640]   There's a wonderful application that I talked about before, I've plugged on a show called
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:30.360]   Jungle Disk Monitor that makes it very easy.
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:37.240]   So what it does is it makes a Web Dev image, Web Dev, you know, the pop-up.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:42.600]   Okay, so Web Dev images, network drives, mounted computers of any kind.
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:43.600]   Cause hell.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:44.760]   Oh my God.
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:49.000]   So for whatever reason in this world, that device is no longer available.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.920]   It just keeps on looking.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.760]   It's a functionally like a hang.
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:53.760]   It's a hang.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.760]   It's a hang.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:59.480]   But if you go to Starbucks, I find and buy a coffee by the time you come back, it's fine.
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.400]   I think that's crazy making.
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.520]   Oh, I couldn't find it.
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:03.520]   I kept looking for you.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.680]   Now John, is that the same wine or is that a different wine?
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.680]   No, it's a different well.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:07.680]   It's a related wine.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:10.680]   It's a related wine because there's something about it not knowing what's the same.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:11.680]   I just don't understand.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:12.680]   I was like, get a clue.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:13.680]   There's a hierarchy here.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:14.680]   I mean, we can find this.
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.040]   There's a range networks, right?
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:19.800]   I'm no longer talking to my quote home network where all that stuff is.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.600]   I'm now talking to something called Starbucks.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:24.880]   Gee, that ought to be a clue that those network drives aren't there.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.360]   And just like gracefully deal with this problem.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:31.360]   That happens to me probably twice a week when I'm running Jungle Dismonter, which actually
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:32.360]   has a new release today.
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.360]   I have to say it.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.360]   It happens to me almost every day.
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:35.640]   Well, and it's crazy making.
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:38.800]   And then I, you know, they're just like this.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:39.800]   Why?
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.360]   Why should I have to go?
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:45.120]   Unmount, unmount, unmount, unmount before I put my, you know, before I go.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.840]   I have a quick mini plug.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:49.320]   I do not have this in front of me.
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:51.280]   I'll be happy to find this URL and send it to you, John.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:56.880]   But I got sent a wonderful script, a shell script from a guy whose name's escaping me
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.200]   and I apologize guy.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.040]   But I use this 10 times a day.
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:02.520]   He's giving me a shell script called it's ejectol.
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:06.760]   And it basically ejects every drive and I have that associated with quick silver.
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:10.880]   And so if I type EJ capital R-U, it'll unmount everything.
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.480]   There's no dragging, no grabbing, no nothing.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:13.480]   And it's super fast.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:14.480]   Cool.
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.480]   Well, you know, that'll help.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.240]   So if you use quick silver, that's a really, or for the shell for that matter.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.240]   So it's a quick way.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.640]   Hey, Alex, what's your one?
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.640]   You took it.
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:22.640]   I did not.
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:23.640]   You did take my one.
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:24.640]   Oh, you want a different one?
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.640]   I'm looking for another one.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:26.640]   Why don't you, you know what?
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:27.640]   I'm lying.
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:28.640]   I'm lying.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:29.640]   I'm lying.
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:30.640]   I'm lying.
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:31.640]   You know what?
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:32.640]   I have to do the finder.
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:33.640]   Here's Alex's wine.
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:34.640]   Okay.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:35.640]   So sound control panel.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:38.040]   John, why does that thing just like tear my hair out every single time?
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:39.040]   I just want to.
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:42.200]   I don't want it to talk to the internal microphone.
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:44.400]   I want to talk to the external microphone.
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.400]   I want it to stick there.
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.400]   You should have something like a location manager.
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:48.400]   There should be a thing like a location manager.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:49.400]   I'm actually just going to have a pro.
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.000]   I'm going to have actually a pro app wine.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   Okay.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   Do it.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.640]   Here's my pro app wine is that soundtrack.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.200]   You're listening to this show.
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.200]   You're listening to Mac break.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:44:59.200]   Theoretically.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:00.200]   Theoretically.
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.200]   You're listening to Mac break weekly.
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:02.200]   If it doesn't crash.
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.080]   And you're listening to this show and it's going to be edited.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:05.920]   It's going to be put out on iTunes.
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.520]   It is going to be edited on soundtrack pro.
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:11.600]   It's going to be recorded.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:12.600]   Cubase Ellie.
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:13.600]   Oh yeah.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:14.600]   This is a really bad.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:17.680]   So I have a fire pod and I am now going to my fire.
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:18.680]   What is fire pod?
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:23.960]   My fire pod is an eight channel mixer that's feeding into a fire wire.
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:30.480]   I would do this all in soundtrack pro except that soundtrack pro only does stereo.
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:33.880]   So I can only take two channels and I can pick any channel that's coming in from my
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.360]   fire pod.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:36.360]   But now I can manage.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.040]   It's like having a store that doesn't accept quarters.
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:44.640]   I can manage I think up to 128 tracks but I can only record two at a time.
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.720]   And I'm not clear why that's the case.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:55.000]   Now logic I can do as many I don't know 128 tracks or 32 tracks or something like that.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.160]   GarageBand.
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.280]   I can do at least eight tracks.
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:03.320]   The problem with both logic and garage band which is based on the logic engine is that
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:05.480]   they're not really stable after about 20 or 30 minutes.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:08.280]   I mean now a lot of guys at Apple are going to probably send me emails talking about
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:09.280]   rah rah rah rah.
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.240]   But we've tested it, we've done a lot of it.
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:15.440]   And you put eight tracks in there and you run 20 or 30 minutes on either one of those.
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:19.560]   They're not built for that logic is built for little songs that are maybe 10 minutes
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:21.120]   long and it's really good for that.
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:25.360]   It's just not so good when you start adding what we find is that after 40 minutes about
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:29.360]   60% of the time garage band would scope and you know I'm done.
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.400]   It didn't there was no error message, there was no nothing.
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.200]   It just stopped.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.200]   GarageBand.
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.200]   It's a little bit of a push.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:37.920]   And so you really want to use sound track works really, really well.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.240]   It's just that it's only in the garage band trick.
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:42.360]   No, no, it's turn the beats.
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:43.360]   Are you talking about the beats?
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.360]   You know that trick?
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:45.360]   No, no, no.
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:46.360]   Is that making a difference?
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.160]   No, it doesn't make any difference.
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.520]   Yeah, you can turn the beats down.
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:50.520]   Here's the problem with that.
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:57.760]   If you add any music that you wanted to put into it, it's if one deep per minute.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:58.760]   That's pretty much what it sounds like.
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:00.400]   And so that's one problem.
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:05.360]   But the other problem is that you can extend it out because you literally will run it both
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:06.560]   in logic and garage band.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:11.360]   You'll run out of beats at like one hour and six minutes and something or other.
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:15.840]   And for a long time, our podcast maximums were one hour and six minutes because we didn't
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:16.840]   want to run out of beats.
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.840]   See this, maybe this is a good constraint for us though.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:19.840]   Hey, shut it.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:20.840]   All right.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:21.840]   All right, we're out of here.
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:24.560]   Where can they find more of you, John?
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:27.840]   Well, if they want to talk to me, the best place is twit.tv/forms.
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.840]   And once again, I apologize.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:32.200]   It costs two bucks to get in.
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.200]   Cover charge.
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:36.160]   You know, I usually, I talk about my website, 43folders.com.
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:40.080]   But today, you like that?
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:41.720]   But today I'm going to get all Scott Moore.
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:44.800]   And I'm going to tell you about another website that I do call thatphoneguy.com.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.800]   It's very fun.
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:46.800]   It's very fun.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   And I don't know about that.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.840]   But it's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a guy who has a lot of
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:55.360]   personal problems and it's a video podcast that is now officially available as a podcast
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:56.360]   on iTunes.
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:57.360]   And I encourage you to subscribe there.
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:01.540]   And if you enjoy that phone guy, but you can find out more information at thatphoneguy.com.
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:04.080]   Is that phone guy, guy.com, kid compatible?
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:05.080]   You know what?
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.080]   Is it kid compatible?
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:08.080]   No.
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:12.160]   The thing I love about now that I'm on blip TV is that I can do ratings for each one of
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.160]   these.
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:14.160]   And I can put an M.A.
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:16.160]   Cause.
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:17.560]   Let's see what I think a lot of people don't get about that phone guy is he, he has a
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:20.280]   lot of personal problems.
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:21.280]   And he gets.
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:22.280]   He has Tourette's.
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:23.280]   So somebody's kids, kids.
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:24.280]   There's a lot of.
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:27.280]   You know, it's like it's, it's yeah.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.280]   Um, it's not for kids.
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:31.760]   Alex, we're going to people find more about you.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:32.760]   It's like how I'm like your sidekick.
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:33.760]   I got your back.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:34.760]   Thanks, man.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:38.520]   Um, you can find more about me at, uh, at, uh, where, where am I?
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:39.520]   Pixel core.com.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:42.280]   Pixel core.com P-A-X-E-L-C-O-R-P-S dot com.
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:44.200]   You don't really have like a canonical page there.
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:46.640]   You need, you need a web blog or blog.
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:47.640]   That's what you need.
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.520]   I've been doing that audio and making it a podcast.
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:54.240]   I've recently discovered how deep the Pixel core site goes with all of your systems about
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:56.560]   systems and your diagrams about who does what.
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:57.560]   It's intoxicating.
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:01.440]   I learned all about what a Luther really does apart from when you're life.
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:04.120]   And I learned, I learned so much about everybody.
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:05.120]   It's a Pixel core.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:07.120]   It has a lot of, it's, it's, you still got a lot of systems there.
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:08.120]   And it's got this one page.
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:09.120]   It just got this one page.
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.120]   It just looks like whatever.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.120]   Should we tell everybody about the big system?
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:13.120]   No, we're going to hold off.
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:14.120]   Yeah, hold off the big systems.
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:15.120]   So anyway, that's it.
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:17.120]   We're, that's enough of the shenanigans.
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.120]   Uh, this is how we do it.
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:19.120]   How we do it.
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:20.120]   How we do it.
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:21.120]   We're close.
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:22.120]   We'll also talk about it on the air.
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:23.120]   Thank you very much.
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:26.760]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:27.760]   This is an act break.
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:28.760]   We...
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:31.760]   See, now you threw my whole thing off.
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:32.760]   You're not supposed to ask.
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.800]   And another Mac break weekly is broken.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.640]   No, we, we broke our Mac.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.640]   We got rid of that.
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:38.640]   We got rid of that.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:39.640]   We got rid of that.
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:40.640]   Break time is over.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:41.640]   I like this.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:47.440]   I was telling Madeline, I really wish I liked the Mac break too.
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.080]   Because I think it's okay.
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:53.640]   I find myself walking around the house going, "Baa, baa, baa, baa, baa.
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:54.640]   And I don't like that.
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:57.360]   I'd rather be singing like a kiss on my list.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:57.920]   I hope it helps."
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.040]   It gets in your head, though.
