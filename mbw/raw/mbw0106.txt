[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.560]   And we bring back to the forum two guys
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.760]   who have been missing in action for some time.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.720]   You don't want to say missing in action when it comes to Scott
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.400]   Borne.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.440]   He's actually been photographing grizzlies.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.680]   I wasn't missing, but I did have some action.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.760]   Yeah, real action.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.920]   We're glad you came back safe and sound.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.760]   Thanks, bud.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.160]   I had to be back to a civilization, sort of.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.520]   And we'll put in the show notes a link.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.520]   But if you go to twpphoto.com, there's a link there
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.840]   to some of Scott's pictures, and you're getting more up.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.280]   And I got a diary of the whole trip,
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.200]   and doing a video on Vimeo.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.400]   And I got some background pictures of what
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.720]   it was like to be on the float plane and the odd,
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.880]   hot, over on Flickr.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.160]   That sounds wonderful.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.720]   That sounds wonderful.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.200]   It was great.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.640]   It was great.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.160]   I was gone nine days, and I have to tell you,
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.000]   for the first time in about 10 years, Leo,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.840]   I actually feel rested.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.520]   You need a good vacation once in a while, don't you?
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.760]   Yeah, nothing like having the Bejibers scared out of you
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.720]   by 12-foot tall.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.280]   Where's the birds that do that?
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.240]   That'll focus you.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.160]   That'll focus you on the issues of the day.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.240]   Also, here Alex Lindsey's back from his travels
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.120]   and some real travels I might add.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.480]   Zimbabwe, England.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.280]   Well, yeah, I started in Amsterdam.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.360]   Amsterdam?
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.720]   And we were shooting for Adobe, mostly.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.640]   And so we spent-- we shot a couple days in Amsterdam,
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.720]   and then Paris, and then London.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.240]   And then I flew to Zimbabwe, and spent a week down there.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.480]   Mostly it was the Zimbabwe International Film Festival,
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.960]   so I was down there speaking and meeting folks.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.760]   And then I was supposed to go to Nigeria,
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.480]   but my visa was turned down, because evidently I'm
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.360]   too dangerous for Nigeria.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.240]   Was it because you think you were coming from Zimbabwe?
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.800]   Yeah, no, no.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.160]   The reason that I got turned down,
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.280]   it had nothing to do with anything other than what happened
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.840]   was, is that I didn't know that I needed
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.520]   to go through this long visa process.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.800]   Most of the time when you go to the US, from the US,
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.080]   when you have a US passport, you walk into an African country
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.640]   at the airport, and they just stamp you with a visa.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.760]   Nigeria, you're a gun runner.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.760]   Yeah, once I was already en route, Nigeria said basically
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.200]   they wouldn't give me a visa from an embassy in a country that
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.840]   wasn't the United States.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.760]   So it was all technical stuff, but I had to--
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.480]   so I got to come home early, see my bub.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.480]   Good.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.560]   And it was good.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.600]   And one thing I do want to say, just some news from Zimbabwe
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.600]   that actually has to do with our listeners
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.720]   can take advantage of, is a really good friend of mine.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.840]   Chiwinizamarare is on tour just this next two weeks
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.160]   throughout the United States.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.800]   Is he the guy that you played us the recordings of?
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.440]   It's a woman.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.760]   Woman in the woman, yes.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.480]   Yeah, she's the one that I've done recordings of her,
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.680]   and I played him on Call for Hell.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.760]   The lab, yeah.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.680]   And on the platform.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.320]   Everything in here.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.080]   She's incredible.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.960]   Incredible, and she's incredible live.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.720]   And if you go to Chiwinizu or Chambanka,
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.920]   but Chiwiniz is just CHI-W-O-N-I-S-O.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.800]   But if you do QI, if you probably do a search for QI
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.480]   and Zimbabwe, you'd probably get it CHI and Zimbabwe.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.440]   You'd probably find it.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.200]   But she's going to be playing in Troy, New York, Toronto,
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.520]   Chicago, Madison, Cedar Rapids, Santa Cruz, Berkeley, Eugene,
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.120]   Seattle.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.080]   And if you're in those cities or anywhere near those cities,
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.040]   and you really want to get a great taste of Zimbabwean music,
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.120]   she's one of the best.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.440]   And so I just wanted to make sure to let people know that.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.800]   Because I'm really excited.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.840]   She only comes to the United States
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.360]   probably once every five years or so.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.760]   So it's definitely worth doing.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.240]   Well, there's a lot of Mac news to talk about.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.040]   I might mention that Anionako is taking the day off,
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.200]   but he will be back next week.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.480]   Also, Merlin Mann, as I mentioned last week,
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.360]   is going to take some time off from the show.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.680]   He's very busy right now, but he will appear from time to time
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.640]   as his schedule permits.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.960]   He's doing-- I actually have to say,
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.640]   I'd really admire what Merlin's doing, which is, unlike me,
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.720]   he's limiting his schedule.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.480]   He's saying, I can do this and this.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.520]   And I'm just-- I have to fit everything in.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.520]   And not--
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.360]   He's going to call that productivity.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.520]   He's all about productivity, man.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.520]   He has to-- he's an example for all of us.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.760]   Hey, we're going to go on in just a second.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.720]   In fact, I have the inside story on how the genius feature
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.000]   works in iTunes in just a second.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.520]   But before I do, I want to mention this show,
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.800]   as always, brought to you by the good folks at Visa
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.120]   when you go shopping online or off.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.000]   You want to make sure you take along your Visa card.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.560]   Visa, make sure that when you're shopping, you are safe.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.440]   You are secure.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.520]   They do all these sophisticated things
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.800]   to monitor online transactions.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.880]   Everything possible to detect, to prevent, and ultimately,
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.080]   should they happen to resolve online fraud.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.520]   So when you go shopping and you're looking D700 or--
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.080]   700D or the 3D, do I get the new-- do I wait for the G10?
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.440]   You know, you don't want to be worried about, am I worrying?
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.400]   If I'm a safe online-- no, don't worry about it.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.040]   Zero liability, buddy.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.600]   You're not liable for unauthorized purchases.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.360]   When you go shopping, take your Visa with you.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.320]   That's peace of mind.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.000]   Safe, secure, Visa.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.920]   All right, now I get it.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.640]   I've got to give them some credit for being safe and secure.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.160]   No problems, they're sure.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.760]   It's Visa, Visa, Visa, Visa.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.440]   It's so good.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.360]   Jeff Smith makes me want to do radio again.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.160]   Oh, wait a minute, I still am.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.400]   Have you seen-- have you guys seen the joy of tech
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.520]   explanation of how the genius--
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.680]   iTunes Genius really works?
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.760]   Nitro's back at Snaggy.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.240]   They do such a great job.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.680]   Yeah.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.240]   You've seen it?
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.880]   How can you show it?
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.480]   I'll read it to you.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.560]   Yeah, how iTunes Genius really works.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.040]   Information from millions of iTunes libraries
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.760]   is uploaded to Atomic Cloud.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.480]   Data is then distilled through Genius algorithms.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.560]   Algorithms comprised of virtual disc jockey
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.120]   artificial intelligences.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.720]   And they've got the Wolfman Jack condenser coil.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.800]   Yeah, baby.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.760]   The Dick Clark Fermentation Vat.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.320]   And the Big Bopper Boiler.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.960]   Hello, baby.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.680]   Then the Essence of John Mayer Injector.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.760]   That's a Steve Jobs innovation.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.120]   Data is then directed to a monitor
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.440]   where it appears as an iTunes visualizer.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.960]   Inspired by color lights, Ringo Star
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.200]   types random song names and uploads your playlist.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.000]   That's my favorite part.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.680]   Thejoyoftech.com.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.080]   Hey, Ab, before we get back to the news,
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.040]   I do want to mention that you are Scott Bourne
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.000]   are doing these appitur--
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.960]   is this their first aperture nature expedition?
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.160]   Yeah, we're doing four of these all told,
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.480]   one about every three months.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.680]   We ran a little contest.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.120]   This first period leading up to the first contest
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.880]   was truncated because of the time necessary
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.840]   to get everything set up.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.840]   But we ran a contest.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.440]   Had about 8,000 people participate.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:56.960]   Wow.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.520]   And we picked four winners.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.280]   And they're going for absolutely free to Jackson Hall,
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:06.320]   Wyoming with myself, Steve Simon, who's a regular on Twitch,
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.040]   Scotty Stulberg, who's a well-known writer for Shutterbug
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.440]   magazine, and an individual from Apple
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.000]   who's going to train them in the aperture.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.240]   And we're going to spend four days together
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.120]   at Grand Teton National Park.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.040]   Oh, I'm so jealous.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.320]   So that's next week.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.640]   And they didn't have to pay anything.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.360]   People were trying to buy their way into this workshop.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.560]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.600]   Maybe you should think about doing that.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.160]   No, no, no.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.600]   This is much like what you did with the Lightroom Adventure.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.040]   This is the same kind of deal.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.600]   Only it's pros and amateurs.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.880]   And we're going out and twos to see what we can do.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.760]   I'll be gone next week because I'll be out on that workshop.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.160]   And then when I come back the week after,
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.760]   we're going to start the contest anew for a chance
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.120]   to win a free trip to Yosemite in the winter time
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.440]   to do the same thing all over again.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.840]   Oh, that would be fun.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.480]   That would be cool.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.720]   And of course, you're always welcome, even if you don't win.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.200]   What is the date for the Yosemite trip?
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.480]   We haven't picked a firm date.
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.240]   If there was a date, you would be available.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.400]   We would make it on that date.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.400]   Now I'm intrigued.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.920]   How many days do you go for?
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.720]   We go on Wednesday and we break up on Saturday.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.640]   You could leave a little early because you have to do your
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.440]   radiation.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.280]   Yeah.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.040]   Or we could work it out so you can do it at the hotel.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:08.720]   Oh, that'd be fun.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.080]   Do it from the O'wanna or something.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:10.480]   That'd be fun.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.160]   Yeah, I had to exactly where we're going to stay at the O'wanna.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.680]   That's a beautiful hotel.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.320]   And this is like the most expensive hotel I've ever bought
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.640]   for a workshop participant.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.800]   I'll tell you that.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.840]   But it's a beautiful place.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.560]   And if you've never seen Yosemite in the winter time
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.240]   with the snow, oh my gosh, it's just a completely different
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:28.800]   place.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.600]   So that's the next one.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.680]   But the first one we still have yet to enjoy on the heels of
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.280]   my Alaska trip, I'm going to Grand Teton National Park.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.720]   So I've got a plethora of photo stuff going on this month.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.800]   Oh man.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.760]   Twipphoto.com to know more about that.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.320]   T-W-I-P-P-H-O-T-O.com.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.640]   Also at F64, F like Frank64.com.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.400]   OK.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.240]   Is that your personal site or?
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.160]   I've owned that site since the first year URLs came out.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.840]   And it's hard to get a three-letter domain.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.480]   I picked that because I did my master's thesis on Ansel Adams.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.720]   And that was the name of the camera club.
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.680]   He started F64.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.560]   It wasn't an F-stop, was it?
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.520]   Yeah, F64 is an F-stop on what's called a field camera,
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.200]   view camera.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.200]   It's like a pinhole camera, practically.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.120]   Exactly.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.120]   View cameras have lenses that will stop way down compared to
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.640]   single-end reflex cameras.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.800]   That's why all his pictures were such crisp focus, huh?
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.240]   Yeah, he bought a good camera.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.240]   That was all it took.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.880]   Yeah, that's all.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.040]   You just had a good camera.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:33.120]   He got at the same place that Mozart bought that piano.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.680]   Back to the news of the week.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.560]   So I guess, Scott, it's good that you're here, though,
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.640]   because the financial markets are in turmoil right now.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.800]   It's the biggest bust since 2001.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.640]   You know, my stock's not gone down at all.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.440]   And what's stuck with those B-Alex?
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.120]   I don't have any.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.160]   That's right.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.400]   Where do you put your money, Alex?
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.160]   I put it back into my company.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.000]   My wife has always been asking about this.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.440]   And five years ago, I said, well, the housing market's going
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.320]   to go down and then the stock market.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.400]   And I don't want any part of either of them.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.640]   And so I had divested a long time ago.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.600]   Invest in your company.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.720]   I think that's fair.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.440]   I just-- you know, and that's it.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.840]   Putting all your eggs in one basket, but on the other hand.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.800]   I got a couple companies.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.200]   So I put them in a couple of tickets.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.040]   So Scott, what I'm puzzled by--
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.720]   Apple has had this week, has had a lot of good news.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:27.320]   And yet, the stock has really taken a beating.
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.000]   It's down 5%.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.080]   And of course, the entire market--
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.520]   once again, we have to look at where
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.120]   it's at in relationship to the market.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.440]   The 52-week range is 115 to 202.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.360]   And we're at 139 today.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.200]   So we're near the low end.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.080]   But the company still has a market cap of $124 billion.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:52.400]   And the PE ratio is 27, which is not as high as a lot
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.400]   of the tech companies.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.680]   A lot of them are crazy.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.360]   That's a price to earnings ratio.
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.520]   That's like, what's the price of your stock
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.360]   against your earnings?
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.840]   Some of these companies are at like 60.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.760]   So that's a-- it's just decent.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.800]   And there's still strong buys on all the charts.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.520]   But the one thing I've noticed is they're performing very poorly
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.240]   compared with the Dow in general.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.120]   And that does have me concerned.
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.320]   And I think a lot of the stuff that you would think
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.080]   would cause good news like they recently
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:23.480]   settled the backdating lawsuits.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.920]   And Steve made another public appearance,
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.680]   despite the fact they said he was dead.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.960]   And yada, yada, yada.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.480]   Even at the keynote, he had a slide
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.600]   that said the rumors of my death are greatly exaggerated.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.160]   Yeah.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.240]   But I just think there's a lot of ambiguity surrounding Apple
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.440]   because of the missteps around Mobile Me,
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.360]   the iPhone launch, having a couple of problems related
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.720]   to that and fears over his health
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.960]   have just sort of dampened the stock.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.800]   Now, I don't own any Apple stock and have it for a long time.
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.480]   I still follow it really closely because I think, you know,
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.640]   for us to do the show and talk about Apple,
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.840]   there's no way we can do the show and it not
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.400]   least be present to the business condition.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.960]   I don't think they're in any kind of trouble.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.840]   But I don't know.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.160]   There's sort of an unsettled feeling about them.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.960]   And of course, we all wonder if the whole market isn't
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.800]   going that way.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.360]   I mean, you're looking at, you know,
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.320]   the day that I thought companies like Bear Stearns
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.480]   would need to be bailed out.
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.920]   I got to tell you, I'm--
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.040]   It's a little scary.
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.280]   And yes, Apple sales--
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.080]   It's according to a change wave.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:29.840]   What is that right?
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.000]   No, that's not right.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.280]   Well, maybe it is.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.480]   Change wave says that Apple sales are at an all time high--
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.480]   I don't know if change wave is to be trusted--
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:45.560]   you're seeing good news in a lot of areas for Apple.
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.880]   The Apple store on track to do a billion items,
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.960]   according to roughly drafted by 2009.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.080]   Of course, the iPhone fix, which a lot of people are saying
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.760]   is fixing a lot of the problems.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.320]   This is-- I mean, these should be good days for Apple.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.000]   I think they are good days for Apple.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.680]   I don't know how much Apple looks at the stock price
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.480]   as much as we do.
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:12.040]   I think that I just came back from Zimbabwe
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:16.440]   and you're looking at a country with an inflation rate of 11%
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.320]   and you'd think that the whole place is shut down.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.120]   And I was in downtown Harari and there's Merx everywhere.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.480]   There's Mercedes and people driving in--
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.560]   And it's congested.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.080]   It's congested there.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.400]   And so the thing is, is that there's always a population
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.720]   that's able to not be part of whatever that process is.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.720]   And I think that that is, if you're in niche market,
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.960]   solving something that's growing no matter what.
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:44.040]   And also, if you are a higher end market sometimes,
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.520]   I think that sometimes you can weather some of these things.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.760]   If you're not just pure luxury, I think
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.400]   that oftentimes you can weather these kind of market
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.720]   corrections more effectively.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.760]   And let's look at something else.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.280]   Most people who do participate in the stock market
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.880]   don't participate in it as day traders.
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.000]   They participate in it in the form of 401Ks
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.400]   that they have through their offices.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:10.280]   And when businesses invest in these stocks,
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.400]   they're looking at long term.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.360]   And I mean, just for fun, I looked at a five-year graft.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.560]   Does anybody remember what the price of Apple stock was
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.800]   five years ago?
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.400]   30 bucks.
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.000]   I don't remember what?
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.320]   Try like 12.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.960]   12?
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.320]   All right.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:30.280]   So it's gone from-- it's at about 139.25 right now,
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.800]   as we speak, according to my iPhone ticker.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.600]   It was 12, five years ago.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.960]   I think you'd be pretty happy if you bought it 12.
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.880]   When I got out, I was dollar cost average at around 90
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.120]   and thought I was doing a pretty big happy.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.240]   Because I got out at 199.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:49.760]   But the stock has a five-year performance
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.080]   that most companies would kill for.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.640]   I don't think there's any doom and gloom.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.600]   Like I say, there's still a strong buy with most
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.360]   of the people that write reports like this.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.080]   I think that we're-- I don't think that they've
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.480]   got another bunch of mobile me mistakes
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.920]   in before they're punished.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:06.440]   They've worked though.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.800]   They've ironed those things out.
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.680]   City groups, Richard Gardner-- this is the one I was trying
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:11.480]   to remember--
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.640]   asserted in a research note yesterday morning
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.120]   that Apple's September quarter is
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:20.000]   tracking in line with his above consensus revenue estimate,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   above-concessance, $8.3 billion thanks
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.800]   to surprisingly robust iPod shipments and inline PC
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.160]   shipments, streets looking for $8.1 billion.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.080]   Furthermore, this is the point I thought was interesting,
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.960]   quote, "field checks have confirmed
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.440]   that shipments of new Macbooks have begun."
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.280]   Yeah, that now Guy Kawasaki--
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.440]   I don't know.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.880]   He's not as close to the Apple group as everyone thinks he is.
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.000]   I think you let the cat out of the bag a couple of days
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.360]   before that report come out that Macbooks were shipping.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.760]   So probably Apple right after this show is wrapped,
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:00.760]   will announce them.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.760]   But watch the Apple--
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.920]   I'll be hitting the Apple store throughout the show
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:05.960]   to see when they shut down.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.720]   But any minute now, here's the thing
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.800]   that I find most exciting.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.560]   And I hope this is not a tease.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.520]   He says, "The most distinctive features of the new Macbooks--
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:20.520]   very thin aluminum casing, LED backlit display,
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.680]   an aggressive entry level price point.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.320]   That-- if I were the stock market,
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.360]   that should be very good news for Apple.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.920]   If they could get in a $1,000 price point
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.360]   on a sexy, attractive Mac, they already almost--
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.600]   I mean, they're already very strong in the laptop market.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.360]   They could own that market.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:43.440]   Yeah, that-- if you're talking $1,000 portable
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.240]   with real power, that's the price point they have to hit.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.080]   They have to hit.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:52.040]   If you do that, then you eliminate the bottom feeders
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.080]   that come in at $9.99 with off-brand markets
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:55.960]   and steel market share.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.160]   $9.99, $6.99, $4.99.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.240]   I mean, you can see laptops very cheap out there.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.120]   I would love to see the MacBook Air--
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.480]   some of the MacBook Air features
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.480]   migrate to the MacBook line, the Pro line.
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.320]   I think that sounds very intriguing.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.720]   We've seen-- it's funny, because we've seen rumor pictures
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.120]   like this.
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:18.320]   Do you think that that's what we're talking about?
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.000]   I don't know.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.320]   I can say there's at least two different sources on this.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.320]   So I don't know.
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.920]   Sounds pretty accurate.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.800]   Well, I mean, when--
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.840]   I mean, I-- Kawasaki doesn't get into this stuff
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.280]   unless he's telling what he believes to be true.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.040]   He's not a rumor site.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.800]   I mean, he's one of the original gurus at Apple
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.840]   and was responsible for the max success
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.600]   by virtue of his ability to evangelize its software.
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.200]   So I mean, he's not--
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.640]   he's a significant guy when he says something I pay attention.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.520]   I'll keep hitting the Apple Store.
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.240]   We're going to wrap up at about 12.30, 12.31 is that?
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.920]   I think it's scheduled for weeks of the new MacBook.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.520]   And 12.32, I'm in my car to the Apple Store.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:03.880]   Because my main work unit is a year old MacBook,
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.080]   which I love, the white MacBook.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.360]   And it's only-- you know, it's what, 5.9 pounds,
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:09.920]   something like that.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.360]   But I would love to get lighter and thinner.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.600]   And I will say that on the trip to Alaska with the MacBook
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.920]   Air, it performed flawless.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.680]   Well, my wife is buying one this week,
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.760]   and I sent her an email this morning after seeing that.
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.520]   I don't buy one to break it.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.080]   It's not-- stop.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.200]   It will be--
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:26.720]   Hang on.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.480]   It's pretty clear it'll be this week.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:28.840]   Yeah.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.880]   Things not to buy today or anything in the way of cameras,
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.120]   lenses, or laptop.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.760]   Photo Kina is, of course, next week.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.080]   And that's when a lot of big announcements are going to come out.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.800]   I'm looking forward to a sequel to the 5D.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.280]   Because I'm--
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.080]   5D Mark II and G10, baby.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:42.920]   You guys are killing me.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.320]   And the G10, you guys are killing me with your Nikon 3D's.
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:46.920]   I'm just--
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:47.280]   I got it.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.200]   Get in there.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.400]   I'm afraid I'm about to pull the trigger on the D700.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.160]   I'm just looking at--
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.200]   That's a beautiful camera.
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.160]   But you're a Nikon lens guy, right, Alex?
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:55.760]   No, I'm not.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:56.680]   I'm a Canon.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.840]   Don't do it, Alex.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.520]   Don't do it.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:58.840]   Wait.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:59.400]   Don't pull away.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.240]   I'm going to watch the tests.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.160]   I'm waiting.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.840]   But I'm sitting there with a happy trigger finger.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.800]   The 700 looks awfully good.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:08.480]   Well, I'm sitting in the rain in Alaska photographing grizzly
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:13.640]   bears at ISO 1600 getting shots that look like I'm at ISO 100.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:14.320]   Well, that's the whole thing.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.920]   And specifically, my rush is actually
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.480]   that she went into user concert.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.800]   Actually, she's coming into town next week here in Berkeley.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.120]   And I want to go shoot concerts.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.920]   And I'm just like, I'm not going to wait much longer
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.480]   if I don't--
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.720]   I want to be sitting there at 6,400 ISO.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:33.520]   How about that new Casio that shoots with 40 frames a second?
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.280]   Or does this high speed video mode?
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.280]   Oh, we've had it.
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.880]   I think we put-- have we posted those samples?
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.120]   They're going to-- they're not an uptick to it.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.080]   Because--
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.120]   We did after PMA.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:45.840]   I did a test.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:46.360]   And it's cool.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.840]   But it can only do it for one second, Leo.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.720]   The Aaron Mailer did a bunch of tests.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.040]   He's the producer for Twi--
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.640]   And he had it for a couple days.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.600]   And he did some tests.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.760]   And it's just-- it is.
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.440]   You get this really short sample.
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.440]   And you get weird, like, postage stamp size images
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.000]   when you do it.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.760]   But it is awesome to watch.
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.360]   I mean, you said there--
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.520]   He drops the phone.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.440]   They're updating it at Photokine, I think.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.360]   I just saw a press release.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.680]   So we'll see.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.360]   We'll see about 325 new point shoots.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.360]   I know.
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.760]   All with names like the--
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:24.000]   Nikon, PL69-4 Stroke 5.6XA.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.240]   Well, just listen to a Twi--
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:25.600]   photo.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.120]   That's my motto.
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.520]   They'll talk all about it.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.960]   We'll have everything-- we'll have the rumors better
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.920]   than anybody else.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.120]   Our rumors will be better than anybody else's rumors.
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:35.640]   How's that?
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.640]   10.5.5 is out.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.520]   Downloaded it and installed it on my laptop?
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.760]   No problem.
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.760]   I didn't install it on my machine here until after the show.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.760]   Any problems on your end?
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.240]   Are you hearing anything?
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.600]   I haven't had time to download it yet.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.040]   It's big up here.
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:50.880]   It's 33.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:51.400]   33 here.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.440]   It's mostly security in there.
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.720]   33 patches.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.120]   And some significant security flaws,
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:00.040]   including the DNS flaw that Apple fixed already earlier
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.080]   this year but didn't fix on the client side very well.
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.560]   And now they're fixing it on the client side.
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.480]   It is a must-- it is a must download.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.600]   Although we are hearing some problems.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.920]   Some people are having problems with it.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.640]   So as usual, you might want to wait.
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.080]   Especially video, there's a fix for the video playback
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.960]   problems on MacBook Airs.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.040]   I haven't seen that myself.
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.680]   Fire plays back, video, fun.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.160]   But 10.5.5 is out.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.320]   You might want to do an update.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.600]   When it's security patches like this,
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.840]   I don't like to wait too long.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.840]   I just wait till you do them, Neil.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.840]   Well, I did want on my MacBook no problem.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.560]   I'll do it on my desktop on my iMac here.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.400]   And I'll let you know if I have any problems.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.400]   But so far, so good.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.080]   And I won't do it while all the shows on.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.200]   You guys update 2.1?
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:49.800]   I did.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.160]   And I have to say, a couple of improvements.
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.000]   They fixed that long backup time.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.520]   Hello, Neil.
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.080]   I'm sticking with 1.4, baby.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.560]   The thing is, what was interesting about the thing
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.480]   is I didn't realize that I just didn't have that many apps
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.160]   on my iPhone.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.080]   And so the backup time was really, really fast.
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.200]   And then I went crazy.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.080]   I was like, oh, I'm going to be on the 17 hour flight.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.240]   I'm going to download a bunch of apps
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.200]   so that I can test them on the way home.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.080]   And man, it just--
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.280]   That's what I'm going to say.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:19.840]   I have five or six pages of apps.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:20.240]   I love it.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:20.880]   Well, that's what happens.
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.040]   I had two pages of apps.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.520]   And when I went to five pages of apps,
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.880]   I dropped like $100 and just bought a whole slew of stuff.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.160]   And I think the one that made it in the back of the longest
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.240]   was Spore.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.160]   Somebody told me-- I think Ray Maxwell told me.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.360]   And he's corroborated this on the net
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.040]   that one of the issues with the long initial--
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.840]   it backs up the first time he's sinking the H day.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.960]   One of the issues is can be some applications
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.960]   create very long log files, which are then sent to Apple.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.560]   And that that could be part of the problem.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.400]   So if that's the case, you might want to--
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:24:00.240]   you can disable that send information back to Apple check
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.720]   box.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.080]   And apparently that speeds things up, but not nearly as much
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.440]   as 2.1 does.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.520]   While we were talking about it, I plugged in my iPhone
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.040]   and the backup's already done.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.440]   I think this surprised me who was getting better reception.
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.440]   So our office is like a Faraday cage.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.520]   And you really can't--
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.400]   A what?
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.560]   A Faraday cage.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:19.800]   What's a Faraday?
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.480]   A Faraday cage is a--
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.840]   About $5, $6 a day, I think.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:24.360]   Ah!
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.000]   Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:26.640]   Faraday cages--
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.640]   God's going to give me this set up.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.000]   I've got to do it.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.720]   So the Faraday cage is something--
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.200]   you can sit there with a Tesla coil, for instance,
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.360]   and sit inside of a Faraday cage,
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.200]   and it'll lighten the all around you.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.720]   And more importantly, you can't get any radio waves in and out.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.320]   And so our office is very hard.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.720]   It's a copper screen, it'll do it.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:44.560]   Doesn't need to be--
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:45.880]   Yeah, copper solid metal.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.400]   No, no, yeah, that's the idea, is it's a screen.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.280]   And so anyway, we have security things on our windows,
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.440]   security screens that then block out everything.
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.440]   You do.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.120]   Oh, you're full.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:55.760]   It came with that.
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:56.520]   We didn't--
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.920]   Oh, they're not for radio--
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:24:59.520]   No, no, no.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.680]   They're in the windows.
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.640]   Oh, they're in the windows.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.480]   So you can't break through the window?
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.480]   But because of that, if the windows are closed,
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.160]   my iPhone just doesn't work in the office.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.880]   Now Verizon will work, but my iPhone wouldn't.
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.160]   And I updated it, and I came in and was really surprised.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.120]   I didn't know that that was one of the updates.
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.600]   But I came in and was suddenly surprised that my iPhone suddenly
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.160]   had three bars in the office.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:20.760]   And it worked?
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:21.200]   And it worked?
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.840]   I was calling all over the office.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.600]   Because some skeptics are saying, oh, all they did was change the bars.
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.320]   No, I was in the middle of the office areas
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.720]   that my phone doesn't even-- OK, so--
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.640]   --answer, and it's getting better.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.080]   And it wasn't just the bars.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.280]   I was calling people.
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:35.600]   And--
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.960]   Yeah, because the conspiracy theory is, oh, they just
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:38.960]   changed the display.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.800]   And there's some credence to that, because they also turned off--
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.760]   in the test mode, they turned off the signal strength meter.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.680]   So you can't actually look anymore.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.800]   I was answering calls that I couldn't answer before.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.320]   You know, that's what I know.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.440]   No, and you're not the only one who supported this.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.440]   I can testify that Alex's office is tough to get a cell phone call.
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.120]   And the first time I went there, there was a blue X on the floor.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.040]   And I thought it was a standard video mark.
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.280]   I said, is that where the talent stands?
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.880]   He goes, no, that's the place the cell phone works.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.200]   That's very good.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.160]   Stand on your mark and make a call.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:12.680]   Exactly.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.360]   Much more offices would have that.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.040]   Other changes in 2.1 I now have a--
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.760]   I actually could see how much memory is devoted to my apps,
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.440]   a little green bar for apps.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.160]   And I'm pleased to say with all the apps I have,
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.760]   it's only 477 megabytes only.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.400]   It's not that much, really.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.680]   Compared to the five gigabytes I've
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:36.480]   got devoted to audio or the three gigabytes to video.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.240]   What else in there?
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.600]   There's fixes, no cut and paste.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.280]   As far as I can tell, not much functionality change.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.160]   But paste.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.320]   I just want to repeat that.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.320]   No.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.840]   How hard is it to add cut and paste?
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.520]   I'm not that hard.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.280]   Apparently, it's very difficult.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.840]   Apparently, it's harder than just any other possible thing
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.440]   this iPhone could do would be to put it.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.800]   Apple continues to proclaim that they've received lots
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.080]   of feedback from their users.
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.320]   And that's a low priority.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:04.880]   Nobody wants it.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:05.840]   Nobody wants it.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.480]   That's a nice thing.
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.400]   Where the nine guys on the planet that wanted, I guess.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.600]   Makes no sense.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.000]   Apple did a very controversial thing
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.760]   in the beginning of a lot of national press on this.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:22.880]   They blocked an application from the Apple Store
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.440]   from Al America called Podcaster.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.680]   It was something I thought, boy, this sure
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.280]   would be a nice application on the iPhone.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:34.600]   The ability to subscribe to it, download podcasts,
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.960]   Apple, they say it duplicates the functionality,
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:41.640]   the podcast section of iTunes, and we're blocking it.
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.680]   We're not going to allow you to add this to the store.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.200]   And frankly, this is extremely disturbing to me.
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.880]   It shows that Apple is being anti-competitive,
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:55.240]   that they're wielding their power unnecessarily.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:58.400]   And it really-- in fact, it breaks the app stores
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.080]   for as far as I'm concerned.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.960]   It really is frustrating.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.320]   Now, he's gone ahead, and he's doing something
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.200]   kind of interesting.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:10.280]   You can actually buy a copy at nextdayoff.com
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.320]   in a very sneaky way, which Apple is sure to come down on him
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.280]   for.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.200]   You go to nextdayoff.com.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.520]   You could submit your email address.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.760]   He'll mail you a link.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.560]   You don't have to jailbreak your iPhone.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.880]   This is a way around getting--
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.520]   you can sell an app without going to the iTunes store.
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.400]   But listen how you have to do this.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.040]   He sends you a link.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:33.280]   You then go to this spot, and then it says,
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:36.560]   you have to donate 10 bucks before you can get the program.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.040]   He says, you can't call it a purchase,
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.760]   because if he did so, it'd violate Apple's terms.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.320]   And then the way it works is, you know,
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:48.640]   Apple allows-- finally, Apple allows developers
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.960]   to do beta tests, but only 100 people at a time.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.120]   So it's using that beta test facility, which
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:58.400]   means he has to change a line of code every 100 new buyers,
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:03.160]   100 new users, and release it as a new version.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.400]   And then he gets his money out of the way.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.000]   He'll get his money, and my question is--
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.440]   and he says, I can't guarantee you
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.320]   that this is going to continue to work.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.800]   Apple could turn it off remotely.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.680]   Yeah, I mean, I think it gets the word out.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.920]   It gets his investment out of it.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.080]   You know, I mean, as far as getting something back.
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.760]   I have to say that part of this,
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.600]   I mean, I do think that it's problematic.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.920]   I think that I was trying to think about what the process would
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.120]   be why Apple would come down on this,
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.440]   and more than just being competitive,
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.040]   because there's other things that Apple--
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.480]   that apps that reproduce what Apple does,
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.680]   that Apple hasn't come down on.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.600]   And I think that part of this is also protecting--
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.760]   once Apple starts letting something like this go through,
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.680]   when Rhapsody wants to do something,
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.040]   or when Microsoft or Amazon wants
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.640]   to do something that kind of reproduces something
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:53.360]   that the iTunes does, and Apple didn't come down on this first one,
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:57.440]   I think it leaves them open to problems in the future.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.520]   I think that's probably-- that's my guess
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.920]   as to why Apple's approaching it this way.
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.520]   I do have to say, as an Apple developer,
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.760]   I mean, we develop applications for Apple.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:10.840]   And we kind of approach Apple as the approach that I have
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.400]   is that I look at what Apple's going to do,
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.320]   and I try not to step on their toes.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:18.120]   You know, there's a big playing field that we can work on,
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.040]   and we just don't go into the areas that we think
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.480]   that we're going to have trouble with.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.560]   And when we produce something, we go through it going,
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.600]   we're adding a feature to Final Cut or Motion,
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.760]   and Apple may reproduce this feature down the road.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.760]   So don't release stuff in March for something
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.400]   that might be reproduced by April.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.640]   This is what Dave Weiner says.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.160]   He says, "I wouldn't invest in or develop an iPhone app,
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.200]   because Apple could decide not to approve it
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.120]   for whatever reason, and if they don't approve it,
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.400]   you can't sell it."
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.160]   I mean, I think that's a little bit of silly thinking.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.600]   I mean, I think it's fine.
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.040]   But I think there's a little bit of hyperbole there.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.280]   I mean, I think-- Well, that's Dave Weiner.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:55.720]   But I do think that that's discouraging.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.600]   If you're going to develop for an iPhone app,
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.880]   you don't find out that your app's been rejected
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.040]   till the day it's done.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:02.520]   OK, wait a minute.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.760]   Let me just put this in perspective here.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.520]   I understand both sides of the equation.
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.200]   I think both sides have merit.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.200]   But this is the way business is done.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.000]   And let me explain to you how it's
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.720]   done on a much larger scale every day.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.160]   And I don't hear anybody complaining about it.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.160]   If you want to watch a video that you buy at Walmart,
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:22.960]   Walmart talks to the studios about how that video is delivered,
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.680]   what the cover looks like on the box--
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.000]   A lot of people complain about that.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Are you kidding?
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.560]   Well, what I'm saying, though, is the complaints are--
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:30.400]   There's a difference.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.800]   You could go to another store and buy that video.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.480]   You don't have to buy it from Walmart.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.040]   What I'm trying to get at, Leo, is that if you don't get it
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.600]   at Walmart, you probably aren't going to get it,
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.520]   because they distribute so much of it.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.320]   And the point is, is that many companies
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:48.120]   make decisions on distribution that make people mad.
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.520]   I understand I would like to be able to get this app if I
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.840]   was using the phone.
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.560]   But I also understand that Apple has a duty
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.920]   to protect its property.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.720]   I think they might have gone overboard here.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.000]   But I just think that the reaction you're getting
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.280]   is mostly hyperbole.
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:04.040]   People aren't going to stop developing apps for this thing.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.640]   You got companies like Kleiner Perkins
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:08.000]   putting money into companies that are developing the apps,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.440]   and it's going to continue to go forward.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.480]   And that's why Apple did it, because they know they can get
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:12.480]   away with it.
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.680]   Well, and I think that, as I said,
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.720]   I think that there's so much money in the app store right now.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.040]   I mean, when I look at how much money I just
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.160]   spent in the last week on apps for my iPhone,
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.680]   and now I've got-- I've broken up.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.640]   I used to be buying mostly $199.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:27.080]   Now I'm buying $499, and $1499, and $999.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.320]   And I just kind of order them out.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.600]   And I was thinking while I was ordering these,
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.080]   is that, man, these little companies
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.800]   are building these little feature apps,
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.280]   and they're making a lot of money.
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.800]   I don't think that they're going to slow down.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.440]   And I think that people who don't want to develop now,
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.240]   I think that they'll be missing out.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.640]   I don't think that they're--
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.480]   I don't think anything's really going to happen.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.560]   And I do think that I think what we're talking about
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.520]   is Apple turned off--
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:53.240]   there's 2% of the area that is a gray area.
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.440]   And if you want to build something,
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.880]   if you want to build an application in the gray area
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:00.440]   of what Apple doesn't like, you're at risk.
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:04.200]   But that's why there's so many to-do lists and flashlights,
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.680]   because people are playing it safe.
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:09.000]   Well, but I mean, they're not just to-do lists and flashlights.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.640]   I mean, there's language converters.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.760]   I'm sitting there walking around Paris with this--
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:14.560]   what was it?
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:15.080]   Lingo book.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.360]   Lingo look, where it's playing back, what I'm supposed to say,
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.120]   is so French people don't get upset with me.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.080]   And--
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.120]   So literally, so you've got to get-- I was sitting there.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.440]   There's this thing called lingo look,
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.720]   and it's got flashcards.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.720]   And so when you want to get a coffee--
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.440]   hold on, let me see if I can do this on the thing.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.720]   So it's associated.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.680]   Just think, do you express it?
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.600]   So that's--
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:37.520]   so what happened was--
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.480]   What does that mean?
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.280]   I need a coffee stack.
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.360]   That's like an espresso.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.960]   If I want sugar, I go.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.840]   So what I would do is--
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.160]   You can't do that yourself?
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.320]   Succo?
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.120]   No, no, no, no.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:49.920]   No, what happened--
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:50.920]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.920]   No, no, no, no.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:52.920]   No, no, no, no.
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:52.920]   What happened?
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:53.920]   There's my head phone.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.920]   No, I had it in my head phone.
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.640]   Oh, oh, it's queuing you.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:57.640]   So you say Succo.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.080]   I sit there, and I'd be sitting there looking
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.280]   like I was playing with my eye.
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.120]   But I'm figuring out when the waiter comes back
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.520]   what I'm going to ask.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.480]   And I play one after another.
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:06.480]   And--
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:06.960]   Oh, this is a--
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.960]   So you're not saying-- you're not holding up the phone
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.880]   and saying--
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:10.720]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.120]   Where is the bathroom?
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.160]   No, they were very--
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:15.280]   there were a lot of French that were very impressed with me.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.280]   Because they say--
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.720]   So many good questions, and we're asking for the--
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.360]   But then they start talking back to you and you say--
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:20.880]   That's right.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:21.600]   What are you going to do?
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.200]   I mean, I can say--
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.600]   let me see how to say--
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.400]   Where is St. John Street?
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.640]   Who, a Rue St. Jacques?
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:28.720]   And now they start talking.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:29.480]   I'm like, what?
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.120]   No, no, no, no.
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.600]   I would make it clear that I was having trouble.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:32.240]   But at least I was--
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.600]   I'll say May.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.880]   In France, there's a lot of--
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:35.840]   if you try, you get--
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:36.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.040]   Oh, no, they get--
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:37.360]   That's true.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:37.840]   They do have to--
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:37.840]   You just have to--
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:38.360]   You just have to--
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.200]   Yeah, you just have to--
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:50.920]   And then the other thing is, there was one guy, I really wanted an authentic croissant.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.520]   You are American, are you nuts?
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:57.600]   So then I sat there with this little thing, and I ordered my croissant, I ordered my coffee,
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.400]   I ordered my--
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.360]   I ordered everything that I wanted.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:04.600]   But anyway, all I'm saying is, is that there aren't just little flashlights.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:07.240]   There's a lot of applications that are surprising--
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.240]   Oh, right.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:11.760]   --you know, well-developed, and they're getting better very, very fast.
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.680]   And I think that--
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.720]   Is there one of those that works in Swahili?
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.040]   Not yet, but I'm working on it.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.440]   Oh, that'd be good.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.920]   No, I want to--
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.920]   I mean, we're talking--
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:24.320]   Well, I mean, I'm looking at things like X-plane, which just came out, which is an amazing flight
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.080]   simulator.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:28.200]   The new Lucas face-nelter?
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.360]   No.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:32.800]   So if you're at the airport, just in case you're wondering, you want to entertain kids,
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.760]   you take a picture of their face, and then it has the morphine--
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:34.760]   That's fine.
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:36.640]   --like the mesh warp that you have in front of.
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:37.120]   Good stuff.
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:38.120]   --and the high-power--
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.120]   And--
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:41.120]   It's a lot of fun.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.120]   So--
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.120]   No, you're right.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.120]   There are a lot of good apps.
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.520]   I just-- well, of course, now I'm speaking as a podcaster here who really thinks there
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.840]   should be a podcast, a native podcast client on the--
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:51.840]   You can agree.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.840]   So I really--
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.480]   So I admit I have a little bit of an axe to grind here.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.880]   But it does scare me that Apple--
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:00.640]   I mean, what business-- they're not in the business of podcasting.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.680]   I'm still like there's a little bit of a--
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:03.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.880]   I just feel like people have seen Apple do this all the time.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.560]   And maybe they should, and maybe they shouldn't.
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.920]   And it's not like T-Mobile doesn't do that with a sidekick.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.920]   But one of the reasons I wasn't fond of the sidekick is there's no--
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.800]   You buy an application from T-Mobile or you don't buy at all.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:20.200]   And real controls what you can get through the real media player and yada, yada, yada.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.200]   I mean, it's just--
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:24.280]   Well, but if I get, for instance, if I get--
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.160]   And this is something Apple has to pay attention to.
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:30.680]   The new BlackBerry Bold and the new BlackBerry Thunder, there is a very robust, very rich
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:33.720]   third-party application ecology.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.920]   RIM is not saying what you can and cannot run.
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:39.200]   Your carrier is not saying what you can and cannot run.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:42.600]   And I think that-- look at-- the Thunder's going to come along.
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:45.520]   And so is the HTC Dream with Android on it?
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.840]   Apple has-- there's also competitive interests here.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:52.920]   People are going to start to say, well, yeah, but you can't do some things with the iPhone.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:57.120]   But I think that I think-- I have a big-- I mean, we've heard this before about how iTunes
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.120]   is going to be challenged.
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.120]   And then we hear about how--
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.120]   The iPhone is challenged.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.120]   The iPhone is--
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.120]   The iPhone is--
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.480]   Because the record companies have decided to kill it.
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:09.240]   The movie industry is now doing deals on DRM that do not include Apple.
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.240]   I think that Apple is--
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:13.800]   On the other hand, the other hand, they got NBC back.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.000]   They did get NBC back, which showed something, doesn't it?
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.080]   It shows that it doesn't-- you need Apple to sell the office, I guess.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:24.480]   I think-- I think the thing is, sure, I understand why people are afraid of iTunes.
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:28.520]   I'd be afraid of iTunes, too, if I was a big Hollywood power broker.
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:31.200]   But the fact of the matter is they're afraid of Walmart.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.560]   They're afraid of Blockbuster.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:33.560]   They're afraid of lots.
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:39.160]   Anything that might put them in a position where they make 15/10ths of a cent less.
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:42.960]   And you can't-- when you've got a big distributor, like, look at the book business.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.880]   My God, there's nothing more Byzantine than the book business.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.360]   The publishers get half the money.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.600]   The distributors get half the money.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.640]   The authors get some pittance of what's left over.
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.400]   This is common to many businesses.
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.440]   Something similar happened in the book business.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:03.480]   And book buyers for just a couple of companies like Borders and Chapters and Barnes and Noble
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:08.920]   started controlling book sales because they were the dominant sellers.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:14.480]   They actually would go to editors and say, "You know, you need to change this book.
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:16.240]   It's not going to sell well."
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.040]   And I don't think that's a good thing.
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.880]   No, I'm not saying that it happens.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.400]   Just saying that it happens doesn't mean it's an acceptable behavior.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.760]   No, no, I'm just saying that I agree.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.760]   It's not unique.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:26.760]   I agree with you.
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:27.760]   It's not unique.
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.440]   I made it clear, I don't think it's a good idea.
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:33.840]   I just wanted to say that if everybody's got all this outrage at Apple, then they need
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.320]   to get busy with their outrage times, everything else.
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:37.320]   It's a good sense.
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.320]   I agree.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.320]   There are a lot of companies that do this.
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.320]   And I think that those companies should suffer in the marketplace.
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:46.800]   Well, I think the record industry may, you know, the record industry and the film industry,
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:50.360]   you know, they may, what I think is going to happen is if they push too hard down this
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:55.320]   path, I mean, Apple has a latent potential to cut them completely out.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:59.360]   I mean, they're making all the tools that are used to produce the content and the tools
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.200]   that are used to distribute the content.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.560]   And they've done a very poor job at tying those things together.
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:07.440]   If they get pushed up against the wall and they start tying those together, there are
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.520]   some, these guys have some serious problems.
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:13.360]   They have more problems than they ever thought that they had before because the reality is
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:17.320]   is that bands like an high-end nail and other people are already starting to prove that
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.320]   they can find other ways.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.320]   Maybe in music.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.320]   I don't know if in film.
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.320]   Well, we'll see.
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:22.320]   Film's expensive.
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:25.320]   I think it's a balance.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:28.600]   I don't think Apple holds all the cards and I don't think the film industry holds all
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.840]   the cards or the music industry holds the cards.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:33.120]   They've got to work together.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.120]   I know.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:37.480]   I just think that forcing Apple down that path is not in their best interests.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:41.120]   You know, and I think that they, because if Apple got serious about that, it's not that
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:44.200]   they would suddenly take them over, but they would do a lot of damage.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:48.120]   You know, there's a lot of, you know, that market, the online video market is building
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:49.120]   up.
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.320]   I mean, you know, we're witnessing a lot of it in a lot of different directions.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:54.600]   When you say it on the side or yesterday writes, afraid that Apple will gain the sort of lock
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.000]   on downloadable video that it did with music.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.240]   Sony and a group of video business heavyweights are planning a new standard that would let
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:07.360]   copy protected movies and TV from any participating service work with many devices, not included,
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:16.400]   by the way, Sony, Fox, Lionsgate, NBC, Universal Paramount, Warner Brothers, Microsoft, Cisco,
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:21.400]   HP Phillips, Toshiba, not on this list, Apple.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:26.520]   Well, if it doesn't work on people's iPods and iPhones, they're going to have a sales
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:27.520]   issue.
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:28.520]   You know what I mean?
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:30.960]   So the thing is, is that they're, you know, we've had that we had this conversation around
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:31.960]   the zoom.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.080]   They sold 13 of them.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:39.080]   You know, I mean, it's just, you can't build a competitor based on, well, we're going to
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:43.840]   freeze out iPods and that's what's going to work because iPods are the dominant player.
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.920]   Well, and they're just not, they're still not paying attention to the user interface.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:50.640]   I mean, they're not paying attention to the fact that, you know, it's, it can be painful
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.840]   to buy on these other things.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.560]   It's not as, it's not as tightly wrapped.
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:54.560]   It's not as easy to do.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:59.080]   I mean, when I want to buy I apps, you know, it's, it's, you know, fluent.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:02.640]   The closest competitor I've seen is the Amazon music store.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.640]   That's the closest.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:06.480]   And I buy Amazon is also not included in this list.
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.480]   Now that's really interesting.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.800]   Amazon and Tivo are both left out.
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:14.800]   That and I see that's crazy to me that we got another.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:18.560]   I mean, how many times these people got to get smacked around before they realize this
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.880]   that they always do this stuff and they fail.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.320]   And then, you know, they keep coming back for more.
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:30.240]   It's like the monster in the sci-fi movie that you kill 13 times and it never really dies.
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.720]   Yeah, I don't.
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:32.720]   Yeah, I don't really understand.
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:33.920]   But it's, but it's consumers.
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.880]   We don't want any one store to be too successful.
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:37.880]   That's, that's correct.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:38.880]   We do.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:43.720]   I mean, to have all the 10, look, as consumers, we don't want to invest in stuff that six
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:47.000]   weeks from now is not going to work anymore because they bailed out on it because it didn't
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   get traction.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.600]   And that's what one thing we see.
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:53.320]   And the thing is, is that if, if you have something, the bottom line is, is that this
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.320]   whole DRM stuff is just going to go away.
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:58.320]   I mean, if it, if it doesn't, they're going to, they're going to ride this one all the
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:01.000]   way to the bottom of the sea, you know, I know, well, that's the other thing.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.240]   I mean, you know, great.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.240]   New DRM system.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.240]   That'll fix everything.
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.520]   I mean, that's not the future.
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.240]   We've already seen that that's not going to be the future.
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.240]   And what would happen to this?
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:12.400]   What would happen to the scenario if iTunes did, in fact, make the switch to subscription
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.400]   music?
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:16.320]   Well, I don't know if they'll let them be safe.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:21.840]   There's some other reason Apple hasn't done that is because the record labels won't let
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:22.840]   them.
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:27.680]   If Apple switched to subscription, if they added that as another feature, it'd be over.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:30.320]   They knew that, but that's, but that's, so that's would be a good reason why they're
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.800]   the record companies not to let them do that.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:33.800]   It would be.
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:36.800]   It's the last little, it's the last little bit of oxygen floating around.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:37.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.040]   It's very interesting.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:45.280]   I just, you know, I guess I'm just too close to this and I just want a podcasting app on
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.520]   the iPhone.
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:47.520]   There are web-based.
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:48.960]   I want it called iTunes.
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.640]   Well, and there's fly tunes and there are web-based ways to do this.
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:55.120]   And there's, you know, podcaster.fm, which lets you do it streaming.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.120]   Sure.
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:02.400]   But, but no, but iTunes, what I want is something that you can natively subscribe to podcasts
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.800]   on the phone.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.160]   I think everybody wants that.
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:15.080]   So I think, and I think that what needs to happen is instead of the complaints and the,
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:21.160]   you know, the screaming and the whining, somebody ought to say, okay, let's try to sit down
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:24.160]   with Apple and see what they would allow.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:25.880]   Let's see if we can work out a compromise.
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:27.480]   Well, are they telling people ahead of time?
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.480]   I mean, that's the question.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:32.720]   I mean, this sounds, I mean, can you go to Apple and say, hey, if I made this application,
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:33.720]   would you allow it?
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.720]   I don't think they're saying.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:38.800]   Well, I don't know, but I know that that certainly would be one way to try to do this
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:44.760]   rather than, you know, this Fort mentality that whiner and people like that are trying
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:45.760]   to advocate.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:46.760]   I think there's another way.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:49.440]   And to be fair, I think Apple does need to get better about communicating what the rules
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:50.440]   are.
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:51.440]   Absolutely.
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:53.200]   I think that's one of the, it's, it's, it comes down to me.
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:57.160]   We deal with this in our business all the time is that, is that what the biggest issue
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.560]   for any company is managing expectations.
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:03.920]   You know, and so, and so Apple's not obviously not properly managing people's expectations,
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:07.320]   and that's what's causing a lot of the upset that we're seeing right now.
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:08.320]   And that's there.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:12.760]   That's always been their weakest link as, as a consumer of their products, from my point
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:14.680]   of view, that's always been what they're worst at.
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:17.040]   They, they kind of don't seem to care.
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:19.000]   Sometimes they do what they do.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.440]   And then you either buy it or you don't, but I agree that that would help a lot.
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:24.160]   And I still think it's worth a try.
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:28.800]   If I'm a developer, I'm going to at least try to have that conversation and see what happens.
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.520]   And maybe there is some middle ground.
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:31.800]   Maybe somebody would work with you.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:32.800]   You never know.
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:37.720]   I guess I have, you know, I have 40 ideas for iPhone apps and I just pick the ones that
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.440]   I don't think I'm going to have any trouble with.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:40.640]   You know, and I mean, how do you know?
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:45.640]   I mean, Apple says it's because it duplicates functionality already existing, but so does
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:46.640]   a calculator.
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:48.640]   How do you know?
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:49.640]   Apple.
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:51.640]   There's no revenue stream attached to that.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:52.640]   Maybe Apple.
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:57.000]   They don't charge you by the number that you compute.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.960]   You know, if there's money coming to them through, you know, some other activity attached
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.440]   to the phone, I think you're going to run into these kinds of problems when you try
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:06.920]   to duplicate that functionality.
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:10.280]   Well, and I think that there's not money coming into their into their pockets related to their
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:14.680]   podcasting, but I still think that what happens is it's a precedent that it lays down that
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:18.320]   opens them up to other things coming in from Amazon because then they'll be saying, well,
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.880]   you didn't block this.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.600]   But why are you blocking ours?
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:22.600]   Right.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.760]   And there's a legal precedent that I think becomes more complicated for Apple down the
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:28.720]   road if they don't take a pretty hard stance in content distribution.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.120]   And I don't know if it's the case here.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:35.960]   But once again, there is always the issue of you can bet the very last penny in your
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:42.440]   in the in the Leoville bank account, Leo, that if we if Apple doesn't do something like
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:45.280]   this, they will be sued by their shareholders.
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:47.320]   Oh, okay.
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.320]   You can just count on it.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:49.320]   Yeah, no, you're right.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.360]   Because they have a responsibility to them to protect profits.
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:52.360]   Absolutely.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.560]   So there, you know, no matter what Apple does, it's going to piss off one of its
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:55.560]   things.
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:56.560]   It's in the happy.
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:57.560]   It's a situation.
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:00.960]   You know, and on the face of it, a podcasting app doesn't take away revenue.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:06.120]   But I guess if you could use RSS to distribute paying music and I mean, it opens the door
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:07.360]   to something.
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:09.440]   I think I think Alex hit it right on the head.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:14.440]   If they started down that road, they'd be they'd be in trouble later for not continuing.
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:19.480]   Now, I once again, I reiterate, I think there should be a better fix to this than this approach.
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:21.280]   I think they should communicate better.
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:25.280]   But I don't I don't really think this is going to have any significant or even noticeable
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:27.880]   negative impact on the company.
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:28.880]   Developers will continue to develop.
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.800]   And if Weiner doesn't want to develop, there are 15 guys behind him.
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:32.800]   They're saying good.
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:33.800]   That means I get a shot.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.080]   Hey, we're going to take a break.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:43.120]   When we come back, I've got a really cool trick that iPhone 2.1 enabled a little trick
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.200]   you could do with the little mic button on your headphones.
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:49.440]   But first, it's time to mention our good friends at Drobo.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:55.880]   The Drobo intelligent automated storage device, the data robots from data robotics, it combines
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:47:00.600]   up to four hard drives into a single drive, a single massive giant drive that is not only
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:10.240]   gigantic, but also secure because your Drobo is using a technique that protects data.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.240]   You lose one drive.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.240]   No problem.
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:13.240]   You pop it out.
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:17.520]   You pop in a new one and you're good to go without the loss of a single bit of data.
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:20.080]   Data redundancy and high capacity.
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:21.080]   That's Drobo.
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:25.560]   Now, the new second generation Drobo's have Firewire 800 and USB 2.0.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:28.120]   So you get twice as fast performance.
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:32.440]   You get the same safety, the same expandability, the same ease of use.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.680]   And now you get Firewire 2.
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:40.520]   Great for time machine, great for storing stuff, bootable backups even.
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:44.920]   Visit Drobo.com/Macbreak to learn more about Drobo and instantly get $25 off.
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:45.920]   You get your choice.
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:51.880]   $25 off the new second generation Drobo with Firewire 800 or $25 off the original Drobo
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:56.520]   offered now at a reduced price off for good through October 31st, 2008.
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:01.960]   If you've got stuff to store, you need a Drobo, my friend.
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:02.960]   I like my, I love my Drobo.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:04.720]   I just remember that too.
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:10.640]   Once all your stuff is stored on a Drobo, you feel very droopy.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:11.640]   Somebody made a feeling droopy.
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:12.640]   Hold on a second.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:17.760]   I get a pause and turn on that track here so that you can hear it.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:21.560]   Somebody actually made somebody actually, I don't remember his name.
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:24.000]   I wish I did, but somebody made a cut.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.800]   We have two jingles.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.600]   This is a feeling droopy.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.600]   I said, this is a feeling droopy.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:33.600]   DR-O-B-O-D-R-O-B-O.
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:34.600]   Drobo.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:35.600]   Feeling droopy.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:42.520]   That's Paul Minshell did that one.
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:46.760]   I'm going to put all of your stuff on a Drobo.
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.600]   Remember I asked for the old style radio jingles?
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:51.600]   Oh man.
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:53.600]   That one is by Jeff Smith.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:54.600]   I love it.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:55.600]   I like this.
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.600]   This is so sweet.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:57.600]   Jeff.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.600]   Put all of your stuff on a Drobo.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:03.440]   Agents, we're back with the brand new one from the Beach Boys.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:04.440]   Doesn't sound like that.
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:05.440]   I feel radio.
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:08.440]   I love it.
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:12.080]   So, so, so here is the most useful trick.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:15.840]   Of all, from iPhone 2.1.
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:20.200]   And I wouldn't have known this except for the Ultimate Apple Web Log.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:23.120]   You can triple click the phone thing.
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:27.360]   You know, so, okay, so you know the when you're wearing the headphones, the microphone
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:32.560]   headphone, you press once to pause a song, press twice to go to the next song.
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:37.240]   Now on 2.1 you press three times, you go back to the previous song.
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:38.240]   Is that not cool?
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:41.720]   I don't have the old iPhone, the whole headphones.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:42.720]   That's the only problem.
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:43.720]   Well, they came with it.
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:45.080]   I know, but I don't use them.
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:49.000]   I mean, I, if it doesn't, if it's not like surgically implanted into my ear, I just don't
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   want to.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.600]   Well, I have, I have, I should make this my pick then of the week because I got the new
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:58.240]   Etymodix H, I don't know what they call the HR's.
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:59.240]   I can't remember.
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:00.720]   They're for the iPhone.
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:03.880]   And, you know, they had the original ones that had the, for the recessed jack, and this
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:05.440]   is for the new 3G.
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:08.960]   And it has the little clicker on it too.
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:12.000]   And, you know, you love, but you're a sure guy, right?
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   Or no?
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   I have.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.720]   So I have a, I have three different ones.
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:20.240]   I have the ultimate ears, the ones that work with the iPhone, but they're on, I sent them
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:21.240]   backside.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:22.400]   I destroyed them.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.680]   And so I'm getting a new one.
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:27.120]   And, and then I have the sure, the threes.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:28.840]   I don't know what the SC3 is.
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.400]   These are basically ER4s with the, with the microphone on them.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:37.560]   And then, and then I have the, and then I have the Vodah, the Vodah ones.
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:38.560]   Oh yeah.
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:40.920]   There's, there's an expensive, they're a little basic.
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:42.480]   They're the, they're the least expensive.
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.280]   They're a little basic.
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:47.720]   The, I think the ultimate ears of the ones that I have are the night sound the best,
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:51.840]   but the wiry, you know, they're much more wiry.
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:54.480]   They have like a wire metal wire or whatever.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:56.120]   And I find them harder to travel with.
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:57.680]   The sure ones don't sound as good.
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:59.400]   Don't sound quite as good.
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:00.400]   They all sound better though.
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:04.080]   If you get the sure, the triple flange and you put them on all of them.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.080]   They all sound better.
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.080]   Well, that's why I use edimodics because I like the triple flange on that.
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:09.280]   I just get the sure edimodics fan, you know that.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:11.280]   Yeah.
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.680]   Anyway, that, that'll work with those too.
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:15.800]   If you have the little clicker, do you have a microphone on the ones you use?
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:19.800]   I have a microphone on the ultimate ear ones and the Vodah one and not the ear ones.
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:21.680]   You don't have to use the Apple headsets.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:22.920]   Any clicker will do that.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:23.920]   Okay.
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:24.920]   Very good.
[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:25.920]   Click three times.
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:27.160]   Click three times on the iPod.
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:31.520]   If you like this song, if you want to go back to Tony.
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:32.520]   All right.
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:33.520]   I'm not gonna sing.
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:36.240]   I'm gonna let Jeff Smith do all this singing.
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:38.960]   And Apple employee, I love this.
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:45.480]   Weihan Lien is on LinkedIn and perhaps was a little too candid on LinkedIn.
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:48.920]   You know, that's the site where you put your job, what you're doing, make connections,
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:50.240]   networking and stuff.
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:52.520]   Little too candid on his job title.
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:52:00.000]   He says he's managing the ARM CPU team for the iPhone.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.320]   So I guess we know that they'll be using arms in future, future iPhones.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:06.320]   Whoopsie.
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:07.320]   Not anymore.
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:08.320]   Not me.
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:10.320]   Maybe he's not working.
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:13.760]   He just got a job in April.
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:19.840]   We just heard from him and he said, would you like fries with that?
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:20.840]   Yeah.
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:21.840]   Whoopsie.
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:25.840]   Whoever thought of that, you know, gotta be careful about what you say about your job
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:28.080]   title on LinkedIn.
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:34.120]   Also an update on Monday, Google announced Google gears will now work with Safari.
[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:38.400]   You guys probably haven't used Google gears because you're Safari users, but it really
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.400]   is great.
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:47.800]   Gears allows you to use Google Docs, Soho office, other JavaScript web apps offline.
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:50.880]   So that's very handy.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:55.480]   Google gears, they've also released a new, oh, you don't care about that Google desktop.
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:56.480]   That's Windows only.
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:57.840]   We don't care.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:59.800]   You don't care about that, do you?
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:00.800]   Try Google gears.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:01.800]   I haven't tried it yet.
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:03.520]   Do you have a different shot?
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:05.120]   Are you Firefox users or Safari users?
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:06.120]   I can't remember.
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.120]   I use both.
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.120]   Okay.
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:09.920]   I don't use Firefox at all.
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:11.920]   Firefox means you would.
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:12.920]   Yeah.
[00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:17.120]   I'm going to go back to Safari.
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:22.240]   In the latest version of Firefox and the latest version of OS 10, I just find it not
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.400]   to be very stable.
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:28.280]   So that's the, for me, the just stability issues with Firefox, things not working,
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:31.880]   it crashing that I don't have as much of with Safari.
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:32.880]   So that's the reason.
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:36.400]   For a long time, I was using Firefox 90% of the time.
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:39.200]   And I've been slowly using more and more Safari because I just know what to work.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:46.040]   I like the add-ons to Firefox, but what convinced me, believe it or not, was Google Chrome.
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:49.840]   So Chrome is this great fast browser, Windows only, based on WebKit.
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:52.680]   And I'm thinking, well, what's based on WebKit on the Mac?
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:54.280]   Oh, yeah, Safari.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:55.280]   Right.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:54:00.280]   Hey, I did see a guy at Hotel and Anchorage.
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:02.760]   They had Windows machines for people to use.
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:05.120]   And I was sitting in the lounge right behind that area.
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:08.520]   And there was a guy there and he was like, I hate this stupid explorer.
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:09.680]   Is there any other browser on there?
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:12.080]   And I walked over, I said, we'll see if they got Safari.
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:15.480]   He pulled Safari up and it was just blinding fast, even on the PC.
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:16.480]   It is really fast.
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.480]   Yeah.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:21.640]   But I also use Camino when I have trouble with compatibility because it seems to be the one
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:27.480]   that generates web pages best for people that have compiled them for use on Windows
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:28.480]   machines.
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:31.080]   And that's always oddly enough based on the Firefox engine.
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:35.520]   Yeah, that's interesting to me because it definitely is easier to use for me than Firefox,
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.160]   but it's definitely not as fast.
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:40.840]   Well, what it is is basically a cocoa Firefox.
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:41.840]   I see.
[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:42.840]   Yeah.
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:45.360]   And so I guess it's using the Gecko engine.
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:48.560]   Now, I don't know if it's benefiting from the latest Firefox editions.
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:54.400]   For that matter, I don't know if Safari is benefiting from the latest updates that Google
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:55.880]   Chrome is adding to WebKit.
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:55:00.160]   So you can still get WebKit.org, you can still get the WebKit browser.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:05.360]   Has Google let on any time any made any predictions as to about when they might release that for
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:06.360]   the Mac?
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:08.400]   You know, I think they did the Linux really quickly.
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:09.720]   I don't, you know, it's based on WebKit.
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:11.840]   It can't take them very long.
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:13.000]   I wouldn't hold my breath though.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   You know who has done it?
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.720]   This is actually kind of interesting.
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:22.000]   The folks at Wine have made a crossover office version of Chrome called Chromium.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.120]   And just more to show that they can do it.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:28.880]   You know, that crossover office lets you do seamless Windows apps on Mac.
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:34.880]   So they took Chrome and they made it run on a Mac, even though it's a Windows app, but
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:36.720]   it runs seamlessly on a Mac.
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:39.080]   So that's kind of cool.
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:42.120]   I need the kind of spare time all these people have.
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:43.120]   Exactly.
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:48.200]   If you weren't taking so many spare pictures, I mean, how do you get the kind of spare time
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:50.600]   to even complain about the things people complain about?
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:55.280]   The other thing is their version of taking bare pictures is making something worth just
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:56.280]   trying to write.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:57.280]   That's exactly right.
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:01.920]   I go to Africa, you shoot pictures of bears, you know, it's like Chromium.
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:03.520]   That's simple.
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:06.280]   I sit on a ball and do 40 hours of TV a week.
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:09.040]   It's just, you know, that's to each his own.
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:10.360]   That's too much information.
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:16.120]   Then I probably shouldn't tell you the ball is blue.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.320]   And really comfy.
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:18.320]   It's squishy.
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:20.040]   I inflated my ball a little bit.
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:21.240]   Now it's just much.
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:23.600]   Oh, just really much nicer.
[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:24.600]   I made a lot of money.
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:25.840]   I'm passing on the 151.
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:28.480]   It's just, I know you're good, Scott.
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:34.800]   An amazing sense of forbearance for trying to keep the clean tag installed here on this
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:42.320]   day in history, ladies and gentlemen, September 16, 1997, 11 years ago, Steve Jobs agreed to
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:48.840]   work for $1 a year running Apple until they found another CEO.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:53.720]   Gilomeo had left Steve says, I don't want this job, but I'll, you know, I love Apple.
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:55.680]   I bleed rainbow colors.
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:56.680]   All right.
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:57.680]   I'll just, I'll do it.
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:03.480]   I'm going to call myself though, not the CEO, but the interim CEO, the eye CEO spawning,
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:08.080]   by the way, all of those other eye things that came from Apple later.
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:10.560]   He was the temporary CEO 11 years later.
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:16.240]   He's not working for a dollar a year anymore, but he is still the temporary CEO.
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:18.760]   I guess he dropped the eye after a while.
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.840]   How is it possible that that was 11 years ago?
[00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:22.200]   It just seems like 15 minutes ago.
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:23.200]   I know.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:26.600]   What is he amazing what he's done with this company in 11 years?
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:30.200]   One year, if you look at it with that lens, Leo, it changes everything.
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:31.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:37.680]   One year later, he released the iMac, the Bondi Blue iMac, the first eye product than the
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:38.680]   eye.
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:42.160]   In many ways, I feel like they, what he did is just literally pick up from where he left
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:46.440]   off in 1986, you know, so he was basically gone for 11 years.
[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:51.200]   And you know, after he pushed out and Apple just kind of, I think Apple mostly just existed
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:54.040]   on the momentum that he created in the first place.
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:57.640]   And then, and then, and then he just came back in and created a new Mac and got right
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:01.440]   back to where, you know, this is what the Mac would look like in 1997 and then pushed
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:02.440]   forward.
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:05.720]   There are people who would argue with you in that, including Steve Wozniak.
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:10.640]   Steve likes Emilio, Steve says Gil had already put into place a number of the things that
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:12.320]   happened after Jobs took over.
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:16.600]   No, I'm not, I agree with you, Alex, but there, but there are people who say, Oh, no, give
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:17.880]   Gil a little bit of credit.
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:22.160]   Some of the things that he put into place are, you know, things that Steve Jobs is now taking
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:23.160]   credit for.
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:24.160]   I don't know what they are.
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:25.160]   I don't know what they are.
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:29.640]   I, I guess I feel like what, what a lot of guys put in place was the most complex product
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:31.840]   line I have ever seen in my life.
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:32.840]   Oh, awful.
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:36.380]   I need to buy my parents and Mac and got so confused that I just didn't buy anything
[00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:38.640]   because it was like, there were so many options.
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:41.400]   I could have a CD or I could have a video or I could have this or I could have that.
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:44.480]   And it's the most messed up thing I had ever seen in my entire life.
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:49.000]   And pink and Copeland, but we do have to give Gil credit for making the most important
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   transaction of Apple's life, which was acquiring next, which is the basis for OS 10.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.560]   And in the same time getting this guy who started next, Steve, somebody.
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:01.720]   And, and so that was, you know, if you're going to say, Gil did something right, that
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:03.600]   was one thing he did right.
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:04.600]   Right.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:07.000]   He sealed his doom.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:11.600]   Maybe that was the thing he did right.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:14.480]   He hired his replacement when you're an alpha when you're an alpha male, you don't bring
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:17.400]   another alpha male into the, the group.
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:19.400]   How did Scully chase jobs out?
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:22.160]   That's just kind of hard to believe.
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:26.200]   And why, you know, in retrospect, that was such a dumb thing to do.
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:30.560]   Somebody sent me in the chat room mentioned by the way that guess this is on boing, boing,
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:35.400]   guess what Apple device, portable device, handheld device using a touchscreen had cut
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:37.400]   and paste.
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:38.960]   Newton, the Newton.
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:39.960]   Yeah.
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:43.080]   If it's so hard to do, how come the Newton could do it?
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:44.080]   The Newton had it.
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:45.080]   We don't.
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:46.080]   And remember was a gesture.
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:47.760]   It was a slash and a paste.
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:48.760]   It's very easy.
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:51.360]   Can we go back to the next for a second?
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:52.360]   Yes.
[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:54.120]   I just want to say I bought one of those.
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:55.120]   You did.
[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:56.120]   I did.
[00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:57.120]   And you know why?
[00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:58.120]   Why?
[00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:00.360]   Because it had a risk chip and that was a big deal back.
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:03.480]   Hey, you know, you don't still have your next cube, do you?
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:04.480]   I don't.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.480]   I wish I did.
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:06.760]   Be beautiful, wouldn't it?
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:09.120]   Man, it was only a 68 68,000.
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:12.160]   It had Motorola 88,000 in it.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.160]   Oh, it was.
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.160]   Yeah.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.960]   68,000 80, I thought 88,000.
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:22.720]   Well, no, the 60, 80 30 was in there, but they you can do a 88,000 risk chip.
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.600]   Oh, so you got it with the right.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:25.600]   I get it.
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:26.600]   Yeah.
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:30.200]   And I'm the whole thing that attracted me was, you know, back then, like,
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:34.400]   you know, in the late 80s, risk, that's what you had in supercomputers.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.400]   Right.
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:37.800]   It was the future computing until it turned out it wasn't.
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:41.520]   I know, but my God, at the time, I was just beside myself.
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.520]   Yeah.
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:46.280]   I've got a risk computer and it was so cool as a black cube.
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:49.600]   I would walk up to go, Hey, baby, I got a risk chip.
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:50.600]   Mm.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.640]   That really got me far too.
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:52.640]   I bet it did.
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:53.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:56.440]   And I paid like 10 grand for the stupid.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.440]   Oh, I know.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.000]   But what a great piece of hardware.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.160]   That's a, I will go down in history.
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:05.240]   I also bought the Silicon graphics indie web force for 15,000.
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:06.480]   The purple computer.
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:07.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:12.280]   That had a $1,500 cable Leo between the monitor and CPU.
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:16.120]   You had to buy it from them because if you broke, there was no way to reconfigure it.
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:19.080]   And SGI is in business.
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:20.080]   No more.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:21.080]   No more.
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:24.200]   But they did have the best, the best computer at the time.
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:25.600]   So I was great machine.
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.600]   Yeah.
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:31.240]   And speaking of all these thefts of ideas, I can go back further.
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:41.040]   Vowdox, my friend, Steve stole the idea from Xerox who created Vowdox on the Epson.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.200]   On the Epson.
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:46.920]   On the CPM running Epson, they threw the first GUI out there called Vowdox.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:47.920]   I worked on the project.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:48.920]   Oh, you did.
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:49.920]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:50.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:55.480]   A 72 40 display chip, which had an inherent ROM based GUI.
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:58.520]   The chip had a GUI that was connected through the chip.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:01.240]   Yep, through the graphics chip.
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.440]   And Steve stole that idea, in my opinion.
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.680]   So well, they licensed it.
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:09.920]   Yeah, later, later, later, man.
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:11.320]   But anyway, I just couldn't help it.
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.480]   I had to go off on the next because I love that computer.
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:14.480]   I was so proud of it.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.480]   Oh, no, that's just.
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:18.520]   Now it wouldn't keep up with like, you know, an EPC.
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:19.520]   Well, that's the funny thing.
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:24.080]   I mean, your iMac on your desktop now is faster than the indie and the next and the
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.440]   Vowdox all combined.
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:26.680]   I mean, it's in that crazy.
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:29.600]   We have so much power on a desktop and it's good.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:35.840]   And I mean, honestly, this is the new iMac for the latest, the latest, most recent aluminum
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:36.840]   iMac.
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.680]   That is a gorgeous work of art.
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:39.680]   It is.
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:42.520]   It looks like something you'd found in a science fiction movie 30 years ago.
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:46.440]   The whole thing in that little box wouldn't be possible without the next.
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:47.440]   That's right.
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:51.600]   It all started when Gil Emelio brought in the next.
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:52.600]   He said this is going to be.
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:58.080]   Remember, it was could have been a BOS could have been Jean-Louis Gasey's returned to Apple.
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.440]   That would have been OK.
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.440]   So they had the choice.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:04.160]   BOS was John Louis or the next was Steve.
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:10.520]   Yeah, John Louis Gasey could be running Apple right now or the hole in the ground that used
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.680]   to be Apple.
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:14.200]   Yeah, it's time for our Mac break picks.
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:17.040]   But before we do that, I want to do a audible pick.
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:22.840]   This show brought to you as always by the good folks at audible audible.com/macbreak.

[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:42.880]   A lot of them are free.
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:47.840]   You can go back in time and listen to some of the best speeches of all time.
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:54.760]   You can if you're Ricky Gervais fan, remember they Ricky moved his podcast to audible
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:55.880]   from free to paid.
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:58.160]   It didn't do so well.
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:00.320]   Now you can get it all for 495.
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:06.520]   The Ricky Gervais show complete fifth season for five bucks.
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:07.880]   Two hours.
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:09.000]   It could be your free book though.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:15.240]   I'll tell you, if you've not listened to Ricky, Steve Merchant and Karl Pilkington, what
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:18.000]   a it is a funny show.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.080]   He does such a great job.
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.200]   All of the seasons are on there.
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:26.520]   The first season, the complete second season, the complete third season plus the podfather
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:33.280]   trilogy, which is season four and then season five of the let me play a little bit just
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:34.280]   just because I can.
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:38.160]   Hello, if you'd be a funny part of it.
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:42.000]   He's a guy who created the office in the UK.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   See, Karl, when he disses all these great inventions and design, which says you don't
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.760]   need them, it's just faffing, what he means is, is a little bit annoyed that no one's
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:56.640]   picked up on his ideas, like the clippable mat for the mug or, I don't know, cat mops.
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.120]   I don't know, it wasn't yours.
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:04:59.120]   Nor was the tie.
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:00.120]   Was it the stupid tie.
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:01.120]   What's that?
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:02.120]   What's the one about the tie?
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:04.480]   The tie that had a pocket.
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.480]   Loads pockets.
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:06.480]   But I didn't come up with that.
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.160]   That's something I saw somewhere.
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.680]   Never caught on.
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:11.120]   I've never seen anyone wearing one yet.
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:12.120]   He's such a good.
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:13.120]   It's not a good idea.
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.320]   It's like having a carrier bag round your neck.
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:16.840]   Anyway, you get the idea.
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:20.120]   It's actually just a hoot.
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:25.280]   I may make that our pick unless you guys have something else you want to pick from audible.com.
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:27.280]   Sounds good to me.
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:29.480]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:33.840]   Did you take any audio books with you, Alex, on your jaunts around the world?
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.440]   I took the Spartans.
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:39.880]   I knew you were going to say that.
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:41.640]   You must be done with that by now.
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:44.600]   No, no, I was down.
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:48.080]   I'm in the midst of downloading one that I was listening to and I'm just trying to find
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.080]   it right now.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:50.080]   You say this way.
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:51.080]   That's it.
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:54.720]   You know, I've been kind of, I still have been kind of re-downloaded one that I've been
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.720]   listening to.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.720]   It's pretty funny.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:00.920]   I learned from the women who dumped me.
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:04.320]   It was just one of those things that it was, someone said it was really, really funny.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:05.560]   I started listening to it.
[01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:06.560]   It's actually pretty good.
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:08.360]   I haven't, I just got into it.
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:12.160]   It's not like I, because I've learned a lot from the women who've dumped me.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:16.240]   I was going to trade notes and see if I had learned the same things.
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:17.240]   Maybe different things.
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:18.240]   My wife says I'm very well behaved.
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.040]   You're well trained, is what it is.
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:23.440]   No, and I try to explain to her that I was very well trained.
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:24.880]   I didn't come this way.
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.120]   I didn't come out of the box this way.
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:32.240]   I was, I was hewn painfully oftentimes into the man I am today.
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.480]   Why you don't want to marry an inexperienced young man.
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.920]   You want one that's been previously trained.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:39.560]   How spoken has it were?
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:42.960]   So I've been kind of tooling through that.
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:45.240]   And then I, you know, the other ones, I'm very ADD.
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:49.000]   So I'm listening to, I'm re-listening to Collapse by Jared Diamond.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   That's an amazing book.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.960]   Barack Obama's The Audacity of Hope and the Spartans.
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:54.960]   See, they may be.
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.720]   I'm just the areas of my expertise.
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:01.280]   Oh, is that a previous Mac Break Weekly Pick of the Week by John Hodgeman.
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:03.040]   I listened to that while I was on the yacht.
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.040]   He's a fan of the show, by the way.
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:06.480]   And we're going to have him on next month, I think.
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:11.360]   If you want to listen to an audiobook that will guarantee, make you laugh, get that one.
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:14.880]   Well, his next book will come out and will be out on Audible in October.
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.040]   And he's going to come on the show when it comes out.
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:20.320]   So we'll maybe even get a personal reading from John Hodgeman.
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.160]   I mean, he's PC.
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:25.520]   We can forgive him for being PC on the IMA Mac commercials, right?
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:30.280]   Well, we want to just be able to have a chance to riff off that and do the Mac part against
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.520]   him and see what happens.
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:36.480]   He credits, you know, I got an email from him in which he says, "This is my first acting
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:38.480]   gig.
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:42.800]   Justin Long, give Justin Long a lot of credit."
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:46.120]   Even though it's not appearing to do a lot, he's really powering that whole thing.
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:51.760]   He said, "With that, Justin, those spots would not be anywhere near as good."
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:54.480]   Of course, he's a very humble guy, John Hodgeman.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:58.480]   Well, and Justin does have an impeccable sense of timing, which is what makes those bits
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:07:59.480]   work.
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:00.480]   Yeah, you noticed that.
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:02.600]   I think that's very interesting that you noticed that.
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:03.600]   He sent me this note.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:06.240]   He said, "Thanks for saying the other nice words about me the other way."
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:09.400]   He says, "Let me read it because his syntax is great."
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:13.760]   Thank you for saying those nice words the other week regarding me, John Hodgeman.
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:18.320]   As a fan of you, Leo Laport, dating back to early screensavers' days, I was amazed to
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:20.640]   hear my name on your fine podcast.
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:23.560]   It has been a very strange year.
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:27.760]   I am someone who has never acted before those ads were it not for Justin's humor, timing,
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:30.120]   and generosity I would have been lost.
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:35.480]   The ads work because of our chemistry, which I would agree, and indeed the work he has
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:39.520]   to do is much more nuanced and subtle than my buffooning.
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.400]   Were it just up to me?
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:44.640]   They're grooving to an iPod, I think then, and only then could be talking about the ads
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:46.160]   backfiring as it is.
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.840]   They seem to be working just fine.
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:50.400]   Anyway, that was very nice of him to send that along.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:52.720]   Oh, the Audible commercial.
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:53.720]   Audible the...
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:58.680]   So they say these commercials go too long, but really the commercial is just a small slice
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:01.240]   of what we're gassing about.
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:05.280]   Audible.com/MacBreak, go there right now, get your free book.
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:06.280]   It's free.
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:10.040]   It's free, and if you love listening, you'll love Audible.com.
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:12.000]   Enough said.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.400]   Now it is time for our picks of the week.
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:19.200]   I'm going to go first because last week I'll let the other guys go first and they stole
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:25.200]   my pick.
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:27.200]   So this one is actually something we've picked before.
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:33.560]   If VMware 2.0 is now out, if you're more fusion, well worth getting, they've really tuned
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:34.560]   it.
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.560]   I go back and forth between parallels and VMware.
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:42.040]   These are the programs that let you run Windows or other operating systems on your desktop.
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:48.600]   Sometimes I use parallel, sometimes VMware, but the new VMware fusion is very fast.
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:49.760]   They used to do a really good job.
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:51.880]   I haven't benchmarked the two.
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:52.880]   It's really a seesaw.
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:55.680]   Parallel's three comes out, then VMware Fusion 2 comes out.
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:59.880]   It's back and forth, but if you think of that, this program has only been out for a year on
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:00.880]   the Mac.
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:01.880]   It's their first Mac product.
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:03.400]   It's very impressive.
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:09.560]   So I'm really picking this by way of saying if you already own VMware Fusion, as I do,
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:15.800]   it might be worth running out and seeing if 2.0 has added any features that you want.
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:18.080]   I think we have VMware on every...
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.080]   I love it.
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:20.520]   Every Intel computer we have.
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:21.520]   Did you upgrade?
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:22.520]   Yeah, not yet.
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:23.680]   I just got back.
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:24.680]   You guys just got back.
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:25.680]   You slow to upgrade, I know.
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:29.480]   Well, I just haven't gotten to it yet, but yeah, we're going to be upgrading over the
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:30.480]   next week or two.
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:31.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:34.040]   I'm never upgrading because I'm never running Windows on my Mac.
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:36.040]   You don't need it, do you?
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.040]   No.
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.400]   You ever want to run the Linux on your Mac?
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:42.880]   No, because I don't know how.
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:44.460]   You're just happy with the Mac.
[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:45.460]   I'm happy with the Mac.
[01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:47.280]   That's why I'm on this show called Mac Break Weekly.
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:48.040]   It's crazy.
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:49.040]   It happens from time to time for instance.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.040]   See the world though.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:52.640]   Just because you're American doesn't mean you can't visit France.
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.240]   Listen, I am the pure blood Mac user.
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:56.240]   I'm the...
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:57.240]   Yes, it is pure vampire...
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:58.240]   I am the pure vampire...
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:11.320]   ...
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:16.640]   However, occasionally comes up as it did yesterday, somebody sent me a PowerPoint presentation.
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:17.640]   It was...
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:18.640]   I know.
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:19.640]   On purpose?
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:23.920]   Yeah, I could open a keynote, but I wouldn't get all the flash stuff that they did.
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:27.520]   I had it, but it's not so bad.
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:30.640]   By the way, one cool thing that you could do with VMware Fusion, I really like this new
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.040]   feature.
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:35.800]   If you do have a running Windows installation, I mean, Scott, just plug your ears here.
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:39.080]   If you have a running Windows installation on another computer, you can actually download
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:44.360]   a VMware tool that will encapsulate it, and then you could just take the existing...
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:49.920]   From a PC, take that file, put it on your Mac, and open it in VMware.
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:51.680]   Duplicating it is very cool.
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:57.200]   It also has a kind of a time machine like automated backup, which is very important if
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:01.320]   you're using Windows, because you're going to get infested with bugs and viruses, but
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:06.200]   you can immediately go back in time and to a safer time.
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:08.320]   I think they've done a nice job.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:14.320]   I saw benchmarks from a Mac tech six months ago that said Parallels was faster, but I
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:17.800]   really have to compare the new Parallels with the new VMware, and I haven't done that yet.
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:21.280]   They both seem pretty darn slick at a split to me, especially if you don't try to use
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.280]   Vista.
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:24.960]   You can get in trouble if Vista is just a hog.
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:26.520]   Use XP in your say.
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:30.200]   So that's my pick, VMware.com, VMware Fusion.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:33.560]   It's about a tenth of an Alex if you haven't already bought it.
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.200]   Alex, Lindsay, you're trying.
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:36.680]   I have an iPhone pick.
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:37.680]   All right.
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:45.880]   I bought all these iPhone apps and I like a lot of them, but the one that I'm just starting
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:47.760]   to test that I really like a lot is true phone.
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:49.280]   Have you guys played with true phone at all?
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:50.280]   No, what's that?
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:51.920]   True phone is a VoIP.
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:54.680]   Oh, no, it's VoIP.
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:55.680]   It's VoIP.
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:57.280]   How did that get through?
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:59.520]   That's what I had to say.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.440]   So it only works with it.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.440]   I was like, I looked at it.
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:05.360]   I can't believe this would work because so I had this issue.
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:08.560]   The reason I got it was that I had this issue in Zimbabwe where everywhere else in the
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:12.880]   world my iPhone would work in roaming, but it would work.
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:16.440]   And the one place it didn't work is in Zimbabwe, which my first generation did.
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:17.440]   And now this one doesn't.
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:21.520]   By the way, it's surprising how many jailbroken phones you can find in one African country.
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:32.560]   So anyway, so this, it's true phone is it's TRU phone and it allows you to hook via Wi-Fi
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:35.080]   and make phone calls, just like you'd make on Skype or whatever.
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:40.920]   You can't use the GS, you can't use 3G because that would go against the SDK, I think, or
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:43.960]   the requirements, but you can use Wi-Fi.
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:50.680]   And it looks, it just looks and feels a lot very close to your phone interface on your
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:55.480]   iPhone except that you're dialing your doing a VoIP call.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:59.120]   And it's going to cost you, it's going to be like a penny a minute or something like
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:01.320]   that to call out.
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:08.240]   But it is really great in situations, especially where you are either roaming in some other
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:11.560]   country, but you have access to Wi-Fi.
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:17.080]   Or if you are in a place like our office before 2.1, where we couldn't, you know, where I
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:18.640]   wouldn't get great reception.
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:24.960]   And so it's pretty nifty and definitely, and I tested it and I was able to call.
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:27.920]   My brother was very confused about why I was calling while sitting in the same room as
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:31.240]   he was, but it works well.
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:36.520]   I'm surprised you just dial it and you have access to all your contacts, recents, favorites.
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:39.920]   I mean, it feels very, very much like your regular phone.
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:42.120]   And I don't know how much it is, but it's not very expensive.
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:44.600]   You know, it's a pittance, a pittance.
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:48.960]   So, but a true phone, definitely check that out.
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:49.960]   Very cool.
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:52.120]   Did you have you played the new Lucas?
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.160]   What was it, the Star Wars game?
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.160]   I haven't.
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:56.160]   I haven't.
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:57.160]   I unleashed what's it called?
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.160]   I can't remember the name.
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:00.960]   But the things that I've been playing them most is Spore.
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:02.520]   If you guys are playing Spore.
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:03.520]   Love Spore.
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:07.560]   That was like two hours on my flight until I killed my iPhone.
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:08.560]   What a great way.
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:10.160]   Oh, you're playing on the phone.
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:11.160]   I'm not.
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:12.160]   There's Spore on the phone.
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:13.760]   Yeah, but that's just that you got to get the whole game.
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:15.160]   Oh, I know, I know, but I know.
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:16.160]   I know ours.
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.360]   You must have finished it in two hours, right?
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:21.520]   No, I kept on starting and stopping and I kept on experimenting with it.
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:23.440]   It's just the cell part of the...
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.400]   Yeah, it's the cell part of the Spore.
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:26.400]   It was fun, though.
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:29.720]   I was amazed at how much you could do.
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:31.240]   I don't know.
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:35.720]   I'm not very high because I kept on changing the structure of my creature and trying to
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:37.960]   figure out if I could break it and try to eat the bigger things.
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:38.960]   It's fun.
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:39.960]   It's fun.
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:45.720]   I can't play those games because I can't get off a Tiki golf.
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:49.800]   Everybody is raving about Star Wars the Force Unleashed.
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:50.800]   Kuk.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:51.720]   999.
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:54.200]   It looks pretty amazing.
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:57.440]   I mean, it's very 3D.
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:59.800]   I couldn't believe when it comes to 3D it explained.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:00.800]   That's an explain.
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:01.800]   Did you get a mind-bar?
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:02.800]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.200]   I'm sitting there just staring around.
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:05.680]   I don't quite understand what I'm doing.
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:06.680]   I can't fly it either.
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:08.880]   I just kind of crash into the hillside.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.960]   But no, I actually did pretty well.
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:14.520]   I played for a little while and I just have to understand how all the little things work.
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:15.520]   Yeah, I figured out you.
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:17.920]   The throttles on the left, you throttle all the way up, then you remove the brakes and
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:19.320]   then you tilt back and you pull up.
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:20.320]   Yeah.
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:21.320]   I figured that one.
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:23.960]   And then you go into it and then you shoot straight up until you stall out.
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:24.960]   Then you crash.
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:26.520]   It doesn't crash that right.
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:28.400]   It just hits stuff and bounces off.
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:29.400]   Exactly.
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:33.120]   But it's amazing that the iPhone has enough juice to do that is mind-boggling.
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:34.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.200]   I mean, that's just mind-boggling.
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:41.480]   The one thing that I have to say, I drove up the one yesterday from Los Angeles with
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:42.640]   my wife and my son.
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:46.480]   And the one thing that I really wish I think that someone needs to build an app for is
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.680]   actually to cash.
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:56.680]   I would really pay, I pay $59 for just a standard GPS collection of maps.
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:59.880]   Just like so, Tom, Tom just took the maps they've already licensed and just stuck them
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:00.880]   on my phone.
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:04.200]   Because the thing is, is that you're driving up the one and I lose the GPS knows exactly
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:05.360]   where I am.
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:09.360]   But I've now lost connection to Google and I can't get the map.
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:10.360]   I can't do the searches.
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.360]   It has to tell.
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.360]   It has to tell.
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.360]   It has to load the map as you get to the places.
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:14.360]   I guess so.
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:15.360]   It must be cash.
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:16.360]   I wonder if it caches them once you've been somewhere.
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:17.360]   Not enough.
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.920]   Well, you've got somewhere you've not been before.
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:20.920]   Right.
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:24.920]   And so the thing is, is that I'd be happy to just pay for California maps or pay for the
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:29.680]   USA maps or wherever I'm going and not have to deal with hoping that I have a connection
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:33.600]   or a fast connection or whatever while I'm driving.
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:36.360]   That yesterday I was trying to show off to my wife because I'm trying to persuade her
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:42.160]   to buy one, to move her away from a Motorola Razr, which is kind of like rocks.
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:46.440]   She's just hanging on to the clinging on to this horrible piece of little crud.
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:48.080]   And I'm trying to move her to the iPhone.
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:50.440]   And of course half the time it's not connecting.
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:53.440]   It didn't look so frustrating.
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:54.440]   Yeah.
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:58.640]   That's why it's good to let those who don't care have crappy little phones because they
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:17:59.640]   work.
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:00.640]   Always go.
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:05.160]   Well, as you always point out one when mine isn't working, oh yeah, I have a crappy little
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:07.480]   phone, but I have Verizon and I'm getting reception.
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:08.480]   Yeah.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:11.880]   I keep my wife has a Verizon and I just say fine, keep it.
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:12.880]   She says I want an iPhone.
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:15.320]   I said, no, you can't have an iPhone.
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:16.320]   Only one.
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:17.320]   Only one.
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:21.240]   Mr. Scott, born your pick of the week.
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:23.560]   My pick is very exciting.
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:26.080]   I've been waiting for this for quite some time.
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:28.280]   You're going to say some new Nikon camera.
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:29.480]   I'm going to throw it.
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:30.480]   No, it's not.
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:31.480]   It's not.
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:32.840]   It is photo related though.
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:34.760]   Okay.
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:36.720]   My buddy's over at Nick Software.
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:37.720]   I have done that.
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:38.720]   Oh, they do good stuff.
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:44.840]   They have now got Nick Sharpener Pro 3.0 as a plug-in for my favorite photo editing and
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:47.520]   management software aperture.
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:50.160]   So you can also get it for Photoshop too.
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:56.560]   But Sharpener Pro, if you're just sort of like a person who messes around with photography
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:00.160]   and never make prints and don't really care, you probably won't want this.
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:05.760]   But my gosh, if you're serious, first of all, it breaks the sharpening down into two
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:11.240]   different kinds, raw pre-sharpening and output sharpening, which is very important.
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:17.280]   There's a certain amount of information lost automatically when you convert an image through
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:20.400]   a digital camera or a scan.
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:24.880]   And what the raw pre-sharpener does is it helps you restore that.
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:30.600]   Now, this is not a way to correct for poor focus, but it is a way to restore what you've
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:31.720]   lost.
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:37.240]   And then that needs to be independent of what you're going to do when it comes to output,
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:42.560]   because most people that are hobbyists don't realize this, but you need to apply sharpening
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:46.360]   in different amounts and different manner depending on what you're going to do.
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:50.680]   If you're going to put something four by six on the web versus 30 by 40 as a print, you're
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:51.680]   going to hang on the wall.
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.920]   You need different levels of sharpening.
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.400]   And Nick is smart enough to know that.
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:20:00.760]   So they've got this sorted out so that you can say, "Okay, you can pick the exact kind
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:01.760]   of output you want.
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:04.200]   I want it for an online display.
[01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:06.600]   I want it for a print from this kind of printer."
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:07.600]   That's brilliant.
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:13.120]   And the sharpening results are much better than you would typically get, just using your
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:17.920]   own devices or whatever particular sharpening methods you might use in something like Photoshop.
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:24.400]   And I use lots of Photoshop methods to sharpen that I'm happy with, but this is more precise.
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:27.520]   And now I don't have to go round-trip to Photoshop to sharpen.
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:28.520]   So that's my pick.
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:29.520]   It's 199 bucks.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:31.920]   They are known for making expensive software.
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:32.920]   I will say that.
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:34.960]   That's my only complaint with this company there.
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:39.360]   There's plug-ins, in this case, the plug-in causes much as aperture, but if you can afford
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:43.080]   it, it's well worth it.
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:44.720]   Doesn't Adam Anks do the Mac cast?
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:46.720]   Does he work at Nick?
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:48.520]   Adam Christensen at MacKast.
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:49.520]   Adam Anks.
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:50.520]   Adam Christensen, yeah.
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:51.520]   Too many Adams in the Mac world.
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:52.520]   Adam Christensen, yeah.
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:53.520]   Yeah.
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:56.240]   He's, I'm not sure what he does there, but yeah, he works great.
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:57.960]   Great collection in general.
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:58.960]   They just mixed up.
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:20:59.960]   Incredible.
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:00.960]   I use their call-of-house.
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:07.000]   Every single one of their aperture plug-ins and use them regularly, the only non-NIC software
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:12.760]   plug-in that I like as much would be the Tifen DFX plug-in, which is sort of like Nick's
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:13.920]   Color FX Pro.
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:18.440]   But other than that, they're my first choice for that kind of stuff because their stuff
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:19.440]   really works.
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:20.440]   All right.
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:29.480]   I'm going to end the show by launching the new Star Wars Unleashed on the iPhone.
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:34.080]   Let's see if it, see, this might be where they pulled the lightsaber off.
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:37.680]   Now, why have the lightsaber when you can buy Star Wars Unleashed?
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:42.280]   I'm kind of curious that my lightsaber, that they didn't like really kill it, kill it,
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:43.680]   like I still have it on my phone.
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:46.360]   I'm not sure exactly how that's working.
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.360]   Enable sounds.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:49.480]   You bet, enable sounds.
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:51.200]   Where's the yes?
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:53.640]   Just says enable sounds.
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:54.640]   Yes.
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:55.640]   Oh, confirm.
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:56.640]   There's a confirm button there we go.
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:57.640]   Confirm.
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:58.640]   Confirm.
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:02.840]   While you're doing that, have you seen the guitar?
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:05.200]   Yeah, that's very popular, isn't it?
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:06.200]   Pocket guitar.
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:07.200]   Yeah.
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:08.200]   It is completely useless.
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:10.480]   But it's a guitar.
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:13.920]   An enormous amount of fun.
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:15.880]   Is it illegal for me to do this?
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:16.880]   Probably.
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:17.880]   Yeah.
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:20.080]   No, for the purpose of critique and review.
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:22.400]   We're reviewing the software here.
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:23.400]   Exactly.
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:24.400]   Oh.
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.800]   This would be a fair use exception to the Copyright Act.
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:30.680]   The galaxy is-- that's too small for me to read.
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:31.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:42.320]   The grip of something and then the Jedi Knights have been all destroyed by something and then
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:43.320]   escaping.
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:47.480]   Man, it's hard when you get bad eyes to read this stuff.
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:48.480]   This is fun, though.
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:49.480]   I mean, you know, it's very Star Wars-y.
[01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:51.520]   I wonder how the game is.
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:54.720]   You could probably just make up what's in there and be pretty close to it.
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:59.360]   Really, a long time ago, the galaxy far, far away.
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:01.520]   Bad people doing bad things.
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:04.800]   Then a Skywalker is born.
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:07.040]   He's got Midichlorian up the Wazoo.
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:10.800]   He first does bad things, but then follows them with good things.
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:11.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:13.120]   Oh, look, listen, new music.
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:15.120]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:18.120]   [SINGING]
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:19.120]   I can't read that.
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.880]   That doesn't sound very John Williams-y me.
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:22.280]   I'm guessing that's from a new--
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:24.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:28.920]   Yeah, no, that sounds like Ernie over at the music department.
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:29.920]   Yeah, right.
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:30.920]   Let's see.
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:38.000]   Story chapters, survival select chapters, locked.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.160]   I have to play the story version.
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:42.360]   Norval is record.
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:44.520]   I can't read it.
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.160]   I got to get my contacts out here.
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:50.760]   Who would have thought that people would listen to a podcast about a guy playing a video
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:56.880]   playing Spore on Sunday for two hours and 3,000 people were watching.
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:24:00.400]   This is sort of like Howard Stern describing naked, you know what?
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:01.440]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:01.960]   Oh, that's--
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:05.280]   Without getting to see him.
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:08.320]   Now, this sounds like it's a Cassio-organ version of it.
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:10.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:13.320]   [SINGING]
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:17.040]   I'm sorry, the Boston Philharmonic was on strike, so we now have a Cassio-organ.
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.120]   It's got-- it's gesture-based, which is kind of neat.
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:22.800]   So like the various moves and stuff, you do gestures, right?
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:27.120]   So I'll have to learn the gestures, maybe when I can see.
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:28.120]   It's very dark.
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:31.000]   Somebody in the chat room's giving you a gesture right now, Leo.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000]   Yeah.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000]   All right.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.760]   That's the cut sign, right?
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:35.760]   Yeah.
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:37.640]   That's the vertical cut sign.
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:39.240]   All right, we're going to wrap this up.
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:41.360]   I have to go play Star Wars.
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:42.360]   It's pretty amazing, though.
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:46.160]   I think this confirms what I thought, which is that this iPhone is probably the best game
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:47.680]   platform ever.
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:48.680]   Forget phone.
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:50.800]   It's a game.
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:54.280]   We thank you for joining us, and we will see you next week at this time.
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:58.880]   And make sure you-- let me-- the one more check to the Apple Store to see if-- okay,
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:01.480]   I-- well, trick Apple.
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:02.800]   Another Mac break is broke.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:03.800]   Okay, let's see.
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:05.800]   Maybe they'll-- [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:08.240]   Yeah, we're all done, Apple.
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:09.240]   Show's over.
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:10.240]   Nice.
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:12.160]   The store's down, yeah.
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:13.160]   It's over.
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:17.320]   You can now-- turn-- up-- put the new Macs online.
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:19.040]   All right.
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:20.640]   Maybe they're waiting for me to put the show out.
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:21.640]   Hey, thanks, everybody.
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:23.040]   Another Mac break is broke.
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:25.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:29.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:32.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:35.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:38.500]   (upbeat music)
