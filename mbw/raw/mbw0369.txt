[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.720]   you Clayton hey I'm great Renee thanks for having me on the show always great
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.200]   to chat with you guys thank you for joining us we have a week that is
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.680]   actually filled with Apple news a standing joke around these parts is that
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.600]   Apple never does anything and we have nothing to talk about and three hours
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.400]   later we figure that out and just kind of stop the show but this week a ton of
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.400]   stuff happened first and certainly most importantly Apple sold nine million
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.840]   iPhones Clayton can you put that in some sort of context for normal people when
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.960]   they look at a number like nine million phones in a weekend what does that really
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.600]   mean well I think you know it's interesting because the question was would
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.760]   Apple be able to eclipse the number that they made last year I think it was five
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.560]   million an opening weekend last year an analyst were saying maybe they'll do six
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.240]   perhaps seven so when you nearly double the amount of iPhones in an off cycle I
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.720]   mean that s cycle right the five s cycle the four s cycle it's pretty
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.480]   remarkable that this is in a year when really if you look at the five s just
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.640]   made a couple of new features right the fingerprint scanner big deal some of
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.360]   the some of the features in the camera of course but it's not a it doesn't look
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.200]   unless you've got the gold device like all that much different than the five so
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.640]   it's really remarkable number you saw that in their stock too they up over 500 as a
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.240]   result I was gonna ask you all as did you go out did you order one no no I
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.040]   didn't I will I will catch up I'm I just just behind so no I didn't I didn't do
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.560]   it I did applaud the what happened there but I think that the the interesting
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.240]   thing about it I think one of the reasons that we're seeing that is a
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.160]   they're opening a lot more countries at one time so I think that those those
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.000]   opening weekends are much more impressive because I believe that there's a lot
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.440]   more sites that they open to China go ahead China yes yes exactly and and I
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.000]   think that I think that that's one of the big things I think that also I think
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.680]   for a lot of people did not upgrade to the five so I think a lot of people with
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.080]   the four s I mean I just know a lot of people that have four s's that yeah just
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.400]   the five wasn't enough of a of a bump so that they didn't really I mean it had
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.320]   a different form factor and for them that wasn't enough of a jump and really if
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.320]   it was me I would constantly be jumping from one I mean I'd go from each
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.400]   iPhone to each iPhone but it's kind of my job so but but if I was if I was just
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.600]   doing it for myself I'd probably go from one s to another rather than if I'm
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.040]   gonna pick which cycle to be on I'd rather be on the s cycle than the in
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.680]   the standard cycle now Clayton I mean there was a bit some people attack the
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.920]   number saying that Apple released two new iPhones this year which is not
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.800]   something they historically do there's the high-end iPhone 5s and the new
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.760]   mid-range iPhone 5c and that they had those extra countries but as far as I
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.520]   know Apple never breaks down which iPhones get sold they give you total
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.680]   numbers and by that measure it's still an impressive debut right I mean I was at
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.080]   the Apple Store in Fifth Avenue and not one I asked a bunch of people online
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.760]   what they were getting they were all getting five s's so I'm sure a lot of
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.320]   those I mean I guess those pre-order numbers right so if you're ordering you
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.960]   you've paid your money if taking your credit card information you're probably
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.560]   not getting it though until October so you might not have been able to get the
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.240]   physical phone in your hand but they're still able to add that to that number
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.520]   for sales that weekend or is it not included until your credit card is
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.840]   actually billed which you might actually be a few weeks because Apple
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.800]   traditionally when they scan your credit card when they take your credit
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.160]   card information they don't actually you know charge you for it until it's like
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.240]   a few days away from shipping so I'd be curious to know how many of those that
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.160]   people who couldn't get a phone stood in line I went to the Apple Store today
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.880]   our local mall just had some extra time and I was gonna just popped in there I
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.080]   said hey do you have any iPhone 5s is left no not a one not a single unit of
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.560]   5s is available so I think a lot of those numbers are probably pretty
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.120]   interesting I think the 5s numbers though we saw in some reports far outsold the
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.160]   5c yeah I'm not sure how many I'm not sure if the
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.520]   see when you look at the numbers that you actually I mean I I looked at a
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.400]   report I think it was the numbers that I saw were something like 6 to 1 or
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.000]   something like that and so the interesting thing is I don't know if they
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.560]   had not released the 5c if they had really if they if they would have even
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.920]   sold that many less you know I think that if they'd stuck with just the 5s now I
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.280]   think that the 5c is a bigger process that's that they're looking at long term
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.240]   it's not how much does it so on the first weekend but I think that right
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.960]   definitely these these early adopters that are willing to stand in line are
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.880]   not gonna stand in line for I think most of them are gonna stand in line for a
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:10.000]   5c Renee you were up you waited in line overnight too didn't you I mean you did
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.560]   you were a lot of people there waiting for the 5c no I think the 5c because it
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.600]   had pre-order starting a week beforehand anyone who wanted one could have
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.480]   pre-ordered it by then so the people who went to line there were no pre-orders
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.000]   for the 5s that's largely due because some people thought that it was Apple
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.280]   just boosting the lines but my understanding is that they just can't make
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.720]   enough and they didn't want to have it we saw when the pre-orders went live for
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.960]   the 5s I think within a few seconds it had already shifted out to October they
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.520]   just didn't have enough to supply an online pre-order so you had to line up
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.880]   and even then I know the Miami flagship store got three gold models my store
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:50.000]   had seven there was just not enough products go around and that's that shows
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.200]   you tell I think Apple was really smart I think Alex is exactly right the 5c is
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.040]   a longer tail product it's meant to sit on store shelves in bright colorful
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.160]   packages for the rest of the year so that people who kind of want an iPhone but
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.520]   want something fun and a little bit cheaper can go and buy it but the 5s was
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.040]   really what us nerds and us geeks and you know early adopters want to have
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.600]   standing in line that first day and that's just why we saw the numbers yeah I
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.280]   agree and just sort of anecdotally walking around the studio hallways in
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.040]   New York City and so forth and people asking to see the phones they're really
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.080]   interested in the 5c and they thought oh this is in some people said you know
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.360]   they're I'm an Android user I'm thinking about switching to iPhone this
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.120]   seems to me like a good entry product to kind of get my hands wet with an iPhone
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.960]   and I'm thinking about getting it I said really this over the five 5s and
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.800]   they said yeah you know I like the colors and it seems easy so it somehow
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.240]   struck them as easier but a lot of people said that to me I was really
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.440]   surprised by that because I find interesting it's just it's a hundred
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.600]   dollars difference and I and I feel like given the early reports of the
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:53.840]   fingerprint you know you know you know quality seems like that would be easier
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:09:00.120]   yeah I said unless you're I said do I kind of talked a couple of people out of
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.160]   getting the 5c and I said look that let me just show you the fingerprint
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.600]   scanner and how well this works and I pull it out and I you know because into
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.400]   the to the lay person it looks like you don't even have a passcode on your
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.680]   phone right you just sort of tap it hold it down until you know you wake it
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.080]   tap it and then you're right into the phone and it looks like oh you know Clayton
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.480]   doesn't have a passcode on his phone now I put it to sleep handed to this other
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.920]   person as a test and it just says try again try again and they're sort of
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:30.600]   their mouths are jaws sort of drop like wow that's crazy when you look at
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.920]   when you look at the addition of the activation you know the new activation
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.440]   tools that have been put in so that if someone steals your phone they can't
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:42.760]   activate it with your you know with OS with iOS 7 and combine that with the
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.800]   fingerprint you end up with the something a really interesting mix of
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:51.920]   convene in the answer to the thing for him yeah absolutely I spent the weekend with
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.760]   the iPhone 5c because I'm reviewing both phones I wanted to give it a fair
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.360]   shake and it is a lot of fun when you see the matching wallpaper especially the
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.840]   dynamic wallpaper and the parallax with that candy coated to lift Dave Whiskis's
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.640]   term that candy coated shell it's a great device but then you start playing
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.440]   with the actually I'm curious about your experience with the fingerprint
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.840]   scanner because here's mine I got the iPhone 5c I unpackaged it I went into
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.880]   settings and I told it to train my finger and then I became skittish like a
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.400]   little dough for a minute and I touched an environment I pulled my thumb away and
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.960]   it kept telling me I was not holding it long enough or holding it too long and
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.320]   I it was an incredibly awkward experience for me to train just because I kept
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.920]   feeling internally like I was doing it wrong and then at the end I forgot to
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.440]   scan half my fingers so I had to rescan it otherwise you know it wouldn't let
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.120]   me in but when I did it properly the second time after losing that initial
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.680]   sheepishness it's just been fantastic I touched the thing I've bought both
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.240]   thumbs my right thumb and my left thumb added now and no matter what I'm doing
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.160]   I just pick it up and a second later I'm into my phone yeah one little trick that
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.800]   I didn't realize until I was talking to some friends at Apple after I was
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.840]   playing with it you know my inclination was to hit the hit the top
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:06.480]   button on the top to wake it right and no you don't have to do that at all and
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.800]   I know there have been some some reports out there about how exactly this works
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:14.600]   but you just want to tap tap the home button just to unlock it or just to
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.800]   wake it and then just keep your finger there and you know once the screen is
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.680]   alive it'll take you right into the phone so you don't physically need to
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.360]   you don't have to top the you know the power button on the top and then and
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.000]   then do the fingerprint scanner on the bottom you just have to simply wake it
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.560]   gets very very very fast and my experience with it so far has been has
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.280]   been great and I know there's been a number of reports people saying the same
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.880]   thing is like they've picked up their iPhone 5 or older their older iPhone or
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.160]   even though the 5c I've picked up to play with and I just my my feeling is to go
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.440]   right to that home button now and to use the fingerprint scanner to unlock it
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.880]   and I just find and you know it's funny on the iPad I'm just like oh I have to
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:12:00.400]   peck out my password come on like an animal now right it's interesting because
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.080]   oh so of course the minute everyone tried it the internet half of YouTube was
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:08.160]   flooded with people using their nipples to unlock it or their dogs claws and it
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.280]   turns out that yes anything that is biological and has a pattern on it can
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:16.960]   be registered and then can be used to unlock it and yes if you are a CSI
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.000]   level person who can I guess yes if you have a really good ability to take
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.760]   fingerprints and produce high resolution photograph scans and you know the
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.960]   procedure you can spoof this ID but Alex this doesn't seem like the point to me
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.280]   it seems like this is just something along the dial between convenience and
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.680]   security and for most people most of time it's still better than a passcode
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.960]   absolutely I think this far more secure than a passcode you know unless you
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:46.640]   have a really long passport pass you know hash which almost nobody has you
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:51.440]   know so I think that I think it's much more secure than a passcode it is it is
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.720]   much more convenient which means you're more likely to use it I know a lot of
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.360]   times we get into you know I get in a situation where I'm in production and I
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.800]   want to have my iPads or or other things not have a passcode because I just want
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.720]   to be able to jump to them and open them and the idea of being able to do this
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.280]   and have a bit of both I think has me more likely to leave it on more likely
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.000]   to have it turn its passcode on faster you know those are all things that you'll
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   do when you don't have to be typing you know pecking in a number every single
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.160]   time you want to open it yeah and the good thing is to to Renee's point no two
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:27.560]   nipples are the same one in ten thousand nipples are the same like a
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:31.480]   snowflake and I'm just saying not gonna I you're the kind of service you're
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.360]   gonna get after you open your iPhone with your nipple is gonna be very
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:39.400]   different than always warning you in public if you're at a restaurant if you
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.520]   start opening your phone with your nipple it's gonna change the conversation
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:48.080]   that's all I'm saying it's impeccable there's also a hack not really a hack
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.200]   that there's a interesting work around where you can scan different fingers
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.200]   into one slot Apple gives you five slots for fingers so you can have any five of
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.480]   yours or you know one of yours your wife's your child child whatever you want to
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.680]   do but you can also scan multiple fingers into one slot it takes a really long
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.360]   time but we've tested it and it does work and then conceivably you could have
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:11.280]   one hand in one slot in one hand in the other slot it's not as intended but I
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.840]   think I think it's important to point out that biometric security like any
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:18.600]   security has its pros and its cons someone can look over your shoulder when
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.960]   you're typing in a passcode someone could grab your finger and force it onto a
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.280]   fingerprint reader someone you know could intimidate you into giving them
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.760]   your passcode so as long as you understand how these things function you
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.040]   can make informed decisions about how to use them and I think well you know
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.240]   the story I kind of died and I think one of the other important things is that
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.960]   you're no longer handing some whole bunch of people a passcode you know I
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.920]   think that you know we have to deal with you know high level passcodes all the
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.560]   time and we use a program called last pass which we've talked about in the
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.360]   past and and one of the things that that's really important there is we pass
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.520]   each other the passwords without ever giving you know one person got the
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:56.120]   password and then put it into last pass and then closed it up and handed to
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.160]   everybody else but no one else has that password you know you know and so no
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.920]   one because we don't want that thing you know it's just easy for that to start
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:07.120]   you know moving around and so so it's it I think that what's interesting about
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.720]   having multiple people being able to be part of that is that you're not handing
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:15.880]   off a passcode that someone might write down they can't remember your kids who
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.240]   have to write it down or or your you know or them saying it out loud when
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:23.920]   they're my son you know says loud when he puts it in you know so those are the
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:28.360]   kind of things that that that we can kind of avoid when when we have when we're
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.640]   just using biometrics and I think biometrics are the future I mean I think
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.880]   that you know this is the first step of doing it right I think a lot of people
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.000]   said oh it's not gonna work because everyone did it wrong well that's what
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Apple tends to do is they tend to take a long time to figure it out they do it
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.560]   right and I think that what we're gonna see is a huge avalanche I think that it's
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.360]   gonna be hard to find a phone that doesn't do biometrics in three to five
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:50.280]   years yeah and I agree with Alex and I you know I've long been beating the drum
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:54.120]   of wanting to get rid of my wallet I hate carrying a wallet and you know I
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:58.960]   was excited about Passbook and that kind of you know founder wasn't as exciting
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.760]   as I wanted it to be and I but you know I still use it my Starbucks app on a
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:07.480]   regular basis United Airlines or Delta or you know or Virgin America or those
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:12.200]   types of things inside a Passbook but to be able to not have to use my wallet
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:17.320]   and then to have keychain integration or a keychain integration with within iOS
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:22.720]   7 which you know Apple is pulled back on suddenly you know and some are saying
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.840]   well that's because they're waiting for Mavericks but you know you don't need a
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.640]   Mac though I mean there's a lot of people who aren't getting a Mac who just
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:37.000]   want to use their iOS device for that kind of a thing to have all your
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.640]   passcodes stored in there and just to be able to know that you have that extra
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.960]   layer of security by using your fingerprint to unlock it then you have
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:47.720]   access to all of those passwords credit card payments that sort of thing make
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:52.560]   purchases to me if I could just carry my iPhone in my pocket and no longer have
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.960]   to carry a wallet it would be a great day I'm curious how far can Apple push
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.880]   this technology we have it in the iPhone now there's gonna be new iPads come
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:05.120]   October the iPad 5 is gonna be a substantial redesign it might get the A7
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:10.480]   processor with its secure enclave Alex you think we'll see the the touch ID in
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.440]   the next generation high-end iPads and maybe further along the line in the Mac
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.280]   lineup as well I think so I think if they're successful absolutely I think
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.480]   that it opens up a lot of a lot of interesting opportunities beyond just
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.800]   you know just the basic opening I think that we're gonna experiment with that
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.520]   because it's a safe place to open it with millions people nine million people
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:32.480]   are now or let's say six million people are now experimenting with this and
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.920]   Apple's gonna get a lot of feedback and so by using it as a low-level operation
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.920]   you can really figure out what's working and not working about it I think that as
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:44.120]   you have the new iPads I pretty unfortunate if they don't if they don't
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:48.520]   include the same technology on the iPads I think the Mac the our Macbook pros are
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.240]   the next thing that I would love to see it in I don't know if they're gonna do
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.480]   it or not but I think that that starts to open up a lot of other things beyond
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.440]   just commerce I mean it definitely opens up commerce it it it closes a very
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.680]   important loop when it comes to fraud when it comes to a lot of other things
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.000]   where you know you add that to it you have your passcode you know I could
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.280]   definitely see Bank of America eventually adding that maybe you know and I think
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.680]   that the first step we're gonna see is not that it's the only way to do it or
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:16.080]   that it is the considered the you know the truth so to speak but it's being
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.960]   added like it's it's one of those things like you can have a photo put on your
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.800]   credit card you can have an added code you could you could add this to your
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:27.360]   Bank of America you know profile that you have to put this in to make it work
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.960]   or you have to type a longer code or or those kinds of things to add security
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.280]   but I think it also changes the way I think we might see some you know sites
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:39.240]   that are doing stuff like you know so you think you can dance or those kind
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.880]   of things use you know starting to play with those ideas to make sure that only
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:45.600]   one person can vote at a time so that maybe you know maybe they do something
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:51.480]   where as this becomes more prolific you you can only vote for on a on a show or
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:55.480]   on a contest once because we know biometrically that's you know that's you
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:00.320]   theoretically and then the and so I think that that could be an interesting
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.960]   possibility I also think it's an interesting possibility when it comes to
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:07.240]   down the road voting in general I mean I think that you know we're moving towards
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.080]   somewhere in the next decade you know starting to really get much more
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:15.320]   serious about you know doing our general political voting yeah and there's a
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.120]   whole bunch of issues related to that related to access related to have you
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:23.440]   know people who have computers versus not and how that how all that looks but I
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.880]   think that that is where there are a lot of you know this is the beginning of
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.640]   that path well an apple has Renee also I mean think about what the kind of
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:36.400]   technology they have in iPhoto and making it smarter with facial recognition too
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.060]   and you've got a FaceTime camera on the front of it you got a fingerprint
[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:42.400]   scanner who's to say that Apple wouldn't employ at least some apps could take
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.960]   advantage of that in some capacity even like Bank of America to Alex's point
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.120]   being able to use both some sort of facial recognition look they use facial
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.080]   recognition on the credit cards now right when you have a debit card you get
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:56.280]   your you get your photo printed out so that other people can recognize you and
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.680]   look at you make sure that you're the right person who's to say that there
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:04.120]   won't be some you know there won't be some developers taking advantage of
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:08.040]   that and I'm told that like for instance Bank of America I don't know this
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.720]   personally because I don't have this kind of money but but but I'm told that if
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.880]   you have a ten million dollars or more into Bank of America they they send you
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.960]   your free ira free iris scanner you know to access your account it turns out
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.000]   if you have that much they prefer you to be a little more secure so but but
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.600]   definitely to Clayton's point I think that the resolution that we're seeing on
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.040]   a lot of the cameras that are just being built into our into our iPhones and into
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.120]   our machines there's no reason why that a lot of biometrics can't be taken and
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.920]   your voice as well you know so you know we're getting kind of that to that Jason
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:42.360]   born level of you know facial ID voice ID print ID where you could
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.280]   theoretically add those all those levels of security to make sure that you are
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:50.240]   who you are for the apps that where that makes a difference I had a friend who
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.480]   used to work in bio actually security procurement and he would always be
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.720]   taken around the world to see the latest technology and they'd have fingerprint
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:00.560]   readers we had to input your your whole hand into a gelatinous substance at
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:04.100]   first or doors would come down and it would scan your skeletal structure and
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:07.720]   make sure there was no one standing behind you and these things sound like
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:11.240]   total science fiction but when you start to think sure we have a biometric scanner
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:15.240]   we have a fingerprint ID sensor in the new iPhone and that's better than having
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.640]   no passcode at all because a lot of people I mean Apple shared stats 50% of
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.360]   people didn't use passcode and now every one of the five S because it's cool
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.600]   we'll probably try it and then you know that's something that you are passcode
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.160]   is something that you know and when you use touch ID they force you to create a
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.240]   passcode because if you get it wrong enough or you go with too long without
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:37.040]   using it or you try to do anything else you have to have that passcode set up
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:42.040]   and then you know the Clayton's point maybe in the iPhone and iOS 7 there's
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.480]   Bluetooth low energy and you can already start to use it to set up some things
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.720]   at least the way the frameworks are built then maybe you have a trusted
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.640]   Bluetooth device and suddenly you go from a really insecure phone to something
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.680]   that's something you know something you are and something you have and that's
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:00.720]   really good tin foil hat three-factor security all of it on a mainstream
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.520]   level which if you asked me a couple years ago we would probably never have
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:07.280]   gotten to well and I think that it's really interesting because it's not it's
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.400]   not just getting into your phone it's also opening files what if you can are
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.800]   able to attach pages documents or numbers numbers documents with all your
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:19.440]   budgets and everything else and you can say I am gonna let these four people
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:24.360]   open that document and have to have a biometric connection to open it so there's
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.720]   not I'm not worried about someone hacking into their account or opening
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:30.200]   their account or anything else the only time it's open is when when they've
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:33.920]   you know checked in as themselves and that's a you know from a production
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.920]   perspective you know when we're talking about film production as well as just
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.680]   finance and everything else that's a pretty powerful tool when it as it
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:44.560]   matures I think what we see right now is baby steps in that direction and
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:48.080]   they had the police I believe in New York City Clayton the police made headlines
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:53.080]   walking around asking people to please update to iOS 7 yeah exactly they're
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.520]   asking people to upgrade and they're saying hey they've had such a big problem
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.560]   they have task forces in fact on launch day here in Manhattan they had
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:05.480]   everyone they had I think two police officers go to both Verizon stores Apple
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:10.000]   stores AT&T stores and others to make sure that there were no thefts so they
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.960]   had I think two police officers assigned to like each store to make sure that
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.880]   there weren't people like bashing people over the head and grabbing their phones
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:20.480]   as they walked out and ran away but obviously you know iPhone theft and it's
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.520]   a huge problem in New York City it's been a big deal I mean sorry in San
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:27.840]   Francisco it's been a big deal and other major cities where people are coming up
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:32.400]   behind people you know knocking them down grabbing their phones and and going
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.160]   and you know they've set up these task forces specific like these I task forces
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.400]   specifically to deal with this so we've iOS 7 you know hits the word on the
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.400]   street people are finding out they're really they're not able to do anything
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.200]   once they steal the phone they're not able to sell it they're not able to do
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:51.800]   anything with it and this may help curb some theft we we had a we actually had
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.160]   Chris Marlar who's in I don't know if I talked about this in an earlier show but
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:24:00.200]   Chris Marlar who runs our school in Rwanda actually had we had a a breaking
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:05.600]   and they stole his iPad you know from you know from the from the house and it
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.240]   wasn't it was kind of an inside job so anyway but the bottom line was he
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:15.400]   realized the iPad was gone and they actually used find my iPhone to to find
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:21.120]   you know to find this guy in the middle of the night his house yeah yeah with a
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.480]   lot of security I mean there was a lot there was like 10 guys with them you
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:27.920]   know and and but they you know it was it was kind of a one of those magical
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.560]   moments where you know the guy didn't know enough about turning these things
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:35.040]   off so a lot of it is also educating you know educating the criminal public
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:38.720]   about what is possible what is not possible with with these new apps but I
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.040]   think that that I mean obviously someone will think of some some way to
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:45.600]   one up that that process but I think it's a good it's a good start you know
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.600]   you're doing something right when you have to steal Android Alex that's the
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:53.480]   only thing you have to do here well well it's you know you're doing something
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:58.000]   right when when you have the city of New York doing the marketing for you it
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.840]   was interesting to me is all the technology and Alex previously mentioned
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.640]   the activation lock which means of someone even if they get your iPhone and
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.120]   they get passed anything else they can't wipe it and reactivate it unless they
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:12.800]   have your Apple ID you know if anything goes wrong some people are afraid that
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.400]   they themselves will lock themselves up and my understanding is that there's
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:19.680]   procedures at Apple Store Apple customer care to let a verified user back into
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:24.760]   their phone in an awards case scenario but that's huge too and just a quickly
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.880]   dispels for the other flood going around some people were concerned that you could
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:33.200]   use Siri or control center in iOS 7 to put an airplane mode and thereby foil
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.120]   find my iPhone that's the equivalent actually just turning off the phone you
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:41.000]   can do that without any OS running on it whatsoever so you have to decide is
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.520]   control center convenient is there a convenience and if they're not you can
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:48.200]   just turn them off in settings I mean you can make the iPhone as incredibly
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:52.440]   can as probably secure and is incredibly convenient as you want and I think
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:56.040]   Clayton is up to individuals depending on what their lifestyle and job is to
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:00.080]   kind of decide where they fit on that spectrum yeah I think so look if you're
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:05.680]   you know if you don't leave the house a lot you know do you need all these
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.760]   extra layers of security but if you're in a major city you're constantly in and
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:14.000]   out of cabs and you're dropping your phones you know constantly in the cabin
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.680]   and my wife has lost a number of phones in cabs we were talking the other day
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.920]   when my little my three-year-old he has one of those little fake flip phones and
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:25.560]   he said mommy daddy I don't know where my phone is and you know I don't know why
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:30.440]   we have the things it's annoying and my wife says don't worry son I've I've
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:35.160]   certainly lost many many of phones so yeah it depends on your love I mean
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.760]   certainly if you're in a major city like New York City or you're constantly
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.760]   traveling like Alex is you need to really worry about that you know that
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.680]   security oops I left my phone you know at the terminal I need to run back out
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.960]   oh my gosh I hope someone didn't see some proprietary documents that I had for
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:52.960]   for the pixel core or something you know you just need to balance that well and
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:57.240]   and I still think I know Apple has already patented it or or they worked on it
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:01.040]   but I know a lot of it worried about it but I really want to be able to turn my
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:06.720]   camera on if I lose my phone you know like they you know I know Apple talked
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.480]   about it or there have been some possibilities of the patents and people
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.760]   got really scared about the idea of someone be able to turn their phone on
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.080]   remotely but but I think that if you know especially when we're talking about
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:18.600]   being able to have extra codes like if I could put in extra levels of security
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.440]   say yes this is really me and that's really my phone and I would like to turn
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:26.480]   the camera on please you know to see what's going on I think that that that
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:32.280]   along with all the other things that have happened so far is pretty makes it
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:37.360]   really not very fun to steal your phone I'm interested I don't know if you guys
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:41.080]   saw this but I mentioned before there were only seven gold iPhones at my store
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:45.840]   there were three or at the one in Miami my good friend and phone addicts Kevin
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:50.280]   Mitchell look paid a guy in front of him $1,500 for the gold iPhone ticket because
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:53.760]   he wanted gold so badly I know at my store people paid you know a couple hundred
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:58.200]   bucks they've been going on eBay for I think one of them went for 2000 another
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:02.960]   one maybe you know 20,000 or some ridiculous amount that you know that's
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.120]   that's not Apple you know deliberately not make enough production that's the
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.960]   realities of trying to produce all these phones but Clayton you have a sense of
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:12.920]   you know for me everyone was making fun of the gold iPhone you know you
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:16.240]   shouldn't have it it's let's see it's chintzy and then as soon as they found out
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:20.160]   they were rare and hard to get everybody wanted one yeah and I was like I said
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.600]   it was at the Apple store today and it was just kind of hovering around the iPhone
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:27.040]   table for a few minutes and a number of people came in the store and said do you
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.680]   have any more of the gold iPhones do you have any more of the gold iPhones I
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.800]   couldn't believe it and I don't know what it is I mean it's just like word of
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:36.400]   mouth we haven't even really we haven't even seen any commercials yet have we
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:41.560]   no only the YC commercials yeah only 5c commercials so this you know just pure
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:45.160]   word of mouth right now people knowing that there's a new iPhone now people
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.920]   reporting on it the news they're seeing it on their late you know local
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:53.120]   newscasts and it's just word of mouth it's really remarkable I know it's some
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.280]   stores I didn't even have them and I found it interesting I mean beyond the
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:01.600]   iPhone people my office walk and I'm going hey the new iOS 7 is released you
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.760]   know like there was a like you know it was I mean like I just wasn't used to
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:09.120]   having I mean we pay attention to that kind of stuff but I wasn't used to
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:14.440]   having everybody excited about a new a new operating system you know that the
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:18.480]   kind of you know the cross-section people that I didn't expect anyway to be
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:23.080]   that you know to be that excited about it and it is but like everybody in the
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.360]   office was paying attention to it and it took there's a lot of peer pressure to
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:30.680]   upgrade yeah I think the iOS 7 point is interesting because I'm hearing from a
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:34.720]   lot of people a lot of people casually just to who aren't you know or who
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:38.000]   aren't techies who have come up to me and felt they need to tell me that they
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.480]   love iOS 7 yeah these are people who are you know these aren't fanboys or
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:49.680]   anything like that these are people who you know sort of casual casual users
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:54.200]   upgraded and I've heard a couple of people in fact my sister-in-law who's as
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.440]   far from a techie as possible she said that she feels like she has a brand new
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:03.040]   phone another friend of mine who's completely not technical said this is
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:06.880]   the first time that he's felt like he has a smartphone I thought that was an
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:11.440]   interesting an interesting take on it and he said he absolutely loved it so I
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:17.920]   like I do yeah I I have to I didn't do the developer upgrade I just waited for
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.200]   it to come out in fact I probably waited a couple days because I was really
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:26.240]   busy and and then I upgraded my my phone first and then immediately upgraded all
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:30.720]   my other iOS devices in and it I just think it's magical you know it's it's
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:36.880]   like it's just better I mean I now you look back at iOS 6 the interface you're
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.840]   like how did I put up with that and I don't know how Apple does that
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:44.280]   like you know with an upgrade to take something that was perfectly fine
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:49.480]   yesterday and now it looks like you know you know chopped liver yeah I mean
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.920]   there's a lot of things I'm sorry go ahead Renee I was gonna say my mother
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.400]   updated to it she did all on her own you know I sat there in case that her
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.520]   problem but she did it all by herself the servers were pounded and we'll get to
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.920]   the numbers in a minute but the servers were pounded she waited tried
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:07.520]   again she updated and then she said oh my goodness it's so colorful it's so
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:12.320]   beautiful she she had a couple small questions like the new Safari favorites
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.360]   she hadn't seen before so she wondered how all those bookmarks got onto her
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:20.400]   iPad but other than that I mean she had she had zero learning curve my two
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.920]   little godchildren five years old and a look and eight years old upgraded their
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.120]   iPod touches and they think it's fantastic they think it's like a
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:32.560]   video game made into an operating system and yeah I wonder sorry no I was
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.680]   just say I agree I wonder though because that was my concern sort of like my
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.880]   dad upgrading my mom upgrading and I haven't talked to them yet about it I
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:42.880]   know just other people around me in my neighborhood here who who know that I
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.480]   cover this kind of stuff all had admitted that they upgraded and they
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.880]   loved it somewhere still trying to figure this out this is new I'm a little
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:54.040]   confused about this can you show me this I had one person who's who's an editor
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:58.520]   in chief of a big website and he said to me I the only thing is I can't figure
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:03.000]   out now how to archive and these messages and etc and I just quickly
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.240]   showed him he said ah there it is oh it's backwards now and I was six it was
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:11.160]   this way now it's this way I've had a lot of viewers writing to me wondering
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:16.400]   how to close apps that's not immediately apparent I know my head is hard for
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:20.080]   some people right right so there are certain things I was a little worried you
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:24.760]   know I was worried that the the the you know the dads the moms out there
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:30.160]   what that was my concern at WWDC I had said publicly I said I'm a I'm really
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.880]   worried about people like my dad who are just gonna not know their way around
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:39.520]   this thing and I've been using it all summer of course but I just I don't see
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:43.600]   I haven't seen that much of a problem have you guys I've seen how so the
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.720]   results for me have been incredibly divisive we have some people who are
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:50.560]   incredibly happy mainstream and geek alike they love that it's built on a
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:54.640]   physics and particle engine they love that it's basically like an entirely
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:58.040]   gamified operating system and other people just think you know those icons
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:02.520]   are hideously ugly I don't know where any of my stuff is anymore they've
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:06.120]   changed it for no good reason and there's a lot of people at stores just coming
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:09.560]   in saying put it back the way it was I don't know how much of that is just
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:14.680]   change aversion but Apple put out the statistics 200 million iOS devices are
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:18.560]   now I mean you guys are developers 200 million people updating to a new platform
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:23.040]   over a weekend never happened in the history of humanity before no I mean and
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:28.640]   that's a you know it's a from a developer standpoint you know the biggest challenge
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:33.000]   for us like it my app read quick which we just launched on the iPhone is we
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.680]   want to make sure that we're not just updating the interface and calling it a
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:39.720]   day you know there are there's so many things there in iOS 7 and so much more
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.880]   than just an updated interface we've got to deal with text you know it's taken
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:46.880]   an even more important role and so how is you know text rendering gonna play in
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:50.680]   in the frameworks that Apple's rewritten there's a lot of big questions
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:54.680]   and so here's one question I have and I'll be curious to see because Apple's
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:34:00.880]   never confronted this anymore hasn't confronted this yet sort of abandoned
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:04.840]   where in the app store right we're approaching I think about a million
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:08.440]   applications now which is a you know mind-blowing number if you think about it
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.640]   but there's a lot of apps in there that just haven't been updated haven't been
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:14.920]   touched they're just sort of floating around out there will Apple still you
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:18.840]   know what point does Apple clean house send out some sort of a notification to
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:23.960]   those developers and just say look your app hasn't been updated since I was four
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:29.600]   or I was five you know it you either you need to update or we're gonna clean
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.560]   house because Apple hasn't had to do a cleaning house in a while or or ever I
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:38.720]   think in the app store yeah I think it'll be interesting I think that obviously
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:43.160]   there's a certain level of wanting to have big numbers as far as how many apps
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:46.080]   you have in there and I think Apple is already pretty picky about you know what
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:50.760]   ends up in the in iOS so I think that you know I think that that's probably not
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:54.160]   gonna be in the top of their list but I definitely as a user I mean you I
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:58.920]   definitely look at what it says if it says you know good for anything after iOS
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:04.160]   for I sometimes worry about that you know I really want to see iOS 6 iOS 7 and I
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.600]   oftentimes will hesitate to buy something that doesn't say iOS 6 iOS 7
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.200]   because it means they didn't even bother to go up and you know change the cross
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:17.560]   you know change the description so it's probably not not being used heavily at
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:22.560]   that point so but yeah I think that it's it is an important thing to make sure
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:26.600]   that things are still viable I think that especially in an environment where
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:30.800]   such a large percentage of the users upgrade immediately I think that you
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.720]   end up with a lot of people upset if you don't if you don't sort that out but I
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.040]   think the biggest thing is you'll just see a lot of complaints if you don't
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:39.800]   upgrade it and it is buggy the bottom line is that you end up with very low
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:43.520]   star ratings and and enough complaints that you know then you're that's that
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:47.360]   may clean house for you peer pressure and it's interesting too because Apple is
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:51.760]   for the first time at least that I'm aware of some devices can't get iOS 7 the
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:57.320]   original iPad can't get iOS 7 iPhone 3 GS can't get iOS 7 most iPod touches I
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:01.680]   think up until the most recent can't get iOS 7 so what Apple's doing now is when
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:05.640]   you go to the app store it will offer to download the last compatible version
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:09.160]   of that app and that's good and bad I mean it's good because you can get those
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:14.320]   apps but if APIs have changed if the way things work have changed enough it
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.920]   may no longer function so what Apple seems to have done recently is also
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:21.240]   allowed developers to opt out of that so that's kind of the best of both worlds
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:24.520]   because if you have someone especially if you've given kids older devices in
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:27.720]   your family or you've given them away or you know for some reason you just you're
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:31.840]   waiting for the next refresh you can still access those apps and I think that's
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:38.200]   that's an interesting change in the other direction Clayton yeah and well I'm
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:42.600]   hey I'm I was pissed to learn that I couldn't update to iOS 7 on my iPhone 1
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:48.000]   which I'm still using that's really laggy I was really surprised some of the
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.040]   transitions 1.3 you should see burst mode on my iPhone 1 it takes like five
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:58.160]   minutes in between each photo well I one of the things that I think is
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.360]   interesting is there's a certain level I think there's gonna be a peer pressure
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:04.360]   related to what I think is one of the bigger features of iOS 7 that no one's
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:07.720]   talked about I guess TechCrunch finally did an article I meant to do one on G+
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:13.080]   and never got around to it but but with FaceTime audio I think is is is it is
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:18.040]   you know that there's something and I think that I find myself very quickly
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:23.000]   pushing everybody that that I'm calling if I can't I know that they have an
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.240]   iPhone and if I can't get them with FaceTime audio I'm just I'm just like
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:31.640]   okay you need to upgrade now we've tested it sounds fantastic well I kind
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.440]   of think with all the traveling you're doing I mean I know you had mentioned
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:37.400]   before it makes a lot of sense like we were just in Europe about a week and a
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:41.960]   half ago and you know we were when we had Wi-Fi I mean those were the people we
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:46.020]   were texting in our family and they're all on you know mostly on iOS my father
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:50.320]   in laws on on Android but we were just you know texting all over iMessage and
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:53.280]   not having to spend anything on it to let people know we're safe we're
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:56.520]   traveling here we're gonna be home then and be able to do that with not have to
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:00.200]   like launch Skype to be able to make a call it's pretty cool exactly I mean it's
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:04.280]   it's you know I am obviously because of my business I do a lot of hangouts I'm
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:08.200]   so I do a lot of G+ hangouts obviously we use Skype a fair bit as well but when I
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:12.320]   want to talk to my kids or I want to talk to my parents it's usually FaceTime
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:17.560]   you know if it's not a phone call if I'm overseas it's FaceTime because I just
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.720]   know that they'll understand it and it's built into the phone and I think that
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:23.520]   that's important where even though there were other services that were provided
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:29.000]   they were all extra services so you had the choice of you know they weren't
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.440]   built in and so they're either not on because you restarted your phone and
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:37.080]   they're not running or when they're on Skype for instance probably cuts the
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:41.440]   battery life in your in your iPhone to half when it's on in the background I
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.600]   mean it's just I don't know what it does back there but it's like running
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:47.080]   running laps on your phone and so you know I just never wanted to leave it on
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:52.200]   and so having this ability I think is is a pretty big deal and I think a lot of
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.880]   techie folks won't won't see that that's important I think that's gonna be and
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:59.160]   not having to explain to them how to you know handle an invite from G+ or how to
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:04.080]   open Skype or any of those other things just being able to call I also think
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:09.280]   that it's it's interesting that Apple well that the phone companies have got
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.160]   into a situation where they have two companies making 90% of the hand or
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:17.320]   the operating system for 90% of the handsets being Google and Apple and they
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:24.760]   that both those companies are actively trying to get rid of them
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:31.920]   yeah yeah yeah it's and maybe vice versa I don't know today was it like I said
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:35.440]   it was the I was at the mall local mall and there's a big Verizon store in there
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:42.040]   there's not one sign for iPhone 5s in there nothing it is huge and plaster on
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:47.840]   the side of the wall big big droid poster there no sign of an iPhone 5s at all
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:51.720]   yeah I want to talk about that no one it's
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:55.520]   walk into those stores you walk into those stores and you and you and you and
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:58.240]   you see that it's not only that there there's no signs but you talk to the
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:01.160]   guys there and you ask them what the percentages and they say it's mostly
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:09.000]   iPhone yeah there's a little bit more IOS news and iPhone news I want to get to
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.920]   and there's some actual Mac news today too so we can verify the title of this
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:17.520]   show is still relevant but before we do I believe that Leo wants to tell us
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:20.720]   something and I think he wants to tell it to us about I'm double checking
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:24.280]   shutter stock hey guys don't let me interrupt for too much but I do want to
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:28.760]   mention those great folks at Shutterstock.com they've been such a blessing to us
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:35.000]   here at Twit because we often use stock video footage we use stock photos

[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:16.280]   show to us much appreciated so the iOS 7 is not entirely bug free any new
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:21.440]   release especially historically X.O. releases for Apple have been fraught with
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:24.840]   a few bugs here or there battery life always seems to be an issue what's
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:28.440]   interesting with this release is it seems that some people have really bad
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:32.960]   battery life for a day maybe two days and then it becomes really good and I
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.600]   wonder I don't know if you've heard anything about this Clayton but I wonder
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:39.320]   if the new spotlight process and all the new indexing and optimizations
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:43.960]   they're doing after the update loads kind of gives you a hit in the beginning
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:48.120]   and then sends you back to a better level afterwards yeah I'm still waiting for
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:52.040]   that better level to be honest with you I've been running around like crazy
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:55.880]   lately so I haven't had I want to sort of drain it all the way down start fresh
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:00.400]   do a full 100% and see how it goes from there because I'm not doing anything
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:04.880]   crazy in the background and I don't know why it would be dropping so much so I
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:09.200]   definitely noticed that even just in sort of casual use if I'm just surf in
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:13.520]   the web reading Twitter and it's dropping pretty quickly if I take the
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:19.000]   train to work and by the time I get to work it'll be down like 79% on a 35 40
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.840]   minute train ride into the city so I'm curious what I'm doing or if the if
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:27.240]   some sort of brightness thing or some sort of location service is hidden
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:31.280]   somewhere in the background that I'm just not aware of or if there's an app
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:35.040]   that hasn't been updated properly that's screwed up with location services
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.800]   running in the background that I just don't know there are some I mean there's
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:42.120]   a bug there's a bunch of new multitasking features in iOS 7 that finally
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:46.200]   lets all apps multitask it lets content update in the background but there seems
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:49.760]   to be something going on between some of those apps in the API I know for
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:55.480]   example Snapchat and mailbox is forcing people to re log in over and over and
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:59.680]   over again and if you turn off the background refresh that stops so there
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:03.560]   might be something going on between those two things. I know that I've
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:12.480]   become very resigned to the length of my you know how long the batteries gonna
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:16.800]   last I mean it just it's just I just know I have two of the mophies and I have
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:20.360]   and I just think about plugging in all the time and I don't know what I'm
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.800]   doing it's kind of like Clayton I don't know what's happening but I mean
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:26.280]   oftentimes I get up I have to admit I get up pretty early so my average day
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:29.560]   starts at you know four o'clock in the morning or three thirty much less not
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:33.960]   as early as Clayton sometimes but but but I'm talking to the wrong person about
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:38.360]   getting up early but anyway but that's my average day and so but by eight o'clock
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:42.760]   if I haven't eight or nine in the morning if I haven't charged up again it's you
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:47.120]   know you're dead you know the other day the other day is that perfect example
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:50.920]   no I was up at like three thirty in the morning had to do the show and then you
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:54.000]   know I'm checking Twitter throughout the show and talking to to viewers and I'm
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.760]   jumping on G plus and then you know the four hour show was done it's 10 a.m. my
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:01.920]   wife and I were heading into Central Park for this October fest event and it
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:07.320]   was down to like 39 something percent I mean if I didn't charge it up I wouldn't
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:10.720]   be able to take any photos while it was at this event for the afternoon so even
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:14.920]   by like yeah 11 a.m. it was already down pretty pretty deep so I don't know if
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:18.800]   just me using it using it a lot or if there's something else going on there
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:22.000]   and I also think that it might be that I use it a lot I'm just a lot of time on
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.640]   the phone I spent a lot of time using it it's I realized I was watching my
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:29.360]   son play soccer and and watching him take direction while he's waiting five
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:32.600]   years old and he just he just he's like a little whirling gervish like
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.160]   wandering around his arm to go on everywhere and like that's when they're
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:37.680]   talking like he's just out there and I was like I wish he could calm down and
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.960]   realize I exactly the same thing except on my phone you know I was looking down
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:45.360]   like if anybody's saying anything that's not that isn't like this to me I'm like
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:48.920]   down there like you know going through you know footboard or whatever and so
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:54.680]   I mean I thought that maybe just me just uses uses the phone the phone has
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:58.800]   become so much part of what I do that I use it so heavily that that might be
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:01.920]   the case but I'm gonna I'm gonna be getting a usually I have one of each
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:05.760]   a droid in a an iPhone I'm trying to figure out which one to get but I know
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:09.880]   that with the droid phone that I'm my next upgrade I'm definitely focusing on
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:12.560]   battery life so like droid max or something like that because you want to
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:16.000]   see if I can have something that actually works all day yeah the Moto X it
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.280]   like sips battery yeah the Moto X has been you know real slow going on battery
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:29.160]   trade I using iOS 7 next to the Moto X on the on my iPhone 5 you know I
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:32.920]   but probably about 30 40% difference in battery by the time by the end of the
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:37.400]   day right yeah it's it's it's pretty amazing one of the things to test
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:40.120]   especially if you're having battery life problems is you just put the phone
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:42.960]   down and see if it's draining whether you're using it or not because a lot
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:45.520]   of people get a new phone or a new version of iOS and then we spend all
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:49.280]   this time using every new feature and it's battery life goes down from when we
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:52.480]   use barely nothing the day before on the old operating system we were used to
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.920]   and the same thing happens you get a new game or anything else that's
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:58.000]   interesting but if it's draining when nothing's happening then you might have
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.640]   a problem or the other thing is is that a lot of it has to do with the
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:03.520]   communication services and so and how stable those are the one thing I've
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:06.280]   definitely learned is you know if you put it in I mean obviously you don't
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.680]   want to put it in airport mode or airplane mode all the time but you put
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:11.440]   an airplane mode that it'll last forever you know a lot of it is in the
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:14.080]   communications and when you're constantly switching so if you're
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:16.920]   traveling a lot you're constantly switching from one tower to another
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:21.760]   yeah those transition periods take a lot of battery power you know bad so bad
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:27.360]   phone connections bad Wi-Fi definitely affect in my opinion affect the quality
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:32.240]   of the connection those are huge I was disappointed we didn't get 802.11ac
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:35.760]   not only because I think you know I don't want to use wires anymore and
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:40.480]   transferring big files over 802.11ac would be nice but it's the same as LTE
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:44.400]   that race to rest when the when the radio can power up quickly transfer
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:48.360]   something and power down you get such huge savings and overall battery life
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:52.280]   that I think you know not including the speed there's such a benefit to go into
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:57.600]   both things but we did get TCP for Siri did yeah that was a that was a you
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:01.240]   know great piece this week and really fascinating because you know I was
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:05.200]   wondering why and the certain things were improved in Siri but one of course
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:09.600]   the great things is TCP so basically if you were you know on LTE and somehow
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:12.600]   drops you're not you're not gonna lose that Siri connection which you would
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:15.840]   always lose I mean God knows you're driving around you're you're asking
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:20.120]   Siri something and if you know a cell tower switch up you're likely not you
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:23.600]   have to be in one stationary spot to get a good response from Siri for a long
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:28.520]   time and now kind of moving around if you jump from Wi-Fi to LTE or to another
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:32.600]   band it's staying pretty steady and you're not I'm not seeing those drops that I
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:36.500]   was seeing before it's very nice and some people are upset that you that's
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:40.520]   Siri defaults now to Bing just like they use Wikipedia for searches series a
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:44.640]   partner agreement system so if you just say search for X it'll show you X and
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:48.360]   Bing but you can still say Google you know X and it'll give it to you on Google
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:52.640]   instead and interesting because Safari is still Google and Siri is now Bing so
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:55.880]   it shows that Apple's not afraid to sort of market their searching around
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:51:02.400]   right the Apple TV also got the update and it's confusing to me because iOS 7 on
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:06.200]   the Apple TV is called Apple TV software update 6 and I wish Apple would
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:09.480]   harmonize that because it's just confusing for normal people but I owe
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:13.800]   Apple TV software update 6 came out it resulted in a lot of people having
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:17.920]   update problems and it gave them that please connect to iTunes which is really
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:21.400]   unfriendly for consumers who bought the device and never ever connected it to
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:25.600]   iTunes because you know you kind of there's a legacy feeling of remembering a
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:29.200]   couple years ago and you had to connect your iPhone that way but very few people
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:32.680]   ever had to connect their Apple TV that way so it's I understand why it's off
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:36.520]   putting Apple finally pulled it I think the night before last and now they've
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:40.440]   put it back out again I don't know if did you did you update did you update
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:44.960]   Clayton I waited until the second one before updated I was at work and I
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:48.360]   didn't get a chance to and then I was like well I can't wait to get home and try
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:51.440]   this and then I got home or as I was getting home I was like the Apple pulls
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:55.200]   the slightest update because of all these problems I was like all right so I
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.640]   thought it was gonna be a few weeks till we would see it again but sure
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:02.840]   enough they released the newest the newest fix with iTunes radio iCloud
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:11.400]   Airplay via iCloud to the Apple TV yeah that's great you know what I'm trying to
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:14.600]   think I mean I guess one of the practical things with that is so you go
[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:18.680]   over to your friends house you've got you launch your iTunes library you launch
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:23.600]   your videos folder in iTunes on your iPhone and you see that you have Batman
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:27.600]   begins they don't have it on their TV but you haven't downloaded it so it's
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:31.000]   not physically on your device you could just hit stream right there and it'll
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.040]   go right to their TV right without work that way yeah absolutely it's on that
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:38.920]   the case or device and then shows them the content which is really I don't
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:41.880]   know Alex we talk about requiring extinction level events for Hollywood to
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:45.120]   start getting it but it seems like Apple's doing this instead of just dropping a
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:48.920]   meteor on them they're slowly encroaching once to put a time well yeah
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:53.840]   I know I think that they're I think that both Apple and Google Earth and and Amazon
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:57.960]   and Netflix are you know are definitely pushing down this path of making it
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:01.160]   easier and and I think that the movie industry I think has also become more
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:04.240]   comfortable I mean I think that they realize that they have to keep on moving
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:07.360]   that direction as well they can't keep on holding such a hard line because
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:11.200]   people just aren't gonna put up with it and so I think that one of the real
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:15.520]   issues that the entertainment industry gets into is if they take too hard of a
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:21.400]   line and I think this is kind of in the soft politics so to speak is that a lot
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:24.640]   of people just don't care anymore about them you know so they don't see them as
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:27.320]   the good guys they don't see them as the people that are providing this great
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:31.400]   these great movies they just see them as the enemy and I think that that that
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:36.080]   also contributes to a lot of piracy and a lot of people working around things
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:37.960]   because they just don't they don't feel like they own because they just feel
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:41.280]   like they're getting screwed all the time and so I think that that's an important
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:43.840]   piece of that but I think from a technological perspective I think we're
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:47.440]   really gonna get into an interesting position with all of these companies and
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:50.720]   I've said it before but I think that we're you know we're moving towards you
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:54.600]   know a 4k reality probably next year where you know suddenly you see Apple TV
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:54:01.360]   and and as well you see Apple Amazon Netflix you know YouTube most likely
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:07.920]   moving to you know the ability to watch both you know VOD and live in 4k because
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:12.520]   for them it's very easy to upgrade it's not nearly as easy to upgrade if you
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:16.440]   are you know if you're a broadcaster you know so so I think that there's a
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:19.640]   real advantage so I think we're gonna see a lot more there and a lot more
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:22.240]   original content I think we're you know Amazon's now going down that path
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:26.520]   Netflix is going down that path and so I think that the Hollywood also
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:31.840]   understands that if they do not play you know what what Amazon and Netflix
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:34.680]   specifically and what Google I mean where YouTube is already kind of going
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:37.440]   down that path and I think Apple should go down the path is that you know you'll
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:40.760]   either let us distribute your content or we'll create it ourselves you know and
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:43.960]   I think that's that's more dangerous to Hollywood or to the to the big
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:48.680]   broadcasters then then figuring out making it easier for people to get access
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:53.480]   to the movies that already exist and I'll have to rely on you guys for this
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:56.880]   because iTunes radio is not in Canada yet so I have not been able to try it
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:02.840]   but 11 million unique listeners on Apple's new service and I know a lot of
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:05.120]   people you know thought you know Pandora should be nervous about this or
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:09.520]   Spotify or or songs but it seems like again and correct me if I'm wrong this
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:12.960]   is like Apple's 80% solution for everyone who would never be bothered to
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:17.040]   go out and get a hardcore music service they are more than happy especially if
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:20.440]   they're already iTunes match subscribers to just start using this and that will
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:23.920]   lead to more discovery and a lot of other things that Apple hopes for oh sure if
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:27.040]   it's just there natively and people don't have to then go and try to download
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:31.360]   some other app to start doing this it's a great thing and to me when people are
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:34.880]   saying well why would Apple even bother with iTunes radio to me it's one of those
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:39.840]   things why not why would Apple want to leave money on the table any sort of
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:44.680]   DNA Clayton right well why would they want to seed the marketplace in any kind
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:49.400]   of way to anyone else I mean it's yes it may not be bringing them gallons of
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:53.600]   cash but it's really about brand people know to go to the iTunes store to
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:56.440]   download the latest album that's where you do it you know your number one on
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:56:00.080]   iTunes this week it's the vernacular right we've had a couple guests on our
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:03.560]   show recently country stars and so forth and say yeah well song is a number five
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:07.360]   on iTunes this morning they don't talk about it on the billboard charts they
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:11.880]   say we're this on iTunes and so why see that to somebody else it's been really
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:15.640]   great I'm really enjoying listening to it and early on I was enjoying listening
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:20.240]   to it over the summer very easy to use and based on artists that I listen to and
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:23.720]   then enjoy if whether it's death cab for Q&A or something else you know just to
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:27.880]   be able to create a radio station around that particular artist also be able to
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:32.480]   create a radio station around a particular song is really great and then
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:35.920]   save them in your in your folder so you have access to on a regular basis and
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:42.000]   it's pretty fast and they've I was really surprised at the variety of music that
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.400]   they've played and things I've learned about and then ended up buying as a
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:46.960]   result which is actually you know which is ultimately what Apple would love
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:51.320]   right if you like the song you're hearing new stuff for the first time and buy it
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:55.320]   well and I think that one of the things that I was surprised about and I have
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:58.800]   to admit I kind of just didn't I was like I don't I don't need that at all and
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:02.160]   the only thing that got me really looking at it was my daughter my 18 year old
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:06.480]   daughter telling me you know that this is really cool and when my my $10
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:12.120]   pretty she's pretty jaded and very geeky you know she's had a computer since
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:15.320]   she was five and she just knows all a little bit the pieces and for her to say
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:19.800]   this is really cool I thought was impressive you know like it was I thought
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:23.040]   okay well now I have to check it out so now I've been I opened it up on the
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:28.760]   Apple TV and thought that that's just a great a great place for it for me you
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:33.400]   know I have a tendency I mean I'm pretty heavy Spotify user but and then for me
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:37.400]   I was just kind of like I don't know why bother you know and but now I'm
[00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:40.360]   experimenting with it because if she thinks there's something and then I feel
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:43.760]   like I better better pay attention because I just thought it was just I have
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:46.280]   to admit I was not very excited about it but I think it's turned out to be
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.680]   pretty good implementation I think that one of the example needs to do and
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:52.000]   think about is how to revolutionize discovery which I don't you know I don't
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.240]   think that anybody's doing very well right now no and I also think I forget
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:02.160]   often I mean what I've even bought you know I I'll buy a new album every now
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:06.240]   and again and I for you know until I somehow randomly stumble across it you
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:09.560]   know you I used to have my CD shelves right like I've got yeah like over here
[00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:13.280]   my shoulder you know you used to have all the CDs lined up and you have them
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:17.160]   alphabetized I knew that my police albums were down here next to next to
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:21.000]   POCO or something and and I just and I could see it and I'm in the mood for a
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.040]   little Miles Davis and I could grab this now I forget that I own things and
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:28.040]   tell you're sort of searching through you I sort of stumble across them and
[00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:32.040]   you're right about that discovery is still discovery and remembering what
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:36.440]   you've purchased well and I think that a lot of one and I don't think about
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:39.360]   purchasing much anymore I mean I have to admit that I'm I've become very
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:43.280]   comfortable inside of the kind of the Spotify world where I just you know just
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.800]   collect stuff and put stuff in there and I have my little playlists and
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:50.400]   everything else and I think that I still think that there is a I think we
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:56.120]   need to think about the new radio which is finding new tastemakers and making sure
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:59.720]   that they they find some way to monetize what they're able to do because
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:04.320]   someone who really gets the kind of their finger on the pulse of music is
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:07.880]   very valuable to the music industry and right now you know the music industry
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:13.200]   is still you know 20 years behind and still looking at radio stations to be
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:18.880]   that that pulse or or you know you to you know videos to be that pulse but I
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:21.200]   think that there are a lot of people out there that used to you know that make
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:24.360]   you know they can make great playlists and right now there's not really an
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:27.600]   incentive for them to do that but I think that some at some point someone's
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:31.060]   gonna realize that if they made a little bit of money off of every everybody who
[00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:34.880]   downloaded their playlist they really you know and we started paying attention
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:38.920]   to who those people are I think you'd end up with a very very interesting you
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:43.000]   know explosive growth in in that process and so I think that we need to
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.480]   think about what that looks like because I think that those are I mean
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:49.040]   that's the next generation of spreading the word is people getting really big
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:52.520]   followings on playlists but a lot of it won't do it that are that are
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:56.680]   prominent because it's just some work and there's no there's no real benefit
[00:59:56.680 --> 01:00:00.800]   from it you know from financially and I think that I think Apple and some other
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:03.040]   folks need to think about that and I think that's one of the ways that Apple
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.600]   could could do something could think different you know and figure out how
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:09.480]   to make that work is to is to really figure out how we're gonna energize
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:12.960]   tastemakers and how we're gonna really connect them with with the population
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:16.160]   I think that's that's really important because there's gonna be all these
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:20.040]   complimentary businesses what Instagram did for photography what playlists could
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:23.760]   do for music and I know Leo wants to tell us about a way that you can actually
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:27.720]   protect that business when you want to go set it up I think it's called legal

[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:12.680]   possible but first I want to talk to you guys about the new iMacs Apple dumped
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:16.320]   these in a press release this morning I don't think that's a huge surprise
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:20.400]   Apple has done that before usually as the way to clear the deck when they have
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:23.440]   another event coming up or something they feel is you know maybe more
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:28.360]   attention worthy and it kind of it sets expectations but it also gets products
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:32.720]   out without having to wait you know for the whole long litany of things and
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.640]   Clayton I know you were following I mean you had some of the best information
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:40.440]   going into the last iMac refresh this looks like you know the same form
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:45.240]   factor but they really ramped up the performance and you know basically the
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:48.600]   specs inside the machine it's got has well in it now and it's got the new
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:53.360]   a ti graphics cards it looks like a great iMac yeah it does I mean we're seeing
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:56.960]   I mean at least according to Apple press release until we get these out and
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:03.760]   start playing with them they 40% increase in graphics performance over
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:11.520]   50% in 50% increase in performance in other areas you know I mean I was I just
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:16.280]   got mine so I just got my 27 inch iMac just a few months ago and you know I'm
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:21.680]   a fit i love photography and so this was to me like the the main photography
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:26.120]   machine I got the fusion drive because you know I wanted to make sure that I
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:30.480]   had I have a drobo that carries most of my Lightroom library and everything
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:34.240]   that I'm doing there but I wanted you know the fusion drive so that first of
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:37.760]   all you know I think it was like thousands of dollars and savings to not
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:42.320]   just have the the SSD drive in there but to just stick with the fusion drive and
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.960]   talking to Apple engineers and others about this you weren't going to see
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:51.160]   that much of a performance hit by going with just the SSD drive over the
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:54.480]   fusion drive for those main apps obviously it's moving and shifting apps
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:57.360]   to where you need it so if you're using Lightroom all the time on the fusion
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:03.040]   drive it knows to store it in the SSD area of the fusion drive so I found
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:06.520]   that okay I'm not gonna I'll be saving myself a couple thousand dollars here
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:11.760]   instead of going that way I'm sure and now I'm just pissed that this just a few
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:14.440]   months later they're out of this one so especially because it seems like the
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:19.240]   performance increases in the SSD area and the way in which some of the way in
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:22.000]   which it's talking to the fusion drive seems like you're gonna see an increase
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.720]   in performance and so I do notice some lagginess here and there when I'm doing
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:31.280]   certain things and I wish that I just waited a few months I think it's always
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:35.760]   wrong it's PCI-E flash now so is that does that give you real world I know
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:39.240]   theoretically PCI-E flash is way better than a discrete drive but does that give
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:43.320]   you real world performance I don't know I mean pretty much all the machines we
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:47.320]   get now are all SSD so we don't I mean we don't we don't use fusion drives we
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:52.200]   don't use say to drive we just it's just all SSD because it's for us being able
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:56.560]   to recover quickly in production we're doing a lot of live events and you know
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:01.000]   a machine needing to be restarted I had it yesterday you know I'm in the middle
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.720]   of a live event and the primary machine you know has an issue and I have to
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:08.640]   restart it it's during an event and I want that to be as short as possible so
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:12.960]   so we don't you know we've had too much trouble trying to deal with fusion
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:15.280]   drives and stuff like that maybe we'll come back to them and take a look at them
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:18.960]   but for us you know we just get even if they're not really big drives if it's a
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:23.800]   desktop machine we're happy to put you know a larger drive next to it and make
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:30.320]   sure that it's got a 256 or 512 you know flash drive on it but yes and I
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:34.640]   know we're not the normal case but there's there are there are only a few
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:37.560]   things that just make a massive difference in performance and if you
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:42.440]   once you get used to working on an SSD only drive you go back to anything like
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:48.120]   fusion or a you know ATA drives or whatever and and it is it's just like I
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:52.360]   don't know it's like walking through sludge it's amazing to me when you look
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:56.760]   at how the Mac has progressed I mean we were used to iPhones and iPads being
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:00.680]   sealed computing appliances but first with the MacBook Air and the new MacBook
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:04.520]   Pros that had sealed batteries Apple started to do that with their computers
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:07.800]   and a lot of us who are used to building our own computers from scratch it kind
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:11.640]   of puts us on edge it makes us feel like we've lost control but it lets them do
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:15.080]   stuff like they're doing with this new iMac and with the new Mac Pro where the
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:18.600]   SSD is no longer a separate part it's on the motherboard and that you know gets
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:23.280]   with a lot of latency it's got 802.11ac which like we spoke about before it
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:27.160]   lets you transfer stuff so much faster without a wire it's also got these
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:31.720]   incredibly thin profiles the Mac Pro is gonna have the board the actual GPUs two
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:35.400]   of them soldered on to the main board Clayton are we in the era I mean
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:39.080]   everything from iPhone 5s iTunes radio are we in the era of popular computing
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:46.440]   I think so you know I obviously we saw and maybe this is telling to see you know we
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:49.960]   had a we it was part of the iPad event last year was a big deal
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:54.200]   or at least it seemed like it was a big deal to have these iMacs part of the
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:58.120]   iPad event last year and they spent quite a bit of time showing them off on stage
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:02.760]   and and spinning it around I think they unveiled it and turned it around and
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:05.880]   disappeared it went sideways and it disappeared right you couldn't even see
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:09.160]   it from the side it was you know spotlight hitting this thing and
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:12.520]   yeah you know we're still we're still working on the Mac and obviously you
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:15.640]   see that with the Mac Pro and obviously Mac Pro will probably take
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:20.200]   priority at this this next iPad event but yeah I think you know just the fact
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:24.840]   that they issued a press release and told us that these things have been updated
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:29.800]   obviously how much of a market is there for the the folks out there who are
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:33.800]   spending three thousand dollars on a 27 inch iMac I mean it's the Alex Lindsay's
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:36.680]   of the world it's the it's the Clayton Morris is the world who are
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:41.160]   doing some heavy photography and thing but yes I think we're in the popular
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:44.120]   computing era and I think you can see that in the sort of the
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:47.400]   summer calling it sort of the uh I think you were even saying this Renee
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:51.720]   weren't you like the sort of the Andy Warhol with the the iPhone 5c
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:57.640]   yeah the colors like yeah yeah and it's interesting to me Alex I mean some
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:01.880]   people were upset that these didn't have retina displays that they're not 4k yet
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:05.720]   you think what it's reasonable to have you know consumer devices going 4k or
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:09.560]   retina at this size yet I you know I think this would have been probably a
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:12.200]   little early I think that you're you're talking about
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.920]   either increasing the price of reducing the margin for something that is still
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:17.880]   pretty out there I think that a year from now we're probably you know
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:21.160]   year or two years from now we'll see you know everything will be all 4k
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:25.320]   I think that that that's kind of the the the the direction we're going I have
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:28.600]   to say that I'm still not one of the people that is a big fan of
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:33.800]   my retina I don't you know I love my my MacBook Pro and we have a lot of them
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:37.560]   um so you know we use these are kind of our work horses
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:41.720]   I would buy them and be happy with them without the retina screen I know that
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:44.680]   people really are attached to their nice smooth text and everything else but I
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:49.320]   still feel like we end up with it puts more it means that there's more of the
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:53.160]   graphics processing it's going to creating pixels that I don't need
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:59.080]   you know to get my work done um and so uh so I I I don't feel like I I'm not
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.400]   that excited about the retina to be honest with you I mean I'm sorry
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.240]   that raises the question in the rest of the computer
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:06.440]   yeah that raises the question we've now got Haswell MacBook Airs we've now got
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:10.200]   Haswell iMacs we're waiting on the Mac Pro obviously has been announced
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:14.520]   Haswell Mac Mac minis could be coming out if they're not
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:19.480]   redesigned and that's probably a press release but retina uh sorry Haswell
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:23.320]   MacBook Pros which would hopefully have the new Nvidia sorry the new
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:27.640]   Intel HD chips in them which would take them from redlining at retina graphics
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:30.600]   to be able to comfortably do it like second or a third and I think you know
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:34.040]   that's the machine I want sounds like the machine Alex wants I just don't
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:37.640]   I don't know if that's a big enough deal to have it be in the event but I feel
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:39.640]   like that's got to be coming next or coming soon
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:42.920]   yeah I mean I think that one of the things we're I mean what I'm
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:46.600]   I definitely expecting to see is is with this new iMac with the MacBook
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:50.120]   with the Mac Pro and the MacBook Pro I think that obviously Apple's going to
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:55.160]   want to cater towards that the you know the professional video
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:58.920]   editors and so on so forth who have pepooted them for a long time but now
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.920]   what they're going to end up seeing and they've already said that they're
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:04.040]   going to have an upgrade to Final Cut Pro I think what we're probably going to
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:07.080]   see is them showing hey you can do it on an iMac you can do it on a Mac Pro
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:10.520]   you can do it on a MacBook Pro and you're handling you know four levels or
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:15.640]   whatever levels they can of 4k footage and go try to do that anywhere else
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:19.160]   you know and I think that that's going to be I have a feeling that that's probably
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:22.600]   going to be the narrative you know is that is that by building this system that is
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:25.960]   totally integrated between the software and the hardware that is designed for
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:30.040]   that I think that they're going to be pushing back at that market because
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:33.480]   that I think that is the market for a lot of these higher level machines I don't
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:37.000]   think if you're doing excel work I don't think you really need any of this
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:41.880]   yeah I don't think it's a surprise apple showed off an upcoming version of Final Cut Pro 10
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:46.200]   that's you know made specifically for all the OpenCL that's going on in the new Mac Pro
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:51.400]   and Clayton I'll be interested to see if the Mac Mini on Haswell because some people no matter
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:57.160]   how nice the Mac Pro is for certain areas they just have different server level needs and I wonder
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:02.760]   if a cluster is of the Mac Mini running Haswell you know in a Mac Mini colo like location
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:06.920]   will be the alternative Mac for the server areas well yeah I think we have Howard
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:12.360]   yeah and I say the mini is one of my favorite we have so many minis
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:17.960]   so so you know and and and then my favorite little glue that I just we put we put them
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:21.720]   everywhere we have cheap ones and expensive ones and we have some that just just power
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:25.640]   you know display and feedback stuff and we have other things that run you know run hang outs or
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:31.080]   run little you know little the little streams and so on so forth and and and I'm I'm really what I
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:34.040]   and what we one of the things we really like about them is the fact that we are able to
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:40.520]   um put them in two of them into one one new racks and I think there are a lot of people that value
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:43.880]   I don't know how many people are actually taking a Mac you know I don't know how many people are
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:48.600]   taking minis and actually putting them on their desk I think the vast majority of us are taking
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:53.720]   them and shoving them into into one new racks two at a time and and locking them in and I would
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:56.840]   love to see a redesign that was more towards that I hope I hope they don't make them round
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:04.200]   mini trash cans that we want to be so sad I have gotten to the point where I've gotten over it with
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:08.520]   the with the Mac Pro in the Mac Pro and I understand why they did what they did and they made it
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:12.360]   really efficient and it allows them to cool everything in a central location allows it to make it super
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:16.840]   small and I I'm envisioning ways for us to put build you know special kids to take them out
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:22.280]   night and they are a lot smaller and which means smaller pelican cases and everything else
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:26.520]   for us to take them where we want to take them but but I'm like I just hope they give they still
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:30.200]   give us some kind of form factor that I can fit into a rack you know I think there's a lot of
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:35.000]   people that'll be bummed if they if they take that away I will not be surprised to see a picture of
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.800]   Alex Lindsey on Google plus with two Mac Pro strapped to his back and those massive heat sinks
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:46.040]   actually providing enough lift for him to get a ball the action to shoot the seats you have to
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:52.120]   try that it's all good. Clayton we talked about this before when you mentioned the iCloud keychain
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:56.760]   and how that disappeared after the beta before it went live in iOS that's also been promised with
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:01.320]   Mavericks Mavericks is coming up I mean often Apple releases Mavericks after their earnings call
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:06.440]   which is coming up fairly soon if not there's an October event coming up we've got airdrop now in
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:12.920]   iOS but it doesn't play nicely yet with airdrop on the Mac how how much do you think we're still
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:17.400]   waiting on Mavericks before everything in the iOS ecosystem kind of gets that next boost up.
[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:22.120]   It's a good question because a lot of the skeu morphism still existing in
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:32.520]   on the Mac that you don't have now in iOS and I don't know I think we saw that lag with iMessages
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:37.880]   too being able to communicate back and forth there was a lot of bugs and it seems like the
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:41.880]   team's trying to work out those issues where you know I'd launch iMessages on my Mac and then I'd
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:46.440]   sit down and then five minutes later I get another message on my phone then even though I had sat
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:51.240]   there and I've actually gone back and forth and answered the person is still showing up on iMessages
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:55.320]   on my Mac so I still think. I had a phone in the corner buzzing with your messages that weren't
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:15:01.320]   showing up on my main phone. Yeah and so I think you know when you've got the the keychain issue
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:08.120]   you know I think that there's still I think they're trying I think they're you know trying to unify
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:12.520]   these two things in a way but I think when I look at the icons I think I look at the you know just
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:17.000]   the contacts when I have to pull up that address book and it still has the old Corinthian leather
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:23.880]   on my Mac it just seems so it seems so dated now compared to what I'm experiencing on iOS.
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:28.120]   You should only have leather on the back of your galaxy now three clinton is the only place.
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:33.400]   One of the things that I one thing that worries me about a lot of the integration that that I
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:37.960]   have to keep kind of stay conscious of is really paying attention to what you're giving access to
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:41.400]   because a lot of us have you know we have an iPad we have a phone and we have a computer and we
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:45.640]   may have a desktop computer and when we install these they all ask you know what do you want to get
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:50.280]   in iMessages and I I pretty carefully turn a lot of that stuff off you know you know I don't want it
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:54.040]   going to everything because you know I don't you know I don't know what's being texted to me you
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:57.640]   know and I don't you know and you know and sometimes it's sometimes it's a password or it's
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:01.240]   something or other and I don't want it going to all the machines where or I don't that aren't in
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:05.560]   front of me and so I know that with me you know a lot of times my phone is getting my messages
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:10.200]   the vote for the phone that I have with me all the time is getting the messages to the to the number
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:13.800]   but I turn most of the other the iCloud and everything else and I've been really I think it's
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:16.600]   important for people to think about that because I think a lot of people just leave it all on I
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:21.160]   know my and you know I had a talk with someone and the company was leaving them all on and you
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:25.320]   can see them appearing everywhere and so that's uh you know that's something that definitely
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:30.280]   pay attention to. Notification pollution yeah they're digging around the house too non-stop you
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:34.200]   know you hear one upstairs and you have you're like oh where there's that old iPod touch ahead
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:39.160]   two years ago. I found it because I've had it exactly in our moment of internet insanity this
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:44.360]   week we had Blackberry messenger for iOS and Android the Android version leaked out the iOS
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:50.440]   version went live in New Zealand and problems arose they ended up having to pull it out. Blackberry
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:55.880]   said that it was because the Android APK that leaked out was not final and caused havoc on their
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:17:00.600]   servers and it's it's going to get you know done again lately it also didn't seem to be compiled
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:05.560]   for iOS 7 so I hope they're fixing that before they release it but a whole bunch of fake ones
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:10.680]   started appearing and then yesterday we had a fake iMessage app in the Google Play store and I'm
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:15.800]   just wondering Clayton uh we're in this era now where communications are everywhere but you know
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:20.200]   the Apple stuff still isn't cross-platform almost at all to the point that people are now
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:24.600]   spoofing it on other stores Blackberry which was locked down for a long time is going to go
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:30.120]   multi-platform. I wonder how long it'll be until there's just a way for us to talk again you know
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:34.520]   SMS took forever to go cross-carrier even it seems like a really hard problem to solve.
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:40.520]   Yeah that's a good question instead of having all of these different companies with their own
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:48.840]   sort of proprietary ways of communicating you know I wanted to share share a photo stream with
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:53.400]   family members and you know just sharing it out to like eight different family members I've
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:57.160]   forgotten that somebody had switched to Android and then I just got a you know rejection notice
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:01.800]   back they couldn't accept it um then this other person who hadn't yet updated to Iowa 7 got a
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:07.720]   ping back he's on Android he doesn't have iMessages he's on Blackberry Messenger he can't receive it
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:13.800]   he's not he's refusing to switch to this to this device um and so you know I don't know I didn't
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:19.560]   never make phone calls so if I can't communicate you communicate with you digitally somehow
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:24.280]   then you know whether it's through iMessages whether it's through text messages whether it's
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:29.640]   through my computer it frustrates me when I'm like my best friend Mike I cannot communicate with
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:35.640]   him using iMessage and there's a couple of other folks in my life who my my friend Andy he still
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:39.880]   has like a flip phone when I sit down at my Mac to get some work done I think oh I left my phone
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:44.440]   upstairs I can't text him using iMessages right now I gotta run upstairs grab my phone yeah it's
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:50.360]   still it's still a little bit it's still a bit of a headache I don't know what we're gonna do to
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:55.320]   get past that um I do know I think that there's also a protocol issue just the one thing I will
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:59.320]   say is that you know one of the things that you'll notice when you're trying to use Skype and calling
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:04.120]   out with Skype because that when people call me on Skype you know you know that all the protocol
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:10.520]   stuff is not as easy as it would seem um and you add latency and a little bit you know it's
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:13.960]   it's incredible what what can be done right now and the fact that we can call the other side of
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:19.560]   the world and have almost no latency but we're pretty sensitive to it if if the latency goes over
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:23.640]   about 200 milliseconds which is about a quarter of a second 250 milliseconds was about a quarter of
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:28.680]   a second it starts to feel very slow and a lot of times when you're trying to get interconnecting
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:34.120]   between terrestrial and and IP those latencies are much higher than that they can be you know they
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:39.560]   start getting to you know 750 milliseconds 1000 milliseconds 1500 milliseconds and and now it starts
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:45.320]   to feel like that satellite feed on you know on your news network you know in Afghanistan and
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:49.240]   it's very hard it becomes very hard to have that conversation and so some of this interconnect stuff
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:54.920]   is proprietary because it is um when we have to deal with this all day this is like my daily like
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:20:00.440]   what I have to do with latency in hundreds of milliseconds and and so um but a lot of it is
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:05.080]   having working with the outside networks and interconnecting with those outside networks
[01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:09.000]   is more than just them being proprietary it is also I mean they could do something about it but
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:14.440]   it's also figuring out how to get out of one system and into another system and when a quarter of a
[01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:19.400]   second makes a difference you know and that's the that is some of the difficulty I do know that
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:24.040]   there is one thing that is still bringing all of us together and that is Squarespace and I think
[01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:28.360]   Leo is going to tell us about that next hello Mac Breakers let me just mention very quickly

[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.920]   I'll give Clayton and Alex a couple seconds to scramble and make sure they've got their picks
[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:20.120]   but I did want to mention that with the iPhone launch apple walked out their executive department
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:25.240]   they had Johnny Ive and Craig Federicki and Tim Cook available for interviews they did them on
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:29.720]   Bloomberg they did them on USA today if you haven't had a chance to see them they're actually really
[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:34.520]   fascinating and Clayton I love the way that they sort of had Johnny and Craig playing off each other
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:39.560]   in those interviews. Yeah and it seems that this this is certainly part of a new strategy
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:45.480]   to put these guys out there make sure that everyone sees this is the future of apple
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:50.680]   these guys you know it's the triumvirate it's not just Tim Cook it's obviously part of a strategy
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:56.520]   for them for them going forward and you know I like the photos too because it's like a fun it's
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:25:00.840]   almost like a like friends you know like from NBC like they're kind of hanging around like you
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:03.960]   know in the photo shoot they're just all hanging around on this backdrop all the
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:07.080]   chicken out their phones like we're just you know just having fun. Could you be more friendly?
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:11.800]   Right. There's just like the theme song of the background and at the end of it they all fall
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:17.320]   into a fountain. Did you think it was manufactured Alex it seemed kind of sincere to me.
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:22.680]   Well I think that I don't I don't know if it's manufactured but I definitely think that I agree
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:27.720]   with Clayton that it is a very specific goal I mean I think that one of the things that apple lost I
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:34.040]   mean I'll they lost a lot when Steve Jobs passed but I think that they lost that epicenter of
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:40.040]   the charismatic leader and I think that what is really interesting and I think a great move
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:46.440]   is to not make that charismatic leader one person is to break it up into I think what we what we're
[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:50.200]   looking at here are the three people that you're going to connect to the three people that are going
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:55.560]   to you're going to think about who are running the company and I think that I think that they
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:26:00.680]   represent three very important aspects of the company as well and I think that it's a I think
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:06.040]   it's a great move by apple to you know kind of go down that path so but it's not going to be again
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:13.560]   one person it's not going to be the Bill Gates or the Steve bomber or the you know Sergey Brin or
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:18.120]   you know and I think Google is actually a good example of of you know having a few different
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:22.360]   people that we look at as you know whether it's Eric Schmidt or Sergey or or you know that you
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:27.080]   have a variety of people that you think of as leaders and it's not all coming from one
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:33.000]   you know one mouthpiece so I think that I think that that's that's important I think it's very
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:37.800]   useful for apple. Some people are wondering Clayton why you know Phil Schiller or maybe Eddie Q weren't
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:42.440]   a front and center because they often play a role on stage when you know Johnny I have is more
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:46.200]   reckless and maybe that was part of the reason they wanted to show Johnny off a little bit.
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:52.680]   Well it's apples rule of three right it's like you know there's a great book written about Steve
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:57.400]   Jobs presentation skills and the rule of three why you always have three main things you know as
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:01.960]   part of your as part of your presentation to put four in there just doesn't work.
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:06.280]   Well you know three has been used for a couple thousand years as right.
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:13.640]   In comedy as well as the rule of three you know you've got it so just you know the fourth
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:17.400]   plus it wouldn't fit well on that business week covered have Phil Schiller just kind of
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:23.480]   popping out of the background. Right right. All right so let's move on into
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:28.680]   picture the weeks what do you have for us Alex. So my pick of the week is a program called
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:33.560]   essential anatomy to and this is something you can get from the app store and I can't remember I
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:37.160]   should go back and look at how much it is I think it's thirty or forty dollars I believe or
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:42.600]   something in that in that vicinity but it is I mean when I was a kid I would have been a lot of time
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:49.160]   just you know cutting cutting people up you know of course virtually and it's just it you know
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:54.120]   this really I think is a the reason that I picked it you may you may decide that you want to get it
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:58.920]   or not but but one of the things to really look at is this is what our education system should look
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:04.920]   more like you know and and obviously it's being used in that but I think that this kind of visualization
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:09.160]   and being able to you're basically able to do is open this up you're rotating it in real time you
[01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:14.760]   can turn on and off the arteries the veins the muscles the you know nervous system the connective
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:19.160]   tissue you know all these things are things that you can simply you know select and unselect and
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:25.240]   just see what all those pieces are and as a learning you know tool I think that it is you know we
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:31.240]   should be thinking about how this happens in education all the time everywhere you know this
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:35.640]   is the kind of stuff this is the beginning of that process and so and it's just a really really
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:41.880]   well-made tool it has quizzes and you know it has a lot of different ways to you know to look at
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:47.560]   these things and so I think that there is anyway I would definitely check it out if you're interested
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:52.760]   in education and definitely in this area but in general I would take a look at it and possibly
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:56.680]   even think about buying it and playing with it I don't know what I would need it for it's not a
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:00.840]   tool that I would use other than we do a lot of education and a lot of visualization education
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:07.080]   so I'm always researching this stuff and it's just a it's very very well made and very stable for
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:12.280]   the kind of work that it's doing I can't believe you know what it's rendering in real time anyway
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:19.320]   yeah it looks unbelievable Clayton what do you have for us oh I got one that's kind of selfish and
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:24.440]   then I have another one here we like self-exulfish works hey you know when you roll out a new app and
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:30.040]   you spend eight nine months working on it you got to be a little selfish right so yes in fact we
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:35.720]   just had an update that just just launched for this past week I think it came out of two days
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:42.040]   ago three days ago was approved so my app read quick it's the world's first speed reading app for

[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:37.960]   already doubled and they're just flying through their news we launched it on iPhone about three
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:42.600]   weeks ago and it has been our biggest hit I wish I would have launched it on iPhone first because
[01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:46.600]   now you know you're standing in line at Starbucks you can read that whole business week article

[01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:07.400]   you can find me on Twitter as well Clayton Morris I'll answer your questions about it
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:13.800]   and one other quick app I love photography and I've been playing around with this you know one
[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:19.080]   of the problems with the you know if you have a DSLR or you have you know like a like a Sony
[01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:23.880]   NEX7 you know the GPS is not built in and sure you can buy like some little dongle and add it to
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:27.880]   the whole thing but if you just want to get geo tagging of your photos when you're traveling
[01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:32.760]   abroad or just here in the States or wherever you happen to be and you get back and you realize oh
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:37.160]   my whole trip it would have been nice to see where we were in that mountain range or along that river
[01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:42.200]   or at that museum and we're in the city it's hard to figure it out using Google Maps sometimes and
[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:48.760]   you don't want to add that stuff later there's a great app called GeoTag Photos Pro for iOS and
[01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:55.080]   basically on your iPhone you create a new trip you know you're going to the Adirondacks this weekend
[01:31:55.080 --> 01:32:00.120]   you create a new trip and type in Adirondacks and then you can set it to Auto Log like leave a bread
[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:05.240]   crumb like every two or three minutes or however often you want so that it knows where you are
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:10.680]   along the path and then you sync with Dropbox and you get back if you're using Lightroom or Aputure
[01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:16.040]   to your main computer and you got to make sure on your SLR you have the proper time set in the clock
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:20.920]   settings because it syncs between the clock settings so it knows where you are according to the time
[01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:25.960]   and then when you get back it syncs through Dropbox you just go into Lightroom and drag that one little
[01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:31.160]   file from Dropbox right into Lightroom and all of your photos will have the GeoTag information
[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:36.280]   from where you were on your trip for a person like me who takes like a thousand photos with my SLR
[01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:40.920]   you like to know where you were when you were in Portugal it's a great app I think it's like
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:48.120]   a dollar ninety nine or or two or three ninety nine I forget exactly but GeoTag Photos Pro
[01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:54.360]   great utility three ninety nine fantastic that's fantastic um I had a lot of public
[01:32:54.360 --> 01:33:00.120]   coming with a pick of the week this week because so many apps updated for iOS 7 a few beforehand a
[01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:05.480]   few after that but on the day of iOS 7 on last Wednesday it was just app after app after app
[01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:12.120]   so I took the cowardly way out and I'm picking apples iOS 7 designed for iOS 7 section because
[01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:16.920]   these are people way smarter than me it's apples app editorial team they go through they carefully
[01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:21.160]   pick out the apps that they think best represent the platform and since they wrote the platform
[01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:26.360]   they're entitled to do this and they have a fantastic collection of apps so if you've got iOS 7 on
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:30.040]   your device especially if you have a new device and you're looking for something to really show

[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:37.160]   you know right out the door iOS 7 apps Alex I want to thank you for joining us I know that
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:41.560]   you are probably in whatever the commando equivalent of video production mode is
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:47.240]   what are you working on lately and where can people find you I am best place to find me is
[01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:52.760]   probably g plus and twitter so I'm just Alex Lindsey I both of them and and I don't really have a
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:59.640]   blog anymore I just post ideas up on on g plus and the I think the most recent thing that I that
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:03.640]   we did that we can talk about we do five or six events a week but I can usually not say anything
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:09.880]   about them so but the one that we did we did a stream with Thomas Keller and William Sonoma so
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:14.600]   if you go to William Sonoma site on YouTube it's we're pretty happy with it it was a great I want
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:21.960]   to cook it and I can tell you it's it's really good we were there on site so we got the sample
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:27.080]   at what it was done and so so anyway Thomas Keller of course is from French Laundry probably
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:32.760]   one of the top cooks in the world and so anyway I'd love to you know get people's feedback on
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:37.800]   and see what they thought of it it's about a one hour live stream how to how to cook lamb shanks
[01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:42.760]   and so so anyway which was you know as it was actually a lot of fun and so so anyway
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:46.920]   that's what we've been working on that we can talk about and we'll hopefully be able to talk
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:51.800]   about something here and there in the upcoming weeks but where to to find out what we're doing is
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:57.720]   you know Twitter and and obviously G+ are the two best places to find me and you've been sharing
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:01.480]   some of the things that you do for your hangouts that I know myself and a lot of other people who
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:06.360]   do hangouts found them enormously valuable so thank you for that yeah it's you know every once in a
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:11.080]   while we get released so I asked them hey you know you know I've got a couple followers I can add a
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:15.560]   couple maybe a couple people to the views if I can show some of the pictures and so they let me
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:19.240]   take pictures of behind the scenes so I think from that Thomas Keller one with with you know with
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:23.800]   William Sonoma they let me put a couple photos up and so if we try to do that whenever we're
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:29.640]   whenever we're allowed to and Clayton had to jump off he apologized but he had an appointment he had
[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:36.280]   to get to you can find him @claytonmorris on Twitter you can find a read quick on the app store
