[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly Andy Inako, Renee Richie and Alex Lindsey in the house
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.360]   we're going to talk about Apple's latest car plans.
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.880]   Who will they work with?
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.680]   iOS, Mac OS and TVOS updates.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.560]   We'll talk about what's new and what's coming with iOS 14.5.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.640]   The Apple Watch now on 100 million wrists and I just team.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.040]   She wasn't saved by her Apple Watch, but she got some interesting stats out of it.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.320]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.960]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.960]   Hello everybody.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.400]   This week I should content warning.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:44.320]   There's no news from Apple, so this could be a wildly vacillating show between comic
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.880]   books and audio and video production.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.880]   Hat traversal.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.880]   And not traversal.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.000]   That's because thank you Renee Ritchie.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.920]   He is of course at youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.800]   And an expert on all things net traversal.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.800]   Actually you're not a.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.800]   No day.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.800]   It's a snow day in Montreal.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.240]   Everything is closed.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.720]   It's weird it's snowing in Montreal and Austin, Texas.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.720]   Yep.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.720]   Go figure.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.720]   We left the back door open on Canada again Leo's our back.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.720]   We're really sorry.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.720]   It's your fault.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.240]   Also with his Andy and I co.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.240]   WG.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.240]   VH.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.240]   Boston.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.280]   See what people don't understand is that not only is there no evidence in the movie itself
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.680]   that decor is a rebel can but also the whole point that his whole story back is about
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.280]   how more from Andy and I love it.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.280]   Oh, okay.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.280]   That's a.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.760]   I thought there was my big chance because we didn't have we don't have much.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.920]   It's a running joke from earlier in the show where Andy apparently has learned that ether.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.200]   What was it you learned?
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.600]   No, there was some sort of like a factoid thing where it's that you know how the movies
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.560]   were like you know in the 1930s like oh my god this is they knock someone up by just
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.800]   pressing ether against their face.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.800]   They still do it now.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.280]   I just saw it in a movie the other day.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.320]   Yeah, but immediately fall over unconscious.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.320]   Right.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.480]   But it takes several minutes.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.480]   I am told.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.920]   I'm not I'm not tested this out on my show.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.080]   experimentation and to which Andy posited he could probably put you to sleep with 45 seconds
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.160]   if he picked the right topic.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.600]   And is my skill set.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.160]   And hey, we're thrilled to have Alex Lindsay back on the board.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.160]   Hello, Alex.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.840]   Oh, nine oh media dot oh nine oh dot media.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.840]   Good to see you.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.040]   Yeah, the true king of net traversal.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.280]   That you know, I'm just glad that I'm coming in for resolution.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.280]   Look at that.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.600]   Look at that.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.240]   So it was marvelous behind the scenes.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.320]   You know, we've been experimenting we use it use Skype since for time immemorial since
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.760]   the mid 2000s.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.400]   But I nervous about the future of Skype.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.720]   We often have problems with Skype.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.760]   So we've been playing with other solutions, including Steve Seguin's very nice OBS dot
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.240]   ninja, which is open source based on WebRTC.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.200]   And we couldn't get Alex to come up with Skype very well if you remember last week.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.200]   He was all blurry.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.240]   I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure that they took all the Skype engineers and they moved
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.280]   him over to teams and they left some like high school.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.760]   Yeah, some like high school interns.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.760]   I actually know high school interns.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.760]   They'll probably do better.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.760]   Probably do better.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.240]   But yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.320]   But they left like like what are we doing with this and they're like they're all using
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.320]   WebRTC.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.080]   They don't even know how to use Skype and they're just doing the best they can to keep their
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.080]   job, you know, because Skype is such a dumpster fire at this point.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.440]   I mean, just because worse every two weeks it gets worse.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.440]   Well, I did.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.040]   Here we are using OBS ninja without Alex and it looks fantastic.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.040]   Go ahead, Sir Andy.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.920]   No, no, I was just going to say that like Alex says like this like $80,000 really wonderful
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.360]   cameras on lighting.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.960]   I have like basically what you can buy from Amazon.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.000]   I think that it's like PG the PGA golfing to the golf tour where you can have a professional
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   who gets a handicap.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.920]   I get a handicap equals the playing field equals the playing field of Alex based on how smart
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.560]   he is about wiring up his studio and the quality of his equipment.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.480]   Skype Skype can option like we're going to we're going to reduce your handicap.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.920]   Your pencil count and you're right.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.480]   So I'm like putting a lead in the jockey saddle.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.480]   That's the equal.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.320]   That's not Queen Latifa.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.320]   It's Skype.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.080]   It's not lead in Alex's Skype connection just to just to make him equal to all of us.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.920]   You do in fact have a great picture, great audio.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.920]   Everything's working well.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.400]   Thanks, Dopias and then Jen, Steve.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.400]   So marvelous.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.440]   Steve, by the way, was a guest last week on Floss Weekly, our open source show.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.720]   So if you want to know more about Steve, it turns out he's a CIO at a big company and
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.880]   he does that in spare time just for fun.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.120]   Alex, you've been using other, what do you use?
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.320]   You zoom, you said, right?
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.160]   Yeah, I mean, so most of the time when we're connecting to folks, we use zoom.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.440]   We use the point what we do is we build zoom rooms and then each zoom room has a person
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.000]   and then we mix everything in hardware much like what you do.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.160]   So it's very much like.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.160]   You have zoomosaurus.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.280]   I have a zoomosaurus, right?
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.040]   Except my zoomosaurus has about 14, 14 points to it.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.800]   So you can do up to 14 people right now.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.880]   I think we're going to go to 20 later this month.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.880]   Nice.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.840]   And so we can take up to that many at one time in zoom and the thing is easier.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.840]   How do you send a mix down back to the participants?
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:20.360]   Yeah, so ours is a little bit more complicated because we, so all of the audio comes out,
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.760]   all the computers are all on Dante.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.640]   So they're pulling all the audio to and from with Dante.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.720]   That goes into a Yamaha Q01, which does the mix and the mix minus.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.160]   But the Yamaha then goes through a clear, common clips and the reason we do that is so
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.840]   that we can add comms, you know, comm channels to the, to the process as it goes back to each
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.840]   person.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.200]   So each person's getting a mix minus, you know, that's formed in that, in that pipeline.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.200]   That way they can hear program.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.840]   They can hear each other, but we can also talk to them.
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.160]   In fact, the way that our clear comm works is that someone, a producer can be watching
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.480]   from anywhere and open up their phone and have comms on it.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.200]   And if they want to talk into the host's ear, they can just push a button and talk into
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.200]   their ear.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.160]   And so that makes it a lot easier.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.320]   There you have it, a slight, small, tiny simulation of what you hear every morning on
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.320]   office hours.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.480]   That's, you know, what's funny is that's all we talked about it today.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.280]   This morning it was all about comms.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.800]   So we just, it was, it was an hour of us just geeking out about comms.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.120]   And now on clubhouse, by the way, which I, I've, I've followed you on clubhouse Alex Lindsey
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.760]   so I can, I can, we had to figure out how to hack the phone because, you know, you can't
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.160]   join clubhouse any other way.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.800]   Yeah, they don't want you putting that stuff in clubhouse, but you figured it out.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.840]   We, we, we got a, we have just the, it's, um, what's it got a little Henry, a little
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.120]   Henry device to do it or, uh, I know it's all tangled up.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:49.080]   Henry's convert the unbalanced phone output into balanced for a mixer.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.640]   So you need like a reverse Henry that takes the un, the balanced mixer output and puts
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.680]   it into the unbalanced phone output or something.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.680]   Yeah.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.440]   So we're using a USB pre two.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.440]   Oh, that's, that's it.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.160]   And you feed the phone.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.160]   You put the phone in the club.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.200]   This is what it looks like.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.240]   This is, this is the USB pre that feeds the phone.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.800]   So it goes, it goes USB out of my, out of my laptop.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.800]   Into the USB pre.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.360]   And this part goes out to the phone.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.000]   It's just, it's just going to one of these little dongles.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.560]   So it all ends up in this little, you know, the little dongle as if you're using a headset
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.560]   to participate.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.560]   Exactly.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.560]   So it looks like a headset.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.960]   It looks like a headset to the, to the phone, but it's, um, full program.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.960]   And club house, nothing.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.560]   We haven't got nothing.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:36.000]   We, we are sending it out right now, but next week we're going to start allowing people
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.640]   from clubhouse to actually talk to zoom through the phone.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.480]   I just, it's just, I'm just trying to make this.
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.640]   I'm just trying to learn how to use clubhouse first.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.160]   And so, but that's one of the things that they did right on clubhouse was you have a
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.800]   stage where you can have a, some number of people on it and you invite people up from
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.920]   the masses below into it, but there's also a raise a hand and then you can give a person
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.000]   a chance to ask a question as the moderators.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.600]   There's some nice moderation tools, I guess is what I'm saying.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.600]   It's interesting.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.320]   I mean, it's not as nice as yours.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.840]   Well, we just have, we have a Q and A system.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.320]   So what we do is the worst part of your in clubhouse, we give you a link to the Q and
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.320]   A.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.320]   Oh, that's terrible.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.000]   So people are listening in clubhouse, but we tell you, and in, in the description, we
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.520]   tell you where to go and then you can ask questions.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.520]   And so then we're kind of merging.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.880]   I hope this doesn't get used against you by clubhouse, like this recording, like clubhouse.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.320]   You see, you see your honor.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.360]   I told you he was hackers.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:34.240]   You were on, you were actually quoted in clubhouse.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.760]   You were in Renee Richie, some room that got a lot of attention recently.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.520]   Yeah, it was all the wrong kind of attention.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.520]   What was it?
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.920]   What was going on in the room?
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:49.000]   There was a clash of different moderation styles where a very, very, very, probably one
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.400]   of the most popular YouTubers on earth was doing a Q and A and he's very new to the platform.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.880]   He just moves people in and out.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:01.680]   The only one moderating could not keep up and involved the contest of Gary Vaynerchuk
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.680]   avatars.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.680]   I do not want to die.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.680]   Oh, Lord.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.440]   But he got confused and moved some people out.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:14.120]   One of the people he moved out was clubhouse popular and wasn't used to being moved out.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.840]   And so went to Twitter and so what you're saying is the mean kids are here in clubhouse
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.840]   now.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.480]   No, it's just like the thing is that there's expectation debt.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.960]   Like some people believe very strongly that you should always take questions.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.960]   Some people want to do what Alex does and just broadcast like a lecture.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.360]   Some people want small panels or only the panelists are talking.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.000]   Others want to continually change.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.520]   Some people and some people are very cognizant about who like we were trying to increase
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.520]   diversity on the panel.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.720]   So we were moving some people out to bring more women and other people up and some people
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.920]   don't care about that.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.800]   Some people desperately care about it.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.920]   When you have so many people with such very different expectations, it can sometimes be
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.440]   explosive when they're not all like real life.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.640]   It's like a conference room, but like it's all different kinds of conference rooms at
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.440]   once and everybody wants a different kind of conference room.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:08.160]   And since we've been doing this for a year, we have a very specific way that we like to
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.160]   discuss stuff.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.920]   So like for instance, we open up.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.120]   So on Wednesday nights, we're doing at seven o'clock on Wednesdays, we're actually doing
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.600]   clubhouse clubhouse, which is like we're not using, you know, we're not piping zoom into
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.600]   clubhouse.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.080]   And in that sense, though, still, I know who all the people are that are on my panel all
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.080]   the time.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.080]   And I just bring those guys on.
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.120]   Just bring everybody up to the, uh, it's called moderate stage.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:34.400]   And then, and so if I don't know somebody, if they're not someone part of our community,
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.600]   I kind of am not ready to take too many chances yet.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.640]   You know, with that, and we had so many bad experiences in the very early days of our,
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.360]   our little zoom sessions where people would come in and zoom bomb and everything else
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.440]   that were pretty specific about how we do it.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.800]   You're doing what eventually everybody on club is will have to do, but you have years
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.960]   of experience ahead of time.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.600]   So some people think that's not fair.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.760]   And then, and of those people are also popular.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.720]   It can create a lot of disharmony.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.680]   I don't want to spend the whole show talking about clubhouse.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.120]   It's not that light on Apple news.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.840]   Although I think technically we could call this kind of an Apple discussion because the
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.600]   only place clubhouse happens is on iOS right now.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.880]   So, yeah, they have an eight person team and they, they keep saying they're working on,
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.040]   on the Android version, but they're also having huge scaling problems because they're,
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.920]   they're built on Al Gore, which is an audio video platform from China.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:27.000]   And when some, when someone big comes on, like recently they've had outages because Elon
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.440]   Musk came on, Elon Musk came on and brought Kanye, Steve bomber came on a couple other
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.360]   really big, and the idea of Steve bomber having to use an iPhone for clubhouse, the lights
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.480]   meet in so many, so many ways.
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:44.120]   Oh, that when you stopped on Steve a couple of years ago, and you should have brought
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.120]   this you kept out.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.120]   But yeah.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.320]   And then some people are concerned about the security model for Al Gore and whether it's
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.920]   like for a Gora sorry, whether it's straight to China.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:53.920]   Straight to China.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.920]   If you're worried about TikTok.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.560]   So the good news is there about eight million clubhouse clones like yesterday.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:06.520]   In fact, we had Wesley Faulkner on, uh, Twitter on Sunday and he works at a company that does
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:10.880]   daily.co that does web RTC integrations for people.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:16.280]   Uh, they're, they have a real time API and he said, uh, one of their users created a
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.080]   clubhouse clone in one hour.
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.640]   Cause if you, you know, if you can use web RTC, there's spaces on Twitter, which I haven't
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.680]   used yet, but it's been around for a while.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:30.080]   Uh, Mark Instagram and Facebook and Facebook, Mark Cuban has announced something called
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.480]   fireside, which is sounds like clubhouse.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:37.400]   I mean, it's not hard to do, to do what clubhouse is doing, honestly, the hard part is the
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.960]   community, the community building.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.960]   And yeah, as always, yes, with everything doing this.
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.680]   Because with everything, it's the network effect.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.600]   Well, there's one called stereo that has limitless venture capital money from Beidou
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:56.440]   and they are paying a fortune for quote, unquote influencers to host rooms on, uh, their platforms.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.760]   You know, we said since we've thousands and thousands of dollars.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.120]   So by do's also a Chinese company.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:04.320]   So since we've already brought this up, maybe we should, because this is something that
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:10.520]   Apple has, uh, is, is grappling with right now is this issue of, you know, should you,
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.720]   well, there's a Apple's does business in China, which means they have to follow the laws
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.720]   of China.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.720]   So that's one issue.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.200]   And then the other issue is Apple's very dependent on China because everything's assembled
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.200]   there.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:25.320]   There seemed to be a noise over the last few weeks that Apple is looking to move as much
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:31.000]   of its manufacturer or its assembly anyway, out of China to places like, uh, Thailand,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.800]   South Korea, uh, Vietnam, India, Brazil, uh, Foxconn, of course, has factories there.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.000]   It's also supposedly building a factory in the US.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.920]   Uh, what do you think, Andy?
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:48.560]   What, what should, how should Apple approach China?
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:52.240]   Apple needs to have a plan B in case things go very, very south there.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:57.720]   Uh, cause we've, not only, not only, it's here too, even if as we start to say, we don't
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.520]   want to work with China.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.920]   Uh, that becomes an issue too.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.160]   Look what's happening with clubhouse and Agora.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.840]   But, but not only, not only for the, for any political reasons or any trade reasons, but
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:15.520]   because we saw what happened when, uh, when they've, uh, when the, when the coronavirus
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:20.120]   started shutting down manufacturing in China, the fact that they put so much of their investment
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:24.080]   in if China shuts down, we have no ability to build iPhones.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.600]   We have no ability to move.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.040]   I think that put the fear of God into a lot of different industries.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:34.080]   That's why you see a lot of other, uh, other nations offering really, really good terms
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:39.120]   to companies that want to start to build manufacturing plants is why Foxconn is, has started to,
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:44.240]   has really up their game and making sure that, uh, whereas before you would see plants being
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:49.360]   manufactured and, excuse me, plants being built in India, mostly to comply with local
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.160]   laws saying, look, if you're going to sell in our country, you have to manufacture in
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:57.120]   our country, we're now seeing we need the idea that we have to diversify, uh, our supply
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:02.000]   lines because otherwise we've seen what happens when you have, uh, when you, when you trust
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.920]   one incredibly good source, uh, for your, for all your supply, but also I, I won't beat
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:14.320]   this horse again, but I do think that Apple is going to need to have a lifeboat in case
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:21.520]   they're, in case China ever throws them a rule that they just absolutely cannot, cannot follow.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:25.120]   Uh, once they, once they pass a law saying, look, we're going to have to make sure that
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.000]   we're, we're going to have to insist you create a new version of Iowa's forest.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.680]   Let's, let's, let's us track any citizen that we want based on any one of 50 different
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:39.120]   demographics that we ask you to wire in, Apple's going to really have to say, okay, we're done.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.560]   And so at that point, they're going to have to make sure that they have that plan in place so
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.120]   that they could simply have a bump in their, in their workflow as opposed to we're done,
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:52.240]   we have to reinvent ourselves. And I think that there's, there's a balance between the two as well.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:57.120]   I mean, I think that the, the one of the issues is that China can't afford for a huge outflow of
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:01.920]   all the per, you know, spook, apple leaving would be, would spook a lot of manufacturers.
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.680]   It would not be good to try to overall.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.480]   It would be a cot of the canton.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:10.480]   Yeah. And, and, and so, but I do think that right now trying to reproduce what China has would be
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:16.560]   very difficult anywhere else in the world. But the overall trend on almost every industry is the
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:21.280]   diffusion of resources. How do you move? I mean, we're seeing it with people, you know, leaving
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.040]   California, leaving New York, leaving cities, leaving, you know, all those things. This is
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:29.840]   going to change a lot of things forever. And, and so we're going to see, you know, companies
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.120]   have gotten clear that you can't have any one place that you're building things because,
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:39.280]   you know, we've seen this in, I don't, there's a lot of drama right now in the audio industry,
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.600]   because one of the factories that makes all the little A to D converters caught fire.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.720]   They're the only ones that make those, you know, and, and so now, you know, no one can
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.120]   build their mixers and build their other things because of that.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.160]   Wait a minute. You mean that in Thailand with hard drives, we've seen, you know what?
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.000]   You mean all the A to D converters are made in the world are made one of the factory.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.480]   Building. There are tiny little piece of concrete.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.160]   Are there multiple companies that make those things?
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.280]   It's a tiny, we had that one.
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.080]   The protein cheese.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:04.480]   The cost three dollars.
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.520]   The national disaster.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.680]   The protein cheese factory burned down.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.280]   Well, this happened before.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:15.200]   I remember there was a big fire a few years ago in a ran in a memory factory.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.080]   And even though it wasn't the only one, it still was made some
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:22.560]   there weren't many straits and supplies. And, and you know, this is, this is,
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:29.280]   you know, a very important point, I think is diversity in the supply chain is important.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.240]   And of course, it's hard.
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.080]   You get someone gets into a circle of something that they're really good at, you know, so this
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.560]   is AKM the AKM fire is the factory fire.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.520]   How I am in no business.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.400]   And they make these, they like, they make these little chips that,
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:44.320]   that they could be down for six months to a year.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.240]   And you know, this is everybody uses it.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.800]   Like every, it's like it's the thing that everybody uses.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:53.360]   And so in the markets, not big enough to support probably two or three manufacturers.
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:57.120]   That's the problem. It's just a, it's everybody's using them, but it's not a huge market.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.720]   It's a very, very vertical market.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.880]   There also, but we saw that also shortage.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.920]   I mean, we saw applies now for graphics cards and the end of,
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:10.080]   the end of tape, you know, came from the, the, the, the earthquake.
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.560]   So when the earthquake in Japan,
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.960]   the last two factory,
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.680]   no, they destroyed the only two SR tape machines,
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.840]   because one had been moved from LA to for calibration or something.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.600]   And so, so suddenly those tapes became prohibitively expensive.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.800]   Everyone moved to memory and that was it.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.680]   It was the end of tape. That was, like it was, it was.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:36.640]   So, so, so diversifying to Andy's point, diversifying is what everybody should be doing,
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:41.040]   you know, and I think we're going to, and it's become much, much easier in the last six months.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:47.040]   So this AKM, I'm looking at a story of ProSound network from October.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.720]   AKM factory fire, a pro audio industry disaster.
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.760]   This happened in October, but it's still an issue.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.720]   Assowing because the chips went from three or four dollars each to like a two hundred
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.280]   dollars each.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:19:59.600]   Wow.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.400]   And this is not just ADCs.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.000]   This is DAX as well, apparently.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:04.800]   Wow.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.360]   I thought there were like a lot of different companies making these things.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:15.760]   Is this a case of kind of like, uh, fabulous design company designing a DAC and then outsourcing
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.360]   it to AKM or?
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:22.080]   It's really just, it's an OEM that just provides that chip and they're really good at it.
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.240]   And they just make them all in the market.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:24.640]   All the same.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:29.680]   Not enough to test them and build another DSP emerging technology, SPL and RME all
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.920]   designed around AKM chips.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:32.240]   Wow.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.760]   Anyway, yeah, but it's that kind of thing.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:41.040]   And then that's what, that's what China, China has all these other various issues that
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.960]   are going to continue to be a problem for them.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:47.600]   And to your point, Leo, this is why we're seeing, we're suddenly seeing a lot of a lot of interest
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:52.480]   and investment in chip manufacturer plans, chip foundries, because we have two foundries
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.520]   in the entire world.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.720]   And once they get out, get capacity, that's it for phones.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.760]   That's it for graphics cards for, for heaven's sake.
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.040]   The thing that really got my attention as I was following this is that, wow, they're actually
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:08.640]   considering building a major chip foundry in the United States of America, where it's really,
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.040]   where you're not going to get that much help from the government.
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:15.520]   You're not going to get that much help from the labor organizers.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:23.440]   The fact that any part of the world is now open to the idea of we're this desperate for
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:28.560]   having the ability to do five nanometer chips, any sort of technology that is desperately needed,
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:34.400]   we can't have it all, we can't have it in a situation where Apple can buy 80% of the output
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.560]   of a single factory, because that really puts the brakes on not just the phone industry,
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.400]   but the entire chip industry.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.680]   To give you an idea of what-
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.560]   Because they're worried that-
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.920]   Go ahead.
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.800]   Go ahead, Renee.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:50.480]   No, there also fears that China is looking very hungrily at Taiwan's semiconductor manufacturing,
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:54.960]   and may want to at some point make moves of nationalizing it or taking it over or making it
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.400]   supply Chinese interests.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.240]   I think Ben Behren had a really interesting article this week about why it's critical that
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:05.600]   Intel doesn't stop doing its own foundry work, or maybe spins off its foundry and makes it
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.920]   makes its nodes, its processes available to everybody else, because it comes-
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:14.240]   We could easily get to a point where you need foundry outside of Asia, and right now you have
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.000]   Samsung and you have TSMC.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.200]   That was with the new Intel CEO, the Gelsinger, the rumor was that Gelsinger would announce that
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.880]   we're going to close our fabs.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:26.640]   Fabs, just to give you an idea, this fab that you were talking about, Andy, that TSMC is going
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:33.840]   to build in Arizona, will cost $12 billion, and it won't go into production until 2024.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.920]   What is it real? TSMC keeps promising to build stuff, or was it Foxconn?
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.160]   Was it- Foxconn's the Wisconsin one?
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.960]   Yeah, that was a political act.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.440]   It was the end they got some tax money, I think.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.400]   He would post every two weeks on the progress of that plant.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.840]   Yeah, nothing happened to that.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.240]   I mean, eventually they'll do something with it, I'm sure.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:01.040]   So, yeah, in Arizona fab, that's one solution.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.840]   That'll be TSMC's second facility in the US.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:08.560]   They have one in Camus, Washington, but that's a pretty old plant, actually.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:09.920]   Right.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.640]   It's the newest technologies that are most precious now.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.840]   Yeah, nobody wants the old chips.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:19.280]   And I think this really is important to Apple because Apple does custom chips,
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:26.000]   and all of their production, iPhone, iPad, and Mac, rely on chips made from TSMC at this point.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.560]   They used to double source with Samsung, but Samsung, on this generation,
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.480]   Samsung hasn't been able to keep up.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.440]   Their fifth generation process isn't as good as TSMC's,
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.680]   which is why everybody wants TSMC's.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:42.160]   And it turned out that it was a really good bet on Apple's part to prepay and fund all of that.
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.000]   They bought them up ahead of time, huh?
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.520]   They helped.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.720]   They've spent so much money there.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.360]   They essentially fund the launch of a new process,
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:53.040]   which is incredibly expensive and that grants them access to it for a while.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.880]   Let's take a little break.
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.520]   I do want to come back and talk about that because now we're starting.
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.600]   For the first time, we've seen benchmarks of a new M1.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.560]   Chip on the geek bench sites.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:07.440]   I don't know if this is BS or if it's something worth talking about,
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.240]   but it's about when we start to see them, I think.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.400]   Lots more to talk about.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:18.480]   Actually, as it turns out, there's a 14.5 beta for iOS.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.640]   That has a significant number of new features.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.000]   We could talk about that.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.280]   They've seeded the second beta of 14.5.
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:30.880]   Yeah.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:31.760]   And a lot more.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.000]   Another shots fired sort of release.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:34.400]   Yes.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.440]   Another shots fired.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.480]   I think you just said the right phrase.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:42.320]   Our show today brought to you by Sandisk.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.520]   You know the name Sandisk.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:48.000]   I've used Sandisk memory in my cameras for years in my phones
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.240]   when I used to be able to put micro SD cards in my phones.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.840]   This is a new Sandisk storage solution.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.440]   I'm really excited about this.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.640]   This is the iExpand.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.400]   Well, I've have two of them here,
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.760]   but I'm going to show you the iExpand flash drive Lux.
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.600]   You're going to love this.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.800]   So here, let me hold it right here because I want to surprise you.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:13.680]   Looks like a normal USB key, but look, it's got a lightning port on it.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.760]   Oh, and look, flip it around.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.000]   It's got a Type C connector on it.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.600]   So this is really cool.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.640]   If I plug this into my iPhone,
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:27.520]   the Sandisk iExpand flash drive Lux has its own software,
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:28.640]   it says allow.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.640]   I'm going to communicate with the software,
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.920]   and it's going to start backing up my photos.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.200]   It's going to start backing up everything I ask it to back up,
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:43.120]   including photos, contact information, music.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.240]   This is awesome.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.960]   And because it's lightning, I can connect it right to my phone
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.640]   and then flip it around.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.680]   And now I've got Type C.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.920]   So I could plug it into my Mac or any other device
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.120]   or copy it to another phone.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.080]   No internet needed.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:58.000]   If you don't have to use iCloud's photo storage,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.120]   you can if you want.
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.680]   In fact, this will back up everything from your iCloud photo storage,
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.080]   if you want.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.680]   So you don't just get thumbnails.
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.200]   You'll get the originals.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:09.680]   You could choose from 64 gigs, 128 gigs or 256 gigs,
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.040]   depending on your storage needs.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.360]   It's, you saw as soon as I plugged it in,
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.840]   immediately launched the iExpand software.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:16.400]   And look at this.
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.840]   Wait, but show my, show my phone again.
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:18.400]   It's almost done.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.440]   You're going to miss it.
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.200]   It's already backed up 200.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.520]   Oh, just finished back here.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.520]   You just missed it.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.360]   But it backed up all my contacts.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.560]   I can set what I wanted to back up, when I want it to back up,
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:31.600]   just plug it in.
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.520]   And now I can just unplug it.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.480]   And I can easily put it on my MacBook or anything else
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.080]   with a Type C connector.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.080]   Move your content around.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.400]   This is fantastic.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.640]   For the first time ever, I could just plug something in
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.880]   to my, my iPhone and get the data off right away
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:52.240]   without uploading it to iCloud without even air dropping it.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.360]   So it's great for really big files or mass copying of files.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.680]   And it happens completely automatically.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.160]   I just have to say, copy the photos from the phone,
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.320]   copy files from the iExpand drive.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:06.080]   Here is a directory of all the stuff on my device,
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.800]   including basic files.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.600]   I can get all my music and you see it even shows you the album
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.240]   art and everything.
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.000]   So you know exactly what you've got.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.160]   My videos, I can copy them over.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.160]   Boom, just like that one by one are in mass.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.200]   You have a select all button and of course all my photos.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.240]   There's a lot of photos on here.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.960]   So it's going to take a little while to sort those all.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.400]   And actually I've already backed them all up.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.200]   So it's not going to take too long to back up the additional stuff.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.520]   This is an awesome solution.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.200]   You don't have to mount it or unmount it.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.560]   You don't have to do anything.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.240]   You just need the iExpand software on your, on your, on your phone.
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:40.080]   You don't need it on your laptop obviously.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.760]   In fact, here I am on a Linux machine.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.080]   Watch this.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.560]   I can plug it in and I can see all my data.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.240]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:51.440]   The two and one drive from Sandisk, it's called the iExpand,
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:58.720]   iXpand, flash drive, Lux for iPhone, iPad, and any USB type C device.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:02.720]   The two and one drive from Sandisk, go to sandisk,
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:06.880]   s-a-n-d-i-s-k dot com slash Mac break.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:11.440]   You can get 15% off your first order of the featured Sandisk products.
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.200]   There's more than one on that page.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.920]   But one of them will be the iExpand.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:21.600]   That's sandisk, s-a-n-d-i-s-k dot com slash Mac break.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.760]   So handy.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.040]   I love it.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:30.320]   I just, as a matter of fact, I just bought a couple weeks ago a different Sandisk to
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:36.800]   upgraded my flash drive to 256 gigs USB C because I needed the speed,
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:42.400]   I needed the portability because everything in my office is supposed to be able to talk to each other.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:47.680]   But sometimes it's, I just, for some, sometimes you just need to take a big pile of files,
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:52.400]   in my case, a big pile of movies, and I just want to plug it into my video streamer and not
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:56.240]   have to deal with, oh, but I have not logged into from here to here.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:00.720]   Sometimes sneaker net is actually the best source to get a solution.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.000]   Plus you have a backup now.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.400]   You know, it's not internet independent.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:08.640]   The other thing I really love about these, and I actually, it's not in the app,
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:12.000]   but I'm going to mention it, every time I get a Sandisk device, it has a keychain.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.680]   These are made of nice solid aluminum from the thing.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.840]   But you can put this on your keychain and carry it around.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:18.560]   And I love that.
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:19.920]   It makes it very, very useful.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.960]   I'm a big fan.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.920]   So thank you, Sandisk, for supporting Mac Break Weekly.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:29.840]   Thank you for supporting us and get your 15% off at sandisk.com/macbreak.
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:30.640]   Okay, I'm done.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.400]   I just wanted to show that to you.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.280]   I have another one too.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.720]   I'll save that for another show.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.760]   There's another device too.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.720]   It's all on that page.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.560]   Moving right along.
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:39.600]   It's got my V90 cards.
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.400]   So good.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.480]   Like everything in my, all my cameras is always Sandisk.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.440]   Always.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.360]   Because the new one's recorded at such a high rate,
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.400]   with such a high resolution.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:48.880]   It's amazing.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:48.880]   It's amazing.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.880]   It's because I'm modeling it.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.440]   It's like mind-boggling.
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:52.000]   It is happening.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:52.560]   What has happened.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:56.240]   And now they have micro SD cards that are huge.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.920]   I mean, it's really exciting.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:02.640]   I remember, I can still remember like seeing the spec for the micro SD cards
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.640]   and seeing the speeds and the size, and you're like,
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.680]   that's never going to happen.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.240]   Well, you're like, there's no way to follow that.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.440]   You're pinky fingernail.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:10.960]   You know, it's terrible.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.320]   I got the C70, which is basically the next generation
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.680]   for the C200 Cinec camera.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.800]   And it just uses V90 now.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.280]   It doesn't even use the big CF cards.
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.440]   It just, you put in the SD card and it works.
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.640]   It does double recording.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.520]   It does relay recording.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.160]   It's fantastic.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:30.800]   It's so, we're old enough to have our minds bottled.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.120]   That like, right here on my desktop,
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:37.360]   I've got a 10 terabyte drive
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:41.760]   that I've nearly filled up with like historic backups
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.080]   and DVD rips and Blu-ray rips.
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.560]   And before it would have been like, even five years ago,
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.480]   it would have been, oh geez, I'm running out of space.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.920]   I better like fine room.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:50.160]   Okay.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:50.960]   I don't need that anymore.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.320]   I don't need that anymore.
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.280]   Now I'm like, I combined other 10 gigabytes for 120 bucks.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.440]   I'll just, I'll just put a sticker on this with the date,
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.080]   with the hard drive in the closet and buy a brand new
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.840]   10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, or 12 terabyte hard drive.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.040]   It's such a wonderful, there are things about 2021
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.360]   that don't stink and storage.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.880]   That's the cheapest storage is one of them.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.880]   - I, go ahead.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.800]   - We've got into getting these OWC,
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.200]   these little raids using MVME.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.960]   And they're like four, you put four MVMEs
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:28.400]   and there's a 16 terabyte raid that's like this big.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:34.560]   And it runs at like 2000 gigs, you know, like our two gigs.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.040]   - It's stunning.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.560]   I don't know if that in real time, can you?
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:37.520]   - It's stunning.
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:37.840]   Wow.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:43.760]   No, you can add it and grade at many streams of 4K.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:44.880]   All at the same time, yeah.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:45.520]   It's crazy.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.200]   I hope that factored it.
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.080]   - Alex, it's basement.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.520]   - I just seen just tweeted about 15 minutes ago
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:56.160]   and it was both scary and kind of cool.
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.640]   Thank you, ScooterX in the chat room.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.720]   So I just seen tweets.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.400]   Running at high elevation is new for me.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.200]   And I passed out a mile in.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.480]   I'm so mad because I didn't have fall detection on my Apple watch
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.840]   because I would have actually needed it.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.720]   But at least I could see the exact moment of blackout.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.520]   Thanks to the heart rate drop.
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:19.680]   There's a proper geek is like,
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:20.640]   at least I got the data.
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.840]   At least I could see my heart rate go from 122 to zero.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:28.160]   Anyway, she says, and I walked a mile back.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:31.120]   So she's, I guess she's okay, but holy moly.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:36.240]   - That's a serious, that's just the geek cred.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.840]   She's got her priorities all like,
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.200]   you know, well, at least I got a good 20 minutes ago
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.320]   and it happened an hour ago.
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.320]   Like she's right on the Twitter.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.680]   - I can't change the fact that I passed out,
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.200]   but at least I got content from it.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.160]   - Yeah, right.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.880]   - I would have done this for the content.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.600]   But since I have the content, I can do some good with it.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.440]   - I'm explaining Jiu Jitsu now,
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.800]   but there's a safer way to train yourself to resist cross-chilks
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.360]   than I thought I passed out.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.760]   - Well, I didn't realize, and I've learned something today,
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:08.800]   is that when you do pass out,
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.360]   your heart rate goes down practically instantly
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:15.840]   to 72 beats per minute apparently from close to 164.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.200]   - It probably goes into survival mode, Leo.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.600]   So I'm guessing it's like any change in life.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:19.840]   - Yeah.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.080]   Well, that's actually cool.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.080]   That's part of the defense mechanism.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:27.440]   But the fact that if when your blood pressure dives down,
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:30.400]   yes, you pass out for a lot of very straightforward reasons.
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:33.520]   But one of the adaptations is that if you're lying flat,
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:37.040]   your heart can push blood around your body a lot better.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.520]   And so there's a good chance that you'll actually come out of it.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.240]   It's...
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:46.240]   - All right. So Renee Richie is nominated for our rumor debunker.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.840]   - Okay.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:48.640]   - As always.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:49.680]   - Bring it on, my pot.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:50.400]   Bring it on.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:54.640]   - From Apple Insider, Apple M1X chip
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:59.200]   appears on CPU monkey, which I've never heard of, but
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.960]   12 core...
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.280]   This is a benchmark site.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:08.800]   According to an alleged benchmark of a pre-sample of the M1X
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.720]   that appeared on CPU monkey,
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:11.920]   as Apple Insider points out,
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:15.440]   we can't independently verify anything about this.
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.440]   So take it with a grain of salt.
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.800]   But it's completely credible.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:25.200]   The M1X chip in this benchmark is 12 cores.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.800]   Instead of 8, internal GPU 16 core instead of 8.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:39.600]   So a GPU forward Apple processor Renee, credible, yes or no?
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.160]   - So I mean, the thing to remember about benchmarks is that,
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.960]   like one of the reasons that they leak out is that a lot of them
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.520]   will sit up viciously, or at least without telling you,
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.840]   without informing you, without asking you upload your results
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.720]   to their servers, which is why whenever people get review devices,
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.800]   you see just Geekbench light up with them,
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.560]   they don't realize that it's happening.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.120]   Internal people are usually smart enough to know that,
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.960]   and so they disable that functionality,
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.800]   or they use their own internal tools.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.960]   The only thing that I'd say here is that,
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:07.760]   I don't think it matters if the benchmarks for this leak out,
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:11.920]   because an M1X would be using the same generation silicon IP
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.560]   that the M1 does.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.360]   - Exactly.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:16.160]   It's a 5 nanometer, 3.2 gigahertz chip.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.320]   So it's not a faster chip.
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.120]   It's not a new process.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.320]   - A single core would be the same.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:20.800]   - Yeah.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:21.120]   - Yeah.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.440]   - You would just logically extend the number of cores out
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.120]   for the multi-core processing potential.
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:27.280]   - Right.
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:32.160]   Why would Apple, you think, do more GPU cores?
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.680]   Is there, what would that give you better GPU performance?
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.520]   - They have to, because they're not doing discrete GPUs,
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.200]   and the high end MacBook Pros and iMacs
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.080]   all currently have AMD discrete GPUs,
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.480]   but those have phenomenal power draw.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:48.240]   Like if I put Final Cut on my Mac and take out the plug,
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.120]   it goes from like eight hours of battery life to an hour and a half,
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.280]   just because it's hitting the GPU so hard.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.560]   So what they're hoping to get,
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:55.680]   like just to give you an example,
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.400]   I think the power draw on the MacBook Pro now is 99 watts.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.040]   Like it's as much as legally allowed,
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:04.560]   and the M series runs at about, I think, 12 to 15 watts.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:08.240]   So they have a phenomenal envelope at which to accelerate,
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:11.920]   what people commonly think of as an integrated GPU,
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:13.840]   using just scaling out the number of cores.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.200]   - Would that do it for you, Alex?
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.520]   Or do you still need something more?
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.080]   - No, I think that we're going to be able to do it with
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:20.960]   the built-in cores.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.160]   I think you're going to keep on adding cores.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.000]   I think as we see more of these chips come out,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   we see the M2, M3, M4,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.160]   what we're going to see are more CPU cores,
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.240]   and more GPU cores, and more RAM.
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:33.440]   You know, like that's what's going to distinguish these chips
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.160]   from each other.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.440]   - And more and more and more and more and more and more and more.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.440]   - And more and more and more and more and more and more and more.
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.000]   - And unified memory means they get all the RAM to the graphics as well.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.360]   - Yeah, you can always add a dongle.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.600]   I have a, I have a, I have a dongle.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:43.600]   - I have a dongle.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:44.560]   - I have a dongle.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:45.360]   - I have a dongle.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:45.680]   - Oh, I would.
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:49.280]   I mean, I would love to have more, but I'm just saying that it's, it's one of the great things,
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:53.760]   by the way, about the, I have a bunch of the minis is just have so many, so many connections.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.320]   - The old minis.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.240]   - But not the, the new minis.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:01.920]   - The new ones are still, I got two USBs and I've got an HDMI and two, two USB Cs.
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:04.560]   And so I've got a bunch of stuff that's available to me at that point.
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.880]   But I think that, you know, what we're going to see,
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:10.160]   that's what's going to distinguish these chips from each other as we go towards a Mac Pro,
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:14.960]   is more cores and more, more, more cores of both graphics
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.320]   and, and then also more RAM.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:20.000]   And I think that it's going to make a stunning difference.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.880]   Like it really is an exciting time to, we were talking about it this morning on office hours,
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:28.960]   that, that I really was very clear that I was, I thought I said this before on the show.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:32.880]   I was very clear that I was moving to Linux or, or Windows for all the high-end work.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:36.400]   And we were already starting to do that by computers that were going down that direction.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:36.800]   - Yeah.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.560]   - And now we don't have to do that.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:43.760]   - No, in fact, I wish I could get, I could get the equivalent of an M1 on Windows or
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:46.880]   not Windows so much, but on Linux I would be really thrilled.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.680]   But it's okay, I'll use a Mac.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.720]   I can, I can live with it.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.040]   - Working on getting Linux, don't they have some former Linux running on the online?
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:53.920]   - Yeah, they do.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.800]   Corellium, the company that does the emulator stuff has made a,
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:00.160]   has created a Linux that'll run on the M1.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:05.280]   But Apple's put up a lot of roadblocks to running anything but macOS on the new hardware.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:09.760]   - The advantage that these GPUs are going to have, there's a couple of things.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:13.280]   One is that the only reason they did discrete GPUs is because it was a modular
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.080]   design to begin with.
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:16.880]   Like you would go to the cart and you'd order the parts and put them together yourself.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:20.240]   But if you're making your own thing, it doesn't matter if it's discrete or
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:23.360]   if it's embedded, if it's built onto the board.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.520]   What really just matters is what you can do with it.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:29.040]   - Well, if that gets better, if you can get the same kind of horsepower built on,
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.240]   right?
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:30.560]   - Yeah.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:35.280]   - Unless you want a machine like a Mac Pro, it'd be nice if they broke it out into a module
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:38.800]   board that you could replace, you know, over the years as the computer ages.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:43.200]   But just for, like, especially for portables, most integrated graphics never had you.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.480]   Like, not only did they not have unified memory, they never had the amount of memory
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.240]   that unified memory provides them.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:52.160]   They were relatively RAM starved and now they get access to not all of it,
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:54.240]   but they get access to a large chunk of that.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:59.040]   And as you increase both those things, the architecture, like when Alex said the M2 and the M3,
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.560]   the architecture is also going to get better.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:04.880]   And they've hired some amazing GPU talent over the last few years.
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:08.720]   So I expect we'll see both the architecture improve for the GPU,
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:12.960]   the amount of voltage they feed it will improve and the number of cores.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:13.840]   We'll improve.
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:19.440]   And I don't think it's at all unreasonable to say that they will be knocking on AMD and
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.760]   Nvidia's door within two to three years.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:22.880]   It's really hard.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:27.600]   - Let me offer proposition, Alex, and you tell me if I'm wrong on this.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:35.120]   Of course, it's nice to be able to upgrade GPU or to use an eGPU.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:41.520]   But if you can buy hardware, and I'm going to, this is a secondary question,
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:47.520]   but if I add more GPU cores, that's the horsepower I'm looking for.
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:48.960]   Is that right, Alex?
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.320]   - It is, to some degree, yeah.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:55.520]   - So in a pro, I'm going to guess, and I'm going to know from you, Alex, if this is the case,
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:00.960]   isn't so worried about upgradeability, they're going to buy another one if they need the more
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.400]   horsepower, right?
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:08.560]   - Well, a lot of times, I mean, so I have some PCs that have four big Nvidia cards in them,
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:11.120]   you know, PC with like, you know, a-
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:14.160]   - But given the benefit of having those GPUs on core.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.720]   - Yeah, it very well could be.
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.240]   It just depends on how many cores they add.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:22.480]   And the thing is, is that being integrated with the RAM and with the CPU
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.800]   makes them so much more efficient.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:25.280]   - Exactly.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:29.840]   - That I'm not sure what Apple has to do to be as good as all of those cards I'm adding to it
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:30.320]   right now.
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.840]   And so I don't know-
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:34.640]   - Well, let's stipulate that they could get close to that.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.160]   But it's not upgradeable.
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:41.600]   I think that you would accept that as a trade off and just say, well, when I need more horsepower,
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.760]   I'll buy the next one in a year or two.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:44.400]   'Cause you're a fan-
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:49.280]   - I think there's a high probability that if Apple pushes it far enough,
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:52.640]   it will be faster than anything out there that is reasonable.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.440]   And then you would, I mean, now the question is with an Mac Pro,
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:58.480]   do you just make that part of the computer replaceable?
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:02.160]   So, okay, and we just pull the member, having that whole heart,
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.560]   you can just pull that heart out and put another one in.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:05.440]   And it might cost you-
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:05.920]   - It's a module.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.520]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:11.120]   - So you can just pull that module out and put another module in
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.720]   because it's all unified.
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:17.120]   - Or is that whole notion of upgradability kind of maybe out of date?
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:17.920]   Maybe that's not-
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:21.120]   - It just depends on how fast you can advertise the hardware.
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.520]   I mean, when you start spending $50,000 on a piece of hardware,
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.600]   you may want to be able to upgrade it for a little while.
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:30.400]   But I think that it is, it just depends on how fast it is
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.360]   and what you're using it for.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:35.200]   But I don't, I have to admit, most computers that I buy,
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.600]   I don't upgrade after I build it.
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:42.640]   Like I have a PC that sitting next to me or Linux box
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.640]   that sitting next to me and it's-
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.120]   I spent a lot of money on it and built a really beefy one,
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.360]   but I'm not constantly upgrading stuff.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:52.640]   Now some people may, but I don't know if Mac users do that a lot.
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.440]   - I think it's a-
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.720]   - It just depends a lot on me.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.880]   Sorry.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:57.920]   - No, let me finish this.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.040]   - No, it's because they don't-
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.080]   - Go ahead, you go.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:00.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:01.920]   - Okay, so I apologize.
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.600]   - I'm a terrible traffic cop.
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:04.640]   I got to work on this.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:05.200]   - Okay, wait a minute.
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.480]   - It also depends on the-
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.080]   - Renee Rich, you seem more practice.
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:09.200]   - I know, I need more practice.
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:10.000]   - I'm fine.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.280]   - Thank you, Troy.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:12.560]   - Is that what I mean?
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:13.200]   Am I going?
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:13.440]   - Yes.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.200]   - I'm a terrible, as I say.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.280]   - Can I get white gloves with that help?
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.960]   - Okay, go ahead.
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.320]   - It depends a lot on the market too,
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.000]   because for mainstream customers,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.160]   the people who are not computer enthusiasts,
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.560]   the people who look at them as tools to get their job done,
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:29.920]   it really has improved the quality of the computer for them
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.120]   that the things aren't moduled.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.360]   Because a lot of issues that people had over the years,
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:35.440]   when you look back at the repair reports,
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.920]   where things just like RAM modules getting loose,
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:41.040]   or a hard drive module problems,
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:44.080]   it was a fact that all these parts were kind of just assembled,
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:45.680]   like they were made from parts bins.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:47.120]   They were just thrown together-
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:50.000]   - Even Ray Maxwell on the new Mac Pro
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   had a problem with the promise rate card,
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.240]   because it was made by Promise, not by Apple.
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:56.320]   And there was an incompatibility, which they fixed.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.680]   If everything's-
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.760]   - So it's cheaper when you buy,
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.440]   it is more expensive when you have to replace it,
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.840]   because it is a whole thing, it's no longer modular.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.960]   But for hobbyists and enthusiasts and pros,
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.240]   then you need the modularity,
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:11.920]   because they're the ones you want to buy that $6,000 chassis once,
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.400]   and then keep updating the CPU and everything else
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.200]   for the next 10 years.
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.400]   - Well, that's kind of my question,
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:20.960]   is a lot of us did upgrade the cheese grater a lot.
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.680]   Like we were constantly changing stuff inside the cheese grater.
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.360]   - But that may have been because you had to, right?
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.160]   Like-
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:30.240]   - The closure didn't break.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.280]   - Right.
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:35.520]   - I think the new Mac Pros are potentially something you want to upgrade.
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:37.040]   I think all the other ones, not really.
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.080]   Like you wouldn't,
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:40.720]   no one's really thinking about that as a Mac user.
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:43.120]   I mean, yeah, there are, there's like a 1% or 2%,
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.160]   but not 90%.
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.440]   90% are just like,
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.600]   I'm going to buy this and I'm going to use it until I replace it.
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.560]   I'm going to put it on the shelf and have it be a server doing something else.
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.520]   And it will be insanely fast for a long time.
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:58.000]   So I think that overall, I do think the Mac Pro,
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.120]   how they manage that, I don't-
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:02.320]   I know they know, I don't know anything about what they're going to do with it.
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.080]   But I think with the other computers,
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:05.360]   everything up to the Mac Pro,
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:09.840]   no one's going to expect to internally upgrade it.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:12.880]   So they may buy peripherals that make it faster or better,
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:16.320]   but they're not going to do anything internally to make it faster or better.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:21.040]   - I like your proposition that maybe you have an upgradeable CPU module.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:23.520]   - Yeah, I think that-
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:26.640]   - Well, well, really, the thing is when you look at the AR
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.840]   stuff that's happening in USDZ,
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:33.840]   I mean, I just feel like this is just this massive wave about the hit us.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:34.880]   - Yes, I agree.
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:37.600]   - Oh, I think that when you start opening 3D,
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:41.360]   really easily managing it in motion,
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:42.960]   you see the future of every app.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.040]   Motion and Final Cut now have 3D just built in.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:46.320]   And you just kind of move it around.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.400]   What happens when that's in Keynote and Pages?
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:52.960]   And what happens if you can pop objects out and throw them into the living room from that?
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:54.640]   And it's going to be very hard for anyone,
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:59.040]   any other platform that doesn't support this at the OS system to do it.
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:05.360]   And so it's going to be very compelling and competitive in the next couple of years.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:10.400]   - Yeah, one of the things that makes that unique is that their table stakes for graphics
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.920]   are very, very high relative to Windows and other platforms.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:19.680]   With Windows and Linux, there are entire parts of the marketplace where,
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.840]   look, all we're doing is we're pushing spreadsheets.
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:24.400]   Refs performance really doesn't matter whatsoever.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:28.160]   Whereas every single level of the operating system
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:31.920]   will integrate every highest level of graphics performance
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:34.800]   that Apple has available to itself.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.520]   And that has to work on phones, has to work on tablets,
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:38.960]   has to work on the desktop.
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:41.520]   So when I say the table stakes are pretty high,
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:45.840]   it's difficult to compare the power of, I'm sorry,
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:52.480]   it's difficult to translate the difficulty of creating the same sort of opportunities
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:55.600]   that are available on Windows and Linux and transplanting that to the Mac
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:58.880]   because they have to make sure that the GPU that you get for free,
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:03.600]   even if you're just buying it for your kid, is going to be adequate for a very,
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:04.880]   very wide spectrum of users.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:05.680]   - Renee?
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:06.240]   - Yeah.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:09.520]   - The thing I keep thinking about is that Apple just announced that new Mac Pro.
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:11.920]   Like it was 2019, like it was 2019.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:15.200]   They had the M1 Macs, the whole M-series Macs well underway.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:18.800]   And I don't think they would have invested that much in creating all those modules,
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:24.080]   like the Afterburner card, the M1 extension cards, all of those things as like just a one-off.
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:30.400]   So I'm hoping praying that when they get to the M-series version of the Mac Pro
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:32.720]   and that sort of smaller one that we've heard rumors of,
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:36.720]   they will make extensions like that that allow them to off-board some of the things,
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:40.320]   like maybe even the processor, the memory, the graphics,
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.360]   so that you will be able to swap out or at least upgrade those things.
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:46.720]   Because that's a phenomenal investment in industrial design,
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:49.600]   just to waste it on one computer for two years.
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:51.600]   - Your power supply is probably good.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:52.640]   Your case is probably good.
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:55.040]   Most of your RAM is probably going to be good.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:47:00.320]   The idea of having to upgrade an entire box with all of that stuff in it,
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:05.040]   just because you find one part of the architecture to be inadequate for your current needs,
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:07.760]   that's contrary to Apple's message of,
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:11.840]   "Oh, look how green-friendly and how recyclable all of our packaging is."
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:16.320]   We love the planet so much that we're not going to give people cables and power adapters anymore.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:20.240]   That's how much we love the planet, but we will landfill a $30,000 computer.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:26.160]   I will say that I very much doubt that the current computers will support the M1.
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:28.320]   I think that the M1 will be a new piece of hardware.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:32.160]   You'll use the other one for something else.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:34.080]   It's not like you're going to throw it away.
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:37.120]   I don't know when the last time I threw a computer away unless it broke.
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:39.440]   They're all used for other things.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.200]   - We gave all our cheese craters away.
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.520]   - We couldn't figure out what to do with the old cheese craters.
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:44.960]   - Oh, I still don't want to.
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:51.600]   But think about the people who only need one really good, powerful computer,
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:53.920]   only a couple of really good, powerful computers.
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:57.920]   It's not as though you can give the old computer to the marketing department
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:01.200]   if you're a single proprietor or if you're just two or three people.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:04.400]   And these are the people that get hit when it's like,
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:05.520]   "Damn it, I've got this."
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:09.760]   Like I said, when I spent $12,000 on this workstation,
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:14.000]   how much of it was in everything that is still perfectly good for my needs
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.640]   and will still support a new CPU or a new graphics card?
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:23.920]   That's the one thing that constantly gets me interested in Windows.
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:27.360]   The idea of if I start with the right motherboard,
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:31.440]   I can upgrade CPUs for the next two, three, four, five years on and on and on.
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:33.600]   - I have to admit that.
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:36.480]   I mean, and I don't know how everyone runs what they do.
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:39.360]   Generally, I need everything to pay itself off in six months.
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.440]   - Like when I buy something?
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.040]   - Well, that's how I might be fine.
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:44.640]   At that point, I rent things.
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:46.240]   I rent things if I'm not going to pay off in six months.
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:48.320]   I just go, I need to know how it's going to pay itself off.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.080]   It's going to have to do this much work and everything else.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:53.120]   - So if you had that upgrade every year and you would be okay,
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:55.280]   because that's six months of profit,
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:00.000]   you said something really interesting, Alex.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.880]   And I think maybe we've underestimated the power of Apple owning the whole stack,
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:09.920]   because whatever Apple decides to do with all of this capability,
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:15.600]   they're going to be able to put a huge amount of power behind it.
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:19.760]   It comes in both directions.
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:23.840]   They're designing something new and designing the hardware to support it.
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:29.280]   But also the hardware stack will enable stuff that maybe they haven't even imagined yet.
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.040]   I think right now they're thinking AR.
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:33.600]   - Well, and I think they've imagined a lot.
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:34.560]   - Yes.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:38.240]   - The thing is that I think that when we look at this,
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:43.440]   I mean, where we are now, the roadmap was probably created a decade ago.
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:45.120]   - I think they're completely free.
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:47.600]   - But you don't want to throw out a serendipity either,
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:49.920]   because you can't imagine all the possible uses.
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.480]   And it may be there's something that comes up,
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:55.280]   because you have this stack that you didn't think of.
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:55.840]   - Yeah.
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:59.760]   I mean, I just think that if someone was asking me what the most valuable
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:03.520]   piece of, what are the most valuable software that I own?
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:07.920]   And I said, what I made the most money with is keynote and numbers.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:11.760]   I show people what's possible, and then I tell them how much it's going to cost.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.760]   (laughter)
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:19.840]   And it's funny because we can talk about all these other apps I'd love to use,
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:22.000]   but those are the ones that pay the bills.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.600]   And I can build tons of stuff on PowerPoint and slides and keynote.
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:30.240]   And keynote is, I mean, it's just clearly better.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:33.200]   Like it's then the other platforms.
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.520]   And it gives you a competitive advantage.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:40.720]   And when I can add 3D objects to it, it's going to be a big deal.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:42.880]   Now, the hard part is, is I won't be able to send them to anyone
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:46.160]   or show it to anyone that's not on a modern platform.
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.880]   So it puts a lot of pressure on a lot of things.
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:53.520]   So in business, you're going to have a competitive advantage to be able to pop up.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:58.320]   People are going to be showing clients things on iPads in 3D
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:01.200]   and then you're going to need tools to build all of that.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:04.560]   And then you're going to be sending your clients AR,
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:06.880]   stuff, oh, you don't have that?
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:08.080]   Or you're left out?
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:11.440]   And there's not going to be easy ways to do that in other platforms.
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:18.480]   And all this hardware is really building towards this highly graphical future
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:20.080]   that is where the future is going.
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:21.440]   We're not going back to text.
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:26.160]   It's challenging, though, because you're trying to figure out five years ahead of time
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.160]   what's going to be the next big thing.
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:31.120]   And you're building all your hardware aiming toward that.
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:32.320]   And if you pick wrong...
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:36.400]   The thing is, is that the easiest way to predict the future is to create it.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:38.800]   And Apple's in a position to do that.
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:40.000]   Yeah, I would say.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.800]   It's much easier.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.560]   They're building just so much capacity.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:53.200]   It's a real, like the AR situation is a perfect example of the difference between Apple and Google.
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:56.880]   Google threw something up on the wall really early that was really cool.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:01.680]   So what they were doing was groundbreaking, but it was half-baked,
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:05.600]   and they were just waiting to see if it was going to work, then they quit.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:07.120]   They just went, "Oh, well, this didn't work."
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:08.080]   So then they moved on.
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:15.120]   Apple is slow to the market, moving very, very inch by inch by inch, slowly doling out
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.800]   a little bit more every day.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:20.320]   And Google started by building the roof.
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:22.240]   Apple started by building this foundation.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:30.160]   The thing that gets lost in the conversation is that Google always was very, very explicit
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:35.120]   that this is an experiment, that the whole rollout of it was that, look, we don't know how people
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:36.560]   want to wear this sort of stuff.
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:43.920]   We don't know how well people, just a simple question of if you're wearing a really explicit
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:48.640]   wearable device, how do other people interact with you and how does that affect interactions?
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:52.160]   There's a reason why it wasn't just a regular for sale project.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:55.360]   It was the Google S called the Explorer edition.
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:56.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:56.480]   Right.
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:59.760]   But they took a lot of good experience out of it.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.880]   I think a lot of the entire industry learned a lot about it.
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:08.560]   And though it's very, very true, what Alex is saying about all the groundwork that Apple is doing
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:09.840]   to make sure that they have it.
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:15.280]   Right now, they seem to have 95% of everything they need on the software side,
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:20.400]   and all they need now is the technology, the hardware technology, the display technology to catch up.
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:26.160]   However, it's still a crapshoot about whether the world is going to change
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:32.320]   enough that everybody, enough people have access to augmented reality technology so that if you
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:36.080]   create an AR presentation for something, great.
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:39.440]   If you walk into a conference room and they're going to say, "Oh, well, here's the projector.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:42.560]   I hope your AR device uses VGA because that's all we have.
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:43.520]   We're going to be able to use DMI."
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:48.640]   It has to be accessible and it has to be something that the society really really
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:53.120]   rocks or else it is going to be like something like Google Glass where it still exists.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:59.040]   HoloLens still exists, but it's only inside a rarefied environment in which everybody
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:02.320]   absolutely makes sense for them to have it, such as training, such as
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:09.120]   architecture firms that want to walk your billion dollar client through your 10 billion dollar project
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:10.480]   in a very, very flashy way.
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:15.680]   What you have here is, by the way, this is throughout the technology industry,
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:20.320]   and I bet you it's in real life as well, two different philosophies, top down versus bottom up.
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:27.040]   There's arguments. You made a great argument, Andy, for top down and Alex made a great argument
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:33.280]   for bottom up. There's a problem with each of the problem with bottom up is you don't know what's
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:37.760]   going to happen when you get to the Holy Land of a perfect hardware or software stack.
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:41.280]   Maybe you got it wrong. Maybe there's something else that's even better to do.
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:46.480]   Andy, the problem with Andy with the top down is it's a half-baked idea.
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:52.160]   So you don't ever really know fully what is possible because you're throwing stuff at the wall.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:53.920]   Well, I wish there were some way to combine both.
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:55:01.280]   The issue is Google just has one of many examples of where Google gave up early.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:04.240]   Well, I don't know if they've completely given up.
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:08.160]   No, they just lost a lot of ground.
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:11.520]   And I think it's like, let's go back to Hangouts.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.200]   Let's talk about Hangouts, something I know a lot about.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:18.160]   Google built the coolest thing that they had ever built and then they got it.
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:20.320]   And that turned out really well for them, didn't it?
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:20.800]   Oh, I know.
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:22.400]   It doesn't always win.
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:22.720]   It doesn't always win.
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:23.600]   A billion dollar mistake.
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:24.240]   It doesn't always win.
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:31.120]   It's also very possible that Apple is making a big bet on AR/VR and it turns out nobody wants it.
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:35.600]   That's the other side. That's the downside of doing it this way.
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:42.480]   If it turns out to be what Tim Cook and everybody else thinks, the next great big thing,
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:44.080]   then they'll be perfectly positioned.
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:45.920]   But it's also risky.
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.120]   It's not guaranteed.
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:48.160]   They'll come down to content.
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:50.080]   Like they just have to, Apple has to know.
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:50.480]   You know what?
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:52.320]   They've been pushing this AR thing for a long time.
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:54.800]   Does anybody use the AR?
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:56.000]   I know you do, Alex.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.160]   And I made my mask fidders with my Bellas 3D.
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:03.680]   But honestly, most of them look like toys, experiments, games.
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:05.040]   They don't look that serious.
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:08.800]   I know you see a future, Alex, where it is serious.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:12.000]   But I don't think the market has said at this point.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.040]   Yeah, we really want this.
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:15.120]   The market doesn't know.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:16.320]   And you're right.
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:21.760]   You're taking the Steve Jobs, Alan Kay point of view that you tell the market what it wants at a time.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:33.200]   The other way of thinking about it is that there's the research that's very, very useful
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:35.280]   when you keep it behind closed doors.
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:40.720]   Because I don't want to spring this upon the public until we have the entire story
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:41.440]   ready to tell.
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:46.160]   We can't just give them Act 1 and Act 2 and then say that you guys right Act 3 for us.
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:50.960]   We will be standing by taking notes on what you think Act 3 should be, how the story should end.
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:56.320]   The other thing is that the other idea is that sometimes developing technology,
[00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:59.920]   it really is like being a working comedian where you have to just go.
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:01.120]   You have to be in York City.
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:08.000]   You have to go for three different slots at night, working in material,
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:12.720]   you dispose of stuff that didn't find an audience or you keep developing it, it doesn't work.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:14.000]   You find the stuff that does work.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.840]   You keep embellishing it and building upon it.
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:17.280]   It's not a one-to-one analogy.
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:22.720]   But sometimes there are things I really, really admire about Apple's way of doing things,
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:26.560]   which is not so much that we have a finished thing.
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:31.840]   It's that we have something that we ourselves absolutely believe in and we're willing to define
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:34.720]   this as this is part of what the company's future is all about.
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:37.760]   We are not going to throw away something that we think in the future.
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:38.880]   It's all about for the company.
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:42.880]   I also appreciate Google's idea of this is a good idea.
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:45.920]   We're not going to know if it works until we actually put it out there.
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:52.640]   This is why this is why when someone says, how about if we had a helium balloon with like a
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:54.000]   robotic balloon?
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:54.800]   That project.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:56.320]   That's a loony idea.
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:58.560]   So where the internet has to be?
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:01.280]   And Google will say, that's stupid.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:02.640]   That's a ridiculous idea.
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:04.800]   We're going to give you, we think you're so stupid.
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:09.840]   We're going to give you $100,000 to a pilot program just so you can prove how stupid you are.
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:15.360]   There is a hazard though to Google's way of doing things as a public company and the public
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:20.720]   eye, which is stuff can get killed because of a short-term quarterly mentality.
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:25.920]   So Apple by keeping it secret and by holding their cards tight to their chest does have that
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:30.640]   luxury of working on something for years so that when it does emerge, it's a little more fully
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:31.280]   formed.
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:33.200]   Look, those are two philosophies.
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:34.400]   I don't think one is right.
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:36.880]   They're distinctive ways of doing things.
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:39.520]   The heavy challenge for Google though is that no one trusts them anymore.
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:42.400]   So when something comes out of something cool and they've put it out, we're like,
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:43.440]   "Ah, we'll see."
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:45.280]   We'll see how long they hang on with it.
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:48.800]   And so the problem is now they're in this self-fulfilling property.
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:49.760]   Trusts jump in.
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:54.640]   Because it does take investment of time and energy to build up.
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:58.560]   When people build up, spend millions and millions of dollars to build up huge
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:05.600]   followings on G+ and then they kill it.
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:11.120]   There are a lot of examples where in both cases, where magically developed this magic
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:13.760]   thing everybody said was magic, magic, magic, then they came out with something
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:14.720]   everybody said, "That's no good."
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:15.520]   And it's over.
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.360]   They're basically killed the company.
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:20.640]   So there's a risk.
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:23.920]   I'm excited about what Apple's doing.
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:31.040]   I hope that they leave a little space at the end for something unexpected.
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:34.800]   Because that's what often happens to technology is you put something out there and you find
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:37.920]   unexpected uses that actually- That's what the Apple Watch saw, right?
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:37.920]   Yes.
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:39.040]   Like that's a good model for this.
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:43.280]   They had the Apple Watch had very confusing, very broad messaging and they used one or two
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:47.280]   generations to hone down onto what is now very specific, very appealing messaging.
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:50.880]   And I think that's the case with product categories that aren't that well established.
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:54.560]   Like that old, they had 10 years of watching tablet PC, 10 years of watching phone.
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:58.640]   And they could- All that stuff got figured out for them while they were watching the market,
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:03.520]   but wearables and now visual bowls, whatever we want to call them, projectables, all those things
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:04.480]   are brand new.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:08.000]   And so they've got to be part of the process rather than just sitting back and observing it all.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.280]   They can look at a few really early, like that old crossing the chasm.
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:15.920]   Those really early early adopters, adapters and see what they think is going on.
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:19.760]   But I think it's going to take them two or three generations to nail whatever the A-
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.360]   I think that's the best way to do that.
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:22.880]   I think that's the best way to do that.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.400]   I think that's the best way to do that.
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.920]   I think that's the best way to do that.
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.520]   I think that's the best way to do that.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.880]   I think that's the best way to do that.
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.320]   I think that's the best way to do that.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.920]   I think that's the best way to do that.
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.120]   I think that's the best way to do that.
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.480]   I think that's the best way to do that.
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.840]   I think that's the best way to do that.
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.280]   I think that's the best way to do that.
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.640]   I think that's the best way to do that.
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:39.840]   I think that's the best way to do that.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:40.640]   I think that's the best way to do that.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:41.600]   I think that's the best way to do that.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:48.080]   That's actually an example of an iterative process for Apple compared to the pre-planned process
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.240]   that they might be pursuing now with AR.
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.840]   Great conversation.
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:52.320]   Thank you guys.
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:56.160]   We're going to take a little break and we can apply what we have learned here today
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:59.680]   to the Apple car, which is our next topic.
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:05.120]   I'll show today brought to you by ITProTV.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:09.280]   Boy, the tech industry, you'd have to say even in COVID,
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:15.040]   especially in COVID, has been expanding the demand for IT skills and the workforce is growing.
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:19.040]   I saw the other day four million job openings for IT professionals.
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:24.480]   An IT career could be rewarding, longevity, and you know what?
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:31.120]   If you listen to our shows on Twitch, you probably have got a pre-inclined towards that kind of thing.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:33.920]   I want to suggest ITProTV.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:38.400]   This is the place to get those IT skills that are in demand
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.200]   so you can get that job, that perfect job.
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:45.040]   You want to be valuable to your future employers, your current employer,
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:48.000]   if you're already an IT, and you will with ITProTV.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.200]   ITProTV is great because you can get information about what the hot jobs are.
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:59.600]   You can figure out, they'll help you figure out which fields you're most interested in,
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:03.920]   and then they'll tell you which certs you need, certifications you need to get that first job.
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.560]   And all of this, it's not hard.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:07.520]   It's not a burden.
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:08.240]   It's fun.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:14.480]   All of their instructors are pros in the industry but with great teaching styles.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.640]   They're entertaining, they're informative.
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.520]   You're going to learn in a way that you enjoy.
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:22.320]   And ITProTV really has doubled down on this.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.240]   They started in 2013.
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:29.040]   We introduced them to you and of course sent them many people.
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:32.480]   I know many of you are ITProTV customers already.
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:35.760]   Over the intervening years, they've gotten bigger and bigger.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:39.280]   Lisa and I went out a few years ago to see their new studios in Gainesville.
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:44.640]   They now have seven studios running Monday through Friday, 8am to 6pm.
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:49.920]   It's kind of remarkable because IT changes.
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:50.720]   Everything changes.
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.080]   New versions come out.
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:55.680]   The quizzes, questions change in the cert exams.
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:59.040]   But that's why ITProTV is always making new content.
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.800]   Now, 5,800 hours of great IT training.
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:04.880]   You can stream it on your computer, on your phone.
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:08.160]   You can watch it on your fire TV, your Roku, your Apple TV.
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:11.920]   Get the certs you need without leaving home.
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:18.560]   At your own pace, your own schedule, a lot of ITProTV students are working day jobs.
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:22.640]   But they want a better future and that's why they go to ITProTV.
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:25.840]   One reviewer said, "This site has helped me with two certifications."
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:30.720]   Also as the supplemental material for my grad school classes,
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.720]   that's how high quality this is.
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.480]   Give it a try. You won't be disappointed.
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.880]   February is Project Management Month at ITProTV.
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:42.080]   They had a great webinar, February 11th.
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:45.840]   It's on demand now called "Navigating the Future of Project Management."
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:46.880]   You can watch that.
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:51.520]   You can take courses in PMP, ITIL, Service Management, Agile.
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:54.320]   You can get training in Microsoft, Cisco, Apple, Linux.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:58.720]   They're also the only official video training partner for CompTIA.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:03.360]   So they have all the CompTIA cert courses, A+ Network+ Security+.
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:08.640]   If you need and want one, you can get one of ITProTV's amazing learning coaches
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:13.760]   and all the wonderful job resources to help guide you on your career path.

[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:20.720]   And don't forget, there's Adon Pezet on the screen.
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:24.960]   He does a really great free podcast everybody can listen to called TechNado,
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:32.160]   featuring IT guests and IT news recaps for a deeper dive into the realm of information technology.
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.400]   ITProTV.

[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:13.760]   We love those guys, Don and Tim and the whole ITProTV gang.
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:16.880]   So who's the...
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:19.600]   It's not Hyundai.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.040]   Apparently it's not Kia.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.000]   Or is it Kia?
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:22.560]   I don't know.
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:25.360]   Nissan maybe is in the running.
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:28.880]   I have a friend who says watch Leo, it'll end up being Ford.
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:32.320]   Could you bombardier?
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.080]   Didn't Ford just announce they're doing much of Android stuff?
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:37.760]   They did a five-year deal with Google, so I think probably Ford's out of the running.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:39.040]   But who knows, you know.
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:43.760]   Renee is his acting partner like it wouldn't be any of their...
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:44.320]   It's the FoxCon.
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:47.680]   It's the FoxCon of automobiles.
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:48.400]   Or is it?
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:51.120]   I mean we don't know that for sure.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:54.400]   We're assuming that they'll have that same model they have for the iPhone.
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.400]   But I've been thinking maybe it isn't.
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.800]   Maybe they're looking for somebody...
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:05:59.440]   Think of the razor.
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:00.960]   Or the razor.
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:01.440]   What was it?
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.360]   Rocker.
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.160]   The rocker.
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.120]   Yeah, well no.
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:07.280]   That's a bad example.
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.480]   It's not the rocker.
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:09.440]   But maybe they are...
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.040]   Make the word of the tone down, Loretta.
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:11.680]   Maybe...
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:12.320]   Yeah, really.
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:15.760]   Maybe that was the first Apple phone that was a...
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:17.360]   Who did they do that with?
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:17.840]   Singular?
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:18.800]   It was a real roller.
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:19.360]   Roller roller.
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:19.680]   That's right.
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:20.480]   It was a real flop.
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:25.680]   But no, what if it's a car maker making a car under its own badge that says,
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:28.720]   "Apple inside" or it has an Apple logo on the hood or something?
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:29.280]   I mean it might not...
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.960]   It's not a like CarPlay++.
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:31.200]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.640]   It could be that.
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.640]   I mean that's the deal with Google making with Ford.
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:36.400]   It's not going to be a Google car.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.160]   It's going to be Ford.
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.680]   It's just...
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:40.800]   Well it's not even that.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:44.480]   The deal with Ford is that they're in-dash computer that does navigation,
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:45.440]   that does entertainment.
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:48.720]   It's just going to be built on top of the Android operating system.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:49.920]   Well but it could be more...
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:52.560]   They're implying there's more than that actually Andy.
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:54.560]   That obviously the operating system.
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:56.800]   That's what we know.
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:58.880]   I don't know what the future was.
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.080]   This is...
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:03.120]   The automaker said it's worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:07.920]   The tie-up will make Google responsible for much of the automakers growing in
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:12.800]   vehicle connectivity as well as cloud computing and other technology services
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:18.960]   in addition to using whatever it's called, the Google Auto platform
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:21.680]   to replace QNX, which Ford uses currently.
[01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:23.120]   So it's a big...
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:25.760]   I think it's unclear what the scope would be.
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:27.600]   I think it's beyond just the operating system.
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.760]   Canada is very unhappy to this deal.
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.040]   Another blow for Blackberry.
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.960]   Ah, Dagnab, a whole QNX.
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:33.360]   Yes.
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:34.160]   Oh.
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:36.720]   Oh poor little QNX.
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:37.760]   There's no industry.
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:38.480]   Yeah.
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:40.400]   But it is a big question that there's...
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:47.360]   I like the idea of some automaker that has an electric car platform.
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:52.160]   Going back to the old model of you have the auto factory,
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:57.520]   the auto foundry that makes all the stuff that makes it a rolling motorized platform.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:59.120]   And then you hand it off to Cadillac.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:01.120]   You hand it off to a company that's a coach builder.
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:06.640]   That then makes it into either a luxury car or makes it into a truck or makes it into whatever.
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.080]   Andy, you nailed it.
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:10.000]   Because that's exactly what EVs are.
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:14.160]   They are really a skateboard, a platform that you put a lid on.
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.400]   That's your thing.
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:21.840]   And that's exactly why I think this could happen for Apple in a variety of ways.
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.600]   You nailed it.
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.680]   And the EV platform lends itself to that.
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:28.640]   Because it's the battery, it's the motors, it's everything.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.480]   They call it the skateboard.
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:35.120]   And it turns out the reason there was a lot of interest in Kia,
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:38.400]   is they have a... Kia Hyundai have a brand new skateboard.
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:41.600]   They already have 37 vehicles planned to build on top of it.
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.840]   It's a... They've got factory in Georgia.
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:47.840]   They have a platform, a GPM platform.
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.920]   And I wouldn't be surprised if one Apple wants is the platform.
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:52.000]   They don't want to figure that part out because it's not going to them.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:52.640]   It's not their business.
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:53.280]   It's not user-facing.
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:53.760]   They don't care.
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:54.560]   It's not their user-facing.
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:55.040]   Yeah.
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.240]   I mean, they might be able to do...
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:09:00.080]   They don't want the safe... They don't want the sort of safety.
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:00.480]   Safety.
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:04.640]   They don't want to create the network of garages for service.
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.120]   You nailed it.
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:05.840]   All that stuff.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:06.480]   Yeah.
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:11.280]   And frankly, as a buyer, one of the reasons I didn't buy another Tesla when I...
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:16.160]   The least ran out in the first one is I want a car maker.
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:23.600]   I love the idea that a software maker is developing all of this great stuff on top of it.
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.680]   And that's why an Apple car has an interest.
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:27.200]   But you nailed it, Andy.
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:28.880]   I want the four wheels to be good.
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:31.040]   I want a brakes to work.
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:36.800]   Finish. And finish is also important. Tesla has stumbled in those areas.
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:40.400]   I wonder, and I think that right now it's going to be really interesting to see
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:44.960]   what happens in the car market in general over the next decade.
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:48.960]   I think that COVID is going to make a massive change in people's behavior.
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:52.160]   And I think that it's going to be really interesting because I think a lot of people aren't going to be
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.280]   commuting the way that they were.
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:56.640]   A lot of companies are moving away from that.
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:00.880]   And so you don't have the same sensitivities towards a lot of those things
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:05.360]   or the same needs than what we've had for the last 50 years.
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:09.120]   You probably are going to design stuff for a fleet buyer as opposed to an individual buyer.
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:14.720]   Again, my interest was really a Tesla.
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.880]   Like I want a sports car that does whatever.
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.720]   And now I just want a box that just gets...
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:21.200]   It takes me from one place to the other.
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:24.240]   And I don't expect to go one place to the other very often.
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:25.600]   And I think that there's a lot of...
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:32.160]   As we see this huge migration out of cities and out of certain states and so on and so forth,
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.440]   a lot of people...
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:36.560]   They're not expecting to have to do a lot of travel.
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:40.800]   I mean, like that hour and a half that we were losing each way to wherever we were going for work,
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:43.840]   I think is largely not going to go away.
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.640]   I think personal ownership of the vehicle is going away as well.
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:49.280]   It's just not an efficient use of these sources.
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:52.400]   I think the only thing is it depends on how long something like COVID lasts.
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:55.360]   If it lasts for years, the way that some people say it is,
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.040]   then you're not going to want to share...
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.480]   I think it's really bad for Uber.
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:01.280]   You're not going to really want to share your car with anybody if we have to...
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:01.680]   Well, that's true.
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:03.040]   If COVID's a constant problem.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.560]   So that's a good point.
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:09.040]   One hopes that will not be a constant problem, I understand.
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:09.680]   Yes, absolutely.
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:10.720]   That's a possibility.
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:11.280]   That's a possibility.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:14.480]   So Hyundai is announcing it's the first vehicle based on...
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:22.320]   I misnamed the acronym, the Electric Global Modular Platform or EGMP platform,
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:25.920]   February 23rd in the IONIQ will be the first.
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:28.800]   And listen to this headline in the Hyundai Press release.
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:34.720]   Hyundai reveals IONIQ 5's living space and sustainable interior.
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:39.280]   This is kind of towards your box theory, right?
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:40.400]   It's just a transfer...
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:43.040]   It's something you get in, a living room you get in and you go somewhere.
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:46.480]   I think that's going to be most of them.
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:47.920]   Like I really feel like...
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:50.640]   And we saw this a couple of years ago and I think that
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.480]   when I first saw it, I thought I was absurd.
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:57.200]   But the more I look at what I wish I had when on a long trip is...
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:01.360]   I just wish I could just hang out and watch TV or take a nap or
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:04.720]   be on my phone or exercise or whatever.
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:07.280]   I don't really want to drive or even know where I am.
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:09.040]   Like, "Well, I'm driving.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:10.160]   I don't even need the windows."
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:10.720]   Yeah.
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:14.160]   Like, I'm just like, "You can give me an LCD and give me..."
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:16.640]   If I say, "Show me what's outside, it shows me what's outside."
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:19.920]   I think the Ford Google model is actually a template for what's going to happen,
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:23.600]   which is Ford will make the car stuff.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:28.080]   Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford said,
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:30.560]   "One of the most important parts of our strategy is to partner.
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:34.000]   That means we have to get out of the business of doing generic things
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.520]   that we do not add value to, like navigation systems,
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:39.440]   a lot of the in-car entertainment experience."
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:44.240]   He says, "We were spending hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions every year
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:48.240]   keeping up with a basically generic experience that wasn't competitive to your cell phone."
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:50.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:51.440]   That's a really good point.
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:54.160]   So the best part of the LCD...
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.520]   The best part of the Honda...
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:58.800]   We have a Honda and the best part of the LCD is it's the easiest place to put a suction cup,
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:00.160]   so I can put my iPad in.
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:02.640]   [laughter]
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:06.640]   I am getting a new Ford this week and it's going to have a big screen.
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:08.880]   But suction cup is good as your iPad.
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:09.840]   It won't be as good as my iPad.
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:15.840]   And suction cup to it is a knob that actually just has capacitive touch underneath it
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:19.040]   so that when you spin it, it actually feels like you're turning a knob.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:22.160]   But really, it's just a finger going around around the screen,
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:28.880]   which is a very Ford, a very car maker-like solution to a software issue,
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:30.320]   right, or a user interface issue.
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:33.200]   I think there is an opportunity.
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:41.920]   Apple just got three project Titan patents today relating to a 3D AR windshield display
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:46.160]   that fits right into Apple's expertise.
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:49.120]   A next-generation airbag system, which does not.
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:55.440]   I guess Apple's got to design that airbag-based occupant safety system.
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:02.160]   It's difficult when you think about someone who is not necessarily going to be sitting
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:07.120]   on a seat facing forward with next to an A-pillar or a B-pillar.
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.400]   Oh, that's a good point.
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:12.800]   How do you... So what if you have someone that's facing the rear, how do you create a
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:13.440]   restraint system?
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:13.920]   Yeah.
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.040]   So that's a lot of it.
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:16.800]   Or two people facing each other, right?
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:19.280]   A lot of it is like an airbag.
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:24.880]   Some of it is actually like deceleration systems where imagine a seatbelt only,
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.560]   the strap is very, very long.
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:31.360]   And instead of holding you in, it just simply decelerates you as you move forward so that
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:33.360]   you still wind up on the floor.
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:37.760]   But by the time you're on the floor, you're moving at one foot every half
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:38.800]   of every second.
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:41.440]   It's a non-trivial problem.
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:44.480]   And a lot... It illustrates how little people...
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:48.880]   How few assumptions that any of these designers can make about,
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:52.160]   what is a self-driving vehicle going to be used for?
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:56.240]   Is it going to be something that you jump in at an airport that you don't own?
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:59.680]   Is it going to be something that just automatically you get out of...
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:04.000]   You own the car, you get out of the car, your car automatically goes to an off-site
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.920]   parking facility, then comes back when you need it.
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.400]   Or it's going to be...
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.440]   Or it's going to be...
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.120]   Or it's going to be getting out of your car.
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:11.920]   It just drives around.
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:12.960]   Just keeps driving around.
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:15.120]   And picks up passengers.
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:20.880]   Or as Alex said, is it going to be sort of like the 1932 ideal of you just get into
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:24.000]   this little living room with a bed and a desk.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.640]   And then when a little...
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:29.840]   When a Disney cartoon character pops up on the windscreen saying,
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:33.040]   "Hi, you might want to wake up soon because we're almost...
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:35.200]   Oh, goofy.
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:36.080]   That would be great.
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.680]   Hi, I'm 100% behind that.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:40.960]   We're about to be hit by a semi-troll, no!
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:43.680]   The patent actually...
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:45.840]   That's voice you'll hear on this or it's full.
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:52.720]   The patent actually does include an inflator, an airbag, and a shoot switch
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:58.720]   packaging the airbag's issue within a roof rail along a belt liner in any location
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:01.600]   inclusive of a vehicle crush zone where an inflator maces.
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:06.000]   So the idea is you put the bag anywhere and here are two people facing each other.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.640]   And an airbag pops up in between them.
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:11.120]   So I think that's interesting.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:16.000]   The third patent is for something called integrated chassis control.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.880]   And it's about electronic stability control.
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:20.320]   So clearly Apple...
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:25.920]   I mean, we've always talked about how patents don't necessarily reflect the real work that's
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:26.560]   going on.
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:30.160]   But clearly Apple in Project Titan is looking at the whole vehicle.
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:32.480]   Not just a software.
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:37.040]   You're right, it definitely means that they're at least spending money developing this technology
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:40.160]   whether or not this is something that they have a target date for.
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:45.040]   I'm still baffled, but okay, it's a patent.
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:46.800]   Renee, who do you think...
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:51.280]   Or is it premature to even think about who their partner might be?
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:52.960]   Is Kia now out of it?
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:53.760]   Everybody's...
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:56.240]   Kia says we're not in the mix.
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:59.600]   But couldn't that just be them listening to Tim Cook saying,
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:02.480]   "If you mention our name one more time, I owe it a..."
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:05.120]   Yeah, it's that...
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.440]   I have a friend, Devin, who does a legal legal channel.
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:09.280]   He did this video where he just looked at...
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:10.240]   "Stop talking!
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:11.360]   Just stop talking!
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.360]   Don't admit to anything!
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:14.240]   Stop talking!
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:14.720]   Stop talking!"
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.000]   That's true with Apple partners.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:21.760]   I remember, I think, FoxCon said one thing once publicly and they never said anything
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:23.200]   about Apple again.
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:27.600]   So I'm guessing they're still in the running and they're emphatic about how not in the running.
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:29.440]   Definitely, because they really, really want to play in the game.
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:30.560]   We definitely didn't talk to Apple.
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:31.600]   Definitely, definitely didn't.
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:35.120]   Cops on the press have one thing in common,
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.840]   especially if you're a tech industry executive.
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:39.760]   You don't say anything without a lawyer present.
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:40.080]   Yeah.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.280]   You have no comment.
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.880]   You're not answering any questions until you have a legal advice at your hands.
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:46.480]   It's really...
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:50.560]   There's so many stories around this.
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:51.760]   I have to think that something...
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:53.440]   There's a lot of smoke.
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:56.160]   There must be a fire somewhere there.
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:00.160]   Or in the words of another joke, there's a pony in there somewhere.
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:03.360]   Nissan says, "We are not in talks with Apple."
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:04.080]   We're not!
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:05.840]   We are not in talks with Apple.
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:06.400]   Say it again.
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:12.240]   This is a Reuters story from Sunday, which means probably they are in talks, right?
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:12.880]   Yeah.
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:16.320]   Was there an emoji after that statement?
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:17.760]   Was it like a wink emoji?
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:24.880]   The Financial Times had reported that there were brief discussions with Apple and Nissan,
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:30.640]   which faltered according to FT over Nissan's reluctance to become an assembler for Apple-branded
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:35.520]   cars added that the talks had not advanced to the senior management level.
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:39.440]   And then Nissan said, "No, we are not talking to Apple."
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:42.240]   This isn't an analyst call.
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:44.320]   They're not legally required to tell the truth.
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:44.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:45.760]   It's possible.
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:46.160]   It's...
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:51.600]   They're better things to say than a qualitative answer, but they could just simply say,
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.680]   "Hey, internally they might be thinking,
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:55.120]   'Hey, we might get this contract.
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:56.320]   We might not get this contract.
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:57.680]   Let's just...
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:59.280]   Let's just do an awful for now.'"
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:18:59.600]   Yeah.
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:06.560]   Volkswagen's CEO says, "We are not afraid of an Apple car.
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:09.920]   There's nothing to fear here."
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:12.320]   That sounds a lot like...
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:15.680]   I remember a lot of cell phone companies saying that.
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:18.160]   Yeah, we are not afraid of an Apple phone.
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:18.960]   Yeah.
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:19.360]   Yeah.
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:19.680]   Yeah.
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:21.840]   Like, this is a whole market they don't understand.
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.440]   They're computer people and we're phone people,
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:24.240]   and they're not going to understand that.
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:24.960]   Yeah, you still never understand that.
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:26.240]   That turned out really well.
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:29.920]   Herbert D. said, "The car industry is not a typical tech sector.
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:32.080]   You could take over at a single stroke.
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:33.920]   Apple would not manage that overnight."
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:40.080]   He said, "Apple's plans, while not public, are logical,
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:42.000]   because the company has expertise in batteries,
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.800]   software and design, and that it had deep pockets to build in these competencies.
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:48.960]   Still, we are not afraid," he said.
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:51.040]   Alex is right.
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.120]   This is a lot like spokesperson Mad Libs.
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:57.520]   We just changed the adverbs, changed from the nouns on the iPhone.
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:03.040]   But at the same time, we already have automakers that have proven
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:06.960]   that the electric cars are now...
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:10.880]   The technology is sophisticated enough that if you want to make an $80,000 electric car,
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:11.600]   boom, done.
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:12.480]   We can do that.
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:13.040]   No problem.
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:13.840]   What color do you want?
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:15.360]   What other do you want in the seats?
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:16.240]   We can do that.
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:20.880]   The next challenge is to get the people who are coming in with
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:25.040]   the typical budget for a car, $25,000 to $35,000,
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:28.640]   and make sure that they have an electric car that's available to them.
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:32.960]   That might not be within Apple's core competencies.
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:36.000]   Given that we're looking at laws like in Massachusetts,
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.600]   I think in 2035, they are regulating that by 2035,
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:47.600]   we will not allow the purchase of the sale of gas burning passenger cars
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:48.800]   in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:53.040]   So that sounds like it's a far away away, but considering that
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:58.160]   how many different kinds of buyers you have to satisfy, again,
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:59.120]   you have to have the...
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:04.000]   Someone who comes in with all I can afford is a $17,000, $500.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.880]   If you got one with an AM radio and no air conditioning,
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:09.600]   that's how much I got to spend on this brand new car.
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:14.400]   Now, think about how difficult it's going to be going from right now
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:18.320]   to create a car that can be sold at that amount of money.
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:21.680]   It's not a company that Apple that I think is going to be able to do that.
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:26.640]   It's a company like Ford and GM and Volkswagen.
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:28.240]   The companies that are used to making car,
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:32.240]   punching out cars by the hundreds of thousands at all different price levels,
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:34.720]   not the company that is used to saying, "Oh, well,
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:37.040]   let's talk about the churn for angles on these wheels,
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:38.960]   on this new $30,000 workstation."
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:44.560]   So there is some meat on that argument that Apple is...
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:48.720]   Right now, I'm thinking that if Apple does actually produce a car,
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:50.480]   they're going to have great success.
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:54.240]   It's going to be a beautiful car, but it's going to be more like a lotus,
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:58.240]   more like one of these cars that is extremely well-written about,
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:00.240]   extremely well-loved, innovative,
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:04.160]   but they sell 4,000 to 5,000 of them and they're priced accordingly
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:06.800]   as opposed to the Toyota Corolla,
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.880]   which is what the industry really needs right now,
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:12.640]   just for electric cars, let alone autonomous vehicles.
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:17.600]   iOS 14.5.
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.480]   Are you running it yet, Renee?
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:21.120]   You probably are.
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:21.680]   I am.
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:21.920]   Yeah.
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:22.880]   Well...
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:23.920]   And it's a big one, Leo,
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:25.760]   because again, they're talking about new emoji,
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:27.840]   which as we all know is the biggest driver in the upgrade.
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:28.880]   When are they going to make it?
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:32.480]   You can upgrade to emoji without upgrading the entire operating system.
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:32.800]   Why?
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:33.280]   What's the point?
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:34.560]   They want you to upgrade everything.
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:36.000]   The emoji are the driver, Leo.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:36.880]   That's the carrot.
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.640]   Why would they take off the carrot off the stick?
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:41.760]   Are the emojis really that big?
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:42.080]   Yes!
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:43.280]   Yes!
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:43.680]   Yes!
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:44.880]   They're the single biggest driver for...
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:45.120]   Okay.
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:46.480]   Yes!
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:48.160]   Because that's what most people care about, Alex.
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:51.200]   If you send the empty little box and you know someone sent you an emoji
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.160]   that you don't have,
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:54.000]   it destroys your communication parity.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.920]   For a regular person,
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:59.120]   I think they would lose every feature on their phone before they're emoji.
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:02.160]   Although I did see an article probably just link bait saying,
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:03.120]   "Emojis are over.
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:03.600]   It's over."
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:05.040]   No.
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:06.000]   I can't see it.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:06.480]   Clearly they don't.
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:07.440]   They're clear they're not online.
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:09.520]   It's all about A.S.
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:10.480]   Stick is from now on.
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:10.880]   A.S.
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:11.880]   A.S.
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:12.640]   Stick is back my words.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:17.120]   So the second beta of iOS 14 has been seated,
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:18.560]   which means we're probably getting close.
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:22.480]   What will give us the highlights of new features besides emojis?
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:23.680]   I'm guessing it'll be a March event.
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:26.240]   Like if we're at beta 2 now and Apple has a March event,
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:28.720]   I'm guessing that the final version would come out in March,
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:32.160]   along with the air tags and the other things that would benefit from it being it.
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:34.400]   The processor's saying air tags are coming out in March.
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:37.360]   Not that the processor's always right.
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:39.200]   No, but it makes...
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:41.520]   It makes it really, really, really ready for it here.
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:44.640]   I spent half an hour looking for my keys yesterday,
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:48.080]   just going, "If I had air tags, this all would happen really quickly."
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:50.160]   Oh, maybe they don't have air tags on the air tags,
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:52.800]   and they've spent a year trying to find where they left them in Cupertino.
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:55.760]   What I would have lost them is to say,
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:59.200]   "What would be great is if they said, 'Oh, by the way,
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:02.720]   we put the air tag technology in all the last Apple TVs,
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:04.480]   so you could find the remote."
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:05.360]   They're in the remote.
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:06.640]   You weren't supposed to have it.
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:08.960]   Yeah, it's too early, but then you weren't supposed to have it.
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:12.640]   It doesn't have to have the UWB, the W1 in it to do it.
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:13.600]   Ultra-wide.
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:16.560]   No, but it has to have the capacity to alert you to its presence in some way,
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:18.560]   and that means it either has to be able to emit sound,
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:21.200]   or it has to show up on the AR system that they're going to be using
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:22.560]   to highlight where it is in the room.
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:24.960]   I don't think the controller has any...
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:26.000]   Maybe the Bluetooth could do it,
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.600]   but I don't think it has any constantly emitting Bluetooth beacon capabilities.
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:33.520]   This is a big update.
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:38.080]   This is almost a whole point update.
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:39.680]   This is what we've wanted, though, Leo.
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:42.800]   We've wanted them to stop doing these monolithic releases at launch
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:46.960]   that were buggy and speed and would drag on, but just like stage them out.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:48.720]   Why? Stage them out over the year?
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:51.520]   It's not that we're going to throw the phone out in October.
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:53.840]   200 new emoji, including...
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:54.880]   Look at that.
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:25:00.480]   An AirPod Max headphone design instead of whatever that generic thing was.
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:02.560]   Looks like an AKG.
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:05.040]   AKG was super puffy.
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:05.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.600]   Yeah, maybe that's what it is.
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:10.400]   That kind of has a bozy feel, though.
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:11.440]   Couldn't it be the boze?
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:15.760]   Anyway, the new ones are very obviously the AirPod Max.
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:19.040]   Some swipe gestures in music.
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:20.000]   And actually, this is something...
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.320]   This is stuff in beta 2 that wasn't in earlier beta as I gather.
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:25.520]   I'm not playing with it.
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:31.200]   Screen animation on the Apple Watch related to unlocking your iPhone
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:32.640]   has been slightly redesigned.
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:33.760]   Well, that's exciting.
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:39.440]   Any other changes, Renee, that are important that we should highlight?
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:44.560]   Not that immediately comes to mind.
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:46.080]   Oh, the proxy is interesting.
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:46.800]   Yeah, they're going to...
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:47.200]   So now...
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:48.240]   Oh, that's the effort.
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:49.040]   In Safari.
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:49.920]   Yeah, in Safari...
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:52.400]   And this is true of most browsers.
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:56.320]   There's a safe search feature where it keeps you off of malware...
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:57.840]   Or safe browsing feature, I should say,
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:59.840]   where it keeps you off of malware sites.
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:00.480]   That...
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:02.000]   On Safari goes through Google.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.840]   Google keeps track of all of that.
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:09.200]   Now Apple's going to proxy that so that it still uses the Google results,
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:13.840]   but it hides your IP address from Google on the Apple season.
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:16.640]   I expanded proxy into that.
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:17.120]   Is that right?
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:17.920]   Is that what you were talking about?
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:18.320]   Exactly.
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:18.640]   Yeah.
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:23.440]   I think it was first discovered by users on Reddit who was looking at the traffic
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:27.200]   off of the beta and seeing that's now going through a server...
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:27.920]   Proxy.
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:30.080]   Safe browsing.apple URL.
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:30.480]   Thank you.
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:30.720]   Yes.
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:34.480]   And that's an interesting move.
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:37.280]   It's exactly, I think, what we want from Apple.
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:41.280]   One of the things I've been a little bit unsatisfied with is that
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:47.280]   up until maybe a year ago, Apple's been very, very satisfied with talking about privacy
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:52.080]   and user security as a talking point, as a club to hit Google and Facebook and other
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:53.520]   companies over the head with.
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:27:00.080]   But the answer I want to come back with is that's great because you make a really great web browser
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:03.920]   and you could integrate all these kind of tools that, I mean, Google and Facebook,
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:08.240]   yeah, they're bad, but what's really great is how are these data mining companies
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:13.920]   that have infinite tags that follow you wherever you go and they'll sell that personal information
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:14.640]   to everyone.
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:18.800]   Why don't you build that into the browser and answer there comes none.
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:26.160]   This is part of Apple baking into their own distro tools that I think that everybody is
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:29.680]   going to benefit from, particularly in this kind of case, where if they think that,
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:34.080]   hey, if I'm using safe browsing, that's almost, they equate that with,
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:36.320]   hey, I'm running through VPN, I'm using the tour browser.
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:41.120]   No, no, no, no, Google can still, they don't know where you're going, but they know who you are
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:45.840]   when you open, when you access this URL, whatever URL you're opening.
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:51.600]   On the other, the only other thought that I have about that though is that if Apple takes this to
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:58.000]   an extreme, really the most user positive thing they can do is make sure that it's absolutely
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:04.560]   impossible for anybody to track you over the internet for any purpose whatsoever to really,
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:06.800]   really protect you aggressively.
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:13.280]   And they're going to have to find a line that they have to absolutely carefully fall short of because
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:18.320]   if they keep going forward and forward and forward, this is just the first step and again,
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:19.520]   a very good first step.
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:27.760]   But imagine if they kind of got drunk on this, they could actually demonetize every single service
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:32.640]   on the net because a lot of people are kind of okay with tracking if it means that,
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:37.840]   hey, I can use this really great collaborative office suite for absolutely free and it works
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.680]   great and it's the standard for everybody.
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:43.200]   All I have to do is give up some personal information and you have to make sure that all
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:46.880]   those tools still work with all the tools that people rely on and people that are okay with
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:48.960]   working with those still have to work.
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:55.200]   But I'm glad to see Apple putting a lot more throwing some shoulders into their defense of
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:57.760]   the users by baking the stuff into their own distros now.
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:02.640]   Of course, if you're, I mean, to be cynical for a second, I mean, if you were a company
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:06.480]   that's where a lot of your revenue is based on subscription, why would you support the ad model
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:06.720]   at all?
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:11.680]   I mean, like, why would you do anything that didn't just cut the knees off from the ad model?
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:12.560]   You know what I want to hear?
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:16.560]   So I think that's a false, like one of the things that I think Facebook especially has been
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:21.120]   propped in promoting and I think it's been unfortunately widely adopted is that you have to choose
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:26.880]   between the two, like even in terms of data harvesting, you don't have to link data harvesting
[01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:28.720]   to data exploitation.
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:29.840]   That is a conscious decision.
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:34.640]   You can do lots of stuff with data harvesting and you can do lots of stuff in advertising.
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:41.040]   And I know it's their fervent belief that if you affect their ability to target users,
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:42.400]   it is an existential threat.
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:48.240]   But even targeting users doesn't have to be based upon the wholesale, complete utter shadow
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:50.160]   and real profiling of them.
[01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:51.440]   There is a wealth of data.
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:56.160]   There's a superficial layer of data that provides you 80 to 90% of the benefits without having to
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:58.240]   take my entire life apart to get it.
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:01.600]   And I think that if that's understood, the less tolerance we'll have for the way they're
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:04.480]   currently doing it and forced to evolve into a better way.
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:11.600]   Yeah, I mean, the thing is that right now with the tracking is kind of like, you know,
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:15.280]   chocolate with, you know, infused with crack.
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:20.240]   You know, and it's like, and they're like, this is selling really well.
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:22.080]   And we're not sure of how many people will just have the chocolate.
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:23.440]   But they just need the chocolate.
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:25.360]   They're really thinking they just need the chocolate.
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:30.000]   But that's what we're telling them, but they're like, but this sells really well.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:35.600]   Google's not as bad as like the issue is, is that, I mean, if you're, when you see the data,
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:40.400]   the multipliers to the money going in, money going out of, you know, advertising, if you know
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:44.720]   what you're doing is just in, it's, it's amazing.
[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:48.800]   Like it's just, you know, and so that's the hard part is that you won't get those numbers again
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:49.760]   without that tracking.
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:56.560]   You will get good numbers, but it'll be like, you get $1.5 out for every dollar you put in
[01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:59.520]   instead of six, you know, like that's the, that's the problem.
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:00.960]   Yeah, Facebook hates it.
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:01.840]   Google hates it.
[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:04.720]   But it's great for people like me because we can't track people.
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:08.080]   So it gives at least gives us a little better priority, you know,
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:12.160]   a lot of their track, like again, like a lot of the stuff, like what it would be,
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:15.360]   Talix's point, the chocolate is enough and Google's gotten way better about
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:17.680]   giving, providing value in exchange for data.
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:21.360]   Like Facebook still seems like they just want all your data and are willing to give you minimal
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:22.160]   benefit.
[01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:23.440]   But well, they give you this point.
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:25.280]   I mean, like, let's be clear.
[01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:26.880]   I mean, people spend a lot of time.
[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:30.160]   I don't know whether it's good value or not, but then you spend a lot of time on Facebook.
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:31.680]   You get something, you know that.
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:32.400]   You bet a lot.
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:33.840]   Well, I mean, you get a lot of connection.
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:38.640]   There's information, but so the main point I'm trying to make is that some people actually like it.
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:40.000]   Renee, I'm with you.
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000]   But some people do.
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000]   Lisa and I had that conversation in this morning.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.040]   There's no direct relationship.
[01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:48.240]   Like with Google, you can see direct relationship with you feeding them photos and them giving
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:49.200]   you better photo tools.
[01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:50.160]   Oh, I disagree.
[01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:51.600]   You get siredy to the relationship.
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:52.800]   People love Facebook.
[01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:54.880]   I'm not arguing that you don't get the value from it.
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:32:00.720]   I'm arguing that like the exchange isn't as obvious, isn't as one to one as what Google is doing now.
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:03.680]   But the greater point is a lot of the stuff is they don't want to show,
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:07.600]   like if Leo, if you get shown an algorithmic ad and you don't click on it,
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:10.480]   and you get shown it again and you don't click on it, after seven times,
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:12.240]   they figure you're never going to click on it.
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:15.120]   And they don't want to spend the money to show you that ad again.
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:20.160]   And the only way they know that you're Leo is by identifying you and tracking you to every website.
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:25.040]   But there's all sorts of advertising that's more brand focused or just not focused in general
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:30.560]   or based upon identifiers that don't require them to be side by side with you to achieve very
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:35.760]   similar goals, which is why I argue that it's a lazy, it's currently a lazy wasteful implementation
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:41.920]   and things like this can force them to do better, cleaner, less egregious implementation of the
[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:45.040]   exact statement. But I should point out that there, and I don't think it's widely understood
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:49.920]   that there are really different kinds of advertisers. Coca-Cola is not measuring the sale of Coke
[01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:56.160]   by its brand advertising. By its response to a Super Bowl ads.
[01:32:56.160 --> 01:33:00.080]   But there are quite a few advertisers, including all of our advertisers,
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:05.200]   who very much want to couple the ad spend with the revenue generated.
[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:09.040]   So they know if it's worthwhile. And I think any small businesses is that way.
[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:13.200]   I'm not going to buy ads for my flower store unless I know I'm selling flowers.
[01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:18.400]   So they want I completely understand why they want to know. It's just that working.
[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:23.600]   They don't need to know it's you. They need to know it's somebody in that campaign.
[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:27.680]   They don't need to know it's Leo. Well, that's why we use that's why we use, you know,
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:32.880]   Mac, you know, Twitter, whatever it is, you know, yeah, sandis.com/macbreak because
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:36.560]   the hope is people will use that and that'll give them some input on that.
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:39.600]   But it's not a very good system. I don't have to give them a photograph of my driver's license.
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:43.360]   Right. Facebook's a lot better at that. Google's a lot better at that.
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:47.360]   That's a strong competitor for us. And frankly, in the podcast world,
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:50.960]   Spotify is going to be a lot better at that because they know who you are when you're listening
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:54.000]   to Spotify. They're so good that we think they're listening in on our microphone.
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.040]   That is how good they've gotten at it. And that is the startling amount of ability.
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:01.840]   That's a good point. That's a really good point. I'm glad you brought that up. That is the classic
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:08.000]   example of like twice now that's come up like on my NPR show where if you, oh, why? Because
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:13.040]   they must be listening through my phone because I had it. I was just talking about this.
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:14.720]   All the time. Yeah.
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:20.000]   Two days ago and after, oh, don't worry about it. They're not listening through your microphone.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.640]   They just know so they're just following you and your friend. So detailed that they think
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:29.600]   it's probably likely that you talked about this two days ago and can flash you that ad.
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:36.160]   Or I totally agree with Renee though that there one of the great things that Apple does is
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:46.960]   if a company is going to exert its muscles without any opposition, they're going to keep flexing
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:53.760]   nonstop. They don't know what a border is and limitation is until they actually encounter it.
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:59.040]   Apple can in addition to federal legislation, which I think is a very good thing to happen.
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:04.080]   Worldwide in the United States, Apple has the ability to say, well, look, we are going to make
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:08.800]   it very, very difficult for you to do a Wild West sort of implementation of user tracking.
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:14.080]   We are going to, we have a very, very simple fence. There is still like a gate in that fence.
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:18.480]   So you can still like cross that fence whenever you want, but we are going to make sure you can't
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:25.600]   just simply trample the flower beds and use the person's pool. You can just go through this one
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:30.160]   fence that I think is very, very good. Breaking my Google. Yep. We're moving on. Breaking news.
[01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:36.880]   You may remember Epic Games. Speaking of Spotify, Spotify, Tyle and others formed
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:42.640]   the Coalition for App Fairness. They wrote a bill which they sent to the North Dakota
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:51.280]   State Senate that would force Apple to allow iPhone owners to side load apps and to use alternative
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:57.840]   in-app payment options. In other words, not to use the app store just now, according to this tweet,
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:06.160]   the North Dakota Senate voted the bill down. So that was averted disaster for Apple was averted,
[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:11.760]   but Arizona and Georgia are considering similar bills. And I imagine Epic is not going to rest
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:16.480]   until they get some state to say, no, you can't have an app store, Apple.
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:21.120]   Yeah. And then I'll go to Supreme Court and then I'll be dead.
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:27.360]   It's not constitutional. It's not going to go anywhere. And the problem is that Epic is
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:32.320]   fighting this stupid battle because they are clearly the technology leaders in real-time 3D.
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:40.240]   And I would be surprised if in March or June or whenever Apple does another keynote, if Apple
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:45.200]   doesn't take the spot that they were giving to Unreal, the millions of dollars of hundreds of
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:49.360]   millions of dollars of PR that they were giving them and say, hey, let's see what Unity's doing.
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:57.040]   Let's see how this literally will see, but I would be surprised. Apple's never going to show
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:03.920]   Epic again on a keynote ever. And so the thing is is that and the only other option is Unity.
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:09.440]   And so the thing is is for all of us, we're people who are developing for the app platform,
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:15.040]   all of us just kind of step back. I'm going to pause for a second. And Epic is
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:19.840]   doing incredible things. And it's the best thing that Epic's lawsuit is the best thing that happened
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:24.800]   to Unity in the history of its company. And so it's just because people are using Unity.
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:29.920]   Well, Apple's-- I think it's not-- I will be surprised. We'll see what happens. I will be
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:34.480]   surprised if Apple ever talks about Unreal again. And if it doesn't start pushing Unity down the
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:39.120]   pipe, you know? It's not so much that they're fighting stupidly, but that it's sort of stupid
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:43.360]   to fight, but they're fighting stupidly and they're doing it in a way that makes it look like they
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:49.600]   have-- they care about nothing but being epic. Like they like to-- it's almost like Facebook's
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:53.920]   small businesses thing where they have clear motivations in order to be-- like they want to
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:58.160]   become an App Store and they want to be able to collect rent from a variety of apps, which is what
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:04.160]   they're doing on the PC using tactics like exclusives, which some people find objectionable.
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:08.880]   My whole thing with this is like my personal preference would be for the iPhone to simply get
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:13.840]   Gatekeeper the way the Mac has. And that way, like for my mom, my sister, anybody who doesn't care,
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:18.800]   they would have the exact same safe trusted App Store experience, you know, scam apps aside.
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:22.720]   And we can-- I'm sure we'll get to those eventually that they've always had. Like it doesn't take an
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:28.560]   option away from them, but that the rest of us can, if we really want to, just go in, turn on
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:34.400]   different Gatekeeper modes and then sideload things like we do on the app today, on the Mac today.
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:39.680]   The thing I worry about is that for a lot of mainstream users, traditional computers have
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:46.480]   been alienating and intimidating and have caused them a lot of pain. And Steve Jobs' express purpose
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:49.760]   in creating the iPhone and the iPad was to make something more mainstream friendly,
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:55.520]   something that was a controlled console environment. And we have the Mac, we have Android, we have PCs,
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:39:02.320]   but increasingly even in terms of the complexity of the iPad and iPad OS, it feels like us 10, 20%
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:07.440]   of traditional computer users are like, no, those are pretty, we want those too. And we don't care
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:14.160]   that in many ways it's making them worse for mainstream customers. They're pretty and everything
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:19.280]   should be for nerds. And I really hope we don't lose the vast majority of far less focal mainstream
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:25.920]   customers just from our desire to notify everything. The thing that's-- I want to sideload. I want to
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:29.920]   sideload, I'll use an Android. I have Android phones that I sideload. Yeah. Like, you know, like,
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:32.800]   it's kind of like I can have whatever I want to geek out on. I just don't do it on that.
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:39.200]   If you want to get further upset, the North Dakota Senator who proposed the bill said he'd been given
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:46.720]   the draft legislation by a lobbyist for oddity public affairs in Bismarck, North Dakota,
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:54.240]   who said she had been hired by Epic Games and was also being paid by the Coalition for App Fairness.
[01:39:54.240 --> 01:40:03.520]   That's the Epic Spotify Coalition. And basically, Epic wrote the bill and fed it to a senator who
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:07.280]   then proposed it. But not uncommon. Let's be clear. That's really, really common. It's really
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:11.600]   really common. It's really, really common. Not vast. So we don't want to-- I mean, I'll slouch
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:15.280]   for a lot of things, but not that because that's kind of common practice. Yeah. Lobbyists write them.
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:20.080]   There's now a Microsoft Office app for your iPad. It's always been available as an iPhone,
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:23.840]   not always, but it's been available for some time as an iPhone app. But now it's on the iPad.
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:28.160]   That's going to make the iPad, especially with the Magic Keyboard, a very interesting choice
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:31.440]   for people who want to use Microsoft Office instead of keynote.
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:38.080]   Crazy. Every time we talk about Office, I just got to say, why would you say--
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:42.080]   If you're doing huge numbers, if you're doing massive college calculations in Office--
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:45.760]   You need Excel for that. But I got to tell you that 99% of people don't do that.
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:50.880]   And keynote is so much better at everything else. What does Alex Lindsay use? What's his secret
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:56.640]   weapon keynote and numbers? keynote numbers. Yeah. But you can't ignore the fact that Office is
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:01.840]   the grease for the gears of industry and business. So this is what you graduate from--
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:07.120]   The basic education of computer literacy for kids is not to learn A spreadsheet or to learn
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:11.680]   A presentation app. You have to learn how to use Excel. You have to learn how to use
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:20.720]   PowerPoint and the Google Office apps. So this is a very big deal. It basically allows
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:26.880]   IT departments to support a much broader spectrum of users. It gives IT users near parity.
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:29.360]   You know why I like it because it pisses Windows users off.
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:37.200]   Why did you release that for iPad first? Apple is off. Especially when we have Arm
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:44.240]   Windows tablets that are every bit as good. Apple is offering free repairs for Apple Watch
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:49.120]   Series 5 and SE devices stuck in power reserve mode. They did a software update if that didn't
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:57.280]   fix it for you. Free repairs. According to Neil Seibart, Apple now has--
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:05.200]   Apple Watch is now worn by 100 million wrists. A billion iPhones you all in a billion pockets
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:10.800]   and 100 million wrists for the Apple Watch. You think that's low? Right? No, but I think he's
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:17.520]   a conservative analyst. He will jump on these tirades about IDC and other companies with their
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:23.440]   completely wrong inflated imaginary numbers. He has invested interest in being as accurate and
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:27.120]   conservative with these numbers as possible. He says at the current rate of sales, the Apple
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:32.720]   Watch installed base will exceed the Mac installed base next year.
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:36.640]   But again, there's a number as well I'm betting.
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:41.360]   When we hear about Apple's not going to move into cars, we heard this with phones, we heard
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:45.680]   this with the watch. People don't want it. People aren't going to do this. This is not going to work.
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:50.080]   I like the point that Apple Watch didn't know what it was going to be when they released it.
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:56.000]   It didn't sell me initially, but they have clearly found its voice through users.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:07.200]   The thing that makes it unique is that all Apple had to do was build a really, really cool
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:15.280]   stylish watch that tells time. They would have had a win. We have not seen the design of that
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:22.400]   watch change one Iota really since version zero because they designed a really, really,
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:26.640]   like the Movado watch, like the watch that's in the Museum of Modern Art.
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:31.440]   It's such a beautiful design that even if you're not really sold on,
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:36.320]   as I will never ever let them live this down, watching live video of your grown garage door
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:42.880]   opening as your watch is command. You keep bringing that up, Andy, because it's the biggest damn
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:52.240]   rake Apple has ever stepped on. It's the gold watch that the $12,000 gold watch
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:56.560]   and the demo, which, and look, now I can open my garage door and watch the garage door open.
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:44:02.160]   Actually, Andy, if they would do that, I would be very happy. I don't know why my my
[01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:06.080]   cue doesn't work on my watch. I want it to work on my watch because I always have to get my phone.
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:15.280]   Be your best. Wheels for the mind. And by the way, Facebook's going to be doing a smart watch next
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:20.880]   year. So stand back Apple. Oh, yeah. Boy, if anybody if there's anybody you trust having a
[01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:26.080]   having a prison tag on your wrist at all times, that's I want Facebook to be able to track me with
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:32.160]   a with a field with a field tag at all time. I wonder how well that Amazon watch, which I own,
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:37.600]   but I never wear I look at it my my dresser every morning going. No, that's right. Yeah,
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:43.280]   yeah, that I mean, same thing, right? Amazon and it didn't even have a watch face. It just was a
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:47.840]   Velcro band with a with a thing underneath it to tell you if you're yelling at people.
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:52.880]   It's I will say that we thought that the portal. We thought that the portal would be a
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:57.920]   portal's good. It's good. It's sold a lot of those. I wish I hadn't given it to Burke. He's
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:03.360]   taken him apart. I don't know what he's done with him. I bought two portals and
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:08.560]   Burke has them now. So I don't think it's nice that your gybo has someone to talk to. Yes, exactly.
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:15.840]   It's in the it's in the closet with a gybo. All right. I think gentlemen, prepare your picks
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:21.360]   our picks of the week are next. And I for the picks of the week this week, I liked I think I'm
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:27.760]   going to start. You know, I I have mixed feelings because Alex will cost me money.
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:34.560]   Andy will give me something I can really use and Renee Richie is probably going to cost me
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:38.560]   money too. So let me start with Renee Richie and then I can balance it out. I can figure out who I
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:43.680]   spent. Can you start? I just have to run backward. Go on backwards. Let's let Andy and I go
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:52.080]   next. Mine is mine is free and cool. See historical dictionary of science fiction.
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:59.040]   You can go it's free. It's at sf dictionary.com. It is. I actually found out about it before it
[01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:04.240]   was released because it's one of the heads of the project is an editor by the name of Jesse
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:10.160]   Schidelauer who used to be a contributing editor for the Oxford English Dictionary.
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:15.360]   Used to be editor for dictionaries at random house. That's where I first met him because I
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:21.440]   he he got he reached out to me like years ago to write a dictionary of internet slang in 1996
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:27.040]   1997 or something. Yeah. So it was real good to hear from again. And this is this science fiction
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:32.960]   dictionary is sort of an outcropping of a solution to a problem that the OED had which was that
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:38.080]   some years ago that they didn't have a really good content really good authoritative content
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:43.120]   for science fiction terms. And so they didn't necessarily crowdsource it but they basically
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:47.040]   did some outreach and saying if you if you if you are part of this community,
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:51.760]   write things down on slips of paper and send them to us so that we can include this stuff.
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:56.720]   And he had this idea a few years ago of Gee we should actually turn this into like a
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:04.800]   a ongoing resource. So it is now like a a online app online resource at sf dictionary.com
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:11.520]   where it's not a Wikipedia. It's not necessarily crowdsource but it is being updated and maintained
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:16.160]   by editors that they are recruiting through the same very site. And it's amazing because
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:23.680]   there's so I was actually talking about it. I talked to him on the on Skype for an hour about
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:27.520]   it last night and I had to say to him that look what you the science fiction community they can't
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:31.920]   agree on which captain is the best captain on Star Trek. How are you going to get them to agree?
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:36.880]   Like what's what science fiction is defined as which has always been like the hugest argument
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:40.960]   about oh no this isn't science fiction. No no this is science fiction that doesn't count it's
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:46.800]   a game this can't be science fiction. And it is designed not to be a conversation about this stuff
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:53.120]   or an argument about this stuff but to create the kind of authoritative attitude towards these
[01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:59.280]   definitions. So they it does have a definition for science fiction. It is a generic it is a very
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:04.000]   very short and very very informative one. But it also includes like a quote from someone saying
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:09.600]   look the discussion about this is just as just as intense and flame worthy as the definitive
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:14.400]   self. But also they can't just simply say this is what we understand it to be. There is also
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:20.160]   the etymology of it and they the first source they have for it goes back to 1898 to
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:25.040]   I don't have my I don't have the right window in front of me. It's kind of but it's going to be
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:36.480]   G Wells right. An article in 1898 on a farm on a pharmacy like publication that is that is
[01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:45.840]   hang on. I have it right here. Well there you go. Is this so 1898. Yeah. So if I click this it's
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:52.320]   going to say bulletin of pharmacy volume 12 number 10. Mr. H G Wells the imaginative writer of
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:57.920]   science fiction has recently brought out a thrilling romance. Right. So that's the first use of it.
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:03.920]   That's hysterical. And you can even see the page. Exactly. Yeah. Wow. Look at this. The bulletin
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:11.200]   of pharmacy. Here is the first appearance of the word science fiction. Yeah. There it is right there.
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:17.840]   And the other stuff I liked about it is that it's not it's not like I'm a fan of Babylon 5. So I
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:22.720]   have to have like every every single name of every single centaurie ship and every single
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:27.920]   warlon ship has to be no no no it's it really is designed to be a dictionary. But nonetheless it's
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:32.720]   it was so interesting to look through it because I was like again that was on my mind because of
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:38.160]   course Babylon 5 is on HBO and now I'm like rewatching it all again. So oh wow slug thrower.
[01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:42.320]   I didn't know that. Okay. That's a very very specific because on the on Babylon 5 a slug
[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:47.680]   thrower is how they refer to it's not an energy hand pistol but one that actually fires bullets.
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:53.680]   And then I click on it and say oh no actually slug thrower dates back to the 1960s. It's like
[01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:57.840]   classic science fiction. Oh wow. It is not it's not one person's opinion. It is here is the
[01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:04.160]   etymology of it. Here's the source for it. So and these so it's it's not just a static publication
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:10.160]   is going to continue to evolve. And I look forward to being the one central depository of
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:15.440]   these definitions and their origins. It's I keep coming back to thoughts about the
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:21.040]   Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy about in the book is to it's said that the Hitchhiker's Guide to
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:28.000]   the Galaxy is it's often very very wrong but at least it's authoritatively wrong. Meaning
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:33.280]   and that's actually useful in that if you disagree with their definition of science fiction at least
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:38.160]   there is an authoritative source that you think is wrong that now all the discussion can sort of
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:44.320]   hover around. And because nobody has a dog in this fight it really is going to be just about let's
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:47.600]   just make sure that there's an understanding that we all have about what these things mean. It's
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:51.840]   not like the urban dictionary. So it's really really cool. It's it's it's permanently bookmark.
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:58.160]   It's on that. I dragged it almost immediately to the reference folder in my browser tabs and
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:04.080]   it's not as long as it's going to be in the coming years but it's still again the number
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:08.160]   times I click on something thinking that oh yeah that was that that was invented in like
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:16.080]   1980 whatever said no again 1932 it was first used by by people who are writing fan fiction like
[01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:23.520]   okay I am dumb I'm going to watch and listen. It is the historical dictionary of science fiction
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:30.800]   at sfdictionary.com and by the way they split the difference they mentioned both Trekkies and
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:36.800]   Trekkers so yes you get you get to choose although although they did lay the groundwork for some
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:45.280]   flame wars there is Klingons have a listening Raimlins have a listening Vulcans do not have a
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:50.640]   listening. Oh that is an oversight we must correct. It's it's it's not going to be authoritative
[01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:54.160]   science fiction unless you're pissing somebody off so I'm glad that they put that fascinating.
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:58.880]   It's like some fate is the sourdough starter of any conversation about the meaning of science
[01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:05.520]   fiction. Renee Richie has managed to reach over and pick up something very interesting what is that
[01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:13.200]   Renee? Yeah so this is a Canon C70 that I was talking about earlier today and it's a it's Canon's
[01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:18.640]   first cinema camera that's in the smaller body format something closer to what they're higher
[01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:25.760]   end cameras used how many Alex is going to set me back. Ah I have to it's Canadian Alex conversion
[01:52:25.760 --> 01:52:32.880]   is always difficult. No it's like 500 a week of water. U.S. okay but it's way cheaper than their
[01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:37.920]   traditional cinema cameras which have been you know up to you know 10,000 dollars under eight
[01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:43.760]   Alex's okay it's yeah well I mean you can find it retail for around 5,500 dollars okay and it's
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:47.760]   their first RF mount as well which is what all their new lenses are there have been moving away
[01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:53.600]   from EF mounts to RF mounts and this also has the dual gain sensor that they had in the C300
[01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:59.040]   Mark III which just means that you have sort of two sweet spots Alex is going to explain all of
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:02.160]   this better so I don't even know why I'm bothering but you basically have two sweet spots for the
[01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:06.480]   exposure where you can you can get much better performance at low light and it at higher light
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:12.480]   levels and it also records on CF car sorry on SD cars rather than CF cards and to the delight of
[01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:17.360]   vloggers everywhere it has the flippy outy screen. Love that. Which Sony has refused to put on a
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:23.200]   lot of their cameras but yeah I gotta see myself. I don't be able to turn it all. It'd be able to
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:28.000]   turn 180 degrees is really important a lot of them don't yeah yeah yeah it's no point of having a
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:32.720]   flip out if you can't turn it around. There's a lot of them that don't that's ridiculous.
[01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:40.480]   So that's the RF mount which also works with the black magic Komodo. I wonder which body I should
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:45.200]   get Alex. Red Komodo. Red Komodo I mean yeah yeah well and the black I think the black magic
[01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:50.400]   cat where they might use EF still but the other thing I like about it is oh okay there you go.
[01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:57.920]   It's really small. It's all the controls that you want to have on it and it also it also records in
[01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:02.240]   it is it is a super 35 camera but they have they have a new speed booster that came out with it
[01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:07.200]   so you can put on EF lenses and get them pretty much equivalent to full frame and it records in
[01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:12.240]   log 2 which the R5 does not do and there's been hints that Canon might enable it with a firmware
[01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:16.880]   patch but Canon insists on being maddening and always just denying a few critical features
[01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:21.200]   to every single camera that they put out for no apparent reason not even for differentiation
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:25.600]   because some of them have it and some don't it's just I think it's for learned helplessness reasons.
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:29.680]   It doesn't do raw but it does do 10 bit which is what I'm mostly interested anyway
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:36.560]   and to have SD cards dual SD card slots so you can record you know two two sessions at the same time
[01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:42.640]   it's I'm going to experiment with it as a B cam for a while but I think it's it's for people
[01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:46.400]   who favor video I think the R5 is way better if you're shooting stills as well
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:51.280]   because they still time you out on long session video recording but if you really want to focus
[01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:56.880]   on video and you want to up your video game and you don't want to buy a high-end cinema much less
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:55:03.280]   or read much less and you know as as someone of Alex's caliber is probably want to do this is great
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:09.760]   to start breaking into that level of production. I have to admit I only buy black magic cameras now
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:17.760]   I just I rent Aries like I'm not gonna buy an area but you want to shoot that 12k video.
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:25.760]   We're talking we're talking about it I mean getting a couple but um so the Canon EOC 74k it's a
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:30.000]   cinema camera I mean you could shoot stills like yes but that's not what it's I don't even know if
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:36.800]   it does you have to probably take a frame cap here it's a lists for 10 Alex's but you can get it for
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:43.280]   as little as eight Alex's if you shuffle around. You know you know we've been adding to that you know
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:50.160]   in office hours we've been adding to it so we actually have new new money in the denominations
[01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:56.400]   there's the the Alex which is $700 there is a Mickey which is $3,200 and then there's a Charles
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:00.720]   which is $11,000. Oh my god it makes it so much easier like oh it's only a Charles.
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:09.920]   So it turns out you're the sheepscape the bunch I am I am that's nice it's available now obviously
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:14.000]   because you've got one Renee yeah they were in limited supply over the holidays but now they
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:17.600]   started shipping and you can often if you don't go to the bigger places if you go to local stores
[01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:21.040]   they'll they'll still do online shipping but they'll have stock that the big stores are run out of
[01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:28.400]   right right here thank you Renee and now I don't know if I'm going to be spending an Alex a Mickey
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:33.120]   or a Charles what is it going to be it's so it's not very expensive but it is something everyone
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:39.440]   should run out and buy so so we had we had some guys on last week on office hours that were
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:46.320]   amazing so the Henny the Henny the business and Kennard Garrett and they are music producers I
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:52.160]   mean they've worked with all kinds of folks and they have developed an app with audio toolkit or
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:56.960]   audio kit pro have you have you are you familiar I've talked about that in the past we've talked
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:57:01.920]   about some of their software is open source software that gives people the tools to make music
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:06.400]   and these guys came on and it was so amazing to look at what they had done they sampled
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:12.080]   a mark one keyboard very carefully with their students at and they they teach it at Morehead
[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:20.000]   college and so what they did is they built an app that is this great keyboard app for like
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:24.640]   and it's like four dollars on the app store all the money not some of the money but all the money
[01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:29.280]   goes back to the music unit for the creative and performing arts division at Morehouse College
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:35.280]   in Atlanta Georgia so when you're buying it you're really supporting that music program and they've
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:40.400]   got I mean I can't believe that they have those guys as instructors because they're just they're
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:45.520]   really if you go back on YouTube and look at at last Thursday I think is when we had them on and
[01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:51.360]   they the amazing instructors that are there and they and they built this and they built it with
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:58.400]   Jeff Cooper and Matthew Fettcher from you who work on audio kit they they're building that
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:03.280]   the app itself so you can buy the app for four dollars you should go do that the source code is
[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:07.680]   on GitHub like it's a you can actually go up to GitHub and download it and see how they put it
[01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:13.120]   together and you know and figure those bits in you know and and there's so many audio apps that
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:18.880]   are coming out based on this on the code base this is audio kit pro which is what they use to
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:24.880]   build it right what's the name of the the the app is called house mark one house mark one is
[01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:32.560]   mark one okay yeah house mark one and it is uh I I don't quite understand how they stay in business
[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:36.000]   and how they do what they're doing but but they seem to make it work and make it really pretty
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:41.360]   web pages um and at you know it's a great um it's not it's one of those things it's difficult to
[01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:45.840]   let me see if I can do this music creators we are inspired let's see I want to hear some of this
[01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:50.560]   make sure that it made sense for me because all the
[01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:59.440]   so this is the software he's using a real keyboard but he's got a keyboard tied in to the
[01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:04.000]   software these and and I got to say these guys have taken bluetooth journal mini so there's not
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:11.920]   MIDI it's bluetooth um I it's MIDI it's MIDI yeah but it is but I mean the the crazy thing is these
[01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:18.800]   guys have taken production on an iPad way beyond anything I've thought about like it's they really
[01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:23.840]   they they really know how to do it and they're really building everything into that um it's uh
[01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:29.360]   it's a really slick app and uh amazing programs they've got going on you can use it without a
[01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:35.680]   physical keyboard obviously right yeah yeah you can you can use it you can use it on the iPad but
[01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:40.400]   the fact that it ties right in and then you get the you really get some incredible sounds I mean
[01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:46.080]   just very very realistic sounds from from the keyboard it's it's a really really it's addicting
[01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:55.440]   just play with so house colon mark one on the app store created by two platinum selling producers
[01:59:55.440 --> 02:00:02.080]   and it all benefits more house four bucks four bucks just for price of a of a relatively good
[02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:06.720]   Starbucks coffee you can have uh you can support them and get this great app that's really addicting
[02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:13.280]   and you should do it two hundredths of an Alex yeah it's actually practically not practically free
[02:00:13.280 --> 02:00:18.880]   I got free uh this I tip of the hat to uh John Gruber for uh this and I've been meaning to mention
[02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:23.520]   it do you know what I hate I hate that every time I go to a website it's got to pop up a thing
[02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:29.760]   saying we use cookies and I say okay what a damn waste of time that is I know you use cookies
[02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:36.240]   everyone does so you you know what I'm talking about hush right it's so good it blocks the cookie
[02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:42.480]   nags and privacy invasive tracking and safari it does it on the iPhone iPad and Mac and I've
[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:50.720]   installed it on safari and all three platforms because I I hate I hate all those pop-ups including
[02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:57.440]   cookies sign up for our newsletter um push notification requests which it could turn off
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:03.680]   globally but it's nice to have this hush and it's open source it's free and it's on the app store
[02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:10.160]   h-u-s-h noiseless brow browsing by Joel Arvidson and again tip of the hat to John Gruber for
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:14.480]   mentioning that he did it last month but I finally got around to mentioning on the show
[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:22.400]   thank you everybody for being here today what a good show uh Alex Lindsey is office hours
[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:29.440]   every morning twice on a Sunday because the guy just can't get enough work I guess I just
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:34.000]   do a lot of fun we do it it starts very early in the morning so it stays out of my work day yeah
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:40.720]   so it's more work before work it's you know that should be your motto by the way uh Alex
[02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:45.440]   the one thing I have to say is we really noticed over the weekend is it's a conversation that you
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:51.120]   couldn't have anywhere else like it is 20 people all having a conversation that usually spans four
[02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:55.600]   or five continents with with two or three hundred people watching it's and asking questions and
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:02:00.160]   interacting all the time not just watching but the audience runs the conversation like you just
[02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:03.520]   ask questions about media production or virtual production and we answer them that's the whole
[02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:09.280]   I just have to make this my morning show and just put it put it on and when I get up and just have
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:14.080]   it all morning as I'm getting ready because that's probably what everybody else does uh you can get
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:24.480]   the zoom link if you go to his youtube page youtube.com/alexlindsay and you can also see the seven o'clock
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:29.760]   hour which he puts on youtube but that's only one of the three well there's there's actually about
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:34.880]   four well there's there's technically about five hours every morning but I'm not there the whole
[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:39.840]   time but there's a pre-pre-show which is just us hanging out talking that's at five and then
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:44.320]   there's the pre-show at six and then there's the seven to nine that's the show I think there's a
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:48.400]   post-show but I don't usually stay for most post-show there's another one in my video just never ever
[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:53.520]   five hours it's like five hours yeah thank you Alex I'm so glad to have you back on the panel we see
[02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:59.360]   you next week yeah yep absolutely again I know you work really hard so you know you can take any

[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:23.840]   road again I'm aware I'm aware of it but you know sacrifices must be made if justice is going to be
[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:30.880]   pursued uh just go to wgbhnews.org to stream it either live or later very nice always a pleasure
[02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:38.800]   to have you on andrew and rene richy's on youtube.com/rene richy he's also got a great show that he does
[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:44.320]   I called apple talk with georgia now we see him and i'm more and everywhere else anything you want to
[02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:50.720]   plug so speaking of georgia dao I mean she's the real star of that show i'm just doing backup she
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:56.720]   made us do the hot sauce challenge during the podcast which i was not happy about and actually
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:04:00.480]   started hurting me towards the end yeah every question we answered we had to take a hotter
[02:04:00.480 --> 02:04:06.800]   degree of hot sauce and nobody needed I will never understand why people do that wait till she
[02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:10.480]   does it on tWitleo I mean you're home safe because she's only once in a while it ain't gonna happen
[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:17.200]   i'm gonna watch she's gonna does she get bright red no but we do both start to cry unfortunately
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:20.960]   it doesn't really show up well on the video like like because we at certain point like our eyes
[02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:24.320]   we're just burning and we're trying to answer questions and we're forgetting what the question
[02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:28.640]   was which one is it which one is it it's the latest episode of apple talk the ethics i think
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:35.600]   it's called and the bezos factor no twitter twitter opinions and hot sauce twitter opinions and hot
[02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:40.480]   sauce ladies and gentlemen yeah on the apple talk podcast you can't have twitter opinions when
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:43.760]   through eating hot sauce everyone should just eat hot sauce and stay off twitter i don't think it's
[02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:49.680]   up yet i hate to tell you i don't i don't think it's up yet i see the the most recent one is ai
[02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:55.360]   ai are ethics in the bezos factor i will double check i had to put it up this week instead of the
[02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:59.760]   usual people so i might have been completely bad about it maybe you forgot to market public or
[02:04:59.760 --> 02:05:04.960]   something i'll double check i apologize but yeah it'll be though this week's episode i'm subscribed so
[02:05:05.760 --> 02:05:09.840]   everybody i see it it says at least on youtube i see it twitter opinions and hot sauce
[02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:12.560]   here can you look at my screen and see what what am i missing
[02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:18.320]   and maybe it's not on the podcast when maybe the podcast got delayed oh that's probably what i'm
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:22.160]   looking at the podcast but on the youtube channel it's there okay and what is the youtube channel
[02:05:22.160 --> 02:05:28.160]   called youtube.com/appletalk oh that's easy you got your own name now apple talk show

[02:05:35.600 --> 02:05:42.720]   she's crying she's gonna cry oh how can how can georgia dad's hair is already bright red i don't
[02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:47.520]   know if she should do any hot sauce yeah and the thing is that she wasn't happy with the quality
[02:05:47.520 --> 02:05:52.320]   of the sauce is so now she wants to get the actual hot ones the sauces i think are way more painful
[02:05:52.960 --> 02:06:01.200]   yeah and and i'm no Sean Evans so personally i love it i love his show
[02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:07.840]   but that's the thing is it's good to have him as like a guide that it's it's like if you take it
[02:06:07.840 --> 02:06:12.080]   if you take acid for the first time you want someone to guide you when you're acid trippin
[02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:17.120]   Sean Evans is a good person to have that's why i worry about like you and georgia just like

[02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:26.800]   and see what happens she had no concern for my safety the opposite in fact could be argued
