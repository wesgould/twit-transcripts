[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.080]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that well covers
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.200]   Macintosh stuff.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.520]   I want to thank you, Alex Lindsey, for filling in for me
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.720]   last week while I was on vacation.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.000]   And we're going to use that tool again if you're watching live.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.120]   So that you can ask questions, vote on questions.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.520]   And if we have time in the show, we'll get to it.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.000]   I hate to-- my only reserve on this
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.200]   is that the shows have gotten already too long.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.600]   And I don't want to add another two hours to the show.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.440]   So time permitting.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.800]   I think we're more likely to use this on a slow news day
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.520]   than we are on a day like today, which is nothing but news.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.960]   Anyway, Alex, thank you for filling in.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.200]   And the address for this, if you want to vote,
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.000]   is pixacore.force.com/pixacore.force.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.960]   Is this sales force stuff?
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.800]   Yeah, it's something that they don't use much anymore.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.200]   But it's interesting.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.320]   It's a great little-- it's basically like dig except customized.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.120]   Very cool.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.920]   So you can vote questions up and down as well.

[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.640]   Pixacore.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.000]   Pixacore.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.080]   Well, you have pixacore in there twice.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.320]   There's a reason we do it for a lot of different things.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.480]   This is just the generalize of the screen.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.480]   It's a little-- we're going to fix that.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.280]   Also here from School Bus Land, Mr. Mac OS Ken.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.720]   Ken Ray.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.960]   Hey, Ken.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.360]   Hey, Leo.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.800]   How's it going?
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.120]   Welcome back.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.520]   Thanks.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.400]   Thanks for having me back to you.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.480]   The whole time you lived down the street,
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.320]   we never had you on.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.760]   And now that you've moved to Rochester--
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.560]   near Buffalo.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.560]   Buffalo.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.560]   Rochester would be nice, huh?
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.200]   Is that the big city?
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.960]   I'm not all high-falutin, Leo.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.200]   Now that you're in Buffalo.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.000]   Yeah, I know.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.760]   Well, you don't know what you got till it's gone, right?
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.260]   Yeah.
[00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.160]   People like me confuse Rochester in Buffalo,
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.240]   but there is a difference.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.920]   I guess so.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.120]   I'm directly under Rochester.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.040]   So I don't know.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.480]   They won't let me in.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.760]   Anyways, it's great to have--
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.000]   It's great to have you.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.400]   It's great to have you.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.880]   And then from Rochester to Dorchester.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.440]   Dorchester.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.600]   Dorchester.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.320]   Andi Naka, who apparently studying Zumba.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.400]   No, no, this is rare that you get a chance
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.880]   to see Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man, and a female version
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.680]   of the Blue Beetle, and some anime guy
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.920]   fruging and boo-gluing on a public stage.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.440]   That's the reason why I went to New York Comic Con.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.480]   Comic Con.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.240]   You must be happy.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.600]   Now, you don't go to San Diego Comic Con.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.520]   No, I don't.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.320]   It's way too big.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.160]   And if you live in the East Coast, it's like--
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.160]   It's too far.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.440]   Yeah, you spend $1,500.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.800]   And I was like, OK, I'm not going to buy gum while I'm here.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.280]   I've spent $1,500 to be at a comic convention.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.880]   So is this the first New York Comic Con?
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.080]   No, it's the fifth or the sixth.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.080]   And it's just been getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.680]   They had 100,000 people this year.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.680]   And on Saturday morning, if not for the fact
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.400]   that I had a press pass, I would have had to wait 45 minutes
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.440]   to an hour to get in.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.960]   Wow.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.480]   Because it was just 1,000 people.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.320]   And they're trying to manage the crowds as best they could.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.880]   And it's a human nature.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.200]   For decades, we here in the East Coast
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.600]   have been hoping for a big national comic convention
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.200]   to be nearby.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.160]   Now that we have one, only took us three or four years to say,
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.640]   oh, it's so big and crowded.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.600]   I don't even know if I want to go anymore.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.520]   It's not about comics.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.960]   It's about the movies and the TV shows.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.640]   It jumps the shark.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.840]   Yeah, it isn't really about--
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.200]   San Diego, anyway, isn't really about comics so much as you say.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.280]   It's Hollywood.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.440]   Anyway, welcome all.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.640]   We are all here talking about our new iPhones.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.480]   Boy, is that a boring subject, huh?
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.400]   I see you sitting with the Galaxy S2 and an iPhone.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.640]   I've been testing them back and forth.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.280]   Why don't we head to the head?
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.680]   We actually threw them up over the weekend.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.320]   I put them up on one of our resolution charts together.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.820]   Yeah.
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.600]   To see what cameras.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.720]   Because they're both 8 megapixel.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.760]   Yeah, so I haven't done the color low light.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.760]   I have to say the color on the iPhone 4S is pretty amazing.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.260]   It is.
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.560]   The pure resolution, I think, that the Galaxy is just
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.160]   and knows ahead of the--
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.400]   And I'll post some of the images.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.040]   But when I put it up against the resolution charts,
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.440]   it looked like it was just a little bit sharper than the iPhone.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.880]   But I haven't tested, again, the color or low light performance.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.800]   I have to say, the image--
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.160]   The image on the iPhone 4S is pretty spectacular.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.560]   And I was one of the people who said the day after,
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.360]   if you have an iPhone 4, it's fine to wait, no hurry,
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.400]   series cool, but I think Siri will be available on all the platforms
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.520]   as soon as it goes out of beta.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.440]   I don't think that they're going to keep it on iPhone 4S only.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.400]   We should talk about that.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.560]   What do you think?
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.480]   Is this an upgrade--
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.240]   I must have upgrade for-- certainly for an iPhone 3GS owner.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.440]   And I think that's the M10.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.760]   I think every other year now, right?
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.240]   That's the idea.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.000]   Yeah, well, certainly.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.280]   I mean, if you've got the sort of cash,
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.360]   you can buy a brand new phone every single year.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.280]   Or if you're so clumsy with your phones,
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.400]   you can manage to drop one down a toilet once a year.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.280]   Then that's a great move for you.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.760]   But yeah, I don't think that anybody will be willing to--
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.960]   it's hard to justify upgrading from the 4 to the 4S,
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.720]   although the 4S is a lot more significant of an upgrade
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.960]   than the lack of a change of appearance would indicate.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.440]   Yeah, that's an interesting choice,
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.880]   although I think that was intentional on Apple
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.880]   to make you feel OK if you have an iPhone 4, right?
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.720]   Yeah, well, not just that, but I mean,
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.560]   isn't it silly to think that Apple would design--
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.760]   would come up with a design as radical as the design for the iPhone 4
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.080]   and then say, no, it's really--
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.520]   God, that's so 2010, that's so dated.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.600]   Really, really, though, I mean, when you design something
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.360]   that has really no features like this
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.520]   and it says simple and classic as possible,
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.160]   the whole point of that design is
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.320]   to make sure that you could be using this phone five years
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.000]   later and--
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.480]   Oh, come on, Andy, come on, you know that--
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.280]   You know that the iPhone 5 will not look this way.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.240]   Or will it?
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.600]   Well, I don't know.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.000]   It didn't take very long for everybody
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.240]   to start backpedaling on all of those--
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.360]   Yes, all of my iPhone 5 predictions
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.840]   were absolutely spot on.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.120]   I assure you, it's just--
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.720]   and this was a direct quote from somebody
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.240]   that I don't want to name him.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.960]   But he was saying, my sources tell me
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.880]   that when Steve Jobs knew that the end was coming,
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.160]   he decided that he was going to put all of his passion
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.960]   into the iPhone 5 and that the iPhone 4S
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.360]   was a shabby little attempt at an iPhone.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:27.880]   That was fine.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.280]   As long as he put his passions into the iPhone 5,
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.920]   all the wonderful features that I promised
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.760]   you were going to be having were going to be the iPhone 5.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.920]   And he saw that story too, and I thought that was reprehensible.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.400]   Yeah, I thought that was--
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.400]   That's just dumb asking me.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.200]   Using Steve Jobs' name to justify your bad lead
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.160]   or your bad tip, it's reprehensible.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.640]   Yeah, well, I mean, it takes a--
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.520]   I've done this before, and I've heard a rumor
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.160]   and had enough data behind it that I thought
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.520]   it was valuable for someone to hear.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.920]   And with great-- I was so tentative about saying
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.280]   this sort of stuff, I did.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.680]   And once or twice, I've been wrong.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.440]   But if that happens, that's life in the NFL.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.280]   You got to say, OK, I wasn't just being irresponsible.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.640]   I thought I had it right, but I didn't.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.440]   Oh, well.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.080]   And my experience of talking to anyone that might be down
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.800]   in one infinite loop is that when Steve Jobs was there,
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.720]   he pretty much paid attention to everything.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.200]   Yeah, including the t-shirt design and the leather
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.200]   and the--
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.160]   Where in the van?
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.960]   Yeah, everything.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.440]   It was really kind of stunning to see that article,
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.680]   though, I'm in to just see somebody double down, like what?
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.080]   Three days later, I'm talking about that.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:36.840]   We were right.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.480]   We're still right.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.440]   You just wait.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.800]   Well, come back in a year.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.560]   And I know this is hopeless, but can we now please just
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.320]   remember these rumors are worthless?
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.800]   They're worth them-- the toilet paper they're written on?
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.960]   I mean, it's just--
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:52.880]   Of course we can't.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.000]   Three days later, Leo.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.880]   I know, immediately.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.600]   We're talking about it.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.240]   Here we are.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.440]   Immediately.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.080]   It's incredible.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.400]   All right, well--
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.200]   You know what?
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.520]   I'm glad they didn't change the case,
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.000]   because all my accessories still were.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Well, I think that was one of the big features of it.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.640]   Not changing is that I have so many cases,
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.040]   and I have so many little chargers,
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.080]   and all kinds of things for my iPhone,
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.880]   that I was bracing for impact for a new iPhone 5
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.720]   that I was going to get.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.120]   Now I have to get a whole bunch of new cases.
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.160]   And so I was kind of glad.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.040]   So gosh, there's so many things to talk about.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.160]   I don't want to lump them all in one big bunch.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.920]   So let's start with--
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.160]   Golly, I mean, a lot has happened since I was here last.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.840]   Let's start with the iPhone 4S sales.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.960]   The 4 million--
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.240]   Apple announced 4 million iPhone 4S
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.360]   is sold in the first weekend.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.920]   Not only eclipsing previous iPhone sales,
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.960]   eclipsing all previous smartphone sales,
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.120]   not only eclipsing all previous smartphone sales,
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.280]   but possibly the fastest selling consumer electronics device
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.640]   of all time.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.400]   Why?
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.600]   Not bad for a minor upgrade.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.960]   Were we a little disappointed by what was in this?
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.280]   Yeah, we thought it was a minor upgrade.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.640]   I guess we were wrong.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.120]   Well, is that the pre-orders as well as the--
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.680]   It's every new sales?
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.760]   So there was 3 million pre-orders, I think,
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.960]   wasn't there in the first weekend now?
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.080]   So then another million bought them.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.520]   Well, it doesn't-- you know, I mean, the point
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.640]   is that they count it the same way they always have.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.160]   It's the most sales ever.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.960]   That people went to stores and/or got in the mail
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.400]   their iPhone 4S is 4 million of them.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.320]   Partly sprint, right?
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.480]   Pen up demand at Verizon, right?
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.680]   I think this is--
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.640]   I think with smartphone sales, there's
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.040]   so many factors that come into play
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.000]   because it really isn't an imp--
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.560]   it's not like an iPod where you can sort of buy one
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.120]   whenever you want.
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.040]   This might have been a perfect storm sort of event
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.160]   where not only were the features there, not only
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.320]   where it's at a good presentation, but also just a lot
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.000]   of people were in a position where they were able to--
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.480]   they were able to buy a new phone at this time.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.800]   I think that a lot of people were also
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.400]   sort of aiming themselves towards 2011 as the year
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.640]   that they were going to finally ditch whatever they had
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.720]   existing, whether it was a 3GS, whether it was an Android
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.280]   phone, whether it was even just a basic feature phone
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.840]   and finally get into iPhone.
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.120]   So there's a lot of factors here.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.280]   The fact that there was 4 million units in no time whatsoever,
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.120]   that's a little bit too many for me to simply think that Siri
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.240]   and a brand new camera was enough to get people to say,
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.440]   yes, now finally, now there's finally voice interaction.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.960]   That's what I was waiting for for the iPhone.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.720]   I've got to have this phone.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.000]   I also think it's probable that there were a lot of 3GS
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   and 3G users who finally upgraded, who hadn't upgraded
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.600]   to 4, for whatever reason.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.960]   Maybe they listened to consumer reports.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.720]   I don't know.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.240]   They were fairly-- I mean, they were fairly informal surveys,
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.720]   but I think you had Piper Jaffrey and Lestine, Monster,
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.920]   and somebody else.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.320]   Maybe UBS analyst Maynardama can't remember talking
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.160]   to people online.
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.920]   And what they were saying was that it was somewhere between 75
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.200]   and 77% of the people that they talked to were upgrading.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.520]   So I mean, a lot of people were--
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.960]   Upgrading for even from iPhone 4.
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:08.880]   Well, it didn't say.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:09.480]   I mean, that's the problem.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.480]   They actually-- I don't understand.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.920]   If you're going to stand around online,
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.520]   why don't you ask some really important questions?
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.320]   Like, they didn't talk about how many people were going
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.880]   from Android to iPhone.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.400]   They talked about device makers, generally speaking.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.600]   So they know that it was this many people going from LG
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.640]   to the iPhone, or this many people going from Motorola
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.480]   to the iPhone.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.400]   And so you can sort of say, some of those
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.520]   are going to be Android Upgraders,
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.440]   but a lot of them are just going to be people who are going
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.440]   from dumb phone or flip phones.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.040]   I'm actually really curious to see what they say about iPhone
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.320]   sales on tonight's earnings call.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.840]   Because the weird thing to me is, I mean, we all talk tech,
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.240]   right?
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.960]   There are so many people who just didn't even
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.080]   seem to realize that we hadn't gotten a new iPhone over
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.080]   this summer.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.880]   And that we were about to get a new iPhone.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.840]   People were just still going to Apple stores and buying
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.400]   phones.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.200]   So I mean, I'm wondering if even going
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.360]   into what we thought was going to be an iPhone 5 or an iPhone
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.760]   4S or an iPhone Super or whatever we thought it was going
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:56.320]   to be called.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.800]   I'm wondering if even going into that,
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.640]   we still saw a record number of iPhone sales last quarter.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.560]   Yeah, I bet we could happen.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.520]   I bet we did.
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.000]   And it looks like-- I mean, I was tweeting out to--
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.640]   and as to who upgraded from the 3GS versus the 4.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.360]   Who upgraded for?
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.400]   Are you happy with the 4S?
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.560]   Was it worth it?
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.840]   And the vast majority of the people that responded
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.480]   were actually going from the 4 to the 4S.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.800]   And for them, it was Siri and the camera.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.560]   You know, they really wanted to have Siri
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.840]   and the camera made a big difference.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.280]   And I have to say that the camera does mean that--
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.480]   I mean, this is the end of the point and shoot.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.000]   It is.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.360]   It's good enough now.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.800]   It's good enough now.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.120]   And with all the software too available for it,
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.640]   that makes it much more compelling than a point and shoot.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.720]   And we made fun of.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.480]   We mocked Apple announcing the Cards app.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.120]   And I still kind of mocked at that.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.040]   But that's the kind of thing that ties in so nicely
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.960]   to this good camera.
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.560]   And I think I probably will send some cards with that Cards app.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.040]   Next trip.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.800]   I put my mom's address in there.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.960]   You know, I think I might--
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.320]   That's the thing.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.600]   You have to go back and get everybody's address now.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.600]   There are two or three things.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.760]   I can't remember what the other one was.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.320]   But there was something else that I wanted--
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.760]   oh, I was setting an alert reminder.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.960]   I now know the address of my grocery store.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.080]   I've never known what the address of my grocery store was.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.480]   But they also have a pharmacy.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.120]   And there's a prescription that has to be built.
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.320]   And so now I've set a reminder.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:18.840]   Uh-huh.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.680]   Next time I'm there because I always forget.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.040]   Isn't that a nice feature?
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.680]   That GPS reminder says--
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.880]   You're the store again?
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:25.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.440]   Pick up your fungicide.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.440]   And you're there.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.200]   How did you know?
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.600]   I'm sorry, Ken.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.520]   Didn't mean to add to it.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.680]   So yeah, somebody in the chat room
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.840]   said you guys just don't understand how people buy phones.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.800]   And it may be-- I mean, we really live in a bubble.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.800]   We are not.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.200]   I mean, we're all sitting here.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.120]   We probably all have several phones.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:48.800]   Hold on.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.840]   I think I'm actually setting a trend
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.080]   for how I'm going to be on Mac break weekly from now on.
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.080]   Last time, Lion had come out.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.760]   And I did not have Lion yet.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.280]   You still don't have one?
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.160]   I don't have an iPhone 4S.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.160]   I'm not eligible for an upgrade until later this year.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.880]   And I don't have-- I am the person
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.600]   that the person in the chat room is talking about.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.640]   I understand how people buy phones.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.120]   I'm a little annoyed, actually, because when we went from the iPhone
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:15.360]   3G to the 3GS, speed OK, better camera OK.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.200]   But I didn't feel like I actually had to have it to understand.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.640]   It's sort of like when we went from the iPad to the iPad 2,
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.000]   I felt like, OK, well, if I really want to understand the iPad 2,
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.600]   I'm going to have to go ahead and get one,
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.000]   because the camera does change enough.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.360]   But just having a better camera, just having a little bit more
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.560]   speed.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.240]   And by the way, the 3GS--
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.840]   It's under clocked at 800 megahertz.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.720]   And I know people are saying it seems a lot faster.
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.640]   It doesn't seem that much.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.120]   It's not so much faster that you're going to go,
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.320]   oh, my, poor slow iPhone 4.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.920]   Well, it depends on the situation.
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.760]   iOS 5 sped up the camera app for all iPhone models.
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:49.920]   That's true.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.520]   When you're on-- when I was shooting that video on the con
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:56.440]   4, I'm just not used to the idea of shooting five minutes
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.000]   of video, tapping stop.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.960]   And then a second later, the iPhone's like, OK,
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.120]   want to shoot some more?
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.760]   Because I was shooting side by side with the iPhone 4
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.880]   and the iPhone 4S.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.240]   And I tap stop at the both times.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.960]   The iPhone 4S would be ready to go again immediately.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.520]   But there was a still or a video, but a particular video.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:16.520]   iPhone 4 was just watch it, just do nothing for almost a full
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.960]   minute sometimes while it gets--
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.960]   writes the file and gets ready to shoot again.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.200]   So it does feel zippier.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.720]   I don't think the CPU performance is as important on a
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.120]   phone as it is on a desktop.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.400]   Because there's so few situations where you really--
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.960]   they're really doing that kind of number crunching.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.120]   But it really is--
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.280]   I'm going to let it--
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.680]   it comes through the speech synthesis as both features.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.600]   And I apologize, Ken, because I interrupted, because I know
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.800]   where you were going with your--
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.960]   Which was--
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.520]   Well, camera didn't need--
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:48.160]   But there was something that did that you really do need--
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.280]   because you can't test it with an iPhone 4S.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:50.800]   It's Siri.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.800]   Yeah, Siri.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.120]   Right.
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.480]   I mean, and there's so much talk about it.
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.120]   I mean, the cool thing is I will come across people who
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.600]   have it, I'm sure, and I will get to try it.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.160]   And there's no shortage of stuff online about it, because
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.520]   it's such a neat feature.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.840]   Well, most of it's trivial use.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.440]   I want to bury a body.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.080]   I'm horny.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.240]   I need to buy some drugs, that kind of thing.
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.160]   I have to admit, in four days it's become a core part of what--
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.520]   I don't text anything anymore.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.440]   I don't like it a lot.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.360]   Like, I just sit there and just go, you know, text--
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.040]   you know, text Doug, and then I go, OK.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.680]   I like it better if you say tell Doug.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.880]   It's just so imperative.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.040]   I didn't even tell Doug how it works.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:25.960]   Yeah.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.440]   The only thing--
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.960]   I just love just saying tell Alex, I'm going to be late.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.840]   I just love doing that.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.680]   And it says, OK.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.840]   Well, and one of the things that's a little--
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.440]   it definitely feels like dragon.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.960]   So if you've used dragon software,
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.800]   you can put all your punctuation in as well.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:43.280]   So you can--
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.480]   Say period, question mark.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.240]   --question mark, comma, quotes.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.840]   Can you say bang, hash bang?
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.560]   I don't know.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.360]   I haven't tried that before.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:49.840]   I have to try that.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.840]   But I've done open parenthesis, close parenthesis.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.920]   You know, like all that stuff can be put in.
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.600]   It is easier, I have to say, to input text messages.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.840]   If you use the-- when you open up the keyboard
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.520]   and use the little microphone--
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.520]   because I have to admit, when you tell Siri,
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.120]   I want to text somebody, she cuts you off so fast.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.600]   Like if you have to think for a second about what you want to say,
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.080]   she immediately just goes, OK, that's enough.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.320]   One thing Apple does very differently from Android.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.800]   Now, admittedly, Android has these voice commands,
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.440]   voice actions.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.240]   And I have used them.
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.440]   I'm one of the few because I always tell people,
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.360]   use them using their great because I love them.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.920]   I do believe the recognition is better,
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.640]   but that's one significant difference.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.240]   Siri, if you use the keyboard microphone,
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.440]   will patiently wait for you to say, I'm done.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.920]   And can go on and on and on.
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.240]   And Android will not do that.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.640]   Android will stop as you pause, often and opportunity.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:45.800]   Well, and the other thing is, is that if you have pages on your iPhone,
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.160]   you can sit there and just hit it and then just dictate.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.760]   And then you just keep on dictating like you would with Dragon.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.640]   And then when you look at the iCloud,
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.240]   then you can have it available on something else
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.120]   to clean it up and do anything else you want with it.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.400]   It's pretty-- it's one of those things where we talk about--
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.760]   and I know Andy especially talks about a lot--
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.480]   the subtle fit and finish--
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.320]   he's talking to Siri right now-- the subtle fit and finish.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.680]   I saw you do that.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.720]   No, no, I was just--
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.120]   Go ahead.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:11.600]   I hope so.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.760]   The subtle fit and finish that Apple adds to something
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.800]   is enough to me to put me over the top and using this.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.960]   I used it on Android.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.080]   I still use it on Android.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.080]   It's just a little bit, but just enough a little bit better.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.800]   And I really think it's worth it.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.640]   It's really some basic things.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:34.440]   I'm still shocked that Android speech synthesis is so awful.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.440]   Siri will say, OK, I've scheduled you an appointment
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.600]   for 2 PM Tuesday.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.400]   Who has a lunch with Leo?
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.280]   Android is still--
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.320]   [SINGING]
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.280]   Well, there is one thing that Android has--
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.360]   that Siri does not have.
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.920]   You can change the voices on Android
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.080]   and you can put better voices on Android.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.200]   Yeah, but why would you ship it with a piece of crap?
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.800]   Well, I'm sorry to say space.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.480]   Probably I would be on my guess, but I don't know.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:58.960]   Whatever.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.680]   No, I don't think that's phone specific, by the way,
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.040]   manufacturer specific.
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.320]   But S-Vox is a tool that you can add
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.400]   and will allow you to add other voices.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.160]   This is the other side of the equation.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.200]   As long as I'm going to be fair, yes, fit and finish
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.000]   is better on Apple, but it's much more restrictive.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.680]   You're stuck with the voice they give you.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.640]   You can't change it to the British voice.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.640]   Apparently, though, if you change it to the foreign language
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:25.240]   voices, it doesn't do as well or as much.
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.840]   It's very interesting.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.680]   Well, I think that by staying focused on one thing
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.280]   rather than making it available, it's easier to make it more
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.640]   stable, it's easier to make it more--
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.360]   They're probably concomitant features.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.280]   Also, this is one of the reasons why they're calling it a beta.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.560]   One of the things that is explicitly on their to-do list
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.760]   is to expand the international reach
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.680]   and the international compatibility of Siri.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:49.240]   So if there's a reason why Apple has
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.960]   done this kind of unprecedented thing,
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.360]   I think the last time they actually released a beta
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:58.400]   into the public was the first public beta of OS X at 10.0.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.280]   So the idea that they're saying, we got something really cool.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.200]   We think that it's useful as it exists right now,
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.480]   but we can't figure out how people are going to want to use it
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.200]   until lots of people start using it.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:13.240]   So for the first six months, it spends a lot of time
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.680]   saying, I don't know what you mean by do these pants
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.880]   to make my butt look big.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.040]   We like me to search on the web for it now,
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.640]   and that's the sort of thing that's going to be the first three
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:22.360]   or four months.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.520]   Oh, I mean, there's so much.
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.960]   New voices, SDKs.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.960]   Certainly, they should know other apps
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.360]   should be able to work with Siri and vice versa.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.760]   But I do believe that all of this
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.280]   will be fixed once they come out of beta.
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.560]   Apple's-- I can't remember Apple doing a public beta
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.040]   on a product like this before.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.360]   It wasn't-- it didn't-- it wasn't as big,
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.200]   but it wasn't FaceTime of beta when it came out.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.720]   Do they call it beta?
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.280]   I thought so.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.040]   I think they might have.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:46.720]   OK.
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.360]   So that would be the other time.
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.840]   I mean, it's not a common thing for Apple.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.120]   Like Google, it's not something Apple does all the time.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.760]   And I think that there's a very important message
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.560]   that they're saying-- sending by using that term.
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.920]   For instance, I think this will come out on the iPhone 4
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:21:59.640]   and the iPad 2.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.360]   There's no technical reason why it can't.
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:05.920]   Well, I think there's a technical reason they can't.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:10.360]   Yeah, it really does require that kind of dual core processing
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:10.680]   power.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.200]   Well, the iPad 2 is faster than the iPhone 4.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.200]   Right.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.800]   Well, it can't-- so when you said the iPhone 4,
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.400]   I mean, it might come-- you could see it coming out
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.800]   for the iPad 2.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.000]   You could even see it coming for desktops.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.880]   But any previous iPhone, I think that's not going to happen.
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.280]   The Siri app worked fine on the iPhone 3G.
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.120]   Well, because it wasn't doing exactly the same thing, was it?
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.160]   Well, it's all server-based.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.960]   It's my suspicion that they will put it, at least on the iPhone
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.680]   4 and the iPad 2.
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.280]   We'll see.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.320]   I don't think that there's any technical reason they can't.
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.440]   I think there's a server reason they can't.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.000]   As we all noted in the first day, when everybody was asking
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.640]   Siri how to bury a body, it wasn't as responsive as it has
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.160]   been later.
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.640]   Thank goodness.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.680]   What about the--
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:58.000]   I hate doing stuff like this because I can't point to who I
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:58.520]   heard it from.
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.400]   But I heard from a guy who talked to a guy at Apple.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.360]   And that's just--
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:01.880]   That's good.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.520]   --take it forward.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:03.040]   It's worth it for us.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.680]   And I'll take it in that respect.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.400]   What they were saying was that the microphone and some
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:13.880]   of the processing that they put into the iPhone 4s
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.480]   was the reason that you wouldn't-- one of the reasons
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.000]   that you wouldn't get it in the iPhone 4.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   And that indicated to me that it would also be a reason that
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   you wouldn't get it in the iPad 2, which is kind of a bummer
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.320]   if that ends up being the case because you're right, it
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.360]   seems like it would be able to do it.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.040]   But of course, if it seemed like it would be able to do it,
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.040]   why wouldn't it go ahead and be able to do it now?
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.040]   Is Apple Siri noticeably better than the app?
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.360]   Siri app?
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.120]   I didn't use the Siri app, so I know.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.800]   I used it for a while on this side.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.280]   Yeah, they're two different things.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.080]   OK.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.640]   It is true that the Siri app did more.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.200]   You could make reservations and so forth.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.080]   But I think the voice recognition, maybe not as good.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.920]   And of course, Siri, as the chatroom,
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.040]   is quick to tell me on the iPhone 4s,
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.240]   does use a lot of the iPhone--
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.920]   it's not all server-side.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.440]   Some of it does work when you're offline.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:01.200]   All I can say is that my understanding of it
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.040]   is that there is nothing in the iPhone 4s that
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.520]   was put in specifically to support Siri.
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.200]   OK.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.520]   So if this is not--
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.240]   OK, but this does not mean that other things--
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.000]   does that not mean that other things weren't improved
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:13.500]   anyway, though?
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.280]   I mean, if it wasn't put in specifically for Siri,
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:18.880]   they're not things that would make Siri work better for it.
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.320]   I mean, like the A5 processor obviously
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.840]   wasn't put in there specifically for it,
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:25.040]   but the A4 is not going to cut it, right?
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:25.720]   Well, we don't know.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.160]   I mean, an Apple is not forthcoming.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:31.000]   It'd be my best guess that they will offer it on at least
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.040]   the iPad 2, which is perfectly capable.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.160]   In fact, is it faster?
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.680]   I wonder if it's even--
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.800]   and I've had to design feature.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.040]   The more that I use Siri, the more that I understand
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.520]   that it's not just cool voice recognition that could be done
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.000]   on a desktop, could be done on a tablet,
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.040]   could be done on anything.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:50.440]   It's really designed so that when you're
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.040]   stuck with a device that has these really terrible little
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.200]   virtual keyboards, you want to find ways
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.200]   so that you don't have to use that keyboard.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.240]   So I think that--
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.280]   well, I certainly don't doubt that it'll
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.040]   expand it on the devices.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:08.800]   I think this was a specifically an iPhone-based solution.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.480]   I think I would see it on the--
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:14.400]   if I were to make a bet, if they made an iPod touch
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.240]   with the right processing power, I could see this rolling out
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.400]   to the iPod touch before anything else.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.480]   Of course, then you have the problem
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.280]   of not having persistent 3G.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.520]   But--
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.640]   Well, it's not that microphone is somebody pointed out.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.360]   You can use headsets and Bluetooth.
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.240]   Oh, that's a good point.
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.720]   It's not the microphone.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.520]   The thing is that Siri is sort of the next big thing
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.280]   for Apple, right?
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.960]   I mean, you say, well, it's perfect for the phone.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.560]   It's not perfect for everything else.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.000]   I mean, is it not the beginning of--
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.480]   I can talk to my computer and I don't have to be near my computer?
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.080]   There's been a lot of speculation
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.560]   that this is OS 10 bound, absolutely.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.320]   Yeah, well, and I think that one of the things that--
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.120]   And wouldn't you want that?
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.560]   Well, when you start using Siri and you start doing
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.800]   a lot of dictation--
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.880]   and I've done a lot of dictation with Dragon for a long time,
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:02.000]   but being able to use this in pages on your Mac,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.680]   on your iPad, on your--
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.960]   is pretty compelling.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.560]   It is a little frustrating, and it's
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:09.560]   only available on the phone at the moment.
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.160]   Maybe my phone will talk to my computer.
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:14.080]   Maybe the phone becomes a base unit for all of this.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.160]   That is so awesome.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.360]   You were talking about something that's
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.680]   been out for five days, and you're like,
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.040]   I can't believe this is only on my phone.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.800]   You're talking to Alex Lindsey here, my friend.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.520]   It was like, well, I was just got nothing on him.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.560]   Well, yesterday I had--
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.360]   as a good example, yesterday I got food poisoning.
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.040]   So I was in--
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.160]   I was not in a good condition yesterday,
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.160]   and I'm laying on my bed, responding to everyone's text
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.560]   messages, just going, text, love, love, love, love.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.760]   And I just kept on going.
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.560]   And I was like, oh my gosh, this is great.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.960]   I mean, that wasn't great that I was laying in bed.
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.160]   But you can't move in the house.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.160]   In the house.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.560]   But it was quite a--
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.840]   Let's take a little break.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.600]   We're going to talk more about iPhone 4S.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.440]   There's lots more to say, of course.
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.520]   O.S., Mac OS Ken is here.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.560]   Ken Ray, great to have you, Ken, once again.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:02.920]   Thanks.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:07.120]   MacosKen.com for his great show, which he does every single day.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.320]   Or @MacOSKen on Twitter.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.000]   From the Pixel Core, Mr. Alex Lindsey, PixelCore.com
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.080]   for that guild of multimedia artists
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.280]   living, working, and breathing together.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.000]   Did I say breathing?
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.240]   I meant breathing.
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.240]   And they--
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.280]   Did you say breathing?
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.360]   And no, they're not.
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:22.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.240]   It's mostly just online.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.400]   So there you go.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.960]   PixelCore.tv for the podcast.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.840]   Actually, you do a live thing every Thursday,
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.480]   at PixelCore.com/live.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.240]   Mac Break Studio Live is going to be this Thursday.
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.160]   And that's Brent--
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.160]   I'm going to do some of that.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:35.760]   We are going to be--
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:36.880]   I think Brent might be on it.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.400]   We're going to be-- of course, we have our two trainers.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.480]   We have Steve Martin and Mark Spencer.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.240]   Oh, that was great.
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:41.960]   So you can do that again?
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.320]   Yeah, they're going to be up there.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.400]   Oh, that was so great with the OS 10--
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.960]   With the new Final Cut.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.360]   And so they're going to be-- we actually
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.080]   show people kind of behind the scenes of us actually doing
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.600]   Mac Break Studios, and so they can really get
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.600]   a sense of it this Thursday.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.640]   So that's Thursday at 6 p.m.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.080]   And Annie and Aco, who's giant, giant review
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.600]   of the iPhone 4S--
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.200]   I like the dog, by the way-- will appear in Chicago,
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.400]   sometimes, or has it appeared already in the show?
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.120]   It was because for Monday I decided
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.720]   I need a little bit more of a deep soak
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.080]   to understand what was going on.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.400]   So that's going to be hitting probably Thursday.
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.240]   No urgency.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.480]   We are ready now to read the deep thoughts
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.880]   of Andy and Aco on the Chicago Sun time.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.960]   As soon as I have one, I'll be able to write one down.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.200]   You know, I don't want to say anything,
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.480]   but I've been talking to my car for some time.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:26.920]   Right.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.360]   Actually, my whole life.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.400]   But it finally starts responding when I get there.
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.800]   I'm mostly yelling, but they got the new Ford Sync.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.600]   We want to welcome Ford back to Mac Break Weekly.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.600]   We're big Ford fans.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.680]   My Mustang right outside.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:41.400]   And now they've added some really neat new features.
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:45.080]   You can read about all the new technologies in Ford's
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.080]   at Ford.com/technology.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:51.280]   The Sync with My Ford Touch, where you talk to your car,
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.760]   the voice commands on Sync are really fantastic.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.000]   Very similar to Siri.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.040]   It doesn't talk back to you yet.
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.400]   I think it's just a matter of time
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.920]   before it talks back to you, however.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.440]   Everybody's now paying close attention to this.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.360]   The new electric vehicles are amazing.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.920]   I can't wait to get my hands on that Focus Electric.
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.720]   It's-- this is really cool.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:12.880]   You can now turn your Ford into a Wi-Fi access point.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:17.440]   The USB port on the Ford, you plug in one of those 3G USB
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.680]   cards into it.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.400]   And it actually adds Wi-Fi connectivity to your car, which
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.080]   is awfully cool as you're driving around
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.080]   to be able to tell the kids, use your iPads,
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.200]   to use your phone, to use to surf the net,
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.960]   to answer emails, not while you're driving, please.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.400]   But for the passengers, it's really fantastic.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:39.920]   Wi-Fi connectivity built into the car that put the antennas in.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.640]   So it works better than any hotspot or Wi-Fi.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.120]   It's throughout the car.
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.160]   Really fantastic.
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.160]   Up to five people can share that Wi-Fi connection.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:52.400]   Just so many reasons to take a look at Ford.
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.200]   We're just talking about that the other day.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.960]   This is a car company that has reinvented itself
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:00.440]   and is creating amazing products.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.360]   Amazing products.
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.760]   They're really a consumer electronics company now.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.400]   I drove a Ford Edge on vacation.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.080]   And I was playing with them my Ford Touch, and I just love it.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.240]   Things like-- it's little things.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.640]   It's kind of like Apple, the little things like--
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.840]   when you turn on the cruise control with a My Ford Touch,
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.480]   you actually set the miles per hour.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.360]   You're not just kind of looking at the Spadama saying,
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.440]   yeah, remember that.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.400]   You actually go--
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:20.880]   You actually go--
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.320]   I want to go speed limit.
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.160]   I'm going to go eight miles over the speed.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.800]   And it actually shows you what your--
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:26.240]   I just--
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.080]   It's little things like that I just love.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.080]   It was one of the things that I--
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.840]   it sounds like an odd thing to talk about.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.680]   But the GM bailout, I thought, was a little bit of an undermine
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.600]   for it, because Ford has been way ahead.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.240]   I mean, they weren't--
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.160]   Always have been way ahead.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.000]   They were way ahead.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:40.960]   They were able to--
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:41.840]   They never took any bailout money.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.960]   They didn't need to jump because they were already
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:45.800]   headed that.
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.960]   They were already thinking about those things.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.040]   By the way, the Wi-Fi is built, of course,
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.920]   it's a secure Wi-Fi hotspot.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.920]   I love that, too.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:53.680]   Because you're driving by.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.320]   You're driving by it.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.720]   Nobody can use your Wi-Fi.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.920]   If I imagine my iPhone grabbing onto people's Ford,
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:30:59.720]   does they drive by?
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:00.880]   I just think it's so great.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:01.720]   Take a look.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.560]   This is a great site if you're into tech.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:06.640]   Ford.com/technology.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.000]   You can see all the different things
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   that they're doing to make their cars the best performing,
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.920]   the smartest, the most safe and secure,
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.320]   and the most fun to drive.
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.880]   Ford.com/technology.
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:22.640]   We thank them for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.000]   So we've all done-- and I'm not even
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.100]   We're gonna talk about it, the silly Siri commands,
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:29.740]   but I thought it'd be fun to ask each of you
[00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:31.060]   how you use Siri.
[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:33.240]   We already know you use it for text messages, Alex.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.080]   - And emails.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:34.900]   - And emails.
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.840]   - And blog posts, well I mean.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:38.940]   - So you're using the dictation.
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:39.800]   - The dictation it works,
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.320]   - It's just like dragon.
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:46.060]   The thing is that it's, and because I'm well-trained on it,
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:47.340]   I mean because I've been using dragon,
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:49.620]   I sit there and go, okay blood, blood, blood, blood,
[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:51.460]   blood, blood, blood, blood period.
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.620]   - Are there things that you are disappointed with?
[00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.460]   - Yeah.
[00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.640]   - Well, the funny thing is given that Twitter
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.640]   isn't incorporated, you know, what I can't do
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:03.600]   is go tweet this, and I can't, and it won't do that yet,
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.800]   and I'm not, we do know the trick, by the way,
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.640]   you don't have to text us, 404-044,
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.240]   but you can't call it Twitter apparently,
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.440]   or it will get mad at you.
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.280]   - Yeah, it won't do it.
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.280]   - You have to say Mr. Tweet, something else.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.120]   - Or something.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.640]   - So it is kind of, I felt like that was kind of an odd thing.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.320]   - Tell Mr. Tweet, I'm doing Mac Break Weekly,
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.440]   then it'll tweet for you.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.280]   - Right.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.180]   - And it said, the other thing that bothers me a bit
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:28.820]   is the whole process of it cutting me off,
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.320]   you know, so if I don't, if I'm doing it,
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.300]   like if I get a text message and I go respond,
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:34.460]   and then I say whatever I'm gonna say,
[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:38.200]   if I wait for a second to think about what I was gonna say,
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.040]   she cuts me off.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:39.880]   - Yeah, and puts it in there,
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:40.720]   and then it's a bit of a,
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.300]   I don't have to fix that.
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.380]   - But it doesn't do that with a keyboard deck.
[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:45.220]   - No, not with a keyboard.
[00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:46.540]   I'll sit there and wait until you're done.
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:47.740]   - Andy, your favorite feature,
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:50.100]   how have you been using Siri?
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:53.500]   - I love the way that you can just use it incidentally.
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.140]   Again, it's right there next to my desk,
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.580]   and anytime there's something that,
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.820]   it's just a quick question, like a math problem or,
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.380]   what's the current weather someplace,
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.580]   or even a quick web search that Wolf Malefra
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.300]   is probably going to be able to find for me.
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:10.180]   That's the sort of incidental use.
[00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.820]   And also, there's the reminder system.
[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:15.540]   I never used really a to-do list of a reminder,
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:17.540]   because it's just never been this handy.
[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:22.540]   It's always been way too analog a thing in my head.
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:23.420]   I just want, oh, just remember,
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:25.460]   the next time I met Home Depot, pick up light bulbs.
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.820]   I don't want to open the task manager,
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:29.780]   okay, add the personal items list.
[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:32.060]   Okay, now what's the context of,
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:33.220]   is this a home thing?
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:35.620]   Is it a, I just simply remind me to,
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:36.860]   remind me to pick up light bulbs
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.980]   next time I met Home Depot, it's done.
[00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:39.820]   - Yeah.
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:40.660]   - Yeah.
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:41.580]   - Any disappointments,
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:44.420]   any thing you'd like to see change or improve?
[00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:47.700]   - The only disappointment is that it's,
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:51.820]   it's not to the point where it always works the way
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:52.780]   that you think it will,
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:56.380]   and it will never work the way you don't think it will.
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:59.260]   The great thing about most iPhone stuff and most Mac stuff
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:00.900]   is that it really is consistent.
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:03.420]   If there isn't a feature, then it just doesn't,
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:04.860]   the only thing that really don't work are the features
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.140]   that they don't put in.
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:08.180]   So there are times when I'll pick up Siri,
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:10.580]   and I'll activate Siri, thinking that,
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:13.020]   of course, it's going to be able to find out,
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.700]   tell me what the spot price of silver is today,
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:19.220]   but I had to figure out the right way to ask that question,
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:21.820]   to make sure it was not going to be a web search.
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:25.060]   Then it really is, it's, I don't know whether that's a case
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:28.380]   of there's so much AI involved that it really is
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:31.420]   like talking to a person where you might,
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:33.220]   you might be able to tell somebody that you know
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:35.140]   for about 10 weeks,
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:37.220]   oh, give me that blue thing that we always use
[00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:38.420]   when we cook steak,
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.020]   and they'll know exactly what you're talking about.
[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:42.460]   It's actually more efficient than go to the third cupboard,
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:43.300]   look for the third shelf,
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.460]   look for the implement that has the three
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:45.860]   like sort of raised grill time,
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.220]   so on it bring it over.
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:49.700]   - I think it'll work. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:52.820]   - I, Ken, Mac OS, Ken,
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.180]   your power, well, you're not using Siri,
[00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:56.180]   I guess you're left out of this.
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:58.020]   - I'm using it to hate my iPhone 4.
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:59.580]   (laughing)
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.580]   - One of the interesting things, by the way,
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:03.380]   that I got a lot of comments on is a lot of people
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:04.980]   that I've created from the iPhone 4,
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:08.820]   to the iPhone 4S, between Gazelle and other things,
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:10.380]   they got almost the same amount of money back
[00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:11.220]   for their iPhone 4.
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.260]   - Gazelle, pretty much get you the 200 bucks.
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.100]   - It was almost, it was like a $50,
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:16.580]   or some of them made a profit.
[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:19.660]   - Which really reflects the continued perceived value
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:21.620]   of the iPhone 4 itself.
[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:22.980]   They couldn't give you that kind of money
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:24.700]   if they couldn't sell it for that kind of money.
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:27.380]   So that's actually good news.
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:30.300]   These are phones that are very desirable, apparently,
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.460]   and even the iPhone 4 still has some value,
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:36.260]   although I don't know how much longer it will.
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:37.500]   I like the fact that you can,
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.500]   instead of pressing the button,
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.140]   you can hold, when you've got the screen on,
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:41.700]   you can hold Siri up.
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.820]   Here's it, this is a funny, let me,
[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:45.660]   this is a Siri-- - This is a great video.
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:46.500]   - Let's play this video,
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:47.860]   just to give people a sense of Siri,
[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:50.020]   if you haven't seen this, it's from MacMost.
[00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:52.020]   - Hello Siri.
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:55.820]   Hi, master.
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.260]   - You can tell it to call you whatever you want.
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:58.100]   - How are you doing?
[00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:58.940]   - I'm doing you.
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:00.220]   - I'm gorgeous.
[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:01.060]   - I am well.
[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:03.500]   Testing.
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.820]   Is this thing on?
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:08.140]   (laughing)
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.340]   Do you know any jokes?
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:11.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:13.540]   Two iPhones walk into a bar.
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:17.300]   - I don't wonder if that's a little nod to Gizmo.
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:18.140]   - Testing.
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:21.380]   - I can hear you.
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.700]   - Tell me a joke.
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:26.740]   - By the way, most of these can't answers.
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:28.220]   - I always forget the arch line.
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.060]   - Several.
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:29.900]   - Yeah.
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.060]   - What is the meaning of life?
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:33.660]   - It is not like references to how.
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.260]   - Life, the condition that distinguishes animals
[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.340]   and plants from the organic matter.
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:38.500]   - She'll also answer 42.
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.260]   - Testing the capacity for growth,
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:41.980]   reproduction, functional computing.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.180]   - She says she makes some funny jokes too about writing
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:45.980]   a long play with no meaning.
[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:46.900]   - Tell me a joke.
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:51.900]   - Master, I don't really know any good joke.
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.060]   - I don't like being called master.
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:53.900]   - I'm not.
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:54.740]   - I'm not.
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:55.580]   - I'm not.
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:56.420]   - You say full-man shoot.
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:57.260]   - What is the meaning of life?
[00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:58.100]   It's funny.
[00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:00.180]   - To think about questions like this.
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:02.220]   Knock, knock.
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.900]   - I asked her to open the pot and bring doors.
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:04.740]   - Yeah.
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:05.580]   - She said it was very essential.
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.420]   - Knock, knock.
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:07.260]   - Yes, to ask it intelligently.
[00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.100]   - Who was there?
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:09.780]   - Master.
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:12.220]   - Master who?
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:16.020]   - Master, I don't do not knock jokes.
[00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:18.780]   - What is the meaning of life?
[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:21.460]   - 42.
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:22.820]   - Ah, there you go.
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:23.660]   - Testing.
[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:28.060]   - You're coming through loud and clear.
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:30.900]   - What is the meaning of life?
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.100]   - You get the idea.
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:34.780]   - I think we've all seen these.
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:35.420]   - I think we've all seen these.
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:36.380]   - Yes, it's chocolate.
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:37.420]   - Many, many times.
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:39.340]   But this is a good eight minute video,
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:43.620]   which I will not play all of if you want to see it.
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:46.620]   What do you have your iPhone 4s call you?
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:48.060]   What does Siri call you, Andy?
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:50.260]   - I'm sticking with Andy.
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:51.100]   - Really?
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:54.020]   - I don't feel as though I needed ananimate object
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:56.740]   to use vanglorious terminology to inflate my ego.
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.460]   - Apparently Alex and I do.
[00:37:58.460 --> 00:37:59.300]   At least I do.
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:02.620]   - It's more like, it's probably,
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:04.780]   I don't want anyone to overhear me saying,
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:08.420]   "Lord and not go, master of all he surveys.
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:09.260]   "Creator of world."
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:10.900]   - There's the negative.
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:11.740]   There's the negative.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:14.180]   And you can see what it does on your contact card
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:15.300]   on the iPhone.
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.220]   It actually puts in quotes below your name,
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.940]   the name you've chosen.
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:22.220]   And so you see it says, "Leo, gorgeous quote."
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:23.060]   So I'm gonna have to change that.
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.740]   - I'm gonna have to use it by my Klingon name.
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.540]   (laughing)
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:29.380]   - (speaking foreign language)
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:32.860]   - If you had an iPhone 4s, Ken,
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:34.700]   what would you have Siri call you?
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:35.540]   - I don't know.
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.700]   I'm sort of stumped now.
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:38.860]   (laughing)
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:39.700]   - Probably some kind of,
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:41.060]   it'd probably be some kind of superhero,
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:42.740]   either that or reach back to mythology.
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:43.580]   I don't know which.
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:44.580]   Not Zeus.
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:45.860]   - Is Zeus's dad?
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:47.340]   - Zeus's dad, Thor?
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:48.180]   I don't know.
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.740]   - No. - That's a whole different
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:51.820]   - That's a whole different galaxy.
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:52.980]   - That's a different mythology.
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:53.980]   - Did Zeus have a dad?
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:55.740]   I thought he was the father of all things.
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:57.740]   - Well no, there were, I mean, weren't the Titans.
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:58.580]   - Wait a minute.
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:38:59.420]   - You know who's gonna know?
[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:00.260]   - Right?
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:01.100]   - What am I thinking?
[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.940]   - I think he would know that.
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:02.780]   - Yes.
[00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:04.900]   - Who is Zeus's dad?
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:07.780]   If you ask it, who's your daddy?
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:09.420]   It gives you some funny answers.
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.460]   No.
[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:12.300]   - I don't know who this is.
[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:13.380]   - I think it was Chronos actually.
[00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:15.380]   I think Chronos was the father of Tum.
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:16.220]   - Yeah.
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.740]   - Charimas faster than Siri.
[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:21.660]   Who is Zeus's dad?
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.820]   It said, I don't know who is his dad.
[00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.300]   - I don't know who this Zeus's father is.
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:30.100]   - Oh well, Ned just doesn't want to know Zeus.
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:30.940]   - Just think about how powerful,
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:33.100]   how powerful Siri would be if it was connected
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:35.260]   to something like the Mechanical Turk.
[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:36.740]   Where there was some sort of algorithm
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:39.540]   that sort of went through some sort of system,
[00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:42.100]   kind of like the poll the audience on,
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.300]   who wants to be a millionaire,
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.020]   where it goes out on the list of anybody
[00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:47.500]   who gets like one penny for every correct answer.
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:51.340]   It will feed back, if it gets like X number of answers
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:53.340]   that are agreed upon by random people,
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:54.540]   figures out that, okay,
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:56.580]   then I bet that that is the correct answer to Zeus's dad.
[00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:58.780]   But it'll say, according to them,
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.020]   according to a bunch of random strangers.
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:02.940]   - This is why an SDK is important.
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:04.300]   This is why Apple,
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.060]   it's not traditionally how Apple does things,
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.940]   but it would love it if Apple would open this up
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:10.740]   so that you could in fact have an app, for instance,
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.060]   it would be a Mechanical Turk app,
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:13.940]   or you could even tell Siri,
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.780]   you can't even launch apps with Siri right now,
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:17.180]   which is kind of a...
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:18.980]   - I think I just really hear it.
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:21.660]   - I think there's a psychological aspect here,
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:24.100]   that we all know that Siri is an AI,
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:25.020]   it's just a piece of software,
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.420]   it's a nice feature on a phone,
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:28.460]   but it really plugs into that part of our brain
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:31.220]   that recognizes a specific personality
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.220]   and how we trust that one person
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.100]   and how we communicate with that one person.
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.660]   And I think this is a case where we really do need
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:41.340]   a curation so that things that Siri can say back
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:42.660]   and answers that they can provide
[00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:44.740]   are never really variable,
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:45.740]   that they're consistent,
[00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:47.980]   and that they're basically being funneled through,
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:49.580]   even if it's just one copy that decides
[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:51.780]   that we're gonna trust these three sources
[00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:52.940]   for navigation information,
[00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:55.460]   we're gonna trust these four sources
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:56.780]   for movie information,
[00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:58.940]   or movie show times and stuff like that.
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:01.940]   So I'm not sure if they were free for all API,
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.180]   where I'm suddenly getting answers
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:07.020]   from the novelty Valley Girls Speak generator
[00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:12.020]   on what's the safe cooking temperature for a steak?
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:14.300]   Oh my God, I think it must be like 100 degrees or something.
[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:15.140]   - Oh my God.
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:15.980]   - Yeah.
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:16.820]   - And I think that also,
[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:18.640]   I think that one of the things that Apple
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:22.420]   has consistently done is do things very slowly.
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:23.700]   They introduce a new feature
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:26.420]   and then they're gonna let it stabilize
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:27.380]   and figure it out.
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:29.140]   I mean, we didn't have applications on our iPhone
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:30.140]   when we first got it,
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:32.060]   other than the ones that Apple gave us.
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:33.900]   And then they slowly open that up
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:35.300]   and they slowly open these things up
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:37.140]   in a way that they can control it
[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:41.500]   and try to maintain some kind of quality assurances.
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:43.780]   And so I think that what we're seeing right now
[00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:46.740]   is a very, very, very early version of Siri.
[00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:49.980]   I think this is gonna get much bigger and much more complex.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:51.140]   - Plus if we buy the idea
[00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:53.820]   that this could actually be where Apple is hoping to
[00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:55.380]   head things not just for the iPhone,
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:57.420]   but for everything else that they do.
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:59.220]   I mean, building that trust.
[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:01.540]   I mean, getting it to a point where people are very comfortable
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:03.980]   with it and even people who don't have an iPhone for us
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:04.820]   like myself,
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:07.580]   I mean, I know from what everybody has said so far
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:09.220]   that it becomes a very useful, very, you know,
[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:11.580]   integral part of the way that they're using their phones.
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:14.340]   And so that's gonna be a great keynote when they say,
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:18.300]   and finally, all of that that you know with Siri
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:21.020]   on your iPhone is now available on your iPad
[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:22.700]   or is now available on your Mac.
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:23.540]   - Or now available.
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:24.740]   - Or now available in your fridge.
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:28.300]   I mean, it feels like this is the beginning of,
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:31.140]   this is the way that they have built
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:32.460]   sort of the iTunes ecosystem
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:34.220]   and the ecosystem that they've built
[00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:35.180]   over the past few years.
[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:37.340]   This is the first time that we're gonna see Siri,
[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:40.740]   but you're not gonna have to have an iPhone to use Siri.
[00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.780]   - Well, and you might not even know when you're gonna guess,
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:44.660]   but next couple of years maybe?
[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.220]   - You might not even need an Apple product
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:48.620]   'cause you've got to believe that everybody
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:51.940]   and their brother is immediately jumping on this bandwagon.
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:54.220]   In fact, Microsoft even before this had announced
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:57.380]   an Xbox TV application that let you talk to your TV
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:58.780]   through Microsoft Connect.
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:00.180]   - I wouldn't be surprised if Apple,
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:03.260]   the Apple TV3 has Siri built into it.
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:04.660]   - You still believe in that TV?
[00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:05.500]   - No, no, no, I'm talking about the TV.
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:06.340]   - Oh, the TV thing.
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:07.580]   - Even if you just have a little box.
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:08.820]   - And don't you think now we're gonna,
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:11.860]   tonight we're gonna cover Google's Nexus Prime,
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:13.300]   Samsung's Nexus Prime announcement,
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.940]   Google's Ice Cream Sandwich announcement.
[00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:18.300]   In fact, if you want, if you're interested in that,
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.700]   we'll be doing that tonight at 5.30?
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:21.620]   - 7PM.
[00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:23.860]   - 7PM Pacific Time.
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:26.340]   - With you all about Android team, Jason Howell,
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:29.540]   Eileen Rivera and Gina Trepani will join them,
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:31.220]   covering that 'cause that is gonna be streamed live.
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:32.860]   And so one thing that's been interesting
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:35.740]   is there's been precious little about Ice Cream Sandwich.
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:38.860]   And wouldn't it be interesting if Google,
[00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:41.620]   which already has this voice command feature
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.060]   came up with something similar to Siri?
[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:44.380]   I wouldn't be surprised at all.
[00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:48.780]   They have a very large active voice recognition team.
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:50.140]   They have a huge data set.
[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:52.100]   This is one thing Mike Elgin mentioned.
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:53.380]   He said, "You're gonna love Siri,
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.940]   but you're gonna be buying it from Google soon
[00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:58.340]   because Google has more data about us
[00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.100]   and what we do even than Apple."
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:01.540]   - Well, I think it just depends on where Apple,
[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:02.700]   where they're sourcing it.
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:04.420]   If they're sourcing it, which we think
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:05.860]   that they're sorted from nuance,
[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:06.700]   if Apple has sourcing it from the one.
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:07.540]   - That's the dictation.
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:08.700]   - nuance is very good.
[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:09.860]   - Yeah, 20 years of experience.
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:11.220]   - Yeah, well, and you know,
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.980]   the guy who runs Google's effort started nuance.
[00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:14.820]   - Okay, there you go.
[00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:17.100]   - So it's not that Google is out in the cold
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:19.140]   and they have a large data set of voices
[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:21.740]   that they've been collecting for a long time.
[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:22.580]   - Right.
[00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:25.420]   - So, but more importantly, I think that what makes Siri
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:28.460]   intelligent is the database of information behind it there.
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:29.900]   I think Apple was brilliant,
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:32.740]   brilliant to enlist Wolfram Alpha.
[00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:34.180]   Because that's when you can say,
[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:36.580]   you know, what is split my bill four ways
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:37.980]   and add a 15% tip.
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:39.660]   And Siri doesn't know that,
[00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:42.100]   but Siri asks Wolfram Alpha and you get the answer
[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:43.820]   and it's fantastic.
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:44.660]   - Yeah.
[00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:46.820]   - Yeah, it's incredible the way that it organizes
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:48.340]   the information that it feeds back to you.
[00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:49.900]   At Comic Con, I was asking questions like,
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:51.380]   who is Green Lantern?
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:53.100]   And it's not smart enough to say,
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:56.500]   oh, well, Green Lantern has been at various eras,
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:58.820]   Hal Jordan, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:02.340]   But the table information will have in line number two,
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:04.140]   the names that have been associated with that.
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:05.820]   It's just really uncanny the way it works.
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:06.660]   - Yeah.
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:10.380]   I think that everybody agrees that this is,
[00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:11.220]   maybe not.
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:14.500]   Let me pose this and let you agree or disagree.
[00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:16.180]   This is, we will look back and say,
[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:18.820]   this is when we started talking to computers
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:19.820]   and they started talking back.
[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:21.060]   - And people will be frustrated because they'll say
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.020]   that of course Google's been doing this for the last,
[00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:24.340]   you know, the Android has been doing this for the past.
[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:26.180]   - Justice, iPod wasn't the first MP3,
[00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:28.540]   Apple's iPhone wasn't the first smartphone,
[00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:30.060]   the Apple II wasn't the first computer.
[00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:31.420]   Of course, that's true.
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:33.540]   - Yeah, Google was pretty close.
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:34.540]   Google's, I don't think Apple doesn't,
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:36.420]   Apple doesn't really create new things
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:37.900]   that just make things that are sitting around
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:39.300]   work better. - Yeah.
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:40.940]   - It feels like that's a safe thing to say though,
[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:43.340]   because 4 million people started doing it this weekend.
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:44.180]   I mean, you're right,
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:45.500]   Google has been doing it for a while,
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:46.860]   other things have done it for a while,
[00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:49.380]   but 4 million people started doing this one thing
[00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:50.220]   this past weekend.
[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:51.060]   - Yeah, true.
[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:51.900]   - Truth is we've been prepped for this.
[00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:53.460]   I mean, we have been, for the last 40 years,
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:54.740]   we've been watching sci-fi shows
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:56.540]   where everyone's talking to their computers.
[00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:59.140]   - So as everybody knows, nothing happens.
[00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:01.660]   No new inventions happen in technology,
[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:03.660]   unless it happened in sci-fi first,
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:07.460]   because that's what inspires the engineers to make it happen.
[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:10.180]   I don't know what's going on with flying cars, but.
[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:11.020]   - Yeah.
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:12.660]   I was just disappointed to find out that Siri
[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:15.580]   doesn't have any joke response to T, oh great.
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:16.820]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:18.420]   We have tried all of those.
[00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.740]   - Yeah, at this point, everything's been tried.
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:23.140]   - Don't you think that the fact that she has
[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:24.740]   so many funny responses to stuff
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:26.940]   is part of what makes her personal?
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:28.660]   You know, like, there's something about that
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.460]   that really gets you attached to,
[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:35.180]   it makes her appear real, in an odd way.
[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:37.220]   - It was not a throw away thing.
[00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:38.540]   I think it was carefully calculated
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:40.820]   to get you used to talking to her.
[00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:41.660]   - Yeah.
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:43.980]   Also, it patches into that thing I was saying earlier
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:45.980]   about how you really do identify it as a,
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:47.780]   it hooks into that software inside your brain
[00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:49.500]   that says, here's what, here's the skills I use
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:50.820]   when I'm talking to a person,
[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:52.780]   because there was, when I was testing,
[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:55.500]   when I was using it the other day,
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:57.620]   it asked for clarification.
[00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:00.020]   I said schedule something, something for someday.
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:02.140]   I said, okay, for what day is that?
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.740]   And I found myself saying, sorry, Tuesday.
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:07.540]   I just said, I'm sorry to a piece of software.
[00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:09.420]   Just because that's the sort of mode you're in.
[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:10.980]   - Yeah.
[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:12.980]   Well, very interesting.
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:14.340]   I'm sure we'll be talking a lot more
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:17.620]   and talking to Siri a lot more about this in the weeks
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:19.700]   about to come and who knows, maybe this time next year,
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.820]   Siri will be a regular on the show.
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:23.740]   (laughing)
[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:25.700]   - She's kind of, can you get Siri and Watson on
[00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:26.780]   for the same episode actually?
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:27.620]   - She sounds happy.
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:29.980]   - Have you switched over to iCloud?
[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:30.940]   - Well, let's talk about iCloud.
[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:33.460]   That's next on the show, our next topic.
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:34.860]   As we continue Mac Break Weekly,
[00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:37.060]   iCloud is a bigger story in some ways.
[00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:39.740]   I mean, it really is changing not just your phone,
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:42.740]   but all of your Macintosh stuff, including your iPad.
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:44.380]   - Took me all Saturday afternoon to do that change.
[00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:45.500]   - And it could be a nightmare.
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:47.420]   And your Macintosh systems.
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:48.300]   Let's talk about it.
[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:50.060]   Before we do, let's talk a little bit about Citrix
[00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:54.660]   and those folks who at GoToMeeting,
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:58.420]   it's really interesting to watch how Citrix is taking video.
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:01.780]   We've all gotten used to having video with Skype and so forth
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:05.300]   and put it into their online meeting program
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:07.700]   and made it such a great product.
[00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:09.140]   They're coming at it in the other direction.
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:13.300]   They started with screen sharing for online meetings.
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:14.980]   And then these other companies with telepresence
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:18.940]   like Cisco started in the other direction with cameras and so forth.
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:22.980]   But I have to say, for less than $50 a month,
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:24.900]   this is the best solution out there.
[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:27.140]   GoToMeeting has now added HD faces.
[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:30.980]   So you get both screen sharing, the best out there,
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:35.860]   online meeting audio, and now high def video.
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:38.220]   More and more of the people you meet with have their cameras
[00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:40.780]   right there on their computer, have that capability,
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:41.980]   have high speed bandwidth.
[00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:44.300]   And let me tell you, it works, it really works.
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.660]   And there's something about seeing the person you're meeting with.
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:48.380]   Yeah, it's great to see their desktop.
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:49.700]   Great for them to see your presentation,
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:52.580]   your meeting with a client, or perhaps a future client
[00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:54.140]   and showing them the presentation.
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:56.860]   But to see their physical reaction,
[00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:58.700]   whether their arms are folded and they're frowning
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:00.940]   or whether they're smiling, whether they're nodding along with you.
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:03.940]   And for them to see you, if you're in sales, huge.
[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:05.940]   If you're in training, huge.
[00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:07.940]   Even if you're just working with distributed colleagues
[00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:11.780]   all over the world as we often do nowadays, this is huge.
[00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:15.580]   All I can say now is that now you're going to have to actually put on a button up shirt.
[00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:18.180]   Yeah, you don't put on pants still, but you're not going to do it.
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:19.060]   No bed head anymore.
[00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:21.420]   You can't do the meetings with bed head anymore.
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:24.980]   I've been playing with it since before they released it
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:26.580]   and I was so impressed and now it's out
[00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:28.260]   and I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:30.060]   It's just fantastic.
[00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:31.260]   Visit the website.
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:36.860]   It's go2meeting, g-o-t-o-meeting.com.
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:40.660]   And let me see if I can find the URL.
[00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:41.660]   It probably says on the page.
[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:43.660]   Yeah, I'm using offer code MAC break.
[00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:44.660]   There you go.
[00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:47.620]   I think I'm in three or four of these Go2Meeting is a week.
[00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:49.020]   And it's just a lot of--
[00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:51.060]   I don't know how we'd get by without it.
[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:54.420]   And when you use other client stuff, even the expensive stuff from other companies,
[00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:56.300]   you realize this really is the best.
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:50:01.140]   Just click the orange try it free button and enter in MACBREAK MAC break
[00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:03.740]   as the offer code and you're good to go.
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:10.420]   Go2Meeting built in as part of the service, audio and now video with HD faces.
[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:13.220]   It's just fantastic.
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:16.420]   By the way, yes, of course it works great on Mac, on
[00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:22.260]   a line, on Windows, iPhone, works with Safari, works with Chrome.
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:24.140]   Yeah, the iPad one's really cool.
[00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:27.140]   It's really neat to do it on an iPhone or an iPad and see the--
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.300]   that's just awesome.
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.700]   All right, let's talk about the cloud.
[00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:35.300]   iOS 5 has rolled out a week ago.
[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:37.140]   So people have had some time to have--
[00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:38.500]   play with it a little bit on there.
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:43.660]   Older iOS devices and now on the iPhone 4s.
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:45.500]   I love the notifications.
[00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:47.700]   Let's just talk about that first and we'll get to iCloud.
[00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:50.340]   Love the notifications.
[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:51.620]   Nothing hurts shattering.
[00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:55.140]   It's something Android's done for a while, but love it.
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:57.140]   I use them all the time and you spend a lot more time now,
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:01.700]   though tweaking your settings because I don't want to be told every time somebody
[00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:03.420]   wants to be my friend on Facebook.
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:05.020]   But I do want to get them--
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:06.980]   you spend a lot of time messing with it.
[00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:08.580]   But once you got it set up, I think it's really great.
[00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:11.540]   It was like I finally broke down because I only had one or two machines online.
[00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:13.540]   So at home, I started getting all the machines--
[00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:17.700]   my iPhones and iPad and everything else turned into all Saturday afternoon
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:18.620]   of getting all the notifications.
[00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:19.340]   Well, that's the iCloud app.
[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:22.340]   Getting it in an iCloud all sorted out and getting it all working.
[00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:25.540]   I still don't think I have it all sorted out.
[00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:29.940]   Did you go somewhere and read something to help you do this?
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:33.980]   No, I just kind of barrel through it and figure it if I lose some contacts.
[00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:35.940]   If they're in there, important, I'll get them later.
[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:36.940]   I mean, I have to--
[00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:37.940]   Did you lose any contacts?
[00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:38.620]   I didn't lose any.
[00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:39.540]   I always hit merge.
[00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:41.020]   I never hit replace or anything else.
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:42.020]   I always hit merge, merge, merge.
[00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:45.660]   So what I end up with is six versions of the same person, which I have to then go back
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:47.580]   and clean up rather than losing one.
[00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:49.020]   My wife did something else.
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:56.300]   I don't know what it was, but she lost a bunch of contacts in the process of syncing.
[00:51:56.300 --> 00:52:01.060]   I think the big thing with iCloud at least that I was excited about is I opened up my
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:04.060]   iPad and I went to videos and suddenly all these--
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:09.140]   I had bought over the last, I don't know how many years, I bought lots of TV shows that
[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:12.900]   I-- you get up too much space, you put them on some hard drive, you forget about them
[00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:15.300]   or whatever, and suddenly they were all in one place.
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:16.300]   That's cool.
[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:18.460]   They all just showed up and he's like, would you like to download that one that you bought?
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:19.460]   Right.
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:20.460]   Three years ago or four years ago?
[00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:21.940]   So it's pretty amazing.
[00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:23.220]   Now, how about data?
[00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:27.020]   Is my data just going to propagate-- you were talking about pictures that you're--
[00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:29.340]   Isabella had taken up the ceiling.
[00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:33.060]   So that is the one thing about-- so the biggest thing-- and this is the thing that I asked
[00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:36.500]   people what they thought of the iCloud as well on my Twitter account and the number
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:39.900]   one complaint about iCloud is not losing your data, it's not anything else, it's the
[00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:44.140]   fact that you can't individually delete images from your photo stream.
[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:46.580]   Once you turn that feature on, you don't have to turn that feature on.
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:47.580]   You don't have to turn the photo--
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:49.940]   But of course you want to because it's like two pictures.
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:56.180]   So I turned it on on my laptops and on my computer and my iPhone and iPad and then my--
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:53:01.700]   I left my iPad over at my-- in the living room and my daughter picked it up and I have
[00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:07.180]   40 photos of the ceiling and they're propagated within minutes to all of my machines.
[00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:08.180]   Wow.
[00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:11.180]   And there's no way to delete them other than resetting the photo stream.
[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:13.020]   You know, the whole photo stream.
[00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:15.660]   And so just, you know, they're just-- and it's fine, this is the last thousand photos,
[00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:17.300]   it'll slowly propagate its way out.
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:21.220]   But it's just-- it's a-- that has been the number one complaint that I saw on my-- you
[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:26.420]   know, when I was asking people on my Twitter stream or my Twitter feed asking them what
[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:27.420]   they--
[00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:29.220]   So there's some granularity.
[00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:33.980]   On the iPhone itself you can have iCloud copy mail, contacts, calendars.
[00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:36.580]   Notice I use Google so I turned that off.
[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:37.740]   I'm not sure that's the right thing to do.
[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:39.580]   I just didn't want to lose everything.
[00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:40.860]   I did turn on reminders.
[00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:42.780]   I did turn on bookmarks and notes.
[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:45.060]   And here's the photo stream setting.
[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:48.060]   And it might be easier for me because I don't use Google for my contacts.
[00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:49.060]   So I don't--
[00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:50.060]   So I--
[00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:51.060]   Maybe yes, maybe no, I don't know.
[00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:52.060]   I mean--
[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:53.060]   Right.
[00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:54.060]   I just heard--
[00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:55.060]   I also talked on data.
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:56.060]   Sorry.
[00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:57.060]   And then find my iPhone.
[00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:58.540]   All of those are nice features.
[00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:00.540]   Yeah, I didn't turn everything on.
[00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:03.540]   Did you see that story about the find my friend?
[00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.020]   Yeah, we'll talk about that in a second.
[00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:07.020]   There is-- that is one potential flaw.
[00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:08.020]   You know, you don't need that.
[00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:12.580]   It's like even just with the photo sharing feature, so many teenagers at so many parties
[00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:15.420]   are going to be so busted when they get home.
[00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:16.420]   Exactly.
[00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:18.420]   And the Apple TV screensaver in the living room--
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:19.420]   Oh my gosh.
[00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:23.420]   -- all kinds of like body shots and--
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:27.300]   I don't think I'm going to turn it on just for that.
[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:28.660]   I mean, well, not for that.
[00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:29.660]   But when I go--
[00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:31.780]   We know you're a party animal, absolutely.
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:35.540]   No, when I go to the store, though, I want to make sure that something's the right thing.
[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:38.900]   So I take a picture of it and I send it back to my girlfriend and say, is this what we're
[00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:39.900]   looking for?
[00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:40.900]   That's very useful.
[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:41.900]   I don't want that on my Apple TV.
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:42.900]   That's boring.
[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:46.220]   I mean, and also, since I've started using Instagram quite a bit over the past year, I'll
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:49.980]   take like five pictures of something and make sure that it looks exactly the way I want
[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:50.980]   to.
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:52.460]   And I'll usually go back and delete the other four.
[00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:55.380]   So I'm going to have five pictures of that plant on my TV for--
[00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:59.260]   Well, for the next thousand pictures.
[00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:02.580]   That's why an Apple Camera Plus becomes more useful because it has its own private photo
[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:03.580]   role.
[00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:05.060]   So you can use that for your snapshots.
[00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:08.220]   Then when there's something that's important enough, you want to photo stream it, then you
[00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:10.100]   just kick it into the picture's role.
[00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:11.100]   Clever.
[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:12.300]   That does make it more valuable.
[00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:13.300]   Yeah.
[00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:17.740]   Well, but that also sort of negates the ease of use for photo streaming.
[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:18.740]   Well, you can't--
[00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:19.740]   -- it's the problem.
[00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:20.740]   It's all or nothing.
[00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:21.740]   Yeah.
[00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:24.780]   Well, if you need the bone simple version, then you just do nothing.
[00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:28.540]   But if you do want to have some granularity, then at least there's a way around it.
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:33.940]   So pictures that you take in third party camera apps do not get stored in the same play.
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:34.940]   This is another thing.
[00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:35.940]   Well, Marco, our memory--
[00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:36.940]   It depends on what it is.
[00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:37.940]   It depends on what it is.
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:39.420]   It depends on how the app was put together.
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:40.420]   Yeah.
[00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:43.820]   So some apps use cache to store stuff, which is what each of the paper used to do.
[00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:48.180]   But now in iOS 5, that can be wiped out without notice.
[00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:52.820]   So then-- or you can store it in the app's documents, which is a store that is permanent
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:53.820]   but can get massive.
[00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:57.940]   And that's what Marco's concerned about, because that gets backed up.
[00:55:57.940 --> 00:56:05.180]   And so if you use most third party photo apps, I presume save the app not to the gallery,
[00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:09.740]   the standard photos gallery, but to their own documents folder.
[00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:11.420]   And then give you an option to export out.
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:13.100]   That's how CameraPlus works, Andy.
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:15.900]   Yeah, it has its own private photo roll.
[00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:17.820]   A lot of other camera apps work that way.
[00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:24.380]   And so stuff then you save from the private photo roll can then be exported to the regular
[00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:25.380]   photo roll.
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:28.220]   I will say it's a very interesting feature when you're talking about the stuff that
[00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:32.500]   we're seeing in New York, with the Occupy Wall Street and everything else in the past.
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:33.980]   And people try and take away people's cameras.
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:34.980]   It won't matter.
[00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:36.460]   Oh, and that is huge.
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:37.460]   That is huge.
[00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:43.180]   Those photos are streaming out immediately within seconds after you take the photos.
[00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:47.500]   From a press perspective, I think it's a really interesting opportunity.
[00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.500]   So it turned that on if you're going to be out there.
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:51.980]   You're going to be out there and you turn that on and make sure that it's uploading.
[00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:52.980]   Yeah.
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:53.980]   It's interesting.
[00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:58.140]   As soon as I saved a photo, it took it out of the film strip, out of the light box,
[00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:00.820]   because it's now part of, I guess, the standard photos.
[00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:03.420]   Well, we'll learn the camera roll.
[00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:04.820]   And I think there's two things that Apple can do.
[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:09.580]   What's the difference between a photo stream and a camera roll?
[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:11.380]   Your camera roll is what your camera actually took.
[00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:12.460]   And the photo stream is what's in it.
[00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:13.460]   So the camera roll.
[00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:15.220]   This is what other cameras can I get to?
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:16.220]   Everything.
[00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:19.300]   So you put pictures with your iPad or you put things in the iPhone or whatever into your
[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:20.300]   photo stream.
[00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:23.220]   So the camera roll is a subset of photo stream.
[00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:24.380]   Photo stream is everything.
[00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:26.300]   It's all the different devices.
[00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:27.740]   It's anything on that.
[00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:30.100]   So the camera roll is what that camera took.
[00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:34.940]   The photo stream is the collective, you know, it includes what's on the camera roll.
[00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:35.940]   It looks like.
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:36.940]   Exactly.
[00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:39.500]   It's everything you took with your photo stream turned on or off.
[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:43.180]   And with any device that's connected to that, to your user.
[00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:47.260]   So if you're taking pictures with your iPad, it'll show up on your iPhone in the photo
[00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:48.580]   stream, but it won't show up on the camera roll.
[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:49.660]   I don't use ICal.
[00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:50.660]   I use BusyCal.
[00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:59.020]   Fortunately, BusyCal put a big, long document on how to upgrade to iCloud.
[00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:00.020]   And it's in this.
[00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:01.020]   I mean, you have to do this.
[00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:02.020]   This is crazy.
[00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:05.820]   Well, and I think this is actually one of the things that the lock that Apple is really
[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:13.020]   getting on on folks is that if you're not, if you don't stay inside the Apple, you know,
[00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:15.020]   I like BusyCal so much better.
[00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:17.900]   I'm just saying if you don't, there's a price.
[00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:19.300]   Fortunately, they have been at one place.
[00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:20.300]   I think the age is the price.
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:21.300]   Yeah.
[00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:22.300]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:25.020]   I see I boy, I resist that.
[00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:26.020]   And you're right.
[00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:29.140]   Everything's better if you just give up and give in.
[00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:30.820]   I've kind of just given in.
[00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:33.220]   Because I just like, because I always know that every time there's an upgrade, it's
[00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:35.020]   going to be hard for me to move from one to the other.
[00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:37.580]   It's, you know, and I'm just like, let go and let Steve.
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:40.940]   This isn't well, just that these aren't things that are important enough in my life for me
[00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:41.940]   to customize.
[00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:42.940]   I think that's the issue.
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:43.940]   Yeah.
[00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:45.100]   And I really like Google Calendar.
[00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:47.940]   That's why I use BusyCal because it syncs with that.
[00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:48.940]   Mm-hmm.
[00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:49.940]   Oh boy.
[00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:52.300]   I feel bad for you now.
[00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:55.220]   I don't even, you don't even know me and I feel bad for you.
[00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:56.220]   No, I don't know you.
[00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:57.220]   I don't know you.
[00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:58.220]   And I hate you.
[00:58:58.220 --> 00:58:59.220]   Completely crestfall analysis.
[00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:00.220]   I'm so sad.
[00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:04.100]   But if you look at things like this, like adding, adding, scheduling, everything else
[00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:06.780]   is Siri going to work for instance with BusyCal.
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:09.900]   You know, if you're, if you want to be adding schedules into your calendar.
[00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:13.620]   That's why when you saw when I first opened up my computer, I got a mobile me, that old
[00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:14.620]   mobile me sink.
[00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:16.620]   You want to see, because you have to do that.
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:18.020]   So the Siri, because you're right.
[00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:19.020]   I'm making appointments.
[00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:20.980]   They're showing up here, but they're not showing up there.
[00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:21.980]   And this is right.
[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:26.180]   So maybe I should just give up and stop using these third party apps and just live with
[00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:28.220]   Apple in the Apple world.
[00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:29.220]   Just saying.
[00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:30.220]   Come to the wall garden.
[00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:31.220]   They come to the wall.
[00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:32.220]   Yeah.
[00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:33.220]   Vegetables and all kinds of things.
[00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:34.220]   Oh.
[00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:35.220]   He's okay.
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:36.220]   Well, let me ask the question.
[00:59:36.220 --> 00:59:38.020]   Is I Cal the best calendar?
[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:39.020]   No.
[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:40.780]   It's just integrated with the address book.
[00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:41.780]   The best.
[00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:43.780]   I do like the new Western look.
[00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:45.780]   Leather stitching.
[00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:46.780]   Yeah.
[00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:48.460]   I will say I hate me.
[00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:49.860]   I hate the new male.
[00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:50.860]   You do?
[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:51.860]   I hate it.
[00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:53.980]   But trying to do something else.
[00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:56.980]   I put on someone, someone, what was the one that's like a bird?
[00:59:56.980 --> 00:59:57.980]   I can't think of the name of it.
[00:59:57.980 --> 00:59:58.980]   Sparrow.
[00:59:58.980 --> 00:59:59.980]   I love Sparrow.
[00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:00.980]   Oh, I hate it.
[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:01.980]   But you can't.
[01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:02.980]   It was just the conversion would drove me crazy.
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:03.980]   Right.
[01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:08.540]   So, so the, but so I hate male, but I don't want to deal with the trying to get to something
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:09.540]   else.
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:10.540]   I think that's the issue.
[01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:14.300]   And so, but, but yeah, it is one of those things like the new layout that they have
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:18.280]   is just impossible for me to figure out what who emailed me when I don't like threaded
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.280]   comment.
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:21.180]   I don't like threaded wall gardens.
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:25.340]   It's feeling like Facebook to me where not only is it a walled garden, but there's all
[01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:28.260]   sorts of stuff happening that I don't understand.
[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:29.700]   And it's, and it's happening to me.
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:33.500]   And my photos are showing up in places and things are sinking and I don't understand
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:34.500]   it.
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:40.700]   And I have to think that that is not the experience Apple wants people to have.
[01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:43.940]   And isn't iCloud giving you that kind of that experience?
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:46.580]   Is this an, is this, is this inevitable?
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:48.500]   I think we're more, I think about the way we use it.
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:51.420]   I think that for the average person who's just turning it on and having it work, it's
[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:52.420]   just work.
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:54.740]   It just kind of, it just kind of, it's just, I was about to say, I think, I think that
[01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:58.060]   there are two different iCloud experiences, the people who have been migrating from mobile
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:02.420]   May as users like, of that's those services for the past three, four years.
[01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:06.100]   And the people who are just unboxing their first iPhone who have never used cloud services
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:07.260]   before.
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:10.620]   And they, people who think that it's quite wonderful that all the pictures they're taking
[01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:15.180]   on vacation are just landing on their laptops back home without, or I'm back home without
[01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:16.700]   having to do anything about it.
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:21.140]   But yeah, I mean, for people in the first group, it really is not, I'm, the first couple
[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:25.140]   of days was kind of a nightmare as various services were being split between mobile me
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:29.700]   and iCloud and you're wondering, well, why, so why are you asking me to switch from mobile
[01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:32.860]   me find my iPhone to iCloud, find my iPhone.
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:33.860]   It's the same thing.
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:34.860]   Both things find my iPhone.
[01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:35.860]   Right.
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:38.460]   And so I think we're all getting a taste of what it's like really to have an Android phone
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:41.340]   where it takes a couple of weeks before you get everything dialed in the way that you
[01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:42.340]   like it.
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:44.700]   And then it's smooth sailing after that, but it's the, it's a couple of weeks where you're
[01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:47.020]   like, what happens if I click this?
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:51.300]   Okay, box does awful things happen that I can't really understand right now?
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:52.300]   I think so.
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:54.980]   This does happen to normal people because I get calls on the radio show.
[01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:58.420]   For instance, I have two Apple accounts I'm using on my phone.
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:01.460]   I have a cloud account that's my me account.
[01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:04.620]   And then I also have the account that I use to buy stuff at the iTunes store.
[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.140]   They're not the same account.
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:11.580]   And initially, I, the iPhone and the iPad were just choking on this and I had to go back
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:12.580]   and finally I found it.
[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:17.140]   If I did it in this order, change settings this way, you can't have the both of them.
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:20.140]   Well, I think that that's kind of the power user thing, you know, like for me, I don't
[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:21.140]   think so.
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:24.460]   I think that that's unfortunately the kind of thing people accidentally do.
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:25.460]   Right.
[01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:29.380]   It's so easy to with the first time you set up an account with iTunes who not really
[01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:34.100]   understand all those years ago, what happens if you decided to create a brand new iTunes
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:35.100]   account?
[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:38.740]   And now this years later, this really is biting a lot of people on the butt.
[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:41.940]   And unfortunately, I'm really, really, I've always had separate accounts for a lot of
[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:42.940]   different things.
[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:47.740]   But all my personal stuff has always been tied to the same, to the same mobile me account.
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:53.140]   But yeah, there's just no acceptable solution to the problem of having multiple accounts.
[01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:59.060]   I think that merging all these different attempts that Apple made over the years to have any
[01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:03.380]   kind of a network service subscription model, I think that that's really something that
[01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:05.660]   Apple needed to fix and they didn't.
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:07.820]   But, and yeah, now we're stuck with it.
[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:12.620]   By the way, it's a little strange that the Find My iPhone now finds my desktop computers
[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:13.620]   as well.
[01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:16.100]   I guess if it's stolen, that's a good thing.
[01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:17.100]   Yeah.
[01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:18.660]   And for a laptop, that's a good thing.
[01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:21.140]   But I know exactly where my desktop computer is.
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:22.140]   It's in my house.
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:29.500]   You know that, you mean for me, for me, there have been many times when I have actually
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:32.580]   been happy to know where, you know, wish to anywhere my laptop was.
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:34.380]   Like do I know, is that any officers in my house?
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:35.380]   Right.
[01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:36.380]   Which way do I have to go to find it?
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:37.380]   And now I do.
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:38.380]   And I've done that with my iPhone.
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:40.740]   I'm like, should I keep on looking at it, looking for it here in the house or do I need
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:42.260]   to go somewhere else to find it?
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:44.260]   And knowing roughly where it is has been useful.
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:45.260]   It's kind of interesting.
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:46.260]   Yeah.
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:49.740]   If you, if you, you know, for laptop, it makes a lot of sense.
[01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:50.740]   Yeah.
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:55.540]   Which I think is where most, I don't know what the cross section is, but it seems like people
[01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:56.740]   are buying Apple devices now.
[01:03:56.740 --> 01:04:00.060]   I mean, these laptops, these little ones and the air and everything else.
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:04.740]   I think the portable Mac is a lot more popular.
[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:08.700]   I want to answer questions because we have so many of them coming through and we will
[01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:10.340]   do that.
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:13.380]   But I also don't want this show to be more than five hours long because that's, I have
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:15.740]   a pledge, a pledge.
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:19.140]   iOS 5 for the Apple TV.
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:20.140]   Yes.
[01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:22.020]   What's happening here?
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:25.460]   It's getting the iOS 5 treatment.
[01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:29.020]   According to the cult of Mac, they've added, huh?
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:30.020]   Hockey.
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:33.180]   It's all about hockey and Wall Street Journal.
[01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:36.500]   So by the way, the Wall Street Journal, if anyone here is watching from the Wall Street
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:43.420]   Journal, the, the video quality and the content quality is so low that I really, really need
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:47.780]   to, I'm not going to take fire who was working on it, but I'm saying, did something.
[01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:48.780]   Murdoch's got money.
[01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:50.380]   Something because it is 100 million.
[01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:51.940]   I'll fix it all up for you.
[01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:55.500]   From a quality perspective, how can they get the daily so right when it comes to like
[01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:56.500]   good content?
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.140]   Oh, the daily's got 50,000 subscribers though.
[01:04:58.140 --> 01:04:59.140]   That's the problem.
[01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:03.220]   But the thing is is the Wall Street Journal, the Wall Street Journal, the Wall Street Journal
[01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:04.860]   content, you should just take that.
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:07.780]   I mean, I know that Apple gave you that space, but you should take that, you turn that off
[01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:11.260]   until you can figure out how to do it right because I watched it for like 15 minutes and
[01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:12.260]   it was so painful.
[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:14.780]   I was like, you know, because I was just curious, like what are they going to do?
[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:17.540]   I was excited that they might do something useful to watch.
[01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:21.300]   And the people who are on there were so bad and the quality of the content was so bad.
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:23.700]   The framing was off, the quality was off.
[01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:25.700]   You're just like, they really put this on Apple TV.
[01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:26.700]   I mean, that's the whole thing.
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:28.300]   Apple TV is going to be specific.
[01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:31.260]   If they're going to be like specific, like we're only going to give these people access
[01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:34.980]   to the Apple TV, they should make sure that there's some kind of guarantee of quality
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:36.940]   because it's just horse poo.
[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:39.580]   There's also it's a live channel.
[01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:41.500]   I mean, which was the exciting thing about that.
[01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:44.180]   I mean, I'm excited about hockey because I'm excited about hockey.
[01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:45.540]   What was cool was hockey live.
[01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:46.540]   It's the hockey live.
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:47.540]   Yeah.
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:49.980]   Although I see the thing is anyway.
[01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:52.020]   NFL, we want NFL, not any NFL.
[01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:53.020]   NFL, NFL.
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:54.020]   I wonder what's the story.
[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:55.020]   Come on, please.
[01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:56.020]   Please.
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:59.220]   Like you can't throw a rock and you'll hit a TV playing the NFL.
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:00.220]   Come on.
[01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:05.820]   The thing is I watched, I tried to watch a little bit of the Wall Street Journal content.
[01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:06.820]   And there are two things.
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:08.220]   Well, there are two things wrong with it.
[01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:10.660]   First of all, it's not live for the time that it's live.
[01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:14.100]   So you turn it on and it says, hey, come back in three hours because then we've got something
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:15.100]   live on it.
[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:16.100]   It's a good schedule.
[01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:17.100]   That's good.
[01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:18.980]   And the other problem, as Alex points out, is the content.
[01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:19.980]   I was watching.
[01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:25.900]   I happened to catch one of the few minutes a day that the live content is actually live.
[01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:29.740]   And there was, and I don't want to insult this one person in particular.
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:30.740]   I don't know her name.
[01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:35.740]   There was like this probably somewhere between late '60s to mid '70s year old woman talking
[01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:39.260]   about how realistic the show to broke girls was.
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:41.100]   Okay.
[01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:44.140]   Already we're done, I think, because I don't turn to the Wall Street Journal for media
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:45.140]   reviews.
[01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:47.100]   And then if I am going to turn to the Wall Street Journal for media reviews, I'm going
[01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:51.540]   to have a hard time believing that somebody who's probably in her 70s who's writing for
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:56.540]   the Wall Street Journal's would know how realistic two broke girls is.
[01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:59.020]   So in that respect, it was really disappointing.
[01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:02.220]   Plus, I can hear somebody's high heels clapping as they were walking.
[01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:03.220]   No way.
[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:04.780]   We have that problem, too.
[01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:07.980]   I can help them with that.
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:13.380]   So what was exciting was to see them do sort of what I as I understand, and I don't have
[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:17.780]   a Roku box, but was to see them do what Roku has done where you've got channels, right?
[01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:25.580]   Because all they've had so far is like YouTube, Vimeo, the NBA, MLB, and then Netflix and the
[01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:27.500]   stuff that you can buy or rent from Apple.
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:28.500]   And podcasts.
[01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:29.500]   Yeah, right.
[01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:30.500]   And podcasts and both audio and video.
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:31.980]   And they've got the radio things as well.
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:36.900]   But as far as actual content that's being, it was the first thing that they did that actually
[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:40.580]   looked like it might even be sort of thinking about, "Hey, what is this whole cable thing
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:42.860]   about and how can we sort of tromp in on that?"
[01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:45.940]   You can't be a cord cutter if you can't get live.
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:48.300]   Or you can, but that's where it really starts to hurt people.
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:49.300]   That's the pain point.
[01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:50.300]   Yeah.
[01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:53.540]   Well, and I think that now that they're starting to do that, I mean, but I think like Twit.tv
[01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:55.300]   revision three, these are things that you're...
[01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:56.700]   We are streaming live on Roku.
[01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:57.700]   No, but I'm saying.
[01:07:57.700 --> 01:07:58.700]   We have some problems with it.
[01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:04.380]   I mean, look, this is all in nascent, and we have some issues with the HLS server that
[01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.060]   we are working on.
[01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:09.060]   So I think that in some degree, Apple might be saying, "Well, let's wait.
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:10.700]   Lismature is a little bit."
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:12.540]   We'll do more.
[01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:15.140]   I think having a channel store is a good idea.
[01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:16.140]   Yeah.
[01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:17.860]   And it can be like an app store.
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:19.340]   I think just a full app store.
[01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:20.860]   I'd love to see the app store.
[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:22.300]   That solves all of it, right?
[01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:23.300]   Yeah.
[01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:24.300]   Just buy the app.
[01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:25.300]   Yeah.
[01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:29.740]   No, I do like the screen mirroring over airplay with...
[01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:30.740]   Yeah.
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:33.500]   And you mirror the entire iPad, right?
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.500]   Everything, right?
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:35.500]   Yeah.
[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.660]   So no matter what's going on, you see your entire iPad.
[01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:38.660]   You don't have to...
[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:40.260]   You used to be able to hook up the HDMI cable.
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:41.260]   Now you can see the whole thing.
[01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:45.140]   And not only is that useful, I mean, it's really useful for business and for education.
[01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:46.140]   It's business.
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:51.180]   It means anybody can drop that up and just, you know, sync them quickly.
[01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:52.180]   Yeah.
[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:56.700]   I'm seeing there's also content that you can't get on Apple TV that I mean, like I've got
[01:08:56.700 --> 01:09:00.060]   the LG Zira English app because sometimes I want to see news.
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:04.620]   So I turn on one of the five news channels on my cable, you know, and it's locked down
[01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:09.700]   Pittsburgh or it's something that has nothing to do with news and some special that they,
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:13.900]   you know, canned like two years ago that they're replaying because it's the middle of the night.
[01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:14.900]   And still I really want news.
[01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:18.220]   And so having access to that app and just being able to shoot it to my television is
[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:19.220]   actually pretty neat.
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:23.380]   LG Zira is definitely the best world news out there that isn't on cable TV.
[01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:27.740]   Well, it's interesting because no US cable company cable channel will ever be able to
[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:29.380]   do what LG Zira is doing.
[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:34.780]   And so it's going to end up being the international news channels that have a leg up on CNN and
[01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:36.580]   Fox and all the rest.
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:40.940]   Yeah, and there's also like crackle, which is that Sony's crackle.
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:42.380]   Yeah, Sony's crackle.
[01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:44.780]   Yeah, which I mean, has a couple of really neat shows on it.
[01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:47.980]   And you know, the easiest way to get it to my Apple TV is just to now hit the crackle
[01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:49.460]   thing and go.
[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:55.260]   But so that Sunday was declared Steve Jobs Day in California and it was the same day
[01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:59.180]   that there was a super secret event at Stanford University.
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:05.540]   Very difficult to get into unless you were a major technology executive, the Clinton family,
[01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:08.660]   Nancy Pelosi was there.
[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:14.740]   Steve Jobs widow, Lorraine and his sister Mona, three of his kids spoke as did Larry
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:20.260]   Ellison and Johnny Ive.
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:24.540]   YouTube YouTube's a Bono performed.
[01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:26.180]   Joan Baez sang.
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:29.460]   She had dated Steve early in his life.
[01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:32.020]   Yo, Yo Ma, the cellist performed.
[01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:35.060]   Bono read his lyrics from an iPad.
[01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:38.940]   There will be a larger company Memorial tomorrow.
[01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:42.580]   I don't know if it is open to public, but I suspect not.
[01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:45.260]   I think this is where Apple employees only so far.
[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:50.500]   No public Memorial, although there have been public memorials, including the amazing Post-it
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:54.420]   notes Memorial at the Apple store.
[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:55.420]   So Germany?
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:56.420]   Yeah.
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:57.420]   Munich.
[01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:01.180]   There's actually a time lapse video of them making it.
[01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:05.580]   It's all with blue, green and yellow Post-it notes.
[01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:10.460]   It's that beautiful picture of Steve Jobs, which by the way, taken in 2006, was taken
[01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:11.980]   on film.
[01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:13.420]   I just learned.
[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:15.260]   Let's see.
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:16.260]   Yeah.
[01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:21.980]   Here's one Steve Jobs portrait made from MacBook parts.
[01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:22.980]   That one's kind of creepy looking.
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:23.980]   It's a little weird.
[01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:24.980]   It's a little gorgeous.
[01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:25.980]   It's nice, but it's a little bored.
[01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:26.980]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:27.980]   Yeah.
[01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:28.980]   That's from Georgia.
[01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:29.980]   Georgia.
[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:33.060]   They're really nice, like flash.
[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:36.220]   Ironically, it requires the use of flash memorial.
[01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:41.140]   That's sort of mosaic of all the online tributes that have been posted and all the significant
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:45.100]   YouTube videos and all the significant pictures I've been posted over the past few weeks.
[01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:50.140]   And the more you keep it active, the more of these things sort of fade in and the more
[01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:52.780]   defined the portrait gets.
[01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:56.380]   It's really pretty cool, especially as you keep mousing over and clicking on these videos
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:57.580]   and reading these things.
[01:11:57.580 --> 01:12:01.220]   This guy's doing it with salt, believe it or not.
[01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:03.660]   Can I go ahead and apologize now for saying that was creepy looking?
[01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:04.660]   It was very respectful.
[01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:05.660]   I'm sorry.
[01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:07.020]   It was respectful, but I know what you're saying.
[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:08.020]   It's boargy.
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:09.540]   It was machine parts.
[01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:13.980]   So it just made Steve look a little bit like a member of the Borg.
[01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:14.980]   I don't know.
[01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:16.340]   In some ways, all of this is a little odd.
[01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:21.500]   I think it comes from people who are really very talented and creative and they're deep
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:25.020]   respect and love for Apple.
[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:31.700]   You know, most of these creatives use Macintosh products and have since 1980s.
[01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:33.100]   And that's probably where a lot of that comes from.
[01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:35.740]   This is pretty amazing what this guy does with salt.
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:37.380]   Yeah, it is.
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:38.380]   Wow.
[01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:41.620]   Don't ever say that the artist is made by the tool after you see this, right?
[01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:42.620]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:44.620]   The guy has a piece of paper and some salt.
[01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:47.100]   A bit of portraits that I can do with Photoshop.
[01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:48.100]   That's pretty interesting.
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:50.020]   Yeah, but that's imported like gourmet salt.
[01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:51.020]   If I had that.
[01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:52.020]   Right, exactly.
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:53.020]   That was very special.
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:54.020]   That was very special.
[01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:55.020]   It's called the Elton Brown.
[01:12:55.020 --> 01:13:00.100]   Alright, we have a lot of questions that have come in or comments through your tool, the
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:06.300]   Pixel Core tool, Pixel Core dot, force dot com slash pixel core.
[01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:09.520]   Last chance to vote will take the highest voting questions.
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:11.420]   We had over 200 I think.
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:12.420]   Wow, that's great.
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:14.620]   Sign in and we've had over 100 questions.
[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:17.740]   And we will get to some of those and also our picks which I'm going to ask everybody
[01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:22.760]   to keep kind of short because that's usually where we end up blowing out the shows, the
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:25.000]   right picks because we love our picks.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.360]   I'll do mine in less than a minute.
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:28.360]   Okay.
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:31.520]   But first, let me give you a little plug for audible dot com.
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:37.160]   If you're not already listening to audio books, I got to tell you audible is fantastic.
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:38.640]   I am an audible subscriber.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:39.640]   Habits is 2000.
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:43.360]   I have over 500 books in my library, all of which I can listen to on my iPhone or my
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:46.560]   Android phone or my iPad just by launching the audible app.
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:48.160]   They're all there, which is really cool.
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:52.080]   Of course, you can download them and listen to them and you know, in the iPod, they work
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:56.760]   on all iPods and almost all music players, including Yes, the Zoom.
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:04.880]   Randall Strauss who writes great tech columns in the San Jose Mercury News has written a
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:08.400]   book on Thomas Edison, which might be kind of interesting.
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:14.200]   The Wizard of Menlo Park, how Thomas Edison invented the modern world, especially in light
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.400]   of all the comparisons of Edison to Steve Jones.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.360]   I want you to go to audible dot com slash Mac break.
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.840]   The reason we recommend books is because your first one's free.
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:22.720]   You sign up for the gold account.
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:23.720]   That's a book a month.
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:24.760]   Your first month's free.
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:26.480]   Your first book is free.
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:27.760]   I encourage you to try it.
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:30.200]   I do want you get free excerpts by the way for members.
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:32.400]   So you can always listen to any book.
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:33.400]   Play the sample.
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:39.000]   I'm going to I love I loved Middlesex, Jeffrey, Eugenides, previous novel, his new novel is
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.760]   out the marriage plot.
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:43.880]   But let me ask Andy because Andy always has great recommendations.
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:48.960]   We'll look a free chapter from Neil Stevenson's read and ream D. If you want to see what that
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:49.960]   sounds like.
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:52.440]   What are you listening to Andy?
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:56.000]   My current book is by Temple Grandin and Katherine Johnson.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   Yeah, it's another.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:02.240]   I recommended one Temple Grandin book about sort of a memoir about a couple years ago.
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:08.040]   This one is specifically about what she has her doctorate in, which is about animal behavior.
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:11.160]   And it really it's so interesting to see.
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:16.000]   She explains all these cases in which she's designing systems that animals are supposed
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.760]   to be moving through.
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:23.000]   And her thing is to figure out how the animal is going to see this environment and how to
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.880]   get them to simply want to walk through it.
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:29.280]   And she all these cases are just things you would never consider.
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:32.840]   And one of the basic things she explains is that animals obviously see the world differently,
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:35.720]   but they're really focused on details.
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:40.560]   Things that we have a higher functioning brain were designed to sort of edit out things
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:44.920]   that we don't regard as important or that isn't we see in a million times.
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:47.160]   So we sort of don't even see it.
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:53.040]   And yet when an animal goes to the same sort of line, you'll have a stockade or that's
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:56.480]   designed so that the animals will go through it freely and willingly.
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:59.680]   And then you wonder, well, why are they suddenly barking at this point?
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:04.360]   And then the reason why it turns out is because the ranch hands who are there to like get
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:05.960]   the cattle through, it's a hot day.
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:11.000]   So they're taking off their shirts and putting it on like this wire that's somewhere.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.160]   And it's just the simple fact that when they turn around this corner in the corner of their
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.960]   eye, they see this little thing that's sort of moving.
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:22.080]   And that's just like they sort of like, that's weird and they have to get their entire attention.
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:25.840]   And the idea of having to go through the shoot is not on their minds at all.
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:30.680]   They're just like sort of hypnotized by why is this thing here and why is it moving like
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:31.680]   that?
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:36.040]   And so it's a great book because it does really, it's all about animals.
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:41.320]   It doesn't try to take a larger point of view of, oh, well, certainly we can learn a lot
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:45.120]   about how we interact with each other based on how animals see the world.
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:47.440]   It really is just about this branch of science.
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:52.880]   But it really does sort of demonstrate that if you're trying to get animals through this
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:59.160]   maze, one way is to keep prodding them with electrical stuff and keep squatting them behind
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.880]   and sort of shoving them through.
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:04.640]   Another way is just to figure out why are they stopping at this point?
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:08.400]   What is different about this scenario than other scenarios in which you have full control
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:09.400]   the animal?
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:10.680]   You can figure that out.
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:13.840]   It turns out that you can get things through so much more efficiently and get them to do
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:15.600]   what you want them to do.
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:23.080]   So it's the, I've never had to get a, heard a cattle from Wyoming to wherever you take
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:29.080]   a cattle to, but it really does point out that Wyoming is just, you know, cheese.
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:30.080]   Just down the road.
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:35.640]   I mean, cheese, you know, to the play date that you've gone down.
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:39.720]   I just think it's interesting because, you know, she's a very high functioning autistic
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:44.000]   person who has really achieved huge things.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.680]   If you saw the movie about her and so forth, you understand that.
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:52.000]   But the insight she had was that the thing, the issues that she has with autism are very
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.120]   similar to the behavioral issues that animals run into.
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:59.400]   And so she can use her own autism to understand animals better.
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:00.920]   I thought that was fascinating.
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:03.360]   Just really interesting.
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:08.160]   Animals in translation, it's called using the mysteries of autism to decode animal behavior
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:09.680]   by Temple Grandin.
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:11.640]   You see, this is the thing.
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:14.320]   Audible lets you learn all the time while you're in the car.
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.560]   I was just used listening to Audible at the gym.
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:20.320]   When you're cleaning the house, I have it playing through my Sonos system throughout the
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:21.320]   houses.
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:22.320]   I'm cleaning the house.
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.320]   I love it.
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:24.320]   It's when I'm cleaning the house and doing yard work.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.320]   That's my, that's my day of the time.
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.320]   Yeah.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:27.320]   Yeah.
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:28.320]   My family hates it, but I don't care.
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:29.320]   We're not, we're not, you're just listening to a book.
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:30.320]   We don't even know what book you're listening to.
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:31.320]   I don't care.
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:32.320]   I'm listening to this book.
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.320]   Audible.com/Macbreak.
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:35.000]   Give it a try.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000]   Absolutely free.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000]   Your first book's free.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.520]   You're going to love it.
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:42.640]   Let us move on to our little tool here and then we'll get our picks of the week.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.040]   I want to do this as quickly as we can.
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:45.200]   We've got about two big questions.
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:47.560]   15 minutes total for all of it.
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:49.560]   So question, this is the highest voted question.
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:51.160]   And I think a really good one.
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.640]   This one's battery draining quicker on iOS 5.
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:54.640]   Is there a number one question?
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:56.120]   This is Mike Elkin reported that.
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.240]   Of course, it's hard to tell on the first day or two.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:18:59.240]   It's from Todd Stanfield.
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:02.240]   He says, "Seems to me it's been just, it might be just the fine my friends at the time."
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.120]   The GPS, which could be the case.
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:05.120]   That would certainly do it.
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:07.200]   I have not had that experience so far.
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.840]   It seems like it drains faster to me.
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.600]   Do you have a fine my friends on?
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:11.760]   Yes, I do.
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:17.040]   Because I think that constantly hitting that GPS is going to make a difference in how long
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:18.520]   your battery life is on.
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:20.680]   Well, I haven't tried it without fine my friends.
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:22.680]   But my pick will show you what I do.
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:26.360]   Andy Anaka, what's your experience been?
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:29.320]   Is battery life an issue on the new iOS?
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:30.320]   Yeah.
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:33.320]   That's true.
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:36.600]   I'm getting I have fewer battery, less battery at the end of the day.
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:39.840]   Same situation as before.
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:44.600]   I do think that it is related to iCloud services because experimentally yesterday I just turned
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:49.600]   off all iCloud services and tried to stick with what I was doing with it before.
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:52.360]   Battery life was actually better than what it was before.
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:55.480]   I think this is another case where you're just going to have to start turning off features
[01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:59.960]   that you don't need or don't want and see if the battery life goes back up to where you
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:00.960]   want it.
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:04.920]   If you're in a situation where you can dock your iPhone when you get to the office or
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:08.280]   when you drive around the car, all this sort of stuff becomes moot because it's not a
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.600]   severe battery problem.
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:13.040]   But it'll definitely it's definitely something to keep in mind when you're on a travel day.
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:15.880]   And one of those days where you leave the house at seven in the morning, you're not
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:19.560]   going to be back at a power outlet until you check in your hotel that night.
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:21.680]   And so that's another thing to think about that.
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:24.840]   Well, maybe for the course of this day, I'll turn off these three features to make sure
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:28.040]   that I'll still have 20% battery by the time I get to my hotel.
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:32.440]   Well, and I always if I'm having a long day, a long shoot day typically, I always have
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:35.520]   batteries like a battery pack.
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:41.280]   Whether Leo's got the mofi, I have a Miley, but I always have battery pack with me if
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:42.280]   I'm going to do that.
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:46.400]   We have to do that because it is a beautiful phone by itself, but you just know smartphone
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:49.560]   will get you through the day if you use it heavily, period.
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:51.560]   But iPhone used to be the best of the bunch.
[01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:54.760]   I think it's now probably a little more comparable because it's doing a lot more Android
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:55.760]   fun.
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:56.760]   Yeah.
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:57.760]   Second question.
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:58.760]   I'm sorry, really quickly.
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:02.200]   If you're following Don McAllister online, he had severe problems with his battery when
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:04.480]   he did the iOS 5 and he reset something.
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:07.040]   And I was just looking at my Twitter feed and unfortunately I can't find it because it
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:08.040]   was a few days ago.
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:09.040]   He did like a hard reset.
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:10.040]   And that fixed it?
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:11.800]   He said he said it wasn't sure if that was what happened.
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:16.840]   Was there some kind of hard reset that he did that seemed to have fixed it?
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:17.840]   Yeah.
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:19.200]   Second big question.
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:20.200]   Yes.
[01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:24.040]   iOS 5 Wi-Fi syncing is one of the ins and outs of Wi-Fi syncing.
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:25.600]   How do you know when it's working?
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:27.120]   When does it back up in sync?
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:28.720]   Do we need to have iTunes running?
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:30.840]   This is from Chris Shepherd.
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:33.080]   Do we know any of those things?
[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:37.360]   Well I'm glad he asked a quick question that we can easily answer in just a few seconds.
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:39.160]   This is either two of them for him.
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.160]   No.
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:42.360]   And this is it with all of these new features.
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:44.240]   Apple doesn't tell you a whole lot.
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:46.960]   It's just a turn on and it'll just do it.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:48.800]   In fact, that's what Steve said.
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.160]   It just works.
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:53.760]   Except that people like us want to know, well, what the hell is it doing?
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:54.760]   How do it work?
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:56.960]   I mean, Wi-Fi is thinking we know for sure.
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:58.240]   You obviously have to have Wi-Fi on it.
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:00.480]   It also has to be plugged into power.
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:02.120]   So it's not like the second you walk into your house.
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:03.560]   It doesn't start doing stuff back and forth.
[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:04.560]   It actually has to be plugged in.
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:06.400]   It's kind of for the thing where you're charging it overnight.
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:07.400]   You turn it on.
[01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:09.280]   You let your-- you have to leave your computer on.
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:12.000]   You have to leave-- I think you have to leave iTunes running.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.440]   Does anyone turn their computer on?
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:14.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:15.440]   I guess people-- I've heard of people.
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:17.160]   You've heard of people.
[01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:20.040]   I restarted every once in a while to clear out the cobwebs.
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:22.000]   You know, like, oh, I probably should start this computer.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.200]   I've used Wi-Fi syncing on Android for a long time.
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:26.520]   The problem with it is it just tends to be slow.
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:28.440]   So it's good for kind of topping off.
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:28.960]   Right.
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:30.160]   But you're still going to want to sync if you're
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:31.360]   moving a lot of data.
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:33.440]   But the really the way to think of it is exactly what Ken was
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:34.880]   saying, which is that you do it when you go to--
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:36.240]   you know, you do it overnight.
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:36.880]   You do it overnight.
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.480]   If you did that every night, you'd
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:42.720]   be better than 99% of the users as far as backups go.
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:44.960]   You know, making sure that everything's taken care of.
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:45.480]   Right.
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:46.080]   All right.
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:49.480]   Let us get to our iOS tip of the weekend.
[01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:51.960]   Actually, I don't know if Andy, if you want to use this,
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:55.040]   but a listener gave us a great iOS tip.
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:56.680]   Do you have that to hand?
[01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:58.680]   Or do you want to do something else?
[01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:00.960]   I have-- actually, I prepared the macOS tip.
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:01.680]   He has the macOS tip.
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:02.680]   Oh, you're the iOS tip.
[01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:04.640]   Let's just go ahead and use the one that was saying it.
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:05.720]   I thought this was really great.
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:06.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.400]   I thought he said Andy did this.
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:11.120]   Steve Fumarolo, or Fumarolo, yeah.
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:14.120]   He says, I know Alex does the iOS tip on Mac break weekly.
[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:15.960]   I came across this by accident, but I
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:18.240]   thought it was a good tip, and I agree.
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:19.000]   Yeah, I didn't know this.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.480]   In iOS 5, iPhone's accessibility options
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:25.960]   have a custom vibrate pattern feature.
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:29.120]   So then you can edit a contact and give each contact
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:30.880]   a custom vibrate.
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:32.760]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:34.800]   Can you do it like Morse code?
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:37.880]   There are a few of them built in, or you can record your own pattern.
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:39.040]   How do you record your own patterns?
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:40.440]   I haven't played with this, but I
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:41.920]   think this is very interesting.
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:46.720]   So go into accessibility in iOS and take a look at it.
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:49.560]   I guess that's in the general settings.
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:50.400]   Let me see where it is.
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:51.120]   I can't find it.
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.120]   Yeah, it's in general.
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:52.960]   It's a bar.
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:54.120]   I've got your camera there.
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:54.440]   All right.
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:54.840]   Oh, good.
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:55.200]   Thank you.
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:55.920]   Then we can do this.
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:57.240]   OK.
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:00.760]   And then custom vibrations, turn those on.
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:01.920]   Assign a unique vibration.
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:05.040]   Then you go to contacts, and you can assign a unique vibration
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:05.640]   to a--
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:07.520]   So once you do that, then you go back to sound.
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:07.880]   Yep.
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:10.080]   First you do that, then you go back to sound.
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:12.440]   And I'm going to give you another great tip
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:15.800]   that I discovered on my own, but others have told me about.
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:19.120]   Finally, emojis are built in.
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:21.720]   If you use international keyboards,
[01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:25.560]   go to international keyboards, one of the international keyboards
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:29.080]   you've got to scroll down is emoji.
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:32.080]   Those emojis are those fun little--
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:33.640]   I'll start typing something, and you'll
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:34.840]   see what I mean here.
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:38.960]   They're the fun little things.
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:40.600]   So you change your keyboard, and then you
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:44.040]   have all these little fun icons that only people with iPhones
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:47.720]   can see everybody else will think you're cracked.
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:48.400]   And there they are.
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:49.440]   You see that?
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:51.760]   So I can now put these in, and so forth.
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.120]   So there's two things you can do.
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:54.680]   Are you making a custom vibration?
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:56.040]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:56.760]   Is it?
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:58.280]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:00.080]   OK, let's try this.
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:01.880]   It is like-- oh, my--
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:02.880]   Oh.
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:03.880]   This is better than Siri.
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:05.960]   All right, so anyway, so--
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:07.360]   So you go into it.
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:09.480]   After you set it up, you turn it on and it turns on.
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:11.480]   Yes, I turn it on, and you go back to sounds.
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:11.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:12.840]   Oh, you have to go to sound.
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:14.320]   And I have back to sounds.
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:17.720]   So go into sounds, and you'll see vibration patterns
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:18.560]   at the bottom.
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:19.680]   I'm glad you did the research here.
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:21.240]   OK, sounds.
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:23.320]   And then the bottom, vibration patterns.
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:25.920]   OK, now go into create new custom.
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:26.960]   And I'll go into create new custom.
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:27.760]   Is rapid.
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:28.760]   Go into create new custom.
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:29.760]   There's S-O-S.
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:30.320]   Forget that.
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:31.600]   Now create new vibration.
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:32.200]   All right, yeah.
[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:33.880]   Now you just start tapping.
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:35.200]   Just start tapping.
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:37.680]   Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:39.200]   But you-- OK, you could do that.
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:43.720]   It works.
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:44.600]   But you could be like--
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:46.880]   You could be doing like little Morse codes with a person,
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:48.200]   or a-- You can do Morse code.
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:48.680]   When all the crazy--
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:51.160]   If you know Morse code, which I planned too soon,
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:53.680]   you could have everybody's name in Morse code.
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:54.960]   You know where they're talking.
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:57.040]   That is very neat.
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:57.720]   That's cool.
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:00.560]   So I'm going to call this shave and a haircut.
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:01.400]   Very cool.
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:02.840]   All right, so a couple of iOS tips--
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:03.880]   Everybody's getting-- all my friends
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:05.400]   are getting their own vibrate now.
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:08.240]   Everybody gets your own vibration.
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:10.920]   Andy, your Mac tip.
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:12.720]   This is a quick one.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:14.920]   One thing that's confusing about mission control
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:18.600]   in spaces is what do you do if you want to basically put
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:23.720]   all of your windows for one specific app in their own space.
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:27.680]   Because they made a change to how you move application
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:29.360]   windows into new spaces.
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:34.000]   In Lion, now the actual-- if you go into mission control,
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:38.320]   the actual application icon on that screen
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:41.120]   is actually the handle for that represents all the windows
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:42.720]   associated with this thing.
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:45.080]   So then if you just grab that icon and drag it
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:48.040]   into a new space or an existing space, all of a sudden,
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:50.000]   all those windows now are moved into that space.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.600]   So if you want to basically collect all of your Safari
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:55.080]   windows and make sure that this space is Safari land
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:57.440]   or this space is mail land, then that's
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:59.000]   exactly how to do it.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.480]   Quick.
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:02.040]   You're playing with a very brief--
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:02.480]   Can you hear it?
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:05.840]   This is shaving a haircut.
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:06.600]   Here's Symphony.
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:12.040]   Isn't that funny?
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:12.880]   It's so funny.
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:13.920]   All right, thank you, Andy.
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:14.840]   I don't know what you said.
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:17.400]   I was too busy playing with this.
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:18.960]   But I'm sure it was an excellent tip.
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:21.640]   And I'll go back and listen to the show and find out.
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:25.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:26.840]   That's fine.
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:28.320]   Maybe someday I'll be in the studio
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:29.600]   and I'll be part of the hijinks.
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:31.720]   I guess until then, I'll just be on the outside looking in.
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:32.640]   That is pretty cool.
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:34.000]   And I have to say, that's awesome.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:34.360]   That's awesome.
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:35.040]   That's a pretty cool--
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:37.080]   This is the craziest stuff that I'm so glad.
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:38.520]   I'm so glad this was sent in by Steve.
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:39.840]   Because this was a--
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:40.680]   Yeah, thank you, Steve.
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:41.360]   That's a good one.
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:42.560]   That's a good one.
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:45.440]   Steve, if he hadn't sent that to us, we'd never known--
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:46.760]   Never would have found it.
[01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:48.480]   Never would have found it.
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:49.920]   Let us get our picks of the week.
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:51.680]   And I don't know if, Ken, if you prepared one,
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:53.920]   but I'd love to have it if you have it.
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:55.040]   I did.
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:56.440]   Animogue.
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:57.880]   Animogue.
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:27:59.120]   Emogue, sorry.
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:01.000]   What is that?
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:07.360]   It's a new app for the iPad from the Moog people.
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:08.680]   Oh, this is kind of gross.
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:10.200]   I mean, honestly, what I hear is
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:11.920]   that it's going to be great for musicians.
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:14.160]   For me, it's just a gargantuan waste of time,
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:14.880]   but it's a lot of fun.
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:17.520]   I sat in for 30 minutes and basically made something
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:20.320]   that sounded like the soundtrack to a Blade Runner
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:21.680]   for a very long time.
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:24.760]   But 99 cents right now, at the end of 30 days,
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:25.960]   it's going up to $30.
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:28.840]   And that's how you know it's going to be big for musicians.
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:30.160]   So now's your chance.
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:32.240]   99 cents, I think, goes up a camera.
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:36.040]   Is it the iOS store or the app store?
[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:37.160]   I mean, is it for phone?
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:38.080]   I thought that was the app store.
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:38.480]   iOS.
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:39.640]   No, it's for the iPad.
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:40.680]   It's just for the iPad.
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:41.600]   Got it.
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:41.880]   Yes.
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:43.560]   No, we have the app store.
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.800]   We have the apples confused us, of course,
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:47.680]   because there's an app store for iOS 10.
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:48.960]   There's an app store for iOS.
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:50.440]   You see, I call that one the Mac app store,
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:52.520]   because I think that's what they do, which is really goofy.
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:54.640]   Eventually, we'll have to come up with different names
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:56.080]   so they'll put them all in one place.
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:58.440]   But either way, it's a lot of fun.
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:28:59.040]   Anamog.
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:00.040]   I start--
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:02.040]   Anamog.
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:03.480]   No, A-N-I.
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:04.080]   Anamog.
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.040]   Like an animated MOOC.
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:05.800]   I got it.
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:06.720]   Exactly.
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:07.200]   Talk to us.
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:08.720]   And it's really-- I mean, it's really--
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:10.240]   it's gorgeous to play with.
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:11.080]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:13.880]   It's geeky enough that you go in and you mess with settings
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:15.160]   and you have no idea what you're doing.
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:16.640]   But it creates a whole bunch of different--
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:18.320]   it means visually stunning.
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:20.760]   It's fun to listen to.
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:22.520]   I will never make a song out of it,
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:25.560]   but I will have a lot of fun doing it.
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.640]   Yeah, so I would definitely recommend that one,
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:28.920]   especially right now, because--
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:30.760]   I mean, if you listen to this, or if you watch this
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:32.560]   a month from now and you say, I'm going to try it,
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:33.480]   it's going to be $30.
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:33.960]   30 bucks.
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:34.120]   Yeah.
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:36.080]   So do it now, because it's 99 times.
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:37.360]   How can you go wrong?
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:40.120]   Fart apps cost less, more than that.
[01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:41.680]   I'd send so do it.
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:44.280]   So and you can you make a fart with this?
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:44.720]   No.
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:45.800]   Well--
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:46.640]   How disappointing.
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:49.280]   I mean, sort of like a six.
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:51.280]   Six, kind of.
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:53.240]   Good thing.
[01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:55.960]   Mr. Alex Lindsay, your pick of the week, sir.
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:57.880]   So my pick is mostly pointing at something
[01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:00.880]   that is, I think, an important evolution for Apple.
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:02.280]   So my pick is the airport utility.
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:04.480]   If you haven't gotten the airport utility,
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:06.160]   it is pretty awesome.
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:10.840]   I've got three airports running on my grounds.
[01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:11.360]   Between my--
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:11.680]   There's three.
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:13.840]   --the garage in the front house, the back house.
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:16.560]   And it's got-- it doesn't see anything right now,
[01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:18.200]   but it's got this little graphic.
[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:20.160]   So this is also like the routing.
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:21.480]   Download this now.
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:23.320]   And the thing that's interesting about this
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:27.360]   is this is one of the last vestiges.
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:31.160]   Blair actually sent me an email that pointed this out.
[01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:36.600]   This is one of the last things that is a--
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:38.400]   that was something you could only do on your computer.
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:41.920]   And yesterday, as I said, I spent most of yesterday in bed.
[01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:44.840]   And my wife was freaking out that she couldn't get access
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:45.400]   to the internet.
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:47.400]   So I'm just reconfiguring our airport laying in bed
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:48.080]   on my iPhone.
[01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:49.080]   I can't--
[01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:50.600]   I was just like, I was just too sick to stand.
[01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:52.720]   Every time I sat up, I had to go to the bathroom.
[01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:54.680]   And so I was sitting there laying on the--
[01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:58.080]   reconfiguring all the settings for my airports on my iPhone.
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:00.400]   You're just like, moats are composing the--
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:00.920]   Exactly.
[01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:02.840]   That's the perfect funeral class.
[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:03.360]   Exactly.
[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:05.440]   So the thing is is that-- but it is actually much more--
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:06.800]   This is actually much nicer.
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:10.240]   This is actually much nicer than the iPhone--
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:12.440]   Now-- I don't think it's quite half to 3 feet--
[01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:12.880]   I have to point out.
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:15.680]   It only works with Apple's airports, for instance.
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:16.320]   It's not seeing--
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:18.040]   Which is all I use, so I don't really care.
[01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:20.800]   So anyway, once again, you got to give in--
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:23.160]   you got to give in to the end of the wall garden.
[01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:25.480]   We're not using any airports that are all connected.
[01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:26.920]   Wi-Fi access.
[01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:29.600]   When you-- here's what it looks like when you do.
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:31.280]   It's-- you've got nice little graphic.
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:33.040]   So they're offline, obviously.
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:33.840]   They're offline right now.
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:35.480]   But the thing is, you've got this nice little graphic.
[01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:36.200]   You can route them.
[01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:38.160]   You can select them, change all their settings,
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:39.040]   do all their pieces.
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:39.560]   It was--
[01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:40.560]   That's pretty cool.
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:41.760]   That's really neat.
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:42.440]   That's really neat.
[01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:45.720]   Airport-- yeah, it's free from Apple on the iOS store.
[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:47.720]   But it's important to see that Apple really
[01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:50.080]   is pushing all of those things into that system
[01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:52.800]   where you're not going to need your computer to do anything.
[01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:55.360]   This is the computer.
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:57.600]   Andy and I go, you're pick of the week, sir.
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:59.400]   A little bit from left field.
[01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:02.400]   A lot of people remember a mouse that really cool
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:05.560]   Pulitzer Prize winning graphic novel about the Holocaust.
[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:08.720]   And recently, just this month, our Spiegelman
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:11.040]   came up with this book, Metamouse,
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:14.600]   which is sort of like this ultimate director's commentary
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.240]   on the entire series.
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:18.600]   So not only-- it's a beautiful book in and of itself
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:22.160]   that just page after page, just interviews
[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:26.280]   and background material and stories
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:29.440]   about-- it's lots of context of everything that not only
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:29.960]   went through--
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:31.200]   Oh, there's his wife, Francois.
[01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:32.760]   Not only the stuff that went into the story,
[01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:35.120]   but also how the story was put together,
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:39.240]   how it changed his life, changed his career,
[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:40.600]   his attitudes towards stuff.
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:43.080]   But it also comes with--
[01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:46.960]   And now we can focus in on the swastika.
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:47.920]   It also includes--
[01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:50.480]   Are you supposed to put your picture there and--
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:51.320]   Oh, Metamouse.
[01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:52.320]   Exactly.
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:57.320]   It also includes this DVD that has the entire graphic novel
[01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:59.560]   in the digital format.
[01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:01.280]   And it's also completely hyperlinked
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:03.720]   so that when you're getting to an interview segment,
[01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:06.240]   where there are scenes in which he's interviewing his father
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:08.400]   in the '70s and '80s, you can actually
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:11.160]   click and hear the audio of the actual interview
[01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:13.120]   that he was recording and click on other things,
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:15.400]   get maps about-- more information
[01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:16.760]   about what you're looking at.
[01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:18.480]   It's sort of like if you remember,
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:21.200]   there used to be a Voyager CD version of mouse.
[01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:23.920]   And this was Spieleman's desire to--
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:26.600]   now that there's no way to play the original Voyager CD,
[01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:29.120]   let's do something even better than that right now.
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:32.920]   I saw this at the con, had to order--
[01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:35.440]   had to order a copy of it by Amazon and arrive recently.
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:38.400]   Unfortunately, for some reason, my DVD doesn't play at all.
[01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:39.800]   It's supposed to be Mac compatible,
[01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:41.280]   as well as Windows compatible.
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:45.440]   But just-- the version that I saw that was working
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:48.360]   over the weekend just made me instantly take up my phone
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:49.560]   and make the purchase.
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:53.840]   So it's just really, really just the coolest fusion of print
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:55.760]   and digital that I've ever seen.
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:58.560]   Yeah, I love-- I love mouse.
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:00.160]   Amazing.
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:02.880]   Thank you, Andy, for a great recommendation.
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:05.920]   We were talking about poor battery life on iOS 5.
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:08.240]   I also experienced it, but I don't want to deal with it.
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:09.480]   I don't want to turn stuff off.
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:10.800]   I want to turn everything on.
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:14.920]   So I've taken my nice, small, elegant iPhone 4S
[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:17.160]   and made it into a truck.
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:18.640]   It's a behemoth.
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:19.480]   This is the Mophie.
[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:21.600]   Now, there is a Mophie Juice Pack Air,
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:24.240]   which is a 1,500 milliamp hour battery.
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:27.720]   This is the Juice Pack Plus, 20 bucks more.
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:30.400]   And it's a little bit thicker and heavier,
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:32.760]   but this is 2,000 milliamp hours.
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:36.040]   It's effectively more than doubling the capacity.
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:38.520]   So the way it works, it's still-- you no longer
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:39.480]   use a 30-pin connector.
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:44.440]   You use one of these ubiquitous micro USB connectors.
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:48.280]   The USB connector charges both the iPhone and the Air
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:49.200]   simultaneously.
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:51.680]   It typically charges your iPhone first,
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:53.960]   and then it passes over to the Air--
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:55.960]   OK.
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:57.000]   I think it does both.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.760]   But anyway, it doesn't matter, because you're
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:02.320]   going to do it overnight while it's doing the Wi-Fi.
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:03.520]   Those four lights will show you.
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:06.360]   So it's just finishing up the charge on the Air.
[01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:07.600]   And then there's a switch.
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:10.760]   They recommend that you let the phone die or get close to dead
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:12.840]   and then turn the switch on, which will then
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:15.400]   start running the iPhone from the--
[01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:17.800]   And I like to do it the exact opposite.
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:20.240]   Because the main point is you get double the battery.
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:20.680]   Right.
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:22.640]   Because when I do it, I always put it on--
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:23.120]   Use the Air.
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:24.600]   You let the Air run out?
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:26.800]   So as soon as the battery comes out,
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:28.680]   I can pop it off, continue to use my iPhone,
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:31.040]   and plug that in and keep on charging.
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:31.600]   That's a good idea.
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:32.680]   So that I have it again.
[01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:33.320]   Sometimes you--
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:34.320]   That's a good idea.
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:35.920]   I just bought two.
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:37.560]   So two does work two.
[01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:38.640]   Two mophies.
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:39.240]   Two words.
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:43.640]   So that way, just plug one mophie and have that in the hotel
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:43.840]   room.
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:45.880]   Because I know you need it really day to day.
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:46.720]   It's when I'm traveling.
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:49.480]   It's when I'm at CES or that kind of thing.
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:52.160]   $79.95 list price for the Juice Pack Air, the Juice Pack,
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:54.680]   plus $20 more for more battery.
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:57.400]   And as you can see, it comes in colors.
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:58.680]   Black, blue--
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:01.640]   I'm sorry, cyan, magenta, yellow, purple, and red.
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:02.680]   I got the cyan.
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:05.000]   I think a white iPhone with a cyan trim.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:05.600]   It's pretty nice.
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:06.680]   It's kind of sexy.
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:07.920]   It's a diamond.
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:09.640]   It's kind of pretty.
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:12.080]   Anyway, we've recommended these before.
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:13.800]   The plus is something a little bit new.
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:18.360]   And I think it may be that for the 4S, this is what you need.
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:19.800]   And what I just do on Android phones
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:23.120]   are just buy multiple batteries with a USB charger.
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:25.160]   But you can't do that on the iPhone.
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:26.520]   So there you go.
[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:28.040]   Hey, thank you all for being here.
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:30.280]   OS Ken, so nice to have you.
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:32.520]   And come back again very soon.
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:34.520]   If everybody goes to MacOSKen.com,
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:36.800]   they will find his great podcast there.
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:40.480]   And you do that-- it's almost every day, or is it every day?
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:41.640]   It's Monday through Friday.
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:45.440]   It's about 15 minutes, anywhere between 10 and 20 minutes
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:48.840]   a day of as much Apple news as I can cram in.
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:50.720]   With attitude.
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:51.600]   Yeah, that's what I hear.
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:54.880]   It's a great way to get your daily Mac news.
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:55.360]   Thanks.
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:57.320]   Yeah, MacOSKen.com.
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:58.440]   Thanks for being here.
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:04.360]   Alex Lindsay, Thursday, Yupixacore.com/live.
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:07.240]   You'll be doing a Ray Priest, Mac Mac break studio.
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:08.880]   We do it something different every week.
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:12.240]   So this Thursday is Mac break studio live.
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:15.000]   Next Thursday is we're going to be doing a live shoot.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.840]   We're going to bring in a model in.
[01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:19.040]   And Frederick Johnson is going to be doing a live shoot.
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:20.440]   So that's Twitch live.
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:22.560]   And so you have to watch it and discuss it and so on and so
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:22.880]   forth.
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:24.760]   And we have Gear Media Tech the week after that.
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:26.840]   And then we have-- so it's different every week.
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:27.760]   It's all around media.
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:28.920]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:30.000]   I'm glad you're doing this.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.520]   6 p.m. Pacific, 9 p.m. Eastern, Thursday.
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:34.960]   We were told that the best part of the show
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:36.000]   is actually the after show.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:36.480]   Of course.
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:37.480]   Because we do this whole show.
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:38.400]   Same is true for us.
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:40.720]   And then at the end of the show, I sit there for half an hour
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:42.040]   and we talk about what didn't work.
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:44.720]   So we go, OK, so this camera angle can't keep on doing that.
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:45.640]   And this needs to go here.
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:46.840]   This needs to go here.
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:47.840]   Why were we doing this?
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:49.720]   And we need to change the edits.
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:50.640]   We need to edit faster.
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:54.200]   So it's actually people will really enjoy the behind the
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:54.600]   scenes stuff.
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:55.480]   So check it out.
[01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:59.160]   Incidentally, there's a new Xcode 4.2 that Apple put out
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:00.960]   when they put out all of this new stuff.
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:04.040]   And really, Tout, you might want to check a look in your app
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:06.160]   store, do the update.
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:10.560]   It concludes SDKs for 10.7 and iOS 5.
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:12.680]   Even if you're not really a coder, one of the best things
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:14.960]   that the Xcode download is a quartz composer.
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:15.840]   Yeah, you should have it.
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:18.480]   1.8 gigs is the only negative on that one.
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:20.840]   And the Enochos at the Chicago Sun Times look for his review
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:23.240]   of the iPhone 4s in the next couple of days.
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:25.960]   Look, there he is with Michael Jackson.
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:28.440]   No, I don't know who are those people.
[01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:28.960]   What is the point?
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:30.360]   Is that Cosby, right?
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:33.280]   That would be the Eartha Kit Catwoman, Zatanna from DC
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:38.120]   Comics, and not Dr. Strange, but Dr. Voodoo from Marvel Comics.
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:39.280]   Well, there you go.
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:41.080]   It's Andy's new band.
[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:43.400]   Learn something every day.
[01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:46.520]   Ask Siri about that, and all you'll get is something you
[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:47.120]   don't want.
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:48.400]   God, you're such a dork.
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:51.480]   I don't want to be your personal assistant anymore.
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:53.000]   Yeah, go away.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:53.760]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:54.440]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:55.000]   Thank you, Ken.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:55.960]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:57.000]   We do this show.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.160]   11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern, every Tuesday at Twit.tv.
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:03.760]   But you don't have to be here live because we make sure
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:06.560]   that there's a great looking video download for you soon.
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:10.440]   High def, video downloads of this 720p.
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:12.440]   Well, as of course audio, for those of you who
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:17.080]   like to listen in the car, that's all at Twit.tv.
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:19.480]   Don't forget, coming up at 2.30 this afternoon, every Monday

[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:30.840]   announcement.
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:32.480]   And if you don't know what I'm talking about,
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:33.680]   if you think that sounds like nonsense,
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:34.880]   you can skip that one.
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:36.800]   If you do, you know you're going to want to tune in,
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:39.480]   Eileen Rivera, Jason Howell, and Gina Trepani will talk
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:42.000]   about the latest version of Google's Android OS

[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:48.000]   Twit photos coming up next.

[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:50.360]   We'll see you next time.
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:51.360]   Now get back to work.
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:52.280]   Break time's over.
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:54.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:58.180]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:39:58.180 --> 01:40:00.760]   (upbeat music)
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:02.760]   You
