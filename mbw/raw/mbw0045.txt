[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Time for MacBreak Weekly to show the covers.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Nothing but iPhones all the time.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   You might as well just call it the Scott Born Apple Phone Show show.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Part 2.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Thank you.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   If you're not sick of hearing about the iPhone on the Apple phone show,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   you can listen to us here.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Well, we're going to cover it somehow differently.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   I don't know how, but somehow.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   There is no other story.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   I wish we didn't have to.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   We'd got to cover it because it's coming out a week from Friday.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Also, here back from his travels around the world, Mr. Alex Lindsay of the Pixelcore.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Hello, Alex.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Hey, how are we going?
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   It's great to have you back.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   We missed you terribly.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   It's good to be back.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Do you have a good trip?
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   I did.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   I had a great trip.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   I got to travel over a large portion of southern and eastern Africa.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   And ended up in a roux show, Tanzania, for TED.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   TED Global.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Yeah, you did.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Nice piece on that on our TV show, The Lab with Leo.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Hey.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Yeah, people will be able to see some video of that stuff.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   It's really cool.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Yeah, it was really well done, conference.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   It's one of the things you don't know what.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   I had never been to a TED before, so I didn't know what to expect.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.200]   It was a very complex conference to do because there was 400 people in eight different hotels
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.000]   that are all 40 minutes apart.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   So to get everybody into the same place at the same time was pretty exciting.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   And it was a lot of great speakers and bono and the president hands in the end.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   You know, all that stuff.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   So it was good.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Well, welcome back.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Also, Merlin Mann is here.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   He of the 43 folders.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   I had this idea.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   I'm going to abandon it.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.400]   But I did have an idea that every time somebody said the word iPhone, I was going to imagine
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.000]   that they were actually saying dengue fever.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   And I would just something to mix it up, something to keep it kind of interesting.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Kind of is like dengue fever when you're talking about it.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   It's spreading rapidly.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   It's very painful.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   It's hemorrhagic.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   I think that's the way a lot of the other cell phone manufacturers.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   They've got to be plausing.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I mean, they've got to be looking at this and looking at the attention it's getting.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.160]   And not just in our little corner of the world where we're, of course, we're enthusiasts.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.880]   But I just saw a story that said two out of three people know about the iPhone.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.680]   That's a huge recognition factor.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.320]   And I guess they said that I guess the new thing now is 19 million people are interested
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.520]   in buying one.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.520]   That gets me.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.760]   Those are many, many people who haven't seen the price tag yet.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.160]   Well, I think a lot of these stories where, you know, the rising tide raises all boats.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.240]   I mean, there's so many kinds of technology.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.040]   This is everybody else.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.040]   It does.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.200]   People do not except for total nerds.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.040]   There aren't that many people that buy two $600 phones.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.040]   Right.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.280]   Hey, Scott, have you looked at the iPhone clones?
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.680]   Because there are a lot of them now.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.680]   Have you played with any of these?
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.120]   The closest I've come is I've played with the Nokia 995 that you have.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.200]   I mean, it's not trying to be an iPhone.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.920]   It's not a touchscreen and so forth.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.920]   It's just a full phone.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.560]   No, we have asked, we've asked to get some review units.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.880]   They're on the way, allegedly.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.680]   And we do want to do some comparisons.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.560]   But as soon as the iPhone comes out, part of my focus will be making sure I learn everything
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.760]   that it does well first.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.120]   And then we'll start to do some comparisons.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.920]   And today, obviously, some interesting news came out that Apple has you to press release
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.160]   talking about extended battery life and a different cover for the phone.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.080]   That's going to create even more buzz.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.280]   Why would they wait till two weeks before it comes out to make that announcement?
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.640]   Maybe just to make John C. Devorak look like a jackass.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.400]   Why was he complaining about battery life?
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.600]   45 minutes was his claim.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.680]   Well, we don't know.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.560]   I mean, I'll tell you right now that it's not going to get what Apple is claiming.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.040]   No, but if it gets half what it's claiming, it's 10 times more than what everybody else
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.040]   is saying.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.720]   Well, again, we won't know till it comes out.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.440]   It's easy to say all this.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.240]   They do have a chart up that on their website that shows a comparison.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.240]   Oh, well, there you go.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.240]   They got a chart.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.240]   It's a chart.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.240]   I didn't know there was a chart.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.240]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.560]   It's on the same claims that are made by other cell phone carriers, which are obviously also
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.560]   optimistic.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.560]   Hmm.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.400]   Maybe they're less optimistic than Apple's though.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.400]   We don't.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.480]   There's no standard for optimism.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.480]   That's true.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.480]   We'll find out.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.800]   What is the optimism multipliers?
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.800]   They're a stand.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.800]   You say we don't know.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.800]   I don't think Apple would.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.560]   I don't think Apple would start trumpeting this battery life unless they really did think
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.800]   they were going to have some substance.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.800]   And this is substantive.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.360]   Yeah, it's a lot of battery.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.600]   Three hours talk time is longer than almost any phone I know.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.600]   I know.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.920]   Internet use six hours.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.920]   Video playback seven hours.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.400]   Audio playback 24 hours.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.440]   It doesn't have a video phone.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.000]   It doesn't have a video camera, right?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   It just does still.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Do we know that?
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.600]   I don't know if we know that.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.200]   Well, we don't.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.680]   We don't know for sure.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.680]   Okay.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.680]   Nobody's ever said anything about video.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.920]   And we do know it's a two megapixel camera, which is a little disappointing.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.080]   And another thing that I saw, and I don't know whether you guys talked about this or
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.440]   no, not the idea that you're going to have to buy the data, whether you're going to
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.120]   use it or not, the data service.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.640]   We have no, we have no confirmation of that yet.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.640]   All of this is unknown.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.640]   That's the problem is it.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.360]   Well, I think that's going to be the thing that is the difference between them selling
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.800]   three million in the first two weeks and them selling, you know, I don't know.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.440]   I think people are going to get look, a lot of people are going to be in line on Friday.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.280]   They will all buy a phone regardless of what they're told at the counter.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.920]   That'll be a million dollars in your first one.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.920]   Thanks.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:03.920]   Where do I give you the check?
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.480]   They're going to wait in line for that long.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.960]   They're going to buy the phone.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.960]   Right.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.280]   Of course, that's not, but I don't know.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.280]   What is that?
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.280]   A million?
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.280]   I don't know how many that is.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.280]   Who knows?
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.400]   I don't think we've ever seen this is comparable to the, this is comparable to the, the excitement
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.120]   over the PlayStation three or the Nintendo Wii.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.360]   Except that unlike those, this, this crosses demographic borders.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.320]   I mean, you're only interested in a PlayStation three.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.920]   If you're a gamer, this, this is everyone.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.920]   This is businessmen.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.120]   This is anybody who uses a cell phone, which is everyone.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.920]   I have to say, I think this is the largest consumer product launch ever.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.120]   And it'll either be really, really good or really not.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.680]   So, or maybe in the middle, we don't know.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.920]   Well, they do, they do, they say their battery life is going to be a lot better than mine.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.760]   My Nokia N95 like twice as good.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:00.240]   Almost as much, how much, I mean, blackberry curve, four hours, palm trio, four hours, blackjack,
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.800]   5.5, eight hours is great.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.920]   I mean, if they get eight hours, you know what, I would buy it just for that.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.920]   I think my palm trio is like really 45 minutes.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.920]   I mean, that's really good.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.680]   Seven hours of the year that's true.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.240]   Leo, how does your, how does your Nokia actually perform relative to that chart?
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.240]   Does it get what it is?
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.240]   It's impossible.
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.160]   First of all, does it, do you know anybody that talks for four hours in one charge?
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.160]   I don't know.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.120]   I haven't talked that long.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.080]   It's not talking that wears down my phone.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.920]   It's GPS.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.920]   It's Jaiku.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.920]   It's data.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.200]   So if I've got the GPS going, the data going, I'm sending pictures back and forth, I can
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.680]   run it down pretty quick.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.040]   But I've also learned what not to do.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.400]   I turn off the Bluetooth when I'm not using it, things like that.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.720]   And it gives me all day charge.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.320]   I mean, it's still at five bars right now.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.320]   And here we are.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.440]   We're taping this at five in the evening.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.760]   So it's full, it's fully charged right now and I've been using it all day.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.280]   I've made a few calls, but who talks five hours or eight hours?
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.840]   I mean, how would you even know?
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.600]   Talk to some producer in LA.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.600]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.560]   I would, you know, look, I think we expect any smartphone we expect to charge it at night,
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.560]   right?
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.560]   Yeah.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.200]   The question is, does it get through the day?
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.200]   And it looks like this will.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.200]   It's me away.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.960]   There's seven hours of video playback.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.960]   I mean, that's going on.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.960]   That's a point.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:12.960]   I came back.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.600]   Yeah, we came back from Rhode Island and we were able on a fully charged iPod video.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.960]   We were able to watch exactly two episodes of the wire.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.960]   Right.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.840]   So, which I actually have the DVD for.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.840]   Thank you for clarifying that.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.400]   It was a photo on Flickr.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.400]   I own the DVD.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.680]   You know, I had to buy the DVD.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.720]   I couldn't find episode two on the newsgroups.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.720]   So good.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.480]   But no, but I mean, the thing is that's a tiny little, I think that's a smaller screen
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.480]   than the iPhone and.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.480]   Oh, resolution.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.480]   So what did they do?
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.480]   Is it a bigger battery?
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.040]   I mean, what did they do to make this iPhone battery life longer?
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.680]   They did not release that information.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:54.240]   Obviously, it's either a better battery or less power usage, but they did not disclose
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.240]   that.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:59.240]   I put some calls in Apple PR today, which went unanswered on that issue.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.000]   They also announced, and I think this is a very encouraging move, a glass screen, not
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   a plastic screen.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.840]   I think I was far more excited about the glass screen than I was for the battery, to
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:13.360]   be honest, because my iPod, I admit I did not treat my video iPod very well, but it's
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.360]   pretty scratched up.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.520]   It's kind of hard to watch.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.520]   Plastic's terrible.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.720]   Of course, all the haters immediately started with, okay, well, now it's going to break.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.080]   Well, that could be.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:28.240]   I have to tell you, touch screens are usually pretty hard to read because of all the fingerprints
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.240]   and stuff.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.880]   Well, that and the reflectance, the luminance, now it's gotten better.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.880]   So we'll see.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:38.160]   I mean, look, this could be a groundbreaking product and it looks to be a groundbreaking
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.280]   product, which means it'll have better battery life than anybody expected.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.560]   A better screen, fewer fingerprints or not.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.560]   I don't know.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.880]   I mean, you know, I, I, if it just works, what was a phone and syncs with my contacts, I'll
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.880]   be happy.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.880]   Not bad already.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.200]   I have no trouble with Bluetooth in my Nokia.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.680]   Leo, did you see Rattle?
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.640]   Did you see that the new missing sync does you Jimbo?
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.440]   Ooh, I like that.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.920]   What does it sync it to?
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:04.920]   What does it sync it to?
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.920]   I'm not sure.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.760]   I think I'm guessing it must go into memos.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.520]   I'll double check my facts on that, but I somebody just told me that and passed, which
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.520]   is awesome.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.520]   That's nice.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.520]   Yeah, I don't use missing sync.
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.600]   I use the, I use, believe it or not, Apple I sync.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.600]   It still lives.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.140]   It's on in certain cases and in this case with the, with the Nokia Symbian operating
[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.560]   system, you use iSync and it does a great job.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.520]   Missing sync on my trio has, has been again, I've such a repeated topic.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.000]   We've done this over and over and over.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.200]   No, but, but the other thing that's great about it though is it handles things like,
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:39.240]   uh, it's got it, the Mark space has its own conduits for things like tasks and encounters
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.480]   to handle much better than the stock setup in my experience.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.440]   Yeah, I have paid paid for missing sync.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.440]   So maybe I should try it.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:52.040]   So here it is, sync, this is on the unofficial Apple web log as you Jimbo notes, uh, trio
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.120]   SMS and more.
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:58.080]   I just, I just, I sync my trio like once every three months and brace for impact.
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.080]   And I go back.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.080]   Sinking is always a risky thing.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.400]   I did get an email from a listener folks that said that one of the reasons I might have
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:10.440]   been having trouble with the missing sync on my trio was that apparently Verizon had some
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.200]   weird thing you had to do first to get it to work right.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.120]   And I never did that.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.760]   So I always had bad luck with missing sync.
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.000]   I'm using Verizon, Merlin.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.320]   You're using a different carrier.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.600]   Maybe that was why you got the missing sync love and I didn't.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.840]   Could be also, you just rise in and I also had lots of unhappiness.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.800]   So here's the rundown of what I've been told what's going to happen.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.920]   Apple stores will close and I presume this is AT&T stores as well.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:37.960]   By the way, only company owned stores, not franchisees, uh, not independents, only company
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.560]   owned stores will close at four p.m.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:46.800]   The FedEx man will come a knock and sometime between four and five with an unspecified
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.800]   number of phones.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.880]   They're going to rob them.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.000]   They're going to get them that day and hour before they open, then at six o'clock they
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.440]   open the doors.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.960]   My sources are saying that they will arrive in armored cars.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.480]   That's got to be really.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.320]   Let me say that Scott, whenever you talk about your sources and with respect, I always
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.240]   imagine you doing like a little senior wenz's hand.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.640]   We have like a little eyes on there.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.760]   We'll be arriving in, in, in, in, in, Johnny, Johnny, tell me, what will the iPhones be
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.760]   here?
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.760]   I vote car six.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:15.760]   I vote car six.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.760]   I vote car six.
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.760]   Close the door.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.600]   I don't think they'll do armored cars to all Apple stores.
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.000]   And I mean, I'm sure the big stores they will to make a big splash.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.360]   Also we have not been able to confirm the four o'clock time.
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.040]   We, we've heard different times of closing.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.040]   Okay.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.000]   Uh, it is a rolling rollout.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.560]   So if you, I don't, I think frankly, Scott, if you really cared, you'd go to New York.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.560]   You'll get it three hours early.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:41.040]   I have a Vinnie Ferrari in New York city standing by.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.440]   So he'll get it.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.880]   He could actually have a review before we even touch the phone.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.800]   He could save you a lot of money because ladies and gentlemen, I just want to, can I,
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.960]   can I tell people what your plan is?
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.360]   Mr. Mr. Moneybags here.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.360]   Mr. Thirsty.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.800]   It's not, it's not money bags.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.520]   It don't start it that way.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.760]   It's just how many phones do you plan to buy?
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.840]   Just 12.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.040]   At that store.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.040]   At that store.
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.440]   You have runners at every other store.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.480]   Just in case to buy another 12.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.720]   So how many do you hope to get?
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.960]   I would, I would love to get 24, but I need 12.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.960]   I have.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.600]   One for each pocket.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.600]   What?
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.600]   I don't.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.960]   Well, some of, you know, my team members, the staff at the company would like.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:26.440]   You do the, you do the number one Apple phone show, called Apple phone show at Applephone
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.440]   show.com.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.200]   So of course you need to, this is your job.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.080]   And we have to have one that we're going to actually tear apart so we can see what it looks
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.080]   like.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.760]   I'm not sure that'll avoid the warranty, but I was going to check with Merlin on that.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.680]   It'll probably still work though.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.160]   We are going to give one away on the show, so we have to have that one.
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.160]   That's good.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.920]   And then I have to have a couple of backups in case you guys get wonky on me and decide
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.560]   you want one after all.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.840]   You mean like mention that promise you made?
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.400]   I mean the one you promised you were going to give us.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.600]   You know, I have, I would just encourage everybody to listen to that show carefully and then
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.600]   we'll have that.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.600]   What?
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.600]   I'm going to quote Hank.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.600]   I'm going to quote Hank.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.360]   Hank Hill from the first episode of King of the Hill.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.600]   Don't play lawyer ball.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.600]   No.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.800]   Hey, baseball Scott lawyer ball lawyer ball.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.040]   You said you said you're going to give us phones.
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:18.160]   And if you don't, you know, if you just want to, if you want to skate on that, that's fine.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.000]   But don't go like like pulling your spectacles down your nose.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.920]   You're kind of like you say that.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:23.920]   It doesn't matter.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:24.920]   I don't want to.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:25.920]   Instead of stinking phone.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.800]   I said if they were shipping the day of Mackerels, you'd get one.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.800]   That's it.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.240]   Maybe I'll just hang out outside the store and collect everybody's trios.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.720]   They're back to be profitable.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:40.240]   They should have that like the zoom people try to do with a recycled phone's out in the
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.520]   front of the Apple store.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.640]   So how do I get my, how, what's the best way to get an iPhone?
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:52.080]   Depends on who you believe, but Mr. Jobs allegedly told a prominent blogger that the
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.800]   best way to get an iPhone was to go to an AT&T store.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.640]   Besides being Walt Mossberg.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.640]   You know, he has one.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.640]   He got one on the 12th.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.440]   Hey, there says that David Polk have one yet?
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.440]   I don't know.
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.440]   I haven't asked David, but I'm betting not.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:09.320]   I know that wall pretty much throws his weight around and says, look, if you want, if you
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.880]   want coverage, you'll get it to me before you get it to the time.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.720]   So the Wall Street Journal has its iPhone.
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.720]   I don't know.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.960]   I don't know any other journalist that has one unless they've been signed to, you know,
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.080]   not saying anything, which they may be, but but wall was very upfront about it.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.920]   He said, yeah, if he pulled it out, he showed people.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.920]   Yeah, I got mine.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:26.920]   Got it today.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:30.520]   He was still thinking about, you know, he hadn't used it enough to make a decision one
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:31.520]   way or another.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.960]   And thought he was speaking to a university audience and pulled it out.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.080]   They went, oh, he said, but I'm not going to tell you what I think yet because I haven't
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:42.120]   had it long enough, but which you know, you've been doing this stuff for a pretty long time.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.120]   You've been around a lot.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:47.800]   Have you ever seen like this level of cloth and madness about a computer kind of?
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:52.080]   Well, like I said, the only one that comes close is the, you know, the game console roll
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.080]   outs.
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.560]   I mean, people were fighting each other for PlayStation threes.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:58.720]   It turned out mistakenly because you can get one easily now.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.920]   I mean, it's one thing you like, I'm thinking here, like, you know, you always seem to like
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.240]   cabbage patch towels and stuff, but I never something.
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.800]   This is something that caught 600 bucks.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.040]   No, as I said earlier, I think this is the largest roll out of a consumer electronics
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.040]   item ever.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.880]   Biggest, biggest story.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:16.080]   I've never seen so much verbiage, you know, expanded on it.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.840]   I mean, it's incredible.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.080]   And a lot of hype.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:24.240]   I mean, you know, I, I hope people aren't terribly disappointed.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:30.120]   On the other hand, I'm hoping that we'll all be pleasingly, you know, impressed.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.760]   Well we're going to take our 12 if we get them and put them in a lock box inside the
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.480]   store and get them home some other time.
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:39.360]   Yeah, I was going to say if you will try to walk out of that store with an R full of
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.760]   12 iPhones, you're going to be mugged.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:42.760]   I'm not doing that.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.480]   It's like the time of you.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.960]   It's like when I was standing on the side of the street there by the store leo with all
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.480]   my Mac pros and you had to drive up in the car and get me.
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.480]   There's a big difference.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:55.880]   There's an align of a thousand people out front trying to get one.
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.040]   Yeah, you're going to, if you, if you really do get to it.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.400]   So they, they promise you that you would get 12.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:07.720]   You know, they, I can't really say they promised, but I have hope that that's going to happen.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.320]   So they ever want to see their family again.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:13.120]   So I'm thinking the best place to go, which is probably not where I'm going to be because
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.680]   of my fiduciary responsibility as a professionally trained journalist.
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:22.280]   I think the best place to go would be a small town AT&T company store.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.280]   That would be correct.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.280]   Yeah.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:28.640]   However, that we hear that there may be as few as 20 phones per AT&T company store.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.480]   Oh, well, but see here in Petaluma, I don't know if there are going to be 20 people in
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.800]   line to get one.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.800]   That's a good bet.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.000]   I might just do that.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.880]   Now, now, and here's another thing.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.440]   I'm an AT&T customer.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:44.480]   I could just say, you know, I, I have my, I have my trio or no, I'm sorry.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.480]   I have a black brick.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.640]   I could just say, well, look, I just want to.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.040]   That might actually, that may actually work against you.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.040]   Really?
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.240]   You mean they'll say, oh, I'm sorry, only new customers.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.240]   Please turn around and watch.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:01.640]   Well, we've had two, I've had two different fairly, I believe believable sources contact
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.360]   me and say that they are existing AT&T business customers.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.960]   They are customers of AT&T that represent large corporations.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:14.000]   They called about iPhones and were told essentially, look, we're just, we're trying to use this
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   to get new customers.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.920]   You'll get yours in a few weeks.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.920]   I don't know if that's true, but that's what I heard.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:22.720]   I have to say that if, you know, I'm sure that Apple is not seating journalists with
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.840]   it, they don't need to, right?
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.000]   We're all going to wait in line and buy one.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.960]   Yeah, the more scarcity there is, especially among journalists, the more buzz there's going
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.960]   to be.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:32.960]   Right.
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.120]   That releases all the tension once you, once you let somebody have that.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:40.840]   Otherwise, you know, then it becomes really, you know, desired.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:45.320]   If I buy and if I go on, oh, I guess I can't go online and buy one until then, right?
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:49.760]   Well, you're supposedly you'll be able to get them online at the Apple store at 6 p.m.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.600]   We don't know if that's 6 p.m. Eastern or Pacific, but we will.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.600]   It's rolling.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.600]   Apparently local.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.160]   It's 6 p.m. local time.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:01.920]   So I will have somebody online ready to order phones as well.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.200]   But you won't get until at best Monday.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.800]   Well, that's okay.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.320]   That'll be my backup group.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.320]   You're going to end up with like a thousand phones.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.320]   You know that.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.320]   Can't you pre-order right now?
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.320]   No.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:17.320]   Is there anything else to say about this?
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:22.880]   There's no, Steve Jobs said the best way to do it is to go to an AT&T store.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:27.600]   It was an off the cuff comment that he allegedly made to Ariana Huffington at a conference
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.200]   where she asked him what was the best way he is.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.200]   She is.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.200]   She is.
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.200]   She is.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.200]   She is.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.200]   What is the best way to get my phone?
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.760]   And allegedly Apple PR has since denied that he said that Huffington Post has not retracted.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.920]   Why would that be a better place than an Apple store?
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:46.840]   He said according to the quote that it's going to be chaos at the Apple store, you'll be
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.840]   better off at an AT&T store.
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.600]   I don't think you'll be better off at either one.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.520]   I think if you really got to have one on the 29th, you got to do what I'm doing.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.280]   You got to have multiple attacks.
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.960]   You have to have different approaches.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:06.080]   Hey, I may propose a slight correction and direction to talk about some stuff that you
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.920]   can do with your iPhone.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.760]   I think it's one thing that's kind of interesting.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:17.320]   You are starting to see some websites crop up that are just out there to talk about the
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.240]   quote unquote applications that are becoming available.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.800]   These are the applications that are running in.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:23.800]   Safari.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:24.800]   Safari.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.800]   iPhone application list.com is one.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.480]   I don't know if that's the word you're thinking of.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.480]   That's a good one.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.480]   Also, there's another one.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.880]   I just saw a little bit ago.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:38.240]   I haven't played with this yet, but it looks like I want to get the address for this right.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:42.960]   It's a site where you can go and has a simulated iPhone interface that handles--
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.360]   Oh, that you could play them.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.360]   --Script.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.360]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:51.920]   Now, on iPhone application list.com, if you use Safari, some of these applications
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.080]   actually run.
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.080]   Right.
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.920]   Because they're all Safari applications.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:58.920]   I mean, there's--
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:20:59.920]   Gosh, I have a--
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:00.920]   There is a Facebook interface.
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.120]   I think there's a Facebook interface.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.920]   Looks like there's a Twitter, Twitter.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:06.920]   Twitter.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:07.920]   Google.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.800]   And look, ASAP.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.240]   You can pop in your zip code and tell us your web apps.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.640]   But I mean, I think, I guess, personally, it's more promising to me to look at what are
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.480]   people actually going to potentially be able to do with this first day.
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.800]   I know a lot of my friends who do software development are kind of scrambling right now
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:30.280]   to see what they can get out in time.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:35.000]   This one I Act 2 is a news reader that actually puts little pictures of the newspaper on.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.360]   That's pretty cool.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:43.600]   There is a iPhone bar camp for developers slated here in the Bay Area guys starting July the
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.600]   8th.
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.920]   So they're all going to get together and try to develop apps right there on the scene
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.440]   at the bar camp for two days.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.920]   So I'm going to be covering that.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:51.920]   That looks like that.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.000]   We'll bring about some pretty interesting stuff along these lines, Marlin.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.520]   They find a location, yeah.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:00.200]   They have not picked it, but they're supposed to call me later today or tomorrow and tell
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.320]   me because we're going to sponsor it.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.800]   This would be-- I mean, I have to say, if you're a developer, I could see why you'd
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.880]   want to jump on this bandwagon pretty darn quick.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.160]   And it's not hard to develop.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:13.240]   I mean, you already know, right?
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.920]   Yeah, grab the prototype library and start hacking around.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:20.520]   Here's a dig.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:26.600]   GCalc, a tiny Ajax applet that calculates the running costs of tech gear based on power
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:32.160]   consumption, running time, and domestic electricity costs.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.640]   And it's got a big ad in it, a Google ad in it.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.240]   That's another thing you could do now.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.880]   You could just use AdSense and put it right there.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:40.880]   On a tat.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:41.880]   Monatize.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.200]   Well, it'll be really interesting to see it.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:48.840]   I sat through a couple of the WWC things about what you can do because at first we were
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.920]   a little upset that we weren't going to be able to use a lot of the interactive features
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:52.920]   inside of QuickTime.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.720]   We're trying to add a lot of clickable items.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:56.720]   And it--
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.720]   It's so great for you.
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:58.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.240]   Well, and we were a little concerned about it, but to be honest, our fears were delayed when
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:08.480]   we really saw that if we really start looking at SVG and looking at how we can use--
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.480]   Build it into Safari.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.360]   I mean, the thing that I didn't want to do, which is build it into a web page.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:16.000]   But if we can actually-- if we figure out how to make all of that work, we can actually
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.680]   get really interactive video experiences that you can use on your iPhone and we can
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.400]   get them out really, really quickly.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.920]   And there's still going to be a lot of development.
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:26.600]   It's still-- it's not quite ready yet.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.720]   But by the fall, we should see some of that.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.200]   And that's going to be, I think, a pretty interesting process.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.360]   No flash, though, right?
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.360]   No flashable.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.120]   I'll use flash, so I don't really care.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:42.760]   You may not care, but YouTube might.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:46.960]   Although they say there's a way to play YouTube-- I mean, some of these YouTube players says,
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.560]   oh, we don't need flash.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:53.560]   We have-- we'll H.264 YouTube video.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.560]   Which is what it's doing.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.080]   I guess it's taking a selection and then reconverted into H.264.
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.080]   I don't know.
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.080]   Maybe they have a deal with Google.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.840]   Remember how quickly?
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:06.440]   Just remember, just not long ago, how quickly the Apple TV was hacked.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.840]   I kind am wondering, what is it going to take?
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.840]   Is there going to be a bunch of hacks within a few days of the iPhone?
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:13.840]   And we'll have--
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.840]   You know, a lot of people will be trying.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.760]   And will they respond similarly?
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.400]   Just sort of turn a blind eye to it?
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.720]   They will not turn a blind eye to that.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.720]   I can guarantee you.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.720]   OK.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:25.280]   And if they don't, singular or AT&T won't.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.280]   I think that's very different.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.720]   I think they realize it sells Apple TVs and it doesn't do them any harm because the Apple
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:33.680]   TV is not sitting on a public network, but your phone is.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.040]   I think that's a very risky thing to--
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:39.240]   I'm sure they've made it as hack proof as they can.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.240]   Or they don't--
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.600]   I have a question yesterday.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:49.120]   Matt Howie had a really interesting post on his site, a whole lot of nothing, titled
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.520]   "Some Lingering iPhone Questions I Haven't Heard Answered Elsewhere."
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.000]   And one, I don't have an answer to.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.920]   He has six pretty good questions here.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.640]   "Do you know, Scott, whether this will have an airplane mode?
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.880]   Will there be a way?"
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.080]   I mean, given obviously you've got to have a phone plan to make the thing work, will
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.880]   you-- I mean, what we do on a plane?
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.440]   Can you shut off the phone part of it?
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.440]   Do you know?
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.080]   And still use it as a video player?
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:13.320]   I can't say for sure, but it appears that they've thought about that.
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.640]   That's about as far as I can do that.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.360]   If it didn't, they'd be crazy.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.360]   It has to.
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:22.440]   It's really-- I mean, all that means is you just turn off the transmitter.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.440]   And that--
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.440]   Right.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.600]   Like on a trio, you can shut off your phone part while you hold down the power button.
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.600]   Right.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:31.360]   I mean, most phones now you have an offline mode.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.560]   That's more than just a security issue.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:37.280]   One of the things is if it can't pick up a signal, especially when it's at 35,000 feet,
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.560]   it'll burn the battery into the ground.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:39.560]   Ah, good point.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:40.560]   You know, and so--
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.560]   Yeah, it'll be looking for a signal.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:46.240]   Yeah, it literally just goes-- and on top of that, if you're worried about getting cancer
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.240]   or anything else--
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:51.160]   It's not only dreaming of the battery, there's like a three-foot radius around your phone
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.040]   that is really hot.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.280]   Anytime it can't, I was talking to a phone engineer while I was sitting on one of my
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.280]   flights.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:03.680]   He was like, you know, there's lots of good reasons to-- the big thing is that with the
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.320]   phones on a plane, what happens is that the GSM-- I don't know.
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.960]   You guys probably know this because we're doing all these shows.
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.320]   As you hear that, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:16.480]   When the-- anytime a GSM phone is getting a call, CDMA does not do that.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:21.160]   So if you have a CDMA phone, it doesn't actually affect the audio of the-- in the plane, you
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.800]   know, when they're doing conferencing.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:27.200]   But a GSM phone will-- every time it talks to the network, you hear this clicking.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.200]   And we get that a lot in the studio.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.360]   I'm sure you get that at Leo at the--
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.480]   Yeah, so anybody who's got a GSM phone, if it's a CDMA, it won't do it.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.960]   But if it's a GSM phone, it'll click across the thing.
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.560]   And that obviously causes trouble when you're trying to talk to the tower, and then you
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.400]   end up in the wrong lane, and then you run into a plane, and bad things happen.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.400]   Bad things.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:50.960]   So then the-- but the other thing is that he explained that the other issues were-- one
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.480]   is that it'll burn the battery all the way to the ground in one flight.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:57.080]   Like one five-hour flight will burn most if you leave it on.
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:00.560]   And I've noticed that, you know, your battery is almost dead if you actually leave it on.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:05.280]   And then the second thing is, is that it's a-- if you're worried-- if you ever have any
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:09.360]   worry about radiation, the only time you should worry about it is when your phone can't find
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.360]   a signal.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.920]   Because then it's a-- it's at full power, you know, trying-- you know, reaching out, trying
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:15.920]   to find a signal.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.920]   And it's never hotter as far as RF--
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:21.520]   So you don't want to hold it very close to your genitals while it's looking for a signal.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.480]   Leaving it in your pocket-- leaving it in your pocket when it can't find a signal is,
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.480]   you know, not healthy.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.480]   I just got this--
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.480]   Why was just thinking the opposite, Merlin?
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.480]   I was just thinking the opposite, Merlin.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.480]   I'm just thinking the opposite, Merlin.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.480]   Oh, you're saying--
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.480]   --it's like vasectomy, a $500 vasectomy basically.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.480]   Exactly.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.480]   Exactly.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.360]   Of course, that's the chemo, you know, that helps that.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:43.800]   Yeah, and if you want to use your Safari in this kind of offline mode that we've talked
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:48.120]   about, you know, using things like Google Gears or whatever to allow you to do your
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:52.200]   calendar and all your other stuff and then sync up, you've got to have an offline mode.
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:53.200]   I'm pretty sure that there's no way to--
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.200]   I'm pretty shocked if they didn't--
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:57.840]   I'd be shocked if they didn't-- really, it's a question of is it in software or is there
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:01.360]   a nice switch on the side, which I really appreciate on some phones, you could just
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.360]   turn off the radio.
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.360]   Boom, what's that?
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:08.160]   Just in terms of the crazy, like, yellow submarine style guessing about stuff, I have to say,
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:13.040]   one of the most potentially fascinating-- it's like a-- it's a rumor, but more of like just
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:18.400]   crazy speculation is to just think about how the combination-- so we know that Google
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.760]   and Apple do things together and they have this relationship.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:25.920]   I just-- the idea of bringing something like Google Gears across all of the Google apps,
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.520]   first of all, on the desktop is, to me, fairly disruptive.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.520]   But then bringing that along on the phone--
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.960]   You mean disruptive in a good way for everybody, but Microsoft.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.200]   Disruptive for everybody, but Redmond, yeah.
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:41.640]   Because, I mean, that's-- if you start getting your spreadsheets and your docs, as well as
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.600]   your news and your Gmail, they don't do Gmail yet.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.640]   I think this is news, the only one, the news reader is the only one that works with Gears
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.640]   right now.
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.640]   It was the first one.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.440]   I don't know if they've added any sense, but yeah, it was the first one.
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:54.280]   I mean, you think about adding the offline, so all of a sudden, the not having iMap wouldn't
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.720]   be as big a deal as it is for me right now.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:01.120]   I would never switch to Gmail exclusively just because it doesn't do iMap.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:04.880]   But that idea of having all that stuff work on your desktop as an app that you can use
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:09.760]   on a plane and conversely having that sync and work with your phone, that makes me raise
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:10.760]   an eyebrow.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:16.520]   I mean, again, I'm not saying this is going to happen, but that would be a hell of a play.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:20.800]   What else did Matt say didn't-- were unanswered questions?
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.800]   Maybe Mr. iPhone app--
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.000]   Yeah, he had a really good one.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   I like this number three.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   He says, "The interfaces look fantastic, but is the music player going to be something
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.560]   I can use by feel?"
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:32.920]   And I take his point because, you know, I've almost-- as my wife has pointed out to me,
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.600]   I've almost screamed a couple of vehicles playing with my GPS.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.760]   You know, you can work an iPod pretty well with a no look.
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.360]   And so, you know, how much will this be like a good freestanding player that you can just
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.880]   kind of work?
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.840]   Will you have to be in cover flow, for example, to fly through lists?
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.320]   Do you know anything about that sky?
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.600]   Is there another view besides cover flow from moving through stuff?
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.480]   There's some audio feedback that might help.
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:30:00.840]   And one of the issues I wonder about is-- and I've received several emails from listeners
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.120]   about this from people who are visually impaired.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.120]   They're like, "Well, am I going to be able to use this phone?"
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.120]   Right.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.400]   Because they're used to buttons they can tactfully feel.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:15.240]   And I put it, once again, an unanswered question in the app about that.
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.400]   I don't know how that could work, frankly.
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.400]   I think not.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.840]   That's a really good point.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:20.840]   That had not occurred to me at all.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:24.400]   I think it does the ADA require, if you make a device, it'd be accessible, and I'll think
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.400]   they do.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:30.600]   Well, I think the answer is that the audio feedback technically fulfills that requirement,
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.520]   but there is some audio feedback, Merlin.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:37.640]   And whether or not that's going to be sufficient, we can surely answer this question about his
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.640]   six questions.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.640]   We'll know the answer to all of them on the 29.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:45.720]   The other one of his that I thought was good is there going to be a way to shut off CSS
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:50.320]   in Safari and actually our friend Chris Weatherall responds by saying that he had a chance to
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:54.600]   play with an iPhone and saw that it indeed doesn't seem to do the sideways scrolling.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.720]   Why would you want to shut off CSS?
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:03.040]   Because some CSS, if you make a div that's 1,200 pixels and do it absolute positioning
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.360]   or whatever, it's off the page.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:06.920]   Well now it's Safari currently.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:10.120]   You can have your own CSS.
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.920]   You can override the CSS.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:12.920]   Most browsers let you do that.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.280]   Yeah, well, a new web does that.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.280]   But yeah, it's interesting.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:21.080]   And one of the things I think Blazer actually does fairly okay is the way that it renders
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.080]   web pages.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.240]   That's the browser in your trio.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:27.720]   And your trio, I'm sometimes surprised with how well it handles even putting in images
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.440]   and stuff like that.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.760]   But yeah, so anyway, that's good to know.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:38.960]   Well, it's clear that Safari unmodified is not a good browser for a cell phone.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:42.440]   So one would hope that they've made a lot of modifications to make it better for the
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.440]   iPhone.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.280]   You know, I'm going to play Scott for a minute here and say, I'm just going to guess that
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.520]   the Safari experience on this is going to be pretty nice.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:51.160]   Yeah, that's a big selling point for them.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:55.680]   And just, you know, as far as like we always like, oh, but they made the iPod blah, blah,
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.680]   blah, blah.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.800]   You know, this is one thing I think I have a feeling they're going to get this part of
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:05.120]   it right is having the browser be good because that to me has a lot of wow factor to it.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.240]   And by the same token, if you bought this quote, unquote smartphone or I guess I don't
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:11.880]   know if they're calling it a smartphone, but if you buy a web browser phone and you call
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.600]   it Safari and it sucks, that's going to really disappoint people.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:15.760]   Well, let me ask you this.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:20.000]   What's the chances are that it will be as bad as all the other ones that are currently
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.360]   out there because there's a lot of bad ones out there, right?
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:25.040]   Well, you know, we go down this road sometimes.
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.040]   I don't think we can play.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:27.040]   Only be an improvement.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:28.040]   In fact, we can't play.
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.040]   No, we can't play.
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.040]   The phone needs to do.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.640]   It just needs just to probably satisfy most people.
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.120]   We're not talking uber geeks.
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.600]   Well, I kind of disagree, Scott.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.720]   We can't play both sides of the street on this moderately good because so many of the
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:44.560]   phones I've tried just completely suck over the you can't play both sides of the street
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:47.960]   on this on the one hand, we're saying that this is going to be so fundamentally different
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.960]   and better that it represents a paradigmatic shift in this space.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.720]   That's really different from saying it's not as bad as blazer.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:58.680]   So I mean, I think it's reasonable to have expectations that, you know, may not be reasonable
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:01.400]   to have those expectations, but I can see people saying, you know, I really want this
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.200]   to be a wow kind of product.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:07.920]   Well, believe me, I do too, but I just I'm wondering that I just ask him the question.
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:11.320]   Yeah, I will admit that I'll be happy if I can use it.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:17.280]   I mean, I don't find any of the phone browser or something that I would actually, I mostly
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.880]   just swear at them, especially at edge speeds.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:25.160]   Yeah, you just like, Oh my God, you know, so so the idea of being able to just and you
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.440]   know, here in San Francisco, the ability to get to a Wi-Fi is pretty easy.
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.880]   I'm like, you know, that that was the interesting thing I thought about that that I thought was
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:35.200]   interesting is that you may have to buy a data plan, whether you're going to use it
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:39.560]   or not, because I know for me, I am almost never going to use the data plan.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.680]   I mean, all I'm going to all I really care about is the Wi-Fi.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:46.560]   I wonder though, Alex, I wonder I'm going to talk out of my butt for a minute as I often
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.560]   do.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:51.200]   I wonder how much I'm thinking I want to call it port blocking.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:56.640]   I wonder what protocols they're going to allow and what sort of, you know, if there's going
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.760]   to be some ways that they're going to manage the kinds of traffic that you're allowed to
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:00.760]   search.
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.920]   It's been rumored that the ports that you would need for Skype and that type of thing
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.560]   are going to be shut off.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:06.560]   Right, right, right.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.080]   You know, so you're not going to be able to use Skype on this phone.
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.760]   You know, you're not going to probably be able to use Skype on anything until Apple releases
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:16.440]   something that is just like it without a phone.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.520]   You know, I mean, you know, and I don't know when, and that's what I would prefer.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:20.840]   I mean, we've talked about that in the past.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:26.240]   I mean, I don't really need, you know, but I'd rather have a cheap, you know, crappy
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:30.400]   little phone than I just, you know, I don't talk on the phone very much though.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:34.000]   And I just feel the conversation with that.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.080]   Speaking of GPS, there is a rumor that Apple is going to do a GPS unit of its own.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.680]   Any credibility to that?
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:44.280]   And it's not related to the iPhone, this rumor.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.280]   Right.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.840]   Apple owned GPS unit.
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.960]   There's been a lot of rumors for two or three years.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.600]   Why would they do that?
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:54.040]   Well, it's just another, it's a, it is a killer app.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:59.120]   You know, when GPS is actually integrated properly into a system, I mean, there is an
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.360]   enormous industry that's waiting.
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:04.320]   Oh, so you're saying build it into the Mac books or something like that?
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:08.080]   Well, build it into everything or make it available as an extra peripheral that works
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.080]   with your Mac.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:12.920]   One thing that is true is that a lot of these GPS devices don't work on Macs.
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.480]   There's a Sprint application.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:18.640]   I'm in there a little ambassador thing, so I get these phones with unlimited service
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.400]   on them to be able to try everything out.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.720]   And something I would never use because it would just blow through a data plan like crazy.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:28.200]   But the reason phones I've been getting have a pretty nice built-in program.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.520]   Tell a nav or something.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.520]   I want to say something like on demand, I think it's called.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:37.080]   And so, I mean, but this, this to me, the first time I opened this up, it blew my mind
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:41.600]   because I opened it up and I went to the map and there was a little tick box for saying
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.840]   show me where I am.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.520]   And it places you right on a map and you can then go out.
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:48.800]   It's not super easy to use, but you can then go out and say, well, show me nearby, you
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.520]   know, whatever ATM, show me how to get here from here to there.
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:56.240]   You can also buy turn-by-turn directions from that point.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.240]   That's right.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.240]   That's right.
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:00.520]   But if you add to the mix, imagine them getting into a relationship with somebody like Yahoo
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.200]   or Google in terms of local.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:05.400]   Everybody knows locals where a lot of the dough is going to be in the next few years.
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:10.400]   If you had some way to have those local services advertising and that kind of place-based
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.440]   cover stuff going on, that's a lot of dough.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:18.040]   And if you come from a content point of view, from Apple's point of view on iTunes, what
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:24.360]   if you were able to, for instance, let's say, download an MP3 that was accessed at different
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:31.080]   times based on your GPS point, you could do a tour of Route 66.
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:34.880]   And what it does is it plays music and tells you all the history about Route 66 and then
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.880]   right when you get to something that says, oh, by the way, to the left is this or--
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.120]   The whole world becomes a museum tour.
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.120]   So you get that basically POIs.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:44.520]   You get a POI files for certain areas.
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:45.520]   And that would be really cool.
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.320]   Well, I mean, the idea of location-based services is huge.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.840]   I mean, you can go on and on.
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.320]   I mean, obviously, this is a coming thing with--
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.320]   So much money there.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.840]   Somebody who can get that right.
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:55.840]   I think that--
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:56.840]   I think that--
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:57.840]   I think that--
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:58.840]   I think that--
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:36:59.840]   I think that--
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:00.840]   I think that--
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:01.840]   I think that--
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:02.840]   I think that--
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:03.840]   I think that--
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:04.840]   --he'll answer to your question, Leo.
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:05.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:06.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:08.840]   I mean, well, I don't understand why Apple would make a standalone GPS handheld GPS unit or, you know,
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:09.840]   a lot of different devices.
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.200]   So what is the rumor, though?
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.960]   Is it that they want a GPS enable their laptops or is it--
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.960]   I mean, they're not even put in the cell phone.
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:19.960]   The words were stand-alone GPS.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:20.960]   Yes.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:21.960]   See, that's what I don't get.
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:25.720]   But I think that could also be the first step towards something more complicated.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:30.200]   So you have-- stand-alone that feeds everything that they already have.
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.200]   And then you would obviously see that getting built into more and more stuff.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.200]   I mean, I--
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.840]   It's so cheap and easy to build GPS.
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:38.800]   And I mean, like I said, many phones now, including this phone, have GPS.
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.800]   I mean, GPS is--
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:45.520]   I mean, now you can get a little UP, a USB thing that will follow you around and give
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.560]   you all the data and then you can pop it into your computer.
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.560]   Right.
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.080]   So that's why-- I think that would make sense for Apple.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:54.760]   I don't understand why they would want to do a Garmin Nuvi style standalone unit and
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:59.600]   try to compete with Garmin and Magellan and Tom Tom and Mio and all these other companies
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:00.600]   in this space.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.600]   Unless they--
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:02.600]   Go ahead.
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:03.600]   Go ahead.
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:08.160]   They might have some sort of plan to let you link that to the iPhone and somehow take that
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.160]   data with you.
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:10.160]   I'm not sure.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.160]   Right.
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.960]   All I know is ever since I got a Nuvi, I don't get lost as much.
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:14.960]   I think you're great.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:15.960]   I love them.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:19.400]   Well, you know, do you have the one that you can walk around with, Merlin?
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.400]   Mm-hmm.
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.960]   You have the one that you can walk with and it still tells you what to do?
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:23.960]   Yeah.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:24.960]   You can-- there's a setting where you can go in.
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:25.960]   It's a Nuvi 360.
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:29.600]   And you can go in and say, "Are you on a car or motorcycle?
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.600]   Are you on foot?"
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.840]   Et cetera.
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:35.840]   And it's-- I mean, we used it in Rhode Island and it was just fantastic to be able to say,
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:38.200]   "Okay, well, show me nearby sandwich places.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.200]   Where can I get seafood?"
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.200]   And you're here.
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.200]   Oh, I have the same one.
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.200]   It's really good.
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.200]   Yeah, it is.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.840]   It's a little-- I had to really-- I had when I very first got it because I'm a dork.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:50.400]   I did like use it constantly for really stupid stuff and you really got to watch it.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.400]   You know what I mean?
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.680]   Like using it while you're driving is a bad idea.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:54.680]   But--
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:55.680]   Yeah.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:56.680]   It talks to you.
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:59.520]   And the only-- my only other tip for the Nuvi is set it to turn the backlight off very
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:03.720]   quickly because it will continue to talk to you and-- because that thing just blows through
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.720]   power if you leave the backlight on it.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:08.720]   And I like the Western Australia voice.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:10.200]   We tried that.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.200]   We tried-- I think it was Emily.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.760]   We tried the English woman for a while.
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:18.040]   But here's the cool thing about the Australia voice because I also live in Washington whenever
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:23.160]   it sees a Washington state highway instead of saying Washington state route 16, she always
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.640]   goes, "Western Australia 16."
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.280]   Oh, how funny.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.840]   It's terribly funny.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.720]   So she's reading abbreviations.
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:35.640]   She reads abbreviations as if they were Australian every single time.
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:36.640]   I can't get over it.
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.880]   Yeah, I have a little meo that I hang around my neck.
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.680]   It's for foot travel.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:43.640]   And it's very handy if you're in a-- I got it for Vancouver.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:44.640]   So I could find one.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.160]   Well, you know what it's great for if you're like me and you're just not very smart.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:51.240]   I'll add a-- once again, one of my embarrassing revelations.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.240]   I used to-- I used to do stuff like sometimes I'll take a photograph.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:55.400]   How do I get home from you?
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.400]   I'm hungry.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.400]   Hey, man.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.360]   I'll-- you know, there's a trick of like photographing where you are in a parking garage.
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.920]   You're in a really big, like, huge--
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.520]   You don't use GPS to find your car, do you?
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.520]   I make a waypoint.
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.520]   I make a waypoint.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:08.520]   It's just my car.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:09.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.520]   Hey, you know.
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:13.120]   Turn left at the yellow Buick.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.120]   You're getting close to your car.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:20.120]   You're starting to refine me of the character in that new HBO show, John from Cincinnati.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:21.600]   Some things I know, some things I don't.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:25.400]   All I know is I'm becoming a lot more like Mr. McGoo than I'd really like.
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:28.840]   Yeah, it's actually encouraging for those of us as we get older because now really pretty
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:32.880]   much technology is designed to take over where our brains leave off.
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:34.720]   I use Google-assisted memory all the time.
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.720]   I don't remember anything, but I can find it fast.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.360]   I've brainwashed my brain leaves off a lot, Leo.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:39.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.040]   When I need to point it up, I don't even think about trying to spell it.
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.960]   I mean, I just kind of bang something that's close to it into the Google--
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.960]   Did you mean serendipity?
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:46.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.960]   You guys loaded up-- have you guys loaded up any POI files?
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:50.960]   Any what?
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.960]   I mean, like, you can go out, like, for example--
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:53.960]   That's a good experience.
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:54.960]   Points of interest.
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:55.960]   You can go out.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:59.280]   I file all of the traffic cameras.
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:00.280]   Right.
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.880]   And it'll let you know when one's coming up.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:07.160]   There's also a really great website out there that I can get for show notes that lets you
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:13.320]   take a Google Map, a KML file, and turn it into a waypoints file for your newbie or
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:14.560]   for your whatever.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:19.640]   So you can make a trip in Google Earth, export that as a KML, and then bring that into your--
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:22.840]   So if you're going somewhere and you want to see, like, remember we're all the--
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:26.960]   Or your friend staying or whatever, you can put all that into your newbie when you go.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:27.960]   Does it do this?
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:28.960]   I made my own.
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:29.960]   You made your own POIs?
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.160]   Yeah, I can't discuss what the POIs are.
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:34.160]   Oh, god, I can still imagine.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.920]   There's also a protocol called Mac Simple GPS.
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:40.760]   I think it's a little Java app when we open it up that will let you go in and edit your
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:41.760]   own.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.320]   If you have a lot of time to kill, this stuff is a lot of fun.
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.320]   I'll just--
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:48.560]   I do have to admit that I'm just a lot more adventurous when I have the TomTom because
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.240]   I always know that I can get--
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.240]   Yeah, I know I can find it.
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:52.240]   I'm off Market Street.
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.400]   Like, otherwise I never go off Market Street.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.400]   I'm a lot--
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.400]   It's so much--
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.200]   South of Market or North of Market, right?
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:41:59.680]   I'm in Chinatown and I'm tired.
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:00.680]   I want to go home.
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:05.480]   I don't even know how someone operates in LA without a GPS because that's what got me.
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:10.720]   It's the road trips that I have to do once a month in LA and have all these meetings.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:14.600]   And I just-- I can't even imagine doing those without my GPS because I just sit there and
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:15.600]   type it in.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.040]   I don't need any directions or anything else.
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:22.840]   The thing I love that Merlin mentioned is like, you know, you're hungry and you see
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.560]   like a dairy queen or something and you're just desperate and you're thinking you'll
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:30.240]   go but you can punch in restaurants and then you find out two blocks away there's a four
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.240]   star restaurant you didn't know about.
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.240]   Right.
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:36.040]   Very handy for gas and stuff too.
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:41.760]   So how long is the iPhone buzz going to continue?
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:46.000]   Will be in the iPhone zone for how long before Apple then moves on to other new products.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   Is this going to be a three month period where we just talk about the iPhone or--
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.560]   Well, I'm already getting email from people going, what about version 2.0?
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:55.560]   It's gone.
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.800]   Well, I'm sure we'll start talking about that pretty quick.
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:04.200]   I think Apple will want to have other things going on by the middle of July.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.200]   But I think that we're going to--
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.200]   What will it be?
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:10.640]   For instance, I'm most interested in when I'm going to get an iPhone iPod.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.160]   Well, I mean that--
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.840]   An iPod without the phone.
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:15.840]   That's what I want.
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:16.840]   That's what everybody wants.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.760]   I have to admit, after you look at the iPhone, you look at your iPod now, your video iPod
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.360]   and you're like, come on, when am I going to get something?
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.840]   I predict three weeks after the iPhone comes out.
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:30.400]   They're going to say, oh, by the way, time more than anything.
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:31.400]   More than anything.
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:32.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:36.160]   I think that the iMacs are getting long on the tooth.
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:39.400]   I think we'll probably do for a rev sometime this summer.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:43.480]   Apple Insider says mid to late summer.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:50.280]   It will radically redesign 20 and 24-inch Mac iMac that will be both slimmer and sleeker.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.840]   It will represent the first major industrial design overhaul to hit the flagship all-in-one
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:56.640]   consumer Apple desktop in three years.
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:59.320]   Seventeen inch will not be touched.
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:02.040]   I don't believe they're going to make any more seventeenes.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.040]   Interesting.
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:06.040]   And then I think that the--
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:10.000]   So the mini will be gone, the 17 will be gone.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   No 12-inch power book.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.280]   Is that just going to get bigger and bigger and bigger?
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:18.320]   Laying the groundwork for the nine to 12-inch portable that I think is going to be the way.
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:19.320]   I've changed my mind.
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:20.320]   I'm going even further down.
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:24.160]   I'm going from-- I'm going from wanting the 12-inch to--
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:26.560]   You want a line inch that swells to 12-inch?
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:29.320]   Isn't that what it's going to be?
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:32.320]   It's going to ship with all the Beatles songs and it's going to be yellow.
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.560]   Rub it, it turns into a briefcase.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:35.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.160]   Very small suitcase.
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:43.240]   I think that we're going to also-- I think hopefully we're going to see a real eight
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.120]   processor machine too.
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:49.120]   Because I think that the machines that we got right now are what we can do a processor.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:55.920]   But they're really four processor machines that they're putting eight processors into.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:59.600]   And I think that they're-- I think what we really need to see are ones where they brought
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:05.240]   up all of the infrastructure around the processors to really feed them properly.
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:10.640]   And so I think for performance, I mean, I know we're trying to stall buying too many
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:11.640]   machines.
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:12.640]   Yeah, I would stall right now.
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:13.640]   Totally.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:17.040]   Something's going to happen.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:21.560]   Some interesting and kind of depressing news for Apple fans in terms of security.
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:26.600]   Of course, last week, the Safari for Windows came out and immediately-- well, first of
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:29.040]   all, 1 million downloads, which is amazing.
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:31.680]   But also immediately a number of security vulnerabilities.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.800]   At last count, over 100 have been discovered.
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:36.160]   And Apple's issued three patches.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.160]   Here's the thing.
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:40.120]   These security vulnerabilities are very-- we talked about this Merlin on Twitter very much
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:47.280]   like the kinds of security vulnerabilities we've seen for years in Windows.
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.320]   And the thinking is-- and I've read some more.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:53.440]   My contention on Twit was, well, I think that's just because you're now in a Windows environment
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:56.360]   and all the hackers now are looking at you.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:00.080]   It's not that Safari-- Apple tried to say that most secure-- what do they say?
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:03.880]   Built secure from the ground up.
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:07.720]   And now I've just read an article by one hacker and said, yeah, we use fuzzer, which
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:12.680]   is a well-known-- not hacker, but security company, which is a well-known Windows-based
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:15.320]   tool for finding vulnerabilities.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:19.280]   There are a lot of tools on the Windows side for cracking this stuff.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:24.080]   It just shows you that maybe all along, people have been saying Apple succeeds is secure by
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.080]   obscurity.
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:26.080]   It might be right.
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:29.560]   I mean, boy, the Safari turned out to be a full of holes.
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:32.840]   Well, Safari is, but we still haven't seen them go over to the Mac OS.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:35.520]   Well, because they don't have those tools on the Mac size, what I'm saying.
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:40.880]   So as soon as Apple puts out a program on Windows and all the tools are available to
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:42.880]   attack it, they find all these holes.
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:46.560]   I mean, I'm not here to apologize for Apple, but could that also be a result of just having
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:47.560]   so many more eyeballs?
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:49.760]   I mean, along the lines of-- Yes.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:54.200]   That's why open source works is because there's so many people banging on it.
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:58.480]   And now that that's something that all those folks can use, I mean, I don't know.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:00.920]   I guess I'm kind of not surprised.
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:04.520]   And like I said, on Twitch, I guess I also don't really understand, because I'm not
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:07.400]   very smart, exactly where these vulnerabilities occur.
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:10.920]   And I wonder how much of it is in the safari-ness of it.
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:11.920]   No, it's just safari.
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:13.360]   It's in how safari handles URLs.
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:15.560]   So it's absolutely safari.
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:16.560]   It's pretty cool.
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.560]   Yeah, it's absolutely safari.
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:28.040]   So I mean, I guess if all I'm saying here is it may be a clue to why Macs are more secure,
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:32.160]   and it's not, unfortunately, that they're inherently more secure, but merely that the
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:35.840]   tools and all the attackers and all the eyeballs are on the windows side.
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:39.320]   And as soon as Apple puts out-- I mean, Apple touted this.
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:44.560]   They said, Apple's engineers designed safari to be secure from day one.
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:49.080]   It was only four hours later that the first holes were found.
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.720]   I guess they need to regroup.
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:58.800]   Well, I just think that it's-- I mean, maybe it's just maybe in defense of windows a little
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:47:59.800]   bit.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:05.200]   I've been absolutely one of the people who's been scathing on Microsoft security, but
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:11.040]   it may just be that nobody's secure, nobody's impossible to fully secure program, and you're
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:15.960]   just such a target in the windows side that you're going to-- if there's anything wrong
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.960]   at all, they're going to find it right away, and apparently they have.
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:19.960]   You know what the man--
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:20.960]   So the man--
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:23.200]   He says, he says, "Locks just keep the honest neighbors on it."
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.200]   That's right.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:25.200]   That's really true.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.400]   But a shotgun keeps everybody honest.
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:28.400]   There you go.
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.400]   I like that one good.
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.400]   You said that too.
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:36.000]   Hey, any other stories you want to cover before we move on to our picks?
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   No.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   Let's go to pick.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   Let's go to pick.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   iPhone.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.200]   I'm exhausted and hungry.
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.200]   Me too.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.200]   All right.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.200]   We're tied for a pick.
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.080]   Coming up in just a little bit, we're going to give you our software picks of the week, but
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:50.600]   before we do that, it's time for our Audible pick of the week.
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:55.280]   Yes, once again, we thank the folks at Audible for their support of this podcast, and they're
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.280]   going to give you a free book.
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:59.440]   You can really pretty-- if you're in the US, and I have to say this, I apologize.
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:03.120]   A lot of our international audiences written and said, "Well, I can't get all the books,
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:04.880]   and I know they're not all available.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:08.680]   That's due to restrictions, copy restrictions in the publishing industry.
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:10.520]   There's not anything we can do about it.
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:16.400]   But if you are in the US, you can get a free book from Audible, any of Audible's books.
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:20.280]   However, we like to recommend a book, and this time Scott Bourne has a book he wants to
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:22.280]   recommend from a guy with no hair.
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:25.000]   Yeah, I'm heading that direction.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.520]   So I wasn't talking about you, but yeah, that could be true too.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:30.160]   Now we're talking about Seth Godin.
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:35.720]   Seth Godin has a book that you can get on Audible.com, which I got on Audible.com called
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:36.720]   The Big Moon.
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:39.880]   Stop trying to be perfect and start being remarkable.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:41.600]   Seth is a marketing guy, right?
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:44.680]   He's a marketing guru.
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:48.640]   He writes stuff that a lot of times leave me thinking that he's really good at asking
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:52.120]   questions and not necessarily answering them.
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:55.160]   Not half the time though he writes stuff that I find brilliant.
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:59.720]   This book's interesting because he interviewed 32 big thinkers.
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:09.440]   In fact, Mark Cuban, Guy Kawasaki, Ballmer, all kinds of people wanted to find out what
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.760]   happened when you did something astonishing.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:18.080]   For instance, the people that thought of Tevo or overnight shipping and FedEx.
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:21.080]   These are big moves in the parlance of this book.
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:27.200]   I just particularly enjoy anything that has to do with avoiding mediocrity.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:29.440]   That's really where this book is going.
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:32.960]   I'm into business, of course, so it's a business book.
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:37.840]   If you have any interest in running your own business, doing your own marketing, or just
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:42.920]   learning more about how these really big move events were created, you'll probably find
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:46.000]   this to be a pretty interesting book.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:51.560]   It's rated by the 234 people in Audible at 3.75 stars, which is pretty decent.
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:53.080]   Yeah, on a bridge.
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:58.080]   It's three hours, 42 minutes, and it's 15.95.
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:02.280]   The guy charges like 1,500 bucks an hour to consult, so not a bad deal.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:03.280]   Stop.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:04.640]   This is actually our show motto.
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:08.440]   Stop trying to be perfect and start trying to be remarkable.
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:09.920]   We don't have to worry about the perfect.
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:11.480]   Oh, I think we're remarkable.
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:13.080]   No question about that.
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:15.080]   Remarkable doesn't mean necessarily good.
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:18.520]   You know, a lot of the spot-cashes look well out there and try and be perfect.
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:21.520]   No, we gave up on that ages ago.
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:24.160]   Remarkable, I think we handle.
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:28.240]   Yes, Seth is a very popular speaker, as you say.
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:32.440]   He's around a lot and is very widely regarded.
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:37.240]   The big move is, as you said, 15.95, except that it's free right now.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:42.480]   If you're in the US and you're a new Audible subscriber, I mean a new Audible subscriber,
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:46.880]   you may leave your clothes on, go to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:52.320]   Now we haven't yet kind of wired this whole thing up so that you actually get the book
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:55.000]   on the page, so you'll have to do a search for Goden.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.960]   You'll see actually some of his other books, too, G-O-D-I-N.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:00.160]   The big move is the one that Scott wants you to get.
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.400]   That is audible.com/macbreak.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.600]   We thank Audible for their support.
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:11.080]   Now, ladies and gentlemen, our picks of the week.
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:12.640]   Who wants to start here?
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:15.040]   Merlin, you want to go, you start.
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:16.040]   Sure.
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:19.440]   Yeah, this is going to be kind of a weird geeky one.
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:27.000]   But I noticed somebody had slipped an interesting suggestion into the MBW ideas, which is talking
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.520]   about something that our favorite program, Quicksilver, does, that I am actually very
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:34.160]   fond of and not that many people know about.
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:38.120]   So we'll take it as red that you know Quicksilver is it's an application for interacting with
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:39.560]   your Mac on many levels.
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:42.640]   It's kind of an application launcher, but it does a lot more.
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:45.920]   What people may not know is that there's this really neat thing called triggers, and triggers
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:51.040]   enable you to basically usually associate, say, a key command with a certain Quicksilver
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:52.040]   thing.
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:53.520]   So, for example, I can have a check my mail for me.
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.240]   I can have it upload a file.
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:56.240]   You know, whatever.
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:59.080]   You can create and associate it with an F key or whatever you want to do.
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:03.200]   What a lot of people don't know is that there's this really cool little thing called mouse
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.200]   drag triggers.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:07.920]   And I wanted to bubble this up because if you're a nerd and you like Quicksilver, you
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.520]   should give this a shot.
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:13.240]   Basically, you can go out and identify things like sides of your screen, corners of your
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:19.640]   screen, and key combinations and associate things dropped onto those areas with Quicksilver
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.560]   commands.
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:22.960]   So how would you use this?
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:25.880]   Well, one thing that's nice about Quicksilver as we all know is it's you're creating functional
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:26.960]   sentences.
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:32.480]   This is one way to think of this is that those corners and those sides provide the verb,
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:37.800]   like for example, when I drop something on here, upload this to this particular FTP site.
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:42.120]   When I drop this here, drop whatever I opened in speed download and start downloading it.
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:46.040]   When I drop a string of text here, automatically create a new email and so on.
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:50.560]   And then the noun part of that or the object, I guess, is provided by whatever you drop.
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:55.480]   This is super fast, super great way to if there's something that you're doing constantly,
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:58.880]   you can come up with a really cool little mouse drag command.
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:00.600]   How many different regions are there?
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:02.720]   I'm going to pull it up.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:03.720]   There's a lot.
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:05.560]   It's not just the four corners then.
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:09.080]   Well, no, because so let me see, mouse, drop.
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:10.080]   Let's see.
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:13.160]   I need to go make a fakey one first.
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:14.560]   Hang on.
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:19.300]   Well, as memory serves, you've got the left, right, top, bottom, and then you've got the
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:22.280]   corners and then you can do a key command for each one of those.
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:23.800]   So you could say command shift.
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:24.800]   We have a modifier.
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:25.800]   Okay.
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:26.800]   Drag into the right side.
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:30.320]   And it's neat because for example, the one I use a lot is like I said, I'll drag something
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:34.920]   like an mp3 or whatever, I'll drag onto speed download, which is my lower right hand corner.
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:36.960]   And that'll start doing it for me.
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:40.960]   So it's left, right, up, down, and then you can do command option shift control function
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:43.200]   caps lock in any combination you want.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:46.360]   So you can do the math on how many of those you end up getting.
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:50.600]   So again, I mean, I think transmit, for example, is one of the great underutilized silver
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:51.600]   supporting apps.
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:55.280]   If you find yourself constantly dropping something into the same FTP folder, you can
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:58.000]   totally automate this by dropping it onto a corner.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.200]   Of course, transmittent allows you to make--
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.200]   Docs end.
[00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:04.960]   And there's an icon that you sit on the best time.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:06.240]   Got transmittent so good.
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:08.640]   There's so many-- they give you so many great ways to do stuff.
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:12.480]   But anyway, if you're looking for a nerdy way to extend your Quicksilver love, this is,
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:15.720]   I would call this a moderate to kind of more advanced tip.
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:19.840]   But look into-- I mean, and then of course, we can go even further.
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:23.440]   You can do things now where you can do keystrokes, for example, like not keystrokes, but you could
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:28.280]   draw on screen with something called Abra-Cadabra and it will-- you draw a big S and it saves
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:30.120]   the document or whatever.
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:36.200]   There's endless ways to interface with Quicksilver and I suggest trying mouse drag triggers.
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:37.200]   Excellent.
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.200]   Is that--
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:39.200]   Nerd.
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:41.520]   Nerd Quicksilver is free, which is nice.
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:43.840]   It's Quicksilver.blacktree.net.
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:44.840]   Calm.
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:45.840]   Calm.
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:46.840]   I always do that.
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:47.840]   Calm.
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:48.840]   You have.
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:49.840]   You-- we did that on Macbreak too.
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:50.840]   I've done that many a time.
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:51.840]   Are you using Quicksilver these days?
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:52.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:53.840]   Nonstop.
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:54.840]   Constantly.
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:55.840]   What's your favorite Quicksilver thing right now?
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:56.840]   What do you use it for a lot?
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:03.080]   I use-- I've tried your text, adding-- penning to text and I have all those things set up,
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:07.680]   lots of triggers set up, but I'm pretty much-- you know, it's the command space and type
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:08.680]   the first few letters.
[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:11.560]   That's pretty much what I do all the time.
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:15.360]   I start-- you know how I'm always bitching about Spotlight and how I hate the UI for Spotlight?
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:17.640]   I started using Quicksilver as my way into Spotlight.
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:21.320]   You can search just several ways you can search Spotlight from inside of Quicksilver.
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:25.360]   So you can hit period to start entering your terms and then say you want to open that in
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:27.400]   a Spotlight window and it's a lot faster.
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:30.880]   The independent pop-up mystery meet window is a lot faster than going through the thing
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:31.880]   in the upper right corner.
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:32.880]   Cool.
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:34.520]   Hey, this is kind of related.
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:39.040]   This is another application that allows you to drag and drop.
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:42.800]   And I have to thank CB for sending this along as an email and a recommendation.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:46.000]   And, you know, I-- there's so many great programs out there.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.320]   I probably wouldn't have paid too much attention to it, even though I trust CB's recommendations
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:51.680]   until I saw that it was from Michael Sy.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:57.040]   The guy at C-Command who does SpamSiv, a great programmer, does really great software.
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:58.720]   And it's called Eagle Filer.
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:56:59.720]   Have you tried this yet?
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:01.360]   Yeah, I played with it.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:02.360]   It looks pretty cool.
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:04.640]   We've talked about your Jimbo before and I use your Jimbo.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:08.600]   This is one-- this is in that category of kind of note-taking applications.
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:12.240]   And Jimbo's been my default for a long time because it has a lot of nice features like
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:18.640]   syncing through the iDISC and it has a lot of command keys.
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:21.120]   It's got a little drop panel and so forth.
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:23.640]   But one thing that I don't like about you, Jimbo, and a lot of people complain about
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:24.720]   is the lack of folders.
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:27.760]   So this may be-- this may be the response.
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:31.640]   Eagle Filer, $40, but free for 30 days, uses Growl.
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:33.400]   F1 is the default key.
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:36.640]   Press F1 when you're on a web page, it'll drop it in.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:39.680]   Or email or pretty much anything.
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:44.400]   A couple of things I like about it, instead of using a proprietary database, it uses core
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:45.400]   data.
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:47.480]   So it is very Mac-centric.
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:48.480]   Fantastic.
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:50.120]   I think core data is really important.
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:53.400]   It is a great built-in database in the Mac.
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:55.440]   And I'm glad they use it.
[00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:56.440]   Everything's stored in a library.
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:59.840]   I keep my library on my iDISC, so it syncs automatically.
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:03.320]   You can browse the contents of the library in the Finder or the Pathfinder.
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:07.760]   So even though it's stored in core data and it uses all-- it has all the speed and functionality
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:14.200]   of a database, it is browsable as text files, which I think can even be edited in your favorite
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:15.200]   applications.
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:17.560]   So it's kind of a best of both worlds.
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:20.880]   You can tag and add notes to any data.
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:23.860]   It's an interesting-- if you're looking for ways to keep track-- by the way, multiple
[00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:25.120]   libraries too.
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:29.760]   It combines nice features of a lot of applications.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:30.760]   It's a little like you Jimbo.
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:32.240]   It's a little like Devin Think.
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:37.520]   It's got that what's called notational velocity kind of fast substring like searching.
[00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:38.680]   You know, you had searching.
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:39.680]   I like that.
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:40.680]   And the tagging.
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:42.400]   It looks like the tagging works with mail tags too.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:43.400]   That's pretty cool.
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:44.960]   Built-in PDF viewing.
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:46.280]   Good take.
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:50.960]   Well, and I-- you know, it's funny because I have every one of these from circus cronies
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:53.080]   and note taker and all of them.
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:56.160]   Because I'm always looking for the perfect one.
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.880]   And this is just another one to try.
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:01.480]   And everyone has its own pluses and minuses.
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:04.800]   I pretty much settled on your Jimbo for a long time, but I'm really looking at Eagle
[00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:05.800]   Filer.
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:10.880]   And by the way, it does import from other-- I believe it'll import for your other notebooks,
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:13.480]   making it easy for you to try it.
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:16.440]   It has some interesting features that you might want to take a look.
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:17.440]   Well, I'll just tell you what.
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:18.440]   Just take a look at it.
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:20.280]   It's free to try.
[00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:21.560]   And $40 to buy.
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:24.800]   It's from c-command.com Eagle Filer.
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:30.520]   From the same guy who does the-- simply the best anti-spam filter on the Macintosh Spam
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:32.800]   Civ, Michael Sy.
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:35.320]   That's my pick for the week.
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:36.880]   Scott Borne, you got one for us?
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.560]   Well, let me unglaze my eyes here for a minute.
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:41.880]   Ah, you bored.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:43.160]   Let's talk about something cool.
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:44.880]   It's not that hard to understand.
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:45.880]   OK.
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:48.680]   Cash out X. Has anybody ever heard of that?
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:49.680]   No, what's that?
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:54.720]   It is a cool program that deletes, clears your cash file, swap files, all that buro.
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:59.760]   You know, when I got my Mac understanding, I was always thinking, you know, it was cool.
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.240]   You could just delete programs by dragging them to the trash.
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:07.200]   And then one day I realized I had 2.9 million files that were unrelated to anything.
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:11.520]   And it's because these cash files and swap files from all these different things from
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:15.480]   browsers and browser histories were still there and some application leftovers.
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:19.600]   And this thing clears anything that's laying in your cash out for you.
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:20.600]   And it's free.
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:21.600]   Cool.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:22.600]   Cash out X.
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:24.800]   Cash out X.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:28.440]   And I founded it a place called MacGamesInMore.com.
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:29.440]   Cool.
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:30.440]   Thanks, by the way, again.
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:32.280]   Thanks, only a version of the track as well.
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:33.280]   Say again?
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.240]   And you can find it at version tracker as well.
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:36.240]   OK.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.680]   Hey, by the way, I do want to thank CB for that recommendation for Eagle Filer.
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:43.920]   And now it's time for the long lost Alex Lindsey, who has had months to come up with
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:44.920]   his pickles.
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:51.200]   And over those months, I have been dealing with lots and lots of projects, you know,
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.760]   to keep track of things and dealing with ones that are happening.
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:57.240]   I'm in Africa and they're happening here.
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:02.200]   And the thing that I became a little obsessed with is really starting to really do some experimentation
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.200]   with project management.
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:10.000]   So for a long time, we've used Fast Track, you know, to our I've used Fast Track for
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.120]   kind of working out ideas.
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:16.040]   And I started the kind of, you know, it's fine.
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.640]   I wasn't blown away by it, but it was the thing that I could use.
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:24.560]   And the one that I'm experimenting with now that I'm actually pretty excited about, actually.
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:29.800]   And this is like the productivity set of picks this week.
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.000]   But have you guys seen Merlin?
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.600]   Well, I think you've been on the show all week.
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.600]   I don't know.
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:36.600]   Yes.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:37.600]   Yes.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:38.600]   Merlin, you can see yourself.
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:39.600]   A lot of people really dig Merlin.
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.600]   What is Merlin?
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:46.640]   So Merlin is a project management and they say it's with a bit of magic.
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.520]   And I have to say that it's pretty close.
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:51.240]   I think they're capitalizing our friends here.
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.240]   I know.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.240]   Well-known.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.720]   They said that they named after Merlin.
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.960]   And no, they, so the, you know, because it's very effective.
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:01.360]   And what it is, is it's basically it's a project management software that lets you kind
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:04.920]   of plan out a project, plan out when things are going to start and you can build big
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:09.480]   Gantt charts, you know, and really set the end points and out points of when things
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:12.400]   are going to set up, you can set up dependencies.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:17.920]   So if something starts going over, you know, over deadline, it'll start pushing out the
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:19.760]   other things that are getting affected by it.
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:23.880]   So you can set up hard relationships between things getting done and when the next things
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:24.920]   have to start.
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:27.760]   And you can also look at how things are going.
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:31.600]   So for instance, you have, there's a net plan which tells you basically kind of like a flow
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:34.640]   chart of how, you know, where everything's going from where, you know, from this place
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.800]   to this place you have.
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.560]   It'll show you the utilization.
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:40.840]   So it'll show you like how much everybody is working.
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:44.880]   So if you set up the project being, you know, this person's doing this and this person's
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:48.320]   doing that, you can see over the week whether they're, you know, whether they're at 100%
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:52.880]   or 60% or 400% of what they can actually get done.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:57.560]   It allows you to have just a lot of control and really just a lot of data in front of
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:58.920]   you.
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:02.280]   And I'm finding that this is really, really important as we get more and more projects
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:04.080]   that are coming through the pipe.
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:07.600]   You can't keep it in your head and you can't keep it on Excel and you can't keep it on.
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:12.200]   You need something with a little bit more, you know, a little bit more power to kind of
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:16.240]   keep track of what's going on in a lot of different projects that are all happening at
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:17.640]   the same time.
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:22.360]   And you know, another good one, OmniPlan, Omni just came, you know, Omni, you know, the
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:26.800]   great company that has tons of great software that I use almost all the time.
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:27.800]   They have one.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:28.800]   It's good.
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:31.320]   I don't think it's quite as developed yet.
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:32.720]   I think it's kind of a version one.
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.080]   Merlin is a lot more developed.
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:38.000]   Merlin, did you have you played with Merlin?
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.920]   I played with it really ever since I was 13.
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:42.920]   Oh, dear.
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:43.920]   Ernally.
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.920]   We'll fix that in post.
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:47.920]   I am I.
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:51.400]   I played with it a long time ago and I thought it looked pretty good.
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:54.320]   It's interesting you say this because, you know, I used to have a former life as a project
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:04:00.360]   manager and this is definitely one of those areas where in my experience, Windows for
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:01.680]   years has had us licked.
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:05.720]   There used to be Mac project, you know, there's been the M.S.
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:09.000]   project and I don't want to, I don't want this fast track scheduler.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.360]   I used it for a couple of years.
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:13.360]   I always found it kind of on Mac like.
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:14.360]   Yeah.
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.360]   It's got that very, I don't know.
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:21.480]   Again, I haven't used it in years, but no, there's these are these are great little applications.
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:26.720]   And of course, for most people, I've got to say, for most people, I would discourage
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:29.760]   getting to fiddly with project management stuff.
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:32.320]   But if you are going to build a bridge or something and you need to have effort, you
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:36.360]   know, stuff and time estimates, these are both really, I think I like, I like how many
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:38.120]   plan I work with those guys.
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:39.440]   I play with Merlin a little bit.
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:42.800]   I'll have another look at it, but I remember thinking it looked pretty cool.
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:45.560]   You know, it's one of those things that I, you know, we didn't need it.
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:46.560]   We didn't need it.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.560]   We didn't need it.
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:49.680]   I mean, it was, and people would say, oh, we got to get a bunch of software together.
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:53.200]   And I'd say, well, you know, I can still keep track of it in word, you know, I mean, or
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:56.480]   in tech, you know, I can keep track of where everything is and everything.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:58.000]   You know, I don't need a lot of the stuff.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.560]   And now we've just gotten to this point while I was gone.
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:04.640]   Oh, just, there's too many projects and too many dependencies and too many different people.
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.800]   And we really realized we needed a lot more teeth.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:11.560]   My only, my only piece of it, this is not going to be for everybody, but my only piece
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:17.520]   of advice on that just from my own experience is I think these tools are fantastic for driving
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:20.640]   estimates and kind of coming up with high and low end.
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:23.560]   Like we think this will take between three and seven weeks to do.
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:28.480]   I personally ran into trouble with project management apps is I, you, I find that if you
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:32.320]   really want to keep them up to date, you really almost have to have a dedicated person who
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:35.040]   does nothing but keep that app today.
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:38.720]   Because I mean, in my experience, those things, especially in software development tend to
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.160]   be basically dead the minute you hit save.
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:45.360]   So I find them super useful for planning and especially super useful for finding out like
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:47.400]   proof of concept, is this a practical idea?
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:50.800]   Is this something we can really do in six weeks?
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:54.960]   But yeah, I mean, I think a lot of times what happens is it almost forces you to think
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:55.960]   it out.
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:06:01.480]   You know, as you start to what I find is that I get, I, I just need something to visually
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:05.440]   plan this thing out and suddenly realize that, oh, I need more resources over here.
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.680]   It's a great way to do a brain dump.
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:09.000]   It's great way to do a brain dump and then realize dependencies.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.720]   You didn't even know where they're.
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.600]   So yeah, totally useful for that.
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:13.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:14.600]   All right.
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:15.600]   There's our picks.
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:18.640]   Well, that wraps it up for the show.
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.000]   I thank you all.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:25.680]   Next week, we'll talk a little bit more about the iPhone.
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:29.360]   We'll plan our assault on the iPhone.
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:30.360]   That's for sure.
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:37.200]   Meanwhile, I want to tell folks who are going to the Jai Koo party, which is tonight, Tuesday
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:42.840]   night in San Francisco that they've moved it once again because it was, it's so popular
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:45.000]   that we've outgrown two locations.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.440]   I don't know if you were going to go to it guys, but we last we last we heard we were
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:51.880]   going to be at adaptive path.
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:55.520]   Now we've moved to the ritual coffee roasters.
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:57.480]   So where's that?
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:01.040]   That is on Valencia Street 1026 Valencia Street.
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:04.160]   But if you go to upcoming.org, you'll see the map now.
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:05.160]   I have to say it's full.
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:08.680]   And one of the reasons we keep moving is because it keeps growing and there's even 75 people
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:09.680]   on the waiting list.
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:13.760]   But if you get on the waiting list and then show up, we may we may be able to get you it
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:14.760]   get you in.
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:15.760]   I sure like to.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:16.760]   We're giving away Twitch stuff.
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:17.760]   There's going to be free herring.
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:18.760]   Mm boy.
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:21.200]   Can you get me on the list?
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:23.560]   Pickle, pickled herring.
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:27.600]   I signed up to go because, you know, Padango were sponsoring supernova.
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.080]   Yeah, it's part of supernova.
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:30.160]   So please get I'd love to see.
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:32.520]   I hope you'll come out Merlin and Alex too.
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:34.520]   And six to 10.
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.920]   And Valencia Street come by.
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.360]   Just say you know me.
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:39.360]   Okay.
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:40.360]   And we'll get you in.
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.840]   And then for the rest of you, if you go to upcoming.org and get on the waiting list, I
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:44.000]   can't promise everybody will get in.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000]   There's fire laws and so forth.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.480]   We got like 300 people coming.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:50.920]   If you guys got to let me in, I interrupt like half a dozen of his podcasts every week.
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:52.520]   Yeah, just say that.
[01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:56.000]   Say I am, I may not be perfect, but I am remarkable.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.400]   I have totally remarkable.
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:58.960]   And they'll let you in.
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.600]   All right, everybody.
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.080]   We will see you next week, the mounting excitement.
[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:06.440]   Don't forget if you want to know more about the iPhone and who doesn't, make sure you
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:09.600]   listen to the Apple phone show at the Apple phone show.com.
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:16.040]   If you want to know more about Merlin, of course, the Merlin show.com and 43 folders.com.
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.000]   And you could get into Pixel core.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.600]   This is a great time to do it during the summer where you get a summer long membership for
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:24.640]   just $50 for all three months at pixel core.com.
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.200]   Alex Lindsey, thanks for joining us.
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:27.200]   Thanks everybody.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.200]   We'll see you next time.
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:29.920]   Another Mac break.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:30.920]   It's done, bro.
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:31.480]   Bye.
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:47.520]   [MUSIC]
