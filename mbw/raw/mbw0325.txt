[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.040]   Filling in for Leola Port.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.760]   Once again, I didn't screw up that enough last week.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.960]   They decided to let me sit in Leo's chair for another week in a row.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:32.840]   I'm Sarah Lane and joining me as always is an esteemed cast of characters who are really
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.760]   much better at their jobs than I am.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.440]   To my left, Andy, a not-co.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.960]   I'm just in a singing mood, I guess.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.440]   Senior lead writer, Chicago Sun Times, technology columns.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.440]   Hello, Andy.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.440]   Hello.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.680]   And don't put yourself down.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.680]   Realize that this is how Leno got finally got Carson out of the tonight's show chair.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.680]   A couple of guest hosting stints and then a really, really mean-spirited manager.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.200]   And you'll have that gig soon enough.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.200]   Oh, good.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.200]   Yeah, I just need the mean-spirited manager.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.600]   There's somebody around here who could fill that role, I'm sure.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.320]   And two wonderful gentlemen.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.120]   To my right, Renee Ritchie, the editor of iMore.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.120]   Hello, Renee.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.120]   Hi, Sarah.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.200]   You say mean-spirited manager and then point to me.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.160]   So I'm just hoping I'm not getting cast in that role.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.160]   No, you're Canadian.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.960]   You couldn't do it if you tried.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.520]   All right, awesome.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.520]   Jason Smell.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.840]   There is sort of the agent vibe about your dress today.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.720]   You've got that tailored little jacket.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.720]   You've got the...
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.960]   It's like you're about to pick up the phone and yell at someone at Universal that you
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.280]   don't think that your guy should have a single decker RV.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.640]   They should get a double decker, Mae Van.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.400]   He said green M&Ms for Mr. Naco.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.400]   There you go.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.520]   You know, it happens with that.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.560]   And Jason Snell, the editorial director for Mackereld, Tech Hive and PC World.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.560]   Hi, Jason.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.560]   Welcome to the show.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.560]   Hi, Sarah.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.560]   It's great to be back.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.960]   And Renee scared me a little bit there.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.960]   He's believable.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.960]   Yeah, he is.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.440]   Okay, well, everybody mind your peace and cues.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.440]   Renee's gonna go all M&M on us.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.200]   Maybe he's more of a studio exec type.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.200]   I want you to look in the camera and say, "We love the script.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.440]   We just have a few notes."
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.440]   We love the script.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.440]   We just have a few notes.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.440]   Ah!
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.440]   Ah!
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.440]   That's good.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.440]   That's very good.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.440]   Oh, gosh.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.440]   All right.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.440]   Okay, don't cross him.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.040]   Hey, should we start off with a little bit of good news in the patent department.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.640]   Apple and HTC have reached a multi-year licensing agreement.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.920]   This came down on Saturday night, I remember, because I was at dinner.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.520]   And we were like, "Oh, my goodness.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.520]   This is the coolest.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.080]   Wow, what does it mean?
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.200]   Cats and dogs living together."
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.560]   Which could, some reports say, net Apple up to 280 million per year.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.640]   And I think some reports are saying that HTC might be paying Apple up to $8 per handset.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.440]   Renee, what do you think?
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.040]   Is this out of left field?
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.040]   Does it surprise you?
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.040]   This piece in our time.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.280]   Is that what we find on your team?
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.040]   I don't think it's exactly out of left field.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.000]   I mean, Apple, under Steve Jobs, had that whole philosophy of going thermonuclear on
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.320]   Android vendors.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.600]   And HTC, unlike Samsung, which has a whole plethora of consumer electronics devices to
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.760]   fund their war chest.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.520]   And unlike Motorola that has Google money now, HTC is barely.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.640]   I think they're around 1% profitable.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.680]   So it probably behooved them more than anyone else to get the litigation just off there,
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.680]   out of their skies.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:33.000]   Jason, I know back in, I think it was August, a representative from HTC said, "We do not
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   plan to settle.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.440]   We will take this to court as long as we have to, a bit of an about face."
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:44.200]   Yeah, it makes you wonder what their motivation is here, other than to just get this behind
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.200]   them.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.120]   And maybe it's Apple's motivation to make deals with people who aren't Samsung.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.120]   I don't know.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.720]   But the most important question is, where were you when the first armistice of the patent
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.720]   war was?
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.400]   Well, you remember, you were at dinner.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.520]   So that'll go down in history.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.680]   It is interesting, isn't it, that Apple is settling.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.960]   The thermonuclear war with Android may be over?
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.000]   I think that would be great because maybe we could stop talking about patents because
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   they're really boring.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.960]   I mean, Apple has all the money to keep a lawsuit or five going as long as they want.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.520]   Andy, is this sort of HTC saying, "Well, we didn't have a really great quarter.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.440]   We're not a dominant player if you compare us to Samsung.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.800]   We kind of just want this problem to go away.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.000]   We've got a fold."
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.360]   Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day, every business wants to be doing the thing that they
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.520]   consider themselves to be in business for.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.920]   I don't know anybody at the top levels of tech companies that really like the deal-making,
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.720]   the lawsuits, all that sort of stuff.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.000]   They really want to be able to make the next generation of devices.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.080]   And it's such a huge distraction for both companies to have to spend so much of their
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.880]   intellectual capital.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.800]   You'll have so many brain cycles available to you during the day.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.080]   And so when you spend so much time thinking about, "Well, now we have to defend ourselves
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.080]   against this countersuit.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.000]   Now, we have to make sure that our executives are going to be available for this deposition."
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.640]   You really have to get personal in order to want to attract a lawsuit like that out.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.400]   And as Renee said, for HTC, they're probably the most vulnerable of all the people whose
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.840]   names come up in all these lawsuits where they don't have the broadest portfolio of patents
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.680]   they could fight against Apple with.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.160]   One of the settlements that's being discussed in public is that HTC also had some stuff
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.160]   against Apple.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:34.200]   So it wasn't that if $8 per handset is accurate, it's not that the HTC said, "We're sorry.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.200]   We stole your patents here.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.200]   Have $8 per handset."
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.040]   It's that, "Okay, well, here's how much money you owe us for all the inferences that you're
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.120]   making on our intellectual property."
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:50.320]   But yeah, it's good to see people who are making seven and eight figures a month decide
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.400]   that, "You know what?
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:58.320]   Maybe we should not fight over whose dump truck is supposed to be played with first in the
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.320]   sandbox.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.920]   Maybe we should just settle this, get down to brass tacks about what is required to get
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.720]   rid of this and move on, and then get rid of it and move on."
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.480]   And they get slide to unlock.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.040]   They get to keep it anyway.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.040]   Thank God.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:17.520]   Now the entire world gets the benefits of this incredibly perceptive slide to unlock technology.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.560]   Soon enough, maybe you can build a phone that has a rounded corner on it with a, "Oh,
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.560]   what a nirvana we're going to be setting ourselves up for."
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:31.480]   It's interesting though, because HTC has never been the most Apple-like of manufacturers.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.200]   Motorola and HTC have always had their own design language, and it was mostly Samsung
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.160]   in the early days that was conscientiously very Apple-like.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.600]   And HTC is making a lot of Windows phones now.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:46.120]   They just put out a 1080P Android Super phone on Verizon today, and they're doing more of
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.120]   their own things.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.360]   I kind of wonder if this is also a little bit of a, you know, get HTC out of the way.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.800]   HTC's already settled with Microsoft.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.840]   They want to go on and do their own business, and now Apple can focus on who they think
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.920]   is their best or their biggest competition.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:06.240]   Well, Apple may be getting quite a bit of money from HTC, but it does have to pay the
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:14.520]   SBB, which is the Swiss Railway operator, about $21 million for stealing that mundane
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.000]   clock.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   You know the clock.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.760]   It appeared on iPads, right, when iOS 6 came out, and it was very beautiful, and people
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.760]   said, "Oh, what a lovely clock.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.760]   It's almost familiar."
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.400]   And that's because, yeah, it is.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.080]   It's already in use.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:36.280]   It was created back in, gosh what, the 1940s, and it has been the icon of the Swiss Railway
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:43.520]   system when they noticed that Apple was using almost the exact same clock design, which
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.800]   Andy has on his wrist.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.080]   Boy, is that a nice looking watch.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.600]   That's a sharp little timepiece right there.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:57.000]   Ever since the new iOS referred to as my officially licensed Apple iPad clock, the theme
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   watch.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.080]   And then look, now that's Jason's iPad.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.920]   Those two are too similar.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.920]   That's what SBB said.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.600]   And Apple probably said, "Yeah, what do you want?"
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.560]   See, this is why I got annoyed at a lot of this, what I felt to be really self-righteous
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:19.680]   ruckus raising when Apple won its lawsuit against Samsung.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:25.680]   Because a lot of the broader points being argued were about Samsung quite literally saying,
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.880]   "Well, let's make a phone that looks exactly like the iPhone and maybe confuse people a
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.600]   little bit, at least with our first attempts at making a multi-touch phone."
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:38.720]   But so much of it was just the idea that it's the assertion that every single thing that
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.280]   every company does should be absolutely original.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.760]   It's not possible for someone to just simply decide that something is a really interesting
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.920]   idea that we're going to take it and mix it up and make it our own.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.320]   And also the idea that Apple never, ever, ever does anything like that.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:58.480]   And so it's not that the appearance of this clock face in the app was a condemnation of
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.120]   everything that Apple was doing.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.840]   It's just an acknowledgement and an evidence that this is how things get designed.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.280]   You see things in the world that seem to work really, really well.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:12.200]   And then you try to, ideally, you adapt that and let that inform your own designs.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.720]   Sometimes as happens here, it's not even adapting.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.000]   It's, "Hey, that's a great watch face.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.440]   We should make our own watch face exactly like that."
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.520]   And it's not because Apple is incapable of designing their own watch faces.
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.000]   It's not because they wanted to bully the Swiss railway system.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.400]   It's because they didn't really think it was stealing.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.520]   They thought that they would simply be acknowledging a really, really great design with a non-competitive
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.520]   product.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.800]   But it really is part of how design works.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.360]   You just really do, well, so much of it is just looking at stuff in the wild to say,
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.360]   "That's a really good thing.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.320]   How can we let that inform our own product?"
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.480]   It's absolutely true, although it is different if you are a phone maker and you say, "I
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.520]   like the look of that clock versus you're a phone maker."
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.320]   And you say, "I like the look of that competitive phone."
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.320]   Right?
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.320]   I mean, that's the difference.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:59.680]   But sure, inspiration, everything's about synthesis and learning and changing.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.240]   I think in this case, my guess is that somebody at Apple saw that clock and thought it was
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.400]   cool and thought they'd make a digital representation of it and didn't actually realize that they
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.960]   were going to need to license it.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.680]   And I think Apple does the right thing, right?
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:16.320]   They're like, "We like your clock and we did lift it, so we're going to give you some
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.320]   money."
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.320]   Fair enough.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:23.160]   It seems like their usual operating procedure is to, instead of begging forgiveness, they
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.240]   pay you off and then they ask permission later.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:30.200]   The calculator has been a bronze calculator on iOS since it first launched and there was
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.880]   no big story about them paying off bronze.
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.960]   So maybe they considered this similar.
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:38.200]   It does seem strange that they'd pay $21 million or a clock, but they must have really loved
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.200]   that design.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.680]   Not only that, but remember that one of the hitches above this was it wasn't just that
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.640]   this was an iconic design that's been on the railway system for six years.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.480]   It is, as you see, it's a design that they actually pay a license that other companies
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.200]   pay a licensing fee for.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:13:00.400]   So if they want this watch company to continue to pay money for this design, they really
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.920]   did have to go against Apple and say, "No, you can't just simply get that cool, that
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.080]   cool round red sweep secondhand."
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:11.400]   They could have changed the clock app to be something different, but at that point,
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.320]   they would probably be sued for damages and they'd need to pay them anyway because they
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.080]   did ship it in iOS 6.
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.760]   So at that point, I think Apple and Apple's lawyers had a conversation about what it's
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.280]   worth and they said, "Well, we like it.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.480]   This way we don't have to change it.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.480]   Let's just pay them."
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.520]   And honestly, they have so much cash that, "Why not just do the right thing and say,
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:34.040]   we love it so much, we want it to be permanently a part of our clock app."
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.040]   That seems fair.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:40.120]   Well, think how much better the Swiss railway system will run now with $21 million.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.880]   I mean, what a mess it is now.
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.120]   Nothing's on time.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.120]   You know the Swiss.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.760]   Yeah, they're not very timely.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.440]   They're not time oriented people.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.880]   Maybe they'll clean up their trains a little bit, junk everywhere.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.320]   There's more effort into protecting the Pope.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.880]   Yeah, fill all the holes in that cheese too.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:57.880]   What the hell?
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:58.880]   Talk about a lack of attention to detail.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:13:59.880]   Right.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.880]   That sucks.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.880]   Switzerland.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:02.880]   It's terrible.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.800]   I get so much email.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.240]   The Swiss.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.240]   We've made the Swiss angry.
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.200]   You know, that's almost as bad as making Canadians angry at you.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.960]   I mean, if you get them off neutral ground, you've really done something wrong and sold
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.960]   their trains.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:16.960]   Don't make them angry.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:17.960]   That's the way to do it.
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:25.160]   Apple's head of internet software and services, Eddy Q, has joined the board of directors at
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:30.680]   what seems like an unlikely company, maybe, unless you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:37.680]   Ferrari, the Ferrari board of directors now welcomes Eddy Q and Apple insider says, does
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.240]   this mean?
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:45.040]   Does it mean Apple's now going to be part of a Ferrari car?
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:50.400]   Are we going to be able to talk to our Ferraris and have Apple inside it?
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.400]   You're laughing.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.600]   Is it just a dream?
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:58.640]   Well, it is a good fit because I think that only a company like Ferrari is accustomed to
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.120]   the high markups that Apple is used to on their products.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:06.360]   But yeah, I mean, what the hell is Apple going to do with a car?
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.120]   We can't even agree that they're going to build a TV set, which is at least marginally
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.760]   associated with their interests.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:20.200]   It is fun when you look at, you realize that once you achieve a certain two-star, three-star
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:24.480]   general level in any corporation, then you start working for other companies and serving
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.400]   on their boards as well.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:33.200]   And so when you see how much the brain trust is sort of a shared brain trust between companies
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.120]   of a higher level, it is amazing to find out that this guy, it's not enough that he works
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.000]   for one of the coolest companies on the planet.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.080]   He also has to work for a company that builds race cars.
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:48.320]   And if that guy ever had a really, really, people sucking up to him for his Christmas
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:54.600]   card list before, this guy can hook you up with both the next iPhone and the next supercar.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.320]   I think he's going to have to call, start screening his calls very soon.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.240]   Is it too much to wish that Apple could get integrated in cars?
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.800]   I mean, look at Pandora.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:09.280]   Pandora, there was a certain percentage that they had made public the other day.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:14.240]   It was something like 30% of their users are actually accessing Pandora through their car
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:20.480]   because Pandora is so well integrated into some of the new vehicle models and even aftermarket
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.360]   radio stereos that the people are putting into their cars.
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.360]   I would love that with at least some of my Apple services.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.120]   There's different levels of integration.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:33.200]   I mean, if you look, there's Windows software for cars, which runs Sink and there's QNX,
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.320]   which is owned by Blackberry now that's embedded in a lot of cars.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:41.040]   Apple at WWDC had that little slide up showing basically using a Bluetooth button as a Siri
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.240]   control in cars.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:46.680]   But I think if they did get into cars, it wouldn't be with Ferrari because Apple usually, their
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.600]   strength is mainstreaming technology.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:53.560]   It's taking things that are niche or complicated or just aren't accessible to the mainstream
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.240]   and putting them in places where the mainstream people can find it.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:01.200]   So I would expect they'd start with a much bigger consumer brand of cars, maybe a Toyota
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.160]   or a Honda or a Chrysler or something.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:09.120]   And I think that Apple, you know, I don't think Apple wants to build a product just for
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.120]   the car.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.920]   I think that they just aren't focused on that.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.320]   But we did see with the iPod Connect stuff that recently got actually deprecated with
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.160]   the release of the Lightning connector.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.080]   They were trying to basically put an iPod menu on your cars menu.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:26.720]   And it wouldn't surprise me if where Apple goes next with car stuff is like literally
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:32.600]   a connector, a Lightning connector that does video out and has support for basically touchscreen
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.600]   inputs.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.640]   So you could essentially bring up an iPhone or an iPad on a car's touchscreen and use
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.400]   it in that fashion.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.320]   Because I don't think Apple wants to make a custom anything for a car.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.880]   But that's something that maybe they could do.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.960]   And my car's got a little flat screen.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.760]   I think that's where a lot of these cars are going.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:53.280]   And imagine if Apple just said, look, you can just plug in your iPhone and boom, it'll
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.080]   work with your touchscreen.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.560]   But beyond that, I just have a hard time seeing that they'll do much more than that.
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.360]   They just, I mean, they pick their spots and I don't think cars, I think they want to
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.640]   be sort of minimally compatible.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.080]   And then beyond that, I'm not sure they care.
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.600]   So they want to own the whole widget.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.440]   And they wouldn't, I don't think they'd ever have a partnership with a car company unless
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.080]   they could really control every aspect of the whole experience.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:19.120]   And then you get down to the idea that now that now we have a 7.9 inch tablet that is
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:24.520]   perfectly, perfectly sized for car dashboard, maybe they would be adding a little bit more
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:29.360]   infrastructure to make it a little easier to add hands-free controls to do the AV experience.
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:34.680]   But it seems like a problem that doesn't really need a complicated solution, does it?
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.840]   People's also doing this thing with Siri where they're lining up their brokering deals with
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:42.200]   providers like OpenTable and Yelp and now with Fandango.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.240]   And maybe one day they'll make a deal with an app that runs on the car with specific
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.360]   brand apps because a lot of major car companies now have their own apps.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.680]   And you'll be able to use Siri integration so you can have natural language, control
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.360]   over your music and other stuff while you're driving.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.960]   But I think they're both Jason and Andy are right on with that.
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.320]   Yes, with the Fandango app, that's part of 6.1, right?
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:11.500]   It's now out to developers, not live for the general public where if I was to say Siri
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:16.600]   book me a reservation for this movie at this time, I could at least get to the Fandango
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.320]   app to the point of purchase, right?
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.320]   Yeah, correct.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.320]   That's great.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.640]   I mean, I don't actually use Fandango all that much.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:30.000]   I don't know about the rest of you, but it's, that's at least something that is, that is
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.760]   a transaction I am making regularly because I go to a lot of movies.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:34.760]   That's fun.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:40.560]   So Lisa's good at using open table with a little help from Siri to get a table booked
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.060]   for two.
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.060]   That means that's exactly it.
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:46.560]   Right now you can, you can find out about dinner reservations using Siri, but you get
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.280]   offloaded to the open table app to complete the booking.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.760]   And right now you can find it all about movies, but you're stuck there.
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.840]   You can't, there's no actionable thing that you can do afterwards.
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:59.440]   And when Fandango comes online, you'll be able to take that next step and we'll probably
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:04.160]   see Apple making deals with other transactional companies to handle all the other, you know,
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.160]   there's sports in series.
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.680]   So maybe there'll be different sports ticket providers built in as well one day.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:09.680]   All right.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:15.240]   Well, but well, we've got quite a bit more news in a variety of categories because Apple
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.480]   news never stops.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.240]   But first, I think we should kick it over to Leo.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:23.400]   He's just sitting patiently in his office waiting for me to tell us a little bit about
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.200]   one of our first sponsors.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.200]   Excuse me.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.480]   If you don't mind, I'd love to interrupt back break weekly briefly for just a moment to
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.800]   talk about our sponsor.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.000]   Go to meeting from the folks at Citrix.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.480]   Go to meeting is great for people who use iPads.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:44.360]   It's a way you can attend a meeting, meet face to face with your team, your clients on
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.920]   an iPad.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.880]   Go to meeting is amazing.
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:53.280]   Go to meeting with HD faces really is a critical technology.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.360]   Go to meetings always had the best, the best screen sharing.
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:03.840]   But now they also have a camera and you can use the camera with a sync just a click,
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:10.120]   your webcam and a click and you're suddenly your teleconferencing in high def video.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.120]   I am such a fan of go to meeting.
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:18.080]   You can meet and collaborate anywhere even present from an iPad, which is so cool that
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:21.960]   iPad app absolutely free.

[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.320]   It's how you build trust rapport.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.320]   It's how you sell.

[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:07.680]   Okay, the chat room got me Leo's not really sitting in his office right now.
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.280]   He's on vacation.
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.840]   He's cruising Australia or something really fun.
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.480]   So I'm sorry.
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.720]   I shouldn't have lied.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.800]   Hey, so this is kind of cool.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:23.760]   People is apparently taking a page out of the Google book and giving employees some time
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.080]   to work on their own projects.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.280]   It's kind of like Google's 20% time.
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:35.520]   This is the Wall Street Journal's Jessica Lessig reporting and this would be allowing
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.520]   anybody who works at Apple.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:43.640]   I assume to devote 20% of their work time to their own projects or their own hacks for
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.080]   the good of the company.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:51.640]   But this is not something that would have happened under Steve Jobs.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.920]   He didn't really want people to be doing their own thing.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.720]   He wanted to control the experience.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.120]   Well, the report isn't really 20% for Apple though, isn't it?
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.280]   Isn't it like two weeks or something?
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.560]   You get kind of like two week project time.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.720]   Two weeks out of the normal work schedule, whatever that is.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.720]   It's not everybody.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.720]   It's only certain people.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:17.000]   So just the really talented people get to take a couple of weeks and they get a walk.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.840]   You hear a lot about a couple Apple engineers go off and they build an app and it ends up
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.280]   being so great that it becomes a standard app or a standard part of Biola.
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.920]   I think that maybe what they're going for here is letting people who've got an idea
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:31.960]   for something that they think might be cool actually go and pursue it a little bit, which
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:32.960]   is a great idea.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.600]   It's not the same as Google's time, which is sort of every week I'm going to set aside
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.600]   some time.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.160]   It's more focused and there could be some cool stuff that comes out of it.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:45.480]   And I think it's also just to let those Apple employees who are frustrated because they're
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:49.120]   so focused on what they're doing for their regular job and they've got these big ideas
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.800]   to try something else and see what can happen in a couple of weeks.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:58.240]   A few people could make something that could end up being a standard part of Mac OS or iOS
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.240]   down the road.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:06.800]   That's the take that I got from a two because it's one thing to say that what Google does
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:14.000]   is a lot more broad in that it tries to the larger goal of it is to keep their employees
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.960]   from burning out and feeling as though they need to take a year-long sabbatical to attend
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.720]   to a personal project or just get so burned out at Google, they say, "You know, I just
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.520]   want to leave right now because I can't be focused on the same thing time and time and
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.520]   time again."
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:32.640]   I would like to like to see a lot more of the details about how this project, how the
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.680]   system is going to work at Apple.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:39.680]   As Jason said, if it really is an idea where it allows people to pursue side projects,
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:44.720]   but if you're still doing that in company time, and Apple can say, "Well, thank you
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.560]   for developing this incredibly great podcasting app.
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.520]   Now we own it because you did it at your desk.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.920]   You used our photocopier to make silly faces and emails to other people while trying to
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.720]   get their opinions on this product.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.480]   So glad you enjoyed your time off.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.280]   Now we'll take your app away from you."
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:05.840]   It's one thing, it's not exactly if you want to take two weeks off to go help create clean
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.320]   water in Central America.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.280]   We'd love you to do that and come back in your job when you come back.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.520]   I think one of the other important things here is now that people said a lot about when
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.800]   Steve Jobs was gone from Apple, you wouldn't have the high highs, but you wouldn't have
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.000]   the low lows as well.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.120]   It's a much more normalized company.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.680]   It's sort of like now that Star Wars is owned by Disney.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:29.240]   You may not get Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back, but you won't get the prequels either.
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:33.320]   Scott Forestall was a very powerful personality, had a lot of ideas.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.520]   And exactly what Jason and Andy said often in teams of very small teams, even two people
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.080]   would come up with apps or ideas that would find their way into iOS.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.880]   And now that you have a more normalized company giving people time to start coming up with
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:50.280]   creative, different things so that maybe future versions of iOS do have a freshness to them
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.800]   or in new direction, I think is a huge positive.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:59.640]   Yeah, wouldn't you love to see a sort of like commune aspect to a lot of these operating
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:04.520]   systems and apps where it's not just a case of there's a project manager, there's a timeline,
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.200]   there's a punch list of things that have to be done.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:13.040]   There's a great thing that happens when if you've ever had like a family campsite, you
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:16.440]   know, where you just, you get there when you see that, oh wow, that roof looks a little
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.440]   bit patchy.
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.680]   No one has contracted me to do this, but I'm just going to fix that because it's obvious
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.640]   to me that that needs to be fixed.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:27.040]   So if you had the ability to simply look around and say, oh man, we need to do something about
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:31.800]   the way that the podcast apps download, the podcast app downloads new, discovers and downloads
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.080]   new episodes, I'm going to fix that myself.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.320]   And then I'm just going to put it out there on our server.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:39.080]   And if anybody here in the company thinks that's a good idea, they can use it.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:42.880]   Otherwise, I'm just glad that I'm just glad that I now personally have a copy of this app
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.840]   that works the way that I wanted to.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.120]   I'm going to fix game center.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.760]   Give me two weeks and that thing's going to be solid.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.760]   What is going on with game center?
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:54.320]   Are these piles of turn up felt in the dumpster today?
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.840]   Oh, well, Jenkins had the weak off.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:59.840]   He decided to finally de-skim or fies the game center app.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:03.600]   I think the biggest problem with game center is that Apple doesn't have any game center
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.560]   apps built into the iPhone or in the store, which means that any problems with them are
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:11.920]   going to be found first and most painfully by developers.
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.680]   And when Lauren Richter made Letterpress, he went all in.
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:18.280]   He used it for turn-based gaming and for matchmaking.
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:23.720]   And Apple is not a services company like Google and it didn't seem to be able to handle the
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.720]   load.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:28.000]   If someone does have two weeks coming up and they want to re-architect that, that'd be
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.400]   fabulous.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.720]   I would also appreciate that game center.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.200]   It should just work.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:38.720]   Hey, should we talk about Apple and the company that they still really hate Samsung?
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:46.320]   Samsung reportedly has decided to raise prices for the A6 chips that you see in the iPhone
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:50.160]   and iPads while they still can.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.840]   I think they've got a contract through 2014.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:59.960]   And although Apple is definitely experimenting with other companies as alternatives, Samsung
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:04.040]   just has, I can meet the production demand better than the others.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:09.240]   Apple really relies on Samsung, at least to build these processors.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.840]   They're now custom designed by Apple.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:16.040]   But Samsung wants more money.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.800]   I'm not too surprised by this.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:22.800]   I figure Samsung should probably ask for as much as it thinks it can while Apple still
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.480]   doesn't have another option.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:30.320]   I mean, the option, I guess, would be to just make fewer devices quickly and that doesn't
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.320]   work either.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:35.120]   I mean, it's good business in the sense that if they're the only supplier who can give
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:39.080]   Apple what at once, that they can charge whatever, it's bad business in the sense that
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:43.520]   they're, by gouging them potentially, they're basically kissing off their business.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.880]   And they may just have decided that there's no way Apple's going to use them as a supplier
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.440]   in the long term anyway.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.440]   But that's the risk, right?
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:54.040]   I mean, there are different parts of Samsung and they're the parts that do phones and compete
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.680]   with Apple and then they're the parts that make microprocessors.
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:02.840]   And this is an example of maybe the one side kind of crossing over and souring a relationship
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.000]   on the other side.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:10.400]   And I don't know, Samsung's downside is that they're going to lose this major customer
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.160]   when their contract expires.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.640]   And I guess maybe they decided that that's going to happen anyway.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.480]   So they might as well make as much money as they can out of their competitor while they
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:19.480]   can.
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.680]   Any, go ahead.
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:26.680]   Do we really know the reasons behind the markup?
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:31.080]   No, I mean, this is what's being reported.
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:37.040]   I know the Verge said, well, you know, Samsung just made a multi-billion dollar investment
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.520]   into one of its plants in Texas.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:45.960]   Maybe this is just a case of Samsung saying, hey, you know, we've got costs too and maybe
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:49.080]   we felt that Apple was getting too good of a deal.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:50.920]   So there are a lot of reasons for this.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:59.240]   But I think it's almost impossible not to say, well, these two companies have a lot to fight
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.240]   about.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:05.360]   So if Samsung doesn't think that they're around for the long term, why not just get more money?
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.640]   But it is an incomplete report.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:10.320]   And I mean, it's entirely possible that Apple knew this was going to happen and that this
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:15.240]   was part of the disgust arrangement with Samsung's microprocessor unit in upgrading their factory
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.560]   in the US or maybe Apple said, look, we want to make these in Texas.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.400]   So please upgrade the factory and we'll pay whatever.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:27.320]   We don't know that detail whether this is really just Samsung screwing with Apple or
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.320]   not.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.320]   And so it's hard to say.
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.320]   I mean, it could be.
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.720]   The relationship with companies is so bad.
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:36.320]   At the same time, there's so much money changing hands where Apple is buying Samsung's products
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:42.200]   that that's always the thing to be alert for is it's a company doing big bad business
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.720]   decisions because of emotion or not.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.240]   And it's hard to say whether that's really happening here or not.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.880]   Nobody seems to know the details.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.480]   I think the size of the number also makes people ask questions.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:55.240]   If it was a 1% or 2% hike, it would just seem like normal business.
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.120]   Apple's always going to want the lowest prices.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.520]   They can get on components.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:03.640]   They're famous for doing everything they can to ensure low prices for long periods of time.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.480]   And Samsung's going to want to charge as much as they can for theirs.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.440]   And scarcity is a market factor.
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:12.480]   If Apple is asking for more chips, then Samsung can comfortably produce or if they have to
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:16.680]   increase factory capacity to make these chips, they can start charging more.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:18.120]   So Apple adjusts their demand.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.000]   I think Jason's right.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.200]   There's not enough known yet to say whether it's an evil empire play or just a good business
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.200]   play.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:30.960]   Well, Apple and Samsung back to their patent issues.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:37.360]   And the George Lucie Co, Federal District Judge, is going to look into whether the foreman in
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:42.560]   the Apple versus Samsung case, which ended up in Apple's favor, concealed information
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:48.680]   during his selection process into the jury, whether there was misconduct.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:55.200]   The problem is that Samsung says, listen, this foreman, Velve and Hogan, did not disclose
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:00.800]   during jury selection that he had been sued by Seagate, who he used to work for.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:07.200]   Samsung said in court papers, Seagate and Samsung have a substantial strategic relationship.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.640]   So this is definitely something that should have been brought up.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:16.560]   The litigation with Seagate led Hogan to file for personal bankruptcy in 1993.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:21.960]   Hogan's defense is, no, they asked me until a certain amount of years passed.
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:25.920]   I think it was 15 years, is there anything that we should know about?
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.560]   He said, this was before that.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:32.920]   But then again, since Samsung and Seagate do have a relationship, and this is obviously
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:38.800]   something that did drastically affect Hogan's life, personal bankruptcy, should he have said
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:40.800]   something anyway?
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:41.800]   Anyone?
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:46.880]   Well, you're just a belief, no stone unturned, right?
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.120]   And so you might as well try.
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.320]   You might as well try, but it seems like the grasping against you.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.760]   I mean, it's weird, right?
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:56.200]   It's weird that, I mean, he obviously would have said, okay, well, I don't technically
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.480]   have to say anything.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.840]   But why wouldn't you?
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:01.600]   Why wouldn't you say something?
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:07.160]   That would have obviously come right to his mind, as he's got memory problems.
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:10.520]   It does seem like something that would be strategically withheld.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:16.200]   They say it was in the past, and then they say, and it's also not about Samsung, right?
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.200]   It's about Seagate.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:22.200]   And then there's this bizarre linkage of, like, ah, but we have a relationship with Seagate.
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:26.840]   And therefore, there's transference of your rage towards Seagate.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.200]   It's just, I mean, those are a lot of connections to Meg.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.880]   It seems pretty ridiculous to me.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.320]   I would probably not.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:37.000]   Unless, I mean, who knows, in court cases like that, maybe you've volunteered up, you
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.560]   know, who your bully was when you were out in a medical school or something, and maybe
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:44.680]   you just climb up and say, well, you've said only this period, I don't want to get in trouble,
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.440]   I'm only going to answer about this period.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:50.040]   It's not even Samsung anyway, I'd say it would be different if Samsung had caused it
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.040]   to be bankrupt.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:54.240]   But it's like a company that works sometimes with Samsung.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.240]   It's not the same.
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.240]   That's crazy.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.240]   So we want to-
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:01.400]   Hey, like, a billion dollars can buy you a heck of a microscope.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.760]   I'm sure if you look at any jury, you'll find all sorts of craziness that's going on.
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:08.040]   But because it's Samsung and Apple and a billion dollars and people are covering it,
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:11.120]   like it's the OJ trial, you're going to find tons of disparities.
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.640]   I mean, the decision still seems like a good one to me.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:18.240]   I'm sure there'll be a bunch of strange ways at which they achieve the decision, but at
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:22.440]   a certain point they're going to have to move on so that the UK can have the spotlight
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.600]   for the Apple Samsung craziness that they deserve right now.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:32.080]   So yeah, I mean, speaking of that, what is- I mean, how can the story keep going and
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.280]   going, right?
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.280]   It's England.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:38.320]   Oh, because I don't know.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:43.280]   It's when, again, it's amazing when people who earn a seven figure or an eight figure
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:51.800]   salary cannot just have a hot cup of coffee, have a cookie, let their blood sugar get back
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:57.560]   to normal levels and then just realize that there's nothing to be gained by being idiots.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:02.760]   So I mean, if Apple could have, maybe the judges original order wasn't very, it didn't
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:07.200]   make a whole lot of sense, but it was a judges order, it would have cost them almost nothing
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:13.640]   to simply say, "Okay, we can put it, we can stamp a dumb stamp on this piece of paper
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:18.120]   just by putting the simple little notice on the board that we know is going to pass muster."
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:22.640]   But to flaunt it once, then to flaunt it twice, you don't do that to a judge.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.320]   You don't do that to a fake TV judge.
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:28.080]   You don't do it to a judge who has actual power because they're going to get rather upset
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.280]   with you and they have a lot of things they can do to you.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.800]   And it's just amazing to me that Apple just pushed it this far.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:39.320]   Yeah, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, if you're wondering, what is the deal has
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:48.040]   ordered Apple to pay the legal fees of Samsung on an indemnity basis after Apple published
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:54.760]   what the Court found to be false and misleading notice after the patent lawsuit over the iPad.
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:36:02.480]   The judgment will require Apple to pay the majority of the expenses associated with Samsung's
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:06.680]   defense, legal defense, and any disputes over the exact amount.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.400]   Yeah, you know, but Samsung could probably just say...
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.600]   From parking tickets to the porches.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:11.600]   Here's how much we...
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.320]   This is how much we want.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:16.680]   Yeah, this is crazy.
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:21.000]   It's like, I don't know, it seems very childish, yes.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.480]   Somebody needs a cookie.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:28.480]   Isn't this the corporate equivalent of getting pulled over and saying, "Hey, don't you know
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:29.480]   who I am?
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.480]   This is the people who ordered that."
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.480]   I pay your salary.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.040]   Yeah, yeah, we're big in menu.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.040]   We can crush like real folks.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:42.320]   Yeah, we'll post your apology, but we'll post it in the corner in the basement behind a
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.960]   locked door with a sign that says, "Where are the leopards?"
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.800]   Sorry, Douglas Adams' reference there.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:52.320]   But essentially, that's Apple's disrespect in this case, and it's stupid.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.320]   Don't do that.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:54.960]   They'll put you in jail.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:01.880]   I can't help but think about the XKCD cartoon of the people at TSA.
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:06.280]   The guy without the hat is arguing with the TSA's agent, and he's saying to his girlfriend,
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.840]   "Don't worry, honey.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.640]   Any second now, this agent is going to understand the logic of my argument.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.720]   He's going to let me have my bottled water back."
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.240]   No, he's not.
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.760]   He's just going to get more upset with you.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:19.440]   And just to move you out of his way, he's going to send you to the little room for two
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.440]   hours.
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:24.160]   Or you could simply say, "Maybe it's not quite right that I can't bring a bottle of water
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:28.800]   on the plane, but maybe I'll be able to get through my life faster and have far less
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.400]   pain today."
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.480]   If I just let them have a bottled water.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.480]   If they would--
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.480]   It doesn't make you look good.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.480]   It just would have played nicely.
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:40.640]   They would not have had to post a second statement on the Apple website.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.680]   I'll even read it.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:47.760]   On 25th of October 2012, Apple incorporated, published a statement on its UK website in
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.560]   relation to Samsung's Galaxy tablet computers.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:55.680]   The statement was inaccurate and did not comply with the order of the Court of Appeals of England
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.840]   and Wales.
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:03.240]   The correct statement is at apple.com/uk/legaljudgment.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:06.160]   Sorry, I went from embarrassing to humiliating very quickly.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:07.800]   Yeah, really.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.200]   You just made it worse for yourself.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.200]   My goodness.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:16.200]   Hey, before we get to some of our other news, let's kick it over to Leo again.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:20.400]   He is going to tell you a little bit more about American Express.
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.840]   Hey, Mac, break weekly, folks.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:24.880]   Just want to take a minute of your time.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:30.080]   I always said that we'll know Twits made it when we've got a bank advertising.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:33.640]   You know, that's a serious financial institution.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:36.240]   But they trust podcasting, podcasting's on the map.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.040]   And you know what?
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:39.040]   We've got a bank.
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.040]   I'm really happy about this.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:44.560]   I've been an American Express customer since 1981.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:45.840]   Maybe you have to.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.320]   And maybe I didn't know about this, but maybe you did.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:53.320]   The American Express Bank FSB, did you know they have an online bank?
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:59.080]   I know we all want to save more for a rainy day or that gadget or my new Ford Fusion
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:01.080]   that I'm saving up for.
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.080]   Savings is so important.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.840]   We don't do enough of it.
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.040]   I'll tell you what.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:09.240]   If you would like to add this as a component of your financial plan that may, I suggest
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.440]   the American Express Bank.
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.640]   Here's why.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.240]   It's a high yield savings account.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.760]   So you're going to get a competitive variable interest rate.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.160]   It goes up when the interest rates go up.
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.480]   To help you reach your savings goals, it's easy to link your existing account.
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:26.600]   So you can have automatic withdrawals, which makes saving a whole lot better.
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.560]   Very easy to transfer more money or less, too, depending on your needs.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:33.200]   They've got 24/7 web access to your money.
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:37.080]   Also iPhone and Android phone access.
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:41.760]   No minimums, no fees, great phone support whenever you feel like you want to talk to
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:42.760]   somebody.
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.400]   They're always glad to talk to you.
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.040]   This account is not to replace your existing banking.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:50.920]   It's to add to, to complement your existing financial tools.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:57.440]   If you'd like to find out more, find out what today's interest rate is, visit personalsavings.com/onlinesavings.
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:04.840]   That's the American Express Bank FSB, member FDIC.
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.280]   You got to get those initials right.
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.960]   I always wanted to say that.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:12.920]   Member FDIC, personalsavings.com/onlinesavings.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:16.240]   We're so pleased to have American Express Bank as part of the Twitch family.
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:19.200]   We invite you to check it out.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:22.240]   It's good for you, too, better than broccoli.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.920]   It's always good to save.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.960]   What's your reason to save?
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:30.120]   American Express Bank FSB, member FDIC.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:38.800]   Go to personalsavings.com/onlinesavings.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.560]   And now back to back break weekly.
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.360]   Better than broccoli.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.360]   Wow.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.520]   Well, he's really good for you, too.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.800]   He said broccoli.
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:49.800]   And he said better than.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.240]   He didn't say as good as.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.240]   He said better than.
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.240]   Right.
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:54.960]   Broccoli's got what?
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.320]   I think a lot of vitamin C and calcium.
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:58.320]   Calcium?
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:59.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.320]   Awesome.
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:03.960]   I think the idea is if you save, you can buy as much broccoli as you want.
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:04.960]   You know?
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:05.960]   You have money to buy broccoli.
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:09.640]   It's better than being poor and having to buy that broccoli.
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.640]   That's for sure.
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:14.600]   Also, it's one of very few vegetables that if you collect like Star Wars Lego mini-figs,
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.840]   if you want to make them look like they're in the forest of Endor, if you just stock
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:22.360]   up the broccoli stocks, all of your little stop motion videos will look that much more
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.360]   accurate.
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.360]   So it's quite an endorsement.
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:26.360]   That's it.
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.360]   All right.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.360]   Well, you heard it here.
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.360]   I like that idea.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.800]   Hey, should we talk about iPhone 5S rumors?
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:32.800]   Ouch.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:33.800]   Who's excited?
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:36.200]   It only took what?
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.500]   A month?
[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:38.500]   Just in time for Christmas.
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:39.500]   I've heard it's that 23S.
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:40.500]   It's 23S.
[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.000]   It's sickens me and repulses me.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.480]   Apple just, they can't innovate anymore.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.120]   This is obviously going to be a bad product.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.120]   So no, no, no, no.
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:51.800]   That's of course there's going to be a new iPhone 5S and it's going to start shipping
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:52.800]   in December.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.640]   Wait, wait, no, let's not get the rumor, get ahead of us.
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:42:00.000]   Remember every year there was a red iPhone coming in December rumor for about three or
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.680]   four years in a row and just every year it would happen.
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.160]   This is coming from Digitimes.
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:14.800]   Renee, Digitimes has a mixed track record as far as rumors go.
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:19.400]   Digitimes is actually, they get incredibly good data from supply chains that they have
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.600]   absolutely no idea what to do with.
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:24.680]   I mean, they'll hear there's panels, but they won't know where so it'll become an Apple
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:28.280]   panel or they'll hear that Apple's working on this thing, but it won't know that, but
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.320]   they'll think it's for this device and not that.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:34.520]   So if you go back in time two years, you'll find out Digitimes knew a lot about different
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:39.000]   components for devices that would come out two years later, but they just totally misreported
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.800]   it at the time that they got the information.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:45.760]   So it's not so much, we're making it up just to get page views.
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:50.280]   It's, well, I think this is the most logical conclusion that's not necessarily right.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:56.960]   So what Digitimes is saying is Apple is in early stages of production on the 5S or whatever
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.160]   it would be called next gen iPhone.
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:04.840]   The next iPhone should enter trial production in December says Digitimes and then ramp up
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:10.520]   volume production in the first quarter of 2013, which would indicate that the iPhone
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:15.440]   5S would be available to consumers before a new iPad.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:18.560]   Now that might sound crazy because iPhones come out in the fall, right?
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.000]   That's just the way it goes.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:26.120]   Then again, with the iPad mini, the whole schedule might be turned on its head when
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.120]   it comes to Apple.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:31.960]   I think the one that really gets me is that fourth generation iPad because we had assumed
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:35.720]   that there would be an annual cycle and they did a quick turnaround and it had a bump and
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.560]   it looks the same on the outside, but it's different on the inside.
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:42.400]   And that's the one thing that gives me pause about this rumor is maybe Apple's decided
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:48.000]   that it doesn't want to wait an entire year to do some internal refreshes or maybe it's
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.480]   got a reason that it wants to upgrade or change some of the internals on the 5.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:58.160]   And they could call it the 5S or it could be a stealth update, who knows?
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.520]   But maybe it's true.
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:01.960]   It wouldn't be a huge update.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.000]   It would be sort of like that fourth generation iPad.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.640]   It would really be something that would be smaller than that.
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.480]   But they did it.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.480]   That's what gives me pause.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:14.240]   Normally I would poo poo something like this, but that iPad update to the fourth gen iPad
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:18.400]   makes me wonder if maybe they are going to try to be a little more aggressive in swapping
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:23.440]   in some new stuff midstream instead of just waiting for that once a year cycle.
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:25.040]   That's partly a joke.
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.720]   I'm sorry, Renee, go ahead.
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:31.800]   I was just going to say that the iPad 4 is the device that makes everyone think, "Oh,
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.400]   maybe Apple's going to stop waiting and they're going to start releasing."
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:38.600]   I mean, the rumors were that Apple had new iPads ready at the end of last year and the
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.920]   year before and they just waited until the spring to release them.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:47.640]   But the curious thing about the iPad 4 is internally it's iPad 3, 4, 3, 5.
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:51.720]   Apple doesn't consider it a new iPad, which makes it flabbergasting that they would actually
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:57.320]   call it the iPad 4 because the only thing that does is upset people with the iPad 3.
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:04.200]   If Apple is making a 5S, is that an iPhone 6,1 or is that just the Verizon iPhone where
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:08.360]   they fix a couple things and it works on a couple of different networks and it's fine?
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:11.920]   Maybe they still call it the iPhone 5 and it's totally a stealth update, which is sort
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:16.680]   of what we thought the new iPad would be is it's still the old third generation iPad.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:17.840]   It's just the one with the lightning.
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:18.840]   You get the new news.
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:19.840]   You get the new news.
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:21.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.000]   But they call it the fourth generation.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.280]   So now, who knows, is this, you know, but I do think, yeah, it makes me wonder that Apple
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:32.520]   maybe is going to be a little bolder with doing kind of midstream updates instead of
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:36.240]   just saying, "Let's just wait it all out and do only one update a year from now."
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.560]   Well, there are a couple of things here.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:43.840]   Number one, this is one of the benefits that Apple gets from maintaining their manufacturing
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:48.400]   so tightly and so closely that there's never any point in which they have to, they could
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.480]   tell themselves, "Well, we would like to do an update this quarter, but we've got to
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.160]   clear out old inventory first."
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:56.000]   No, that's never a problem for Apple.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:02.080]   Secondly, it's probably a good timing that this rumor is coming out just as Samsung is
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:05.080]   able to say, "We had the hottest selling phone this quarter.
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:08.360]   We outsold the iPhone this quarter."
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:12.480]   And I was on the radio with someone who actually was saying, "Is this a sign that Apple is
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:13.480]   on its way down?"
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:17.680]   And I had to say, "No, it's a sign that everybody knows that September is when the new iPhone
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:21.240]   comes out and the summer is a terrible time to buy a new iPhone."
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:26.560]   And so early summer is a great time for Samsung to do their own flagship feature phone release.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:31.160]   So I think that there's just like years ago when they decided that we're not going to,
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:35.360]   Apple is no longer going to do keynotes every January in Mac world Expo because it put an
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:40.000]   artificial deadline on them and put an artificial limitation on what they could do and when
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.920]   they could do it because everybody was expecting a big announcement at the end of January.
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:47.600]   Now that they've sort of tricked themselves into a situation where everybody's expecting
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:53.680]   a new iPhone once a year, now that they stopped shipping them in June, now we're expecting
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:56.920]   them in September, maybe part of it is just to say, "You know what?
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:58.200]   Let's just let go of all that.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:46:59.680]   Let's ship things on our own schedule.
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:02.560]   Let's make sure that people don't really anticipate when things are going to be doing
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:03.560]   the "We'll do things exactly.
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:05.480]   Let's do things on our own schedule."
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:10.480]   And then with the iPad 4, that was also a special case because they knew what volumes
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:11.840]   they're selling these iPads at.
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:17.520]   And I think that the sooner they feel as though they can shut down those lines producing 30
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:20.240]   pin dock connectors, the better.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:24.600]   And if they could find all kinds of other reasons to come up with a marginal update,
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:27.520]   a half a year in advance, all the better.
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:30.480]   The other thing that's interesting is if you look at these stories and I'm going to be
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:35.680]   more moulder than Scully about this, companies are finding better ways to attack Apple, whether
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:39.200]   it's with branding or whether it's with investors or whether it's with consumers.
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:44.480]   Like a story Andy mentioned about Samsung Outselling Apple, that was absolutely bogus.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.120]   The headline said, "Samsung Outsells Apple."
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:49.440]   The lead says, "Samsung Outsells Apple."
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:53.800]   The actual quote says, "Samsung Out ships Apple," which is a completely different thing.
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:57.560]   And it just gets reported every headline that copied that press release says, "Samsung
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:58.560]   Outsells Apple."
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:01.440]   And you have to start digging in, "Well, which device?
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:02.440]   Which Samsung Galaxy?"
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:05.000]   I mean, there's two different kinds, which iPhone are they comparing?
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.480]   It was a completely, I don't know what the right word for it is, but it was not a news
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:11.960]   story and it was quickly propagated as such.
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:16.840]   And now you have people nervous that if they buy an iPhone, maybe it'll be outdated as soon
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:21.320]   as next spring and that puts pressure on Apple because we saw what happened when iPhone
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:24.640]   5 rumors came up, iPhone 4S sales plummeted.
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:28.400]   So again, I don't want to be a conspiracy guy, but it is interesting to me that all
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:33.160]   these stories that hurt Apple on some form of either investor or consumer level keep
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.160]   coming out around this period of time.
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:42.400]   A few minutes ago, you mentioned that the iPad 4th gen internally isn't even known as
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.400]   iPad 4.
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:45.720]   It's a three point something.
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:48.360]   Why did Apple call it the 4th gen?
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:53.680]   I mean, why didn't they just say the iPad 3rd gen was introduced as the new iPad?
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:57.680]   And everyone went, "Okay, now we're not doing numbers anymore."
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:01.000]   Why couldn't they have just said, "Yeah, you get a little bump if you don't have a new
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   iPad yet.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   Now it's even better."
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:09.800]   And I just thought that all the folks who got so angry that Apple was innovating faster
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.960]   than we were buying.
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:14.240]   It makes absolutely no sense to me.
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:17.920]   And it's what Jason said, "I thought that this would be handled like the Verizon iPhone
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:22.520]   4, where Apple, by the way, fixed the antenna, but the whole crux was that now it works on
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:23.520]   Verizon."
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:27.120]   And I thought Apple would just say, "Here's a new version of the new iPad that also works
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:30.560]   on LTE in Australia and Europe and these other places."
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:33.240]   If you already have the iPad 3, this is essentially the same thing.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:37.040]   By the way, we put the lightning connector in and it's not going to run quite as warmly
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.240]   as it did last time.
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:41.800]   But the main thing is that it's more, the LTE is more extended.
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:46.720]   But instead they actually immediately said 4th generation iPhone, sorry, iPad.
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:50.640]   And even though the processor is twice as fast, in real life usage there's almost no
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:52.440]   perceptive difference.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:56.640]   And if you have an iPad 3 and you don't live in one of those countries with LTE that it
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:00.520]   doesn't support, there's no reason at all to switch.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:01.520]   To an iPad 4.
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:05.680]   So it was really flabbergasted to me that they actually put that on that label on it.
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:07.440]   I wasn't surprised at all.
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:11.320]   I mean, given that they already have an iPad mini event going on there, so it's not as
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:16.040]   though they were going to roll out the whole dog and pony show just for this update to
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:17.040]   the iPad.
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:21.200]   But let's not forget that this is the quarter that Microsoft's shipping Windows 8, which
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.040]   is success or failure.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:26.480]   We can have the debate like that as a sidecar.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:32.240]   But we're still talking about a new brand new line of devices running what is ostensibly
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:37.280]   still the most popular operating system on the planet that kind of blurs the line between
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:42.640]   the sort of devices that are distinctly an iPad and the sort of devices that are distinctly
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:43.640]   a Windows notebook.
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:49.000]   I mean, a Surface RT tablet for a lot of people covers a lot of the same ground.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.600]   And if you're for a lot of buyers, if you're looking for a laptop with tablet features,
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:57.880]   it kind of obvious the need for specifically a 10 inch tablet, I think a seven inch or
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:00.480]   a 7.9 inch tablet is still very much in play.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:04.480]   But a lot of people are going to wonder, well, I was going to be buying a new $799 Windows
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:05.480]   8 PC.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:06.480]   It does have a touchscreen.
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:09.880]   It does operate in some of the same ways that I would assume that I'd be using a 10
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:13.800]   inch iPad for why am I going to be still interested in a 10 inch iPad.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:19.720]   So I do see some logic in them deciding to say not having a special event for it, not
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:23.440]   having a special commercial touting what a wonderful advance this is, but at least saying
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:28.520]   it costs them nothing to say this is the fourth generation iPad rather than saying this is
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:33.160]   we just made a free tweak to people who haven't bought an iPad yet.
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:37.080]   Speaking of iPhone 5s, we've got a couple people in chat saying, why are we even talking
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:40.800]   about people are still waiting to get their iPhone 5 shipped to them?
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.160]   That was part of the rumor.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:45.800]   They were saying that Apple was going to work on an iPhone 5s because they were so difficult
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.560]   making the iPhone 5.
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:49.920]   They needed to change the way it was manufactured.
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.080]   And that would spin off into an S line.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:56.400]   Yeah, apparently word from the Foxconn plant.
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:52:02.360]   iPhone 5 is the most difficult device that Foxconn has ever assembled, although apparently
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:05.600]   production is getting better day by day.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:11.080]   CFO Peter Oppenheimer said we're working very hard to get more into customers hands
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:12.960]   as quickly as possible.
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:18.320]   CEO Tim Cook says probably with a little twinkle on his eye, the demand for iPhone 5
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:19.760]   is extremely robust.
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:22.360]   We are in a significant state of that log.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:25.320]   Happened to know Jason Sennell does a great Tim Cooks.
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:27.080]   We should have him read that.
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:29.240]   This is Tim.
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:30.760]   I love that he identifies himself.
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:31.760]   He's the CEO.
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.760]   This is Tim.
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:40.360]   It's a significant backlog and we feel terrible while we count all your money.
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:41.600]   It's funny.
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:45.120]   I would predict that this new iPhone 5, if it really does exist and is going to ship
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:48.480]   early next year, probably they'll just call it the iPhone 5 and they won't even stick
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:49.480]   an S on it.
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:53.880]   It's probably more about changing the components and making it easier for them to build.
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:55.520]   All of us will be like, "Aha!
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:59.440]   It's actually 5,4 or whatever."
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:02.280]   Regular people will just be like, "Whatever, it's an iPhone 5.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:03.760]   Is it black or white?"
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:06.800]   They're not going to care beyond that.
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:12.720]   The one thing from that report, that kind of concern me, and this was just speculation
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:18.440]   on the writer's part that Apple is partially concerned that they're waiting too long.
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:22.320]   They're over testing, they're over certifying, and they want to speed up the certification
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:24.520]   process for their own hardware.
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:31.960]   Given that antenna issues aside, Apple has a history of getting the hardware right at
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:33.680]   least the first time.
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:36.960]   That would concern anybody to think that they're speeding things up.
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:39.480]   Again, that was just conjecture on that person's part.
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:43.400]   I think it's more like, again, they've seen an opportunity.
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:48.400]   If they're accelerating the development of the next iteration of the iPhone, I do think
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:51.440]   that it's these under the hood sort of improvements, kind of like what they're doing with the
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:57.480]   iPad 4, as opposed to, "We found a way to make it one-third of a millimeter thinner."
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:58.480]   You're welcome.
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:02.960]   It's so interesting because the iPad 4 has all new internals, same case.
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:07.480]   The iPad Mini has the new case, old iPad 2 internals, but it does raise the question
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:10.760]   if Apple is off those cycles that Phil Schiller once mentioned.
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:14.240]   They like their product cycles, and they're just going to release new stuff whenever it's
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:15.240]   ready.
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:19.680]   You can also use the iPad Mini to get the iPad Mini.
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.680]   It's going to be a great deal.
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:23.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:25.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:26.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:27.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:28.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:29.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:30.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:31.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:32.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:33.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:34.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:35.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:36.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:37.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:44.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:47.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:50.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:52.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:54.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:56.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:58.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:00.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:02.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:04.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:06.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:07.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:08.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:09.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:10.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:11.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:12.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:13.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:14.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:15.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:16.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:17.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:18.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:19.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:20.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:21.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:22.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:23.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:24.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:25.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:26.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:27.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:28.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:29.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:30.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:31.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:32.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:33.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.

[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:35.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:36.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:37.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:38.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:58.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:01.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.

[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:03.680]   I think it's going to be a great deal.
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:07.680]   Are we ready?
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:14.680]   Anybody want to add a little anything?
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:17.680]   I bet many.
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:22.680]   I thought I would be more productivity oriented and go back to the big display.
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:25.680]   It hasn't happened.
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:32.680]   It's genuinely a surprise.
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:33.680]   I don't know.
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.680]   We live in a world with all these different options.
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.680]   I've got a Kindle paper white too.
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:42.680]   I find myself asking myself what's the difference between using the Kindle paper white and using the iPad mini.
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:45.680]   Would I just get rid of the paper white and stick with the mini?
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:52.680]   There are some issues there about glare because the e-ink screen, the lighting on it is a little bit nicer in lots of circumstances, but not all.
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:55.680]   It's fascinating that we have all of these choices now.
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:59.680]   Sometimes it's going to come down to literally how it feels in your hand instead of anything else.
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:06.680]   It's comfortable to hold in my hand for half an hour versus something like specs that we think of today.
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:10.680]   It may be not about specs and all about ergonomics.
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:17.680]   I'll just like to say one last thing that Jason's absolutely right.
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:28.680]   I'd love to see the Apple community and the broader community of technology likers get beyond is the idea that there has to be a victor and a loser in every product we have.
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:42.680]   The only way to have a successful product is to make sure that it sells enough that just like that line in Bull Durham, you win by getting your victories that you get to come back to the ballpark.
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:49.680]   If a device sells well enough that they get to do another iteration of it, then the user base continues to evolve.
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:04:03.680]   The installed apps continue to get better. That's a win. What we rarely are hoping for is that not that Apple controls the entire tablet industry and it's silly to say that iPad makes the best devices in any category.
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:11.680]   It's that no matter what sort of device, what sort of solution you're looking for, this consumer will be able to find the one that's perfect.
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:18.680]   They're not getting an iPad because the only one that's out there, they're getting an iPad because they looked at four different models with four different attitudes and approaches towards how to make a multi-part model.
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:26.680]   They decided that the iPad was the best fit. That's what's great about the developments of 2012. So much choices and tablets.
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:37.680]   We went from a situation where really the iPad was the only thing going to a situation in which I can name five superlative multi-touch tablets that I would be happy to recommend it just about anybody.
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:45.680]   It's better competition for Apple. If they dominate the market, Apple's good at competing with themselves, but they're always best when they're strong competition.
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:52.680]   I've just found for me that if I leave the house without a laptop, I'm going to take my big iPad because there's just more things I can do with it.
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:59.680]   But if I already have a MacBook Air with me, I find I don't need the big iPad. So the iPad mini keeps the weight down.
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:03.680]   It's much easier to take with me and that's what I'm going to go with.
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:09.680]   All right. Before we get into some of our, we have a miscellaneous section of stories that we can dip into.
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:15.680]   Let's kick it over to Leo again. He's going to talk about one of our favorite blogging engines, Squarespace.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:22.680]   Hey, Mac Breakers. Leo Laport back from Australia to mention Squarespace. I was so proud of Squarespace.
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:27.680]   Did you read the story in, I think it was the Huffington Post about what happened with Squarespace?
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:32.680]   I was watching the pictures in the blog on Squarespace during Hurricane Sandy.
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:37.680]   After Sandy knocked out the power to lower Manhattan,
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:41.680]   the Squarespace, that's where the Squarespace Network Operations Center is.
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:50.680]   Pier 1 hosting. And the story is amazing. These guys kept through the power outage, kept Pier 1 up,
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:56.680]   kept Squarespace sites up literally by a bucket brigade.
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:03.680]   Employees from Squarespace joined employees from Pier 1 and other in Fog Creek software.
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:09.680]   To keep the content, cut the power off at 75 Broad Street.
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:14.680]   The company had generators in the basement, but the basement was flooded. This is such an amazing story.
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:20.680]   Their last backup generator was on the 17th floor.
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:25.680]   So Pier 1 called Squarespace and said, "Look, we're going to run out of power."
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:30.680]   Anthony Castellano, the founder of Squarespace, ran over with other employees
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:36.680]   and began a bucket brigade of diesel-filled jugs, hauling them upstairs.
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:44.680]   This is the dedication to uptime that makes Squarespace so remarkable.
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:50.680]   What a story. I am so proud to be part of the, you know, affiliated with Squarespace.
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:53.680]   And I love Anthony. We went out and we had dinner with him last year.
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:57.680]   We had such fun talking to him. This is a guy you would like.
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:00.680]   This is a company you would love. He started it in college.
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:03.680]   Here was the idea. He wanted to make a great website.
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:06.680]   He didn't like the tools that were available, so he wrote his own.
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:10.680]   And then he started a business where he does hosting. This is a host.
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:15.680]   But also, there's only one thing you can do on this host, and that's run the Squarespace software.
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:22.680]   Really good software too, let me tell you. Just take a tour. Go to squarespace.com.
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:25.680]   Actually, even better than a tour, click the Get Started button.
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:29.680]   You can try it free for 14 days, absolutely free. No credit card needed or anything.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:34.680]   So you really can get a sense of it. Use the Squarespace importer to import in the content
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:37.680]   from your existing site so you can really see what it looks like.
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:43.680]   You'll love the mobile-responsive designs. And if you are, and I know some of you are,
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:48.680]   an artist of some kind of, many of you are photographers or painters.
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:52.680]   Maybe you're a writer or filmmaker or fashion designer.
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:57.680]   Squarespace is the place to make a portfolio. The responsive design means it's very easy to make a gallery
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:01.680]   that looks great no matter what the platform is. It's so good for people.
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:04.680]   Nowadays, people come on mobile. You need to look good on mobile.
[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:11.680]   Squarespace is the new Squarespace completely designed from the ground up to do this.
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:14.680]   Plus, you have full control of what your site looks like.
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:17.680]   Even if you're not a web wizard, you could be a normal person.
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:22.680]   Now, if you do know CSS, JavaScript, HTML5, the sky is the limited Squarespace.
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:26.680]   You'll love the code editor with the colors syntax coding and all that.
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:30.680]   That's the point. Squarespace kind of makes it easy for everybody.
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:34.680]   I want you to try it free. Go to squarespace.com.
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:40.680]   Set up your site. Look at it on an iPhone, on an iPad, on an Android phone, on a desktop.
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:43.680]   You'll see how great it looks in all sizes.
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:49.680]   If you decide to buy, check it out. The pricing on Squarespace is amazing.
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:53.680]   They've got only two plans. They really simplified this.
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:59.680]   The standard plan, $8 a month, or the unlimited plan, $16 a month, $16 a month.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:05.680]   You can have unlimited pages, galleries, blogs, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage, unlimited contributors.

[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.680]   I'm so proud of them.
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:57.680]   And by the way, everything's up and running, and Sandy's moved on.
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:00.680]   Thank goodness, and our friends are all okay, I think.
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:02.680]   Back to MacBreak weekly.
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:05.680]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:13.680]   So, Pat and Lee Apple had a neat story about an invention, an Apple headphone invention,
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:17.680]   which is way cooler than the earpods, actually.
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:22.680]   This is a headphone design that could be operated in two modes.
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:25.680]   So, you've got the first mode, which is just normal.
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.680]   I'm wearing headphones.
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:34.680]   And then the second mode would allow me to put my headphones, take them off my head,
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:43.680]   put them on a table, and then they become speakers with, I guess, some sort of an amplifier
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:50.680]   that hopefully is really smart enough not to make me go deaf if I'm wearing them on my ears
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:56.680]   so that I've got a little walking stereo system with me.
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:59.680]   I mean, we've all got, we're always carrying headphones around with us,
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:03.680]   although these aren't the in-ear buds that don't take up a lot of space, right?
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:09.680]   These are actually over-the-ear headphones rather than in-ear headphones.
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:14.680]   I don't know. I sometimes wonder, I mean, who are all these people who need speakers all the time?
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:17.680]   Is this cool to you guys? Do you guys, would you use it?
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:23.680]   This is the sort of product description that, like, mentally you hear at the end of this pitch,
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:30.680]   so dry, so, so, sharks, I'm asking for $80,000 for investment in exchange for 5% of the company,
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.680]   because I've written your offers.
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:34.680]   I would have said it's Dell commercial, but that's close enough.
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:39.680]   Yeah, it seems on the surface like an interesting idea,
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:42.680]   and you would have discussions with people about it that would go
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:46.680]   of the 40 levels that you have to go to get a product made.
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:51.680]   It would get to level three before someone would realize that, yeah, but it's kind of a quirky,
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:56.680]   weird, you know, gadget-y sort of product.
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:58.680]   You could find a manufacturer in China to make it.
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:02.680]   You could probably get it in CVS pharmacies, and people would buy them for the holidays,
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:06.680]   but people would never use them after the second time that they turned them on.
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:11.680]   The built-in safety feature, which is addressing my actual concern,
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:15.680]   says to prevent injury to a user by outputting amplified audio,
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:20.680]   while the headphones are near our users' ears, the headphones could include a sensor
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:23.680]   for detecting the distance between ears and headphones.
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:26.680]   So, sensor that detects contact between the headphones
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:28.680]   and the user could be provided.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:30.680]   Well, that's a relief.
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:31.680]   Yeah.
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:35.680]   Also, it doesn't like every guy on the subway, on every time I've written the T,
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:39.680]   I already have a patent on earphones that also act as loudspeakers.
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:43.680]   At least I see three of these guys on every single subway car I go to,
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:48.680]   where it's not enough that they're wearing the earbuds that fill the entire compartment with --
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:52.680]   [humming]
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:55.680]   So, maybe someone was riding the Metro and decided that,
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:58.680]   "Hey, that's a good idea for an actual product."
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:01.680]   I had one of those guys next to me on an airplane once.
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:05.680]   It was hilarious because I felt like I could hear every single thing he was listening to,
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:10.680]   and I thought, "Either those are really bad headphones, or he's deaf."
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:11.680]   Right.
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:13.680]   So, there's really almost no point in nudging a mask
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.680]   and to turn it down because he wouldn't hear you anyway.
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:21.680]   Yeah, I know it's old news, but when the ear pods -- I'm getting that name right, right?
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:24.680]   Yeah, the newest form of the Apple's In Your Headphones,
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:29.680]   when they were first released, I was so excited because they were going to be the answer to all my prayers.
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:32.680]   I thought they sounded so much better, but now that I actually use them,
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:36.680]   and I use them daily, you know, when I go running and things like that,
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.680]   you know, they're really not that great.
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:44.680]   And I'm sure it depends on how well your ears are designed and if they're misshapen or something,
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:46.680]   they fall out of my ears all the time.
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:47.680]   I don't know.
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:55.680]   I don't know if the in-ear headphones thing is -- I don't think the ear pods are as great as I thought at the beginning.
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:57.680]   They're not designed for everybody, right?
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:59.680]   They're designed for anybody.
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:02.680]   They're designed because they need to put something in the box
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:04.680]   and they're better than what was in the box before,
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:08.680]   but, you know, anybody who's kind of even a little bit of a headphones knob
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:10.680]   who tries to use those is all purpose.
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:11.680]   I mean, they're fine.
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:15.680]   They're good enough for probably 90% of the people who use them, 95% maybe,
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:19.680]   but they're not, you know, people who are trying to run with them.
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:22.680]   It's not, you know, people who've got ears that are just not quite the right size or shape.
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:25.680]   I mean, I've got any ear headphones here.
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:29.680]   I've never -- I haven't used a pair of Apple headphones for a long time.
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:30.680]   Yeah.
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:33.680]   Well, there's still, I think, the best sub $50 headphones I've tried.
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:37.680]   And when you consider that you also get, like, in-line microphone and volume controls,
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:40.680]   I think -- I still think they're -- it's a great thing to throw into the box
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:46.680]   with the phone, given that this office here gets a few -- at least a few phones every single month,
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:49.680]   and I see the crappy, crappy earbuds that you get with them, then.
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:51.680]   I do think it's a big win.
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:55.680]   Well, maybe you'll like this patent better.
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:06.680]   This is Apple patent number, 8,303,151 for microperforation illumination.
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:16.680]   Apparently, would create a microperforation and a device that's small enough so that the naked eye could not see it,
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:24.680]   but large enough to allow the passage of light so that it could be used with multi-touch technology
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:29.680]   to create invisible device controls.
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:31.680]   What?
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:33.680]   What?
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:43.680]   Initially, what I saw was a manufacturing simplicity where that's one less -- if they could microperforate the lid of the MacBook
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:52.680]   so that they don't have to put that extra translucent plastic inside, that's a one-step less that's one less part to put in.
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:16:00.680]   I don't understand -- if Apple is actually asking us to stroke the Apple logo fondly, they make something happen,
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:06.680]   that's a level of Apple integrity of Apple fandom that I'm not sure that I'm willing to get behind.
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:10.680]   I was like, Andy, I thought exactly that, that it was going to be a better thing than the plastic.
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:15.680]   Maybe that patent is being misrepresented in the write-up.
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:18.680]   Jason, any idea?
[01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:22.680]   They've been doing those little microperforations for a while now in some places,
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:28.680]   and I think I've always thought that it was more about them not liking the look of cutouts and things
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:33.680]   and trying to get it down to these small little punctures.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:40.680]   It would be cool, I guess, if they could create -- they have more freedom to have touch screen on the bezel,
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:42.680]   even though it's not a screen or something like that.
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:47.680]   Up to now, what they've been using microperforations for is just to make it so that they don't have to --
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:53.680]   to a big round hole, they can do a bunch of little tiny holes, and you can see them.
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:59.680]   They're not as small as the ones in this patent, but it's more of a design decision.
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:02.680]   It's using engineering to make something that looks pretty.
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:03.680]   That's interesting.
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:08.680]   Do you think that they would be so interested -- I'm not even suggesting this is true or not,
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:10.680]   but I think that's an interesting question.
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:17.680]   If they had a technology so that the Apple logo would only appear on the cover of a MacBook
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:20.680]   when it's actually illuminated and when it's actually running,
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:25.680]   would there be a camp inside of Apple that would say, "No, it'd be great because now we have just a sheet
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:30.680]   of unblemished, perfect sheet of substance that just highlights what this thing is made out of."
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:34.680]   And then the Apple logo seems to come in out of nowhere when it's activated,
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:37.680]   or would they just want to make sure they have a logo on there somewhere,
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:39.680]   even when this thing is completely inert?
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:42.680]   Well, and keep in mind it's a patent, so it's possible that they had that argument,
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:46.680]   and the people said, "Nah, we're not going to do it, but let's patent it."
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:47.680]   Tony, I did it.
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:48.680]   Tony, I did it.
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:49.680]   Right.
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:53.680]   Right, but I could see that for something that's revealed, maybe not the logo,
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:56.680]   but something where you look at it and it looks like there's nothing there
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:59.680]   and suddenly there's something that indicates status or it's just,
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:02.680]   maybe on the front a little logo lights up for something.
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:04.680]   That's a sleep point that used to throb.
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:05.680]   Right.
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:06.680]   Cylon light at us.
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:14.680]   Well, what about the current state of iOS?
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:16.680]   Business Insider article.
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:21.680]   The headline is, "It's time for Apple to unleash a major software overhaul."
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:22.680]   That could be an...
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:23.680]   Always time to that.
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:26.680]   Yeah, could be an all sorts of things.
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:27.680]   Everyone.
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:28.680]   iTunes.
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:29.680]   This is sort of a...
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:39.680]   It's a gathering of quotes from a variety of journalists who write about Apple and iPhones and iPads,
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:43.680]   citing iPhone 5, it's boring, and people are bored.
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:44.680]   Who's bored?
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:48.680]   I mean, we've had the same desktop metaphor on the Mac for...
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:49.680]   Since there was a GUI.
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:52.680]   I mean, there's been very little radical change on desktop operating systems,
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:54.680]   probably until Windows 8.
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:56.680]   And if you look at something, people are very impressed.
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:58.680]   Windows Phone is all different.
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:01.680]   It's new, but Metro is even more constrained than iOS is.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:03.680]   You can make a Metro app.
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:05.680]   I think it was your pick of the week last week, Sarah.
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:09.680]   You can make an iOS app that looks exactly like a Windows Phone music player,
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:13.680]   and you can't do that on Windows Phone because Metro is the forced design language.
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:14.680]   So I don't...
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:17.680]   I first don't buy the idea that it's...
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:19.680]   Well, I haven't seen them.
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:21.680]   Oh, I'm so sorry.
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:22.680]   Everything is Metro, right?
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:24.680]   You have the panorama view for apps.
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:25.680]   Everything is large.
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:26.680]   It's big.
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:27.680]   You're in your inbox.
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:30.680]   The design language permeates Windows Phone, where iOS, you have a developer,
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:33.680]   can make an app look like almost anything that they want once they launch.
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:35.680]   Container.
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:37.680]   You can...
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:42.680]   My understanding from my conversation with Windows Phone developers is that you can,
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:47.680]   if you want to, throw out Metro entirely and have a canvas that you just basically put all your objects on,
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:50.680]   just as you can with iPad.
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:52.680]   But there's such a...
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:56.680]   I do think that Metro is a wonderful design language.
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:20:02.680]   That scales magnificently from handset to tablet to desktop very, very well.
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:05.680]   And as a matter of fact, it's one of the things I really like about Surface RT,
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:10.680]   that they found a way to merge an interface that's appropriate for both keyboard and mouse
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:15.680]   and one that's suitable for touchscreen in a very, very good way.
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:17.680]   But you're right in that.
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:23.680]   We've seen very, very few apps that decide, "No, we're not gonna get rid of what is actually supposed to be called the modern interface.
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:27.680]   We're gonna get rid of modern completely and I'm just gonna have my app do whatever it wants to."
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:33.680]   The only places I'm really seeing that are in apps that are just sort of trans-mogrifications
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:35.680]   of an iOS or an Android app.
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:38.680]   Meanwhile, you look at the net or a game, right?
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:42.680]   Meanwhile, you take a look at the Comixology app, you take a look at the Netflix app,
[01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:49.680]   those are, in my opinion, they're the best articulations of those apps on any mobile platform you can find.
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:53.680]   And it is because of the Metro design language, because it allows people...
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:54.680]   It allows designers...
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:21:01.680]   It gives them a nicer palette of tools to go from when you're presenting media in a mobile context.
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:10.680]   I would say I do agree with a larger point that I think we're coming up six years since we first saw what we now call iOS.
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:13.680]   And it's a model built on that one...
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:16.680]   The original iPhone had one screen.
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:18.680]   It wasn't even entirely full of apps.
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:23.680]   And we've come a long way since then, but a lot of the concepts, the fundamental concepts of the springboard,
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:28.680]   especially haven't, which is that screen, haven't changed very much in coming up six years.
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:33.680]   And I do feel like it's time for a refresh and time for a rethink.
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:39.680]   And yeah, Apple's been very successful with it, but if you never change while you're successful,
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:41.680]   you're just going to ride something into the ground until it's a failure.
[01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:43.680]   And Apple doesn't want to do that.
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:51.680]   It makes me wonder with the executive changes, with Forstall leaving, with Ivan and Federighi being upgraded,
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:59.680]   that maybe this is... I'm not saying what their motivations might be and what would have happened if Forstall had stayed,
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:07.680]   but just having new people in charge makes me think like it's a time of transition and maybe we'll actually see with iOS 7,
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:12.680]   maybe some real change in what the iPhone and iPad looked like for the first time.
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:14.680]   And I think it would be welcome.
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:16.680]   I think it's time.
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:20.680]   What's crazy to think about it is that iOS is now one of the oldest mobile operating systems.
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:24.680]   It was so new in 2007, but now everyone else has refreshed.
[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:31.680]   And when BlackBerry 10 launches in December and BlackBerry 10 looks to be a fantastic interface, very gesture-centric as well,
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:37.680]   iOS will be the oldest popular mobile OS still on the market.
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:45.680]   And they are dragging now, they are almost in the Windows position where they are dragging hundreds of millions of mainstream users behind them.
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:51.680]   And I've said before, my sister uses her iPhone to take pictures, make phone calls, and listen to iPod music.
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:56.680]   She doesn't know anything about Notification Center, nothing about fast app switches, nothing about Siri.
[01:22:56.680 --> 01:23:01.680]   She just likes to hit her home, her buttons, press the home button, go back to those three apps.
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:04.680]   But Apple has been making a lot of changes.
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:07.680]   A lot of them are under NDA still, or they're not surfaced in iOS 6,
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:11.680]   but there's a lot of stuff that is setting Apple up for things like Siri,
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:16.680]   which is an entirely new interface that just happens to coexist with iOS right now,
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:19.680]   or with Notification Center where there are the beginnings of widgets,
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:23.680]   the beginnings of data being brought into apps, and not you having to go hunt for apps.
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:28.680]   So I think iOS 7 might be too early, but there's definitely things that Apple is doing
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:31.680]   that I think is going to surprise him to light us going forward.
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:39.680]   I think Apple is in kind of a dangerous time right now in that it's not the...
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:43.680]   When the iPad and the iPhone first came out, all these companies were,
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:48.680]   when say copying is kind of an incendiary term, but let's just say copying, both of those devices,
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:54.680]   which means that they were just producing what Apple was capable of producing in 2007.
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:24:00.680]   What we're seeing, I think for the first time in 2017, is Google and Microsoft
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:06.680]   taking the lessons of three years of experience, not just with iPads and iPhones,
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:10.680]   but with iPad and iPhone users. Here's how they're responding to it.
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:15.680]   Is there something they can learn from the fact that you can buy really clunky,
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:19.680]   really ugly looking keyboard cases for the iPad, and it's a very competitive,
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:23.680]   very successful market. And the result are operating systems like Windows 8,
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:31.680]   interfaces like Metro, the Google's version of Siri, which in many ways is...
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:34.680]   Most ways is as good, in many ways, even better.
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:38.680]   It really is going to be challenged to make sure that they continue to push the medium forward.
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:43.680]   Most of the cases, it's not so much a case of catching up to these other people
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:47.680]   so much as making sure that they don't fall behind in the future.
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:50.680]   But in the springboard app, this I think is a critical issue.
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:55.680]   They need to fix it. Right now, the way that the iPad and the iPhone launch apps,
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:25:00.680]   it's a problem. It is the most difficult system on all the mobile operating systems
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:03.680]   that I work with. And it's the least flexible.
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:07.680]   And the reason why that I often do find myself recommending a Kindle Fire HD
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:13.680]   over an iPad mini to some people is that there are folks that they don't want to interact with this as a computer.
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:15.680]   They want to see the damn book that they were reading yesterday.
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:19.680]   They want to see the damn movie they're listening to watching this morning.
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:23.680]   They don't have to think about, "Okay, what app did I use to buy and run the...
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:26.680]   What app did I use to run this thing?
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:31.680]   And where do I find it on these 10 pages of unassociated, undifferentiated icons
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:36.680]   that are not sorted by name, not sorted by category, not sorted by anything,
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:41.680]   except for this really meticulous process that I, the user, have to undergo to impose some order on this.
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:45.680]   Springboard is potentially an anchor that's going to drag people down
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:49.680]   because this is their first interaction with the iPad.
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:52.680]   You wake up, this is the first thing you use when you take this thing out of the box
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:57.680]   after you've registered it, and man, it's just such a terrible first impression.
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:00.680]   A springboard has changed.
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:01.680]   I don't want to spoil it.
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:06.680]   We'll have a post up on it later today, but there's been some big changes to us.
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:09.680]   I don't want to speak out of term, but there have been some big changes to springboard
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:14.680]   and I think there will continue to be, and I think, again, we'll be seeing some interesting stuff from Apple.
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:19.680]   Still a grid of icons, still understanding that your relationship to your data through applications,
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:24.680]   which is a very 2004 attitude towards the way an operating system works.
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:27.680]   I just think we need something about that.
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:28.680]   I have mixed feelings about that.
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:31.680]   I do think that we are an effort dragging hundreds of millions of people
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:36.680]   who are very comfortable, very used to press the home button, press my icon, press the home button,
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:41.680]   press my icon, and I think the trick is moving them forward while not losing them,
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:43.680]   but giving us a more sophisticated way of doing it.
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:47.680]   I think part of what Apple is introducing in the newer versions of iOS will hopefully take care of that.
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:55.680]   You know, I have a bit of an app issue because I test so many apps that I have way more than the average person should ever have.
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:27:02.680]   But I find that instead of even organizing my apps, I've just completely given that up.
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:08.680]   I search for everything, and that works okay for me, but Andy, I think to your point is,
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:13.680]   I still have to remember what app helped me do the thing, make the thing work,
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:18.680]   and sometimes I'm sitting there with a search bar, empty, going,
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:21.680]   "I don't even know what I'm searching for. I know what I want to achieve,
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:25.680]   but now I have to remember the name of the app that I might have only downloaded a week ago,
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:29.680]   and it's not etched into my brain."
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:31.680]   So that is sort of a problem.
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:33.680]   Yeah, to you, Spotlight is my application launcher.
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:35.680]   I almost never launch from Springboard anymore.
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:37.680]   It's just not useful for me.
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:38.680]   Mm-hmm.
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:40.680]   All right, well, we've got picks with a week.
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:43.680]   I think that'll cheer us all up a little bit.
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:48.680]   Before we get to those, we're going to kick it over to Leo one last time
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:53.680]   to thank our fourth and final sponsor, Gazzo.
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:55.680]   If you don't mind, I'd like to interrupt just for a moment.
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:58.680]   Hello, everybody. Leo Laport coming back from the grave.
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:01.680]   Well, at least from Australia, to talk a little bit about Gazzel.
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:06.680]   Show of hands, how many of you have a messy drawer in the house
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:11.680]   that's filled with old computers and cell phones and old gadgets?
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:13.680]   Some of us have messy closets.
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:17.680]   Some of us have entire rooms devoted to old gadgets.
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:19.680]   There's no reason to save those gadgets.
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:23.680]   They're not getting more valuable, Dick.
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:26.680]   Dick actually pays hundreds of bucks a month for the gadget warehouse.
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:28.680]   They're not getting more valuable.
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:30.680]   What you need is Gazzel.
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:34.680]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, Gazzel.com.
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:40.680]   Sell your iPhone, your iPad, your Mac, your iPod, your old cell phone
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:43.680]   and get cash for it right now.
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:45.680]   They'll even buy old Blackberries.
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:46.680]   How much could those be?
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:50.680]   Let's see, AT&T, Blackberry Torch.
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:52.680]   It's in good condition.
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:54.680]   I don't actually have one of these, but what if you did?
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:58.680]   You'd be tempted just to throw it away or throw it in a drawer,
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:28:59.680]   free of water damage.
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:00.680]   How much?
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:01.680]   Worth 92 bucks.
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:03.680]   Now, throw that in the box.
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:04.680]   You've got your iPad.
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:06.680]   You want to get that new iPad fourth generation?
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:08.680]   Take the old third generation iPad.
[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:09.680]   Trade that in.
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:10.680]   What?
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:12.680]   525 bucks.
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:13.680]   Now, here's the deal.
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:17.680]   That quote is good for a month, so you have time to get the new iPad.
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:19.680]   Decide if you want to keep it.
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:20.680]   Transfer your data over.
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:26.680]   And then, 30 days later, send your iPad to Gazzel and they guarantee that price.
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:28.680]   Their data experts will wipe it.
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:29.680]   This is better than recycling.
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:32.680]   This is getting it to somebody who really wants it.
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:37.680]   Apple computers, Apple TV, Apple displays, iPods of any generation, almost.
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:42.680]   iPads, of course, cell phones and iPhones too.

[01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:06.680]   We now take it back to Macbreak Weekly.
[01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:08.680]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:10.680]   It's pick time.
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:14.680]   This is actually my favorite part of the show because I get a lot of tips from all of you.
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:17.680]   Andy, should we start with you this week?
[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:19.680]   What's your tip?
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:20.680]   Sure.
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:28.680]   My tip, as we turn the screen back on, there you go, is the sort of app that I really love to see.
[01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:34.680]   It's an app that's designed specifically to use on your iPhone while you're in your car
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:37.680]   while it's in a car duct, to be sure.
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:41.680]   What it does is it takes all the most common features that you would like to access on the iPhone
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:46.680]   while you are driving and gives you a way you can access those safely.
[01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:52.680]   This is like the normal, what you see behind me is the normal screen that you're looking at.
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:55.680]   All you see are four really, really huge buttons.
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:58.680]   You reach over and tap one really huge button.
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:01.680]   You have access to your music player.
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:06.680]   Once again, with a really, really large, large display, we can move from track to track just
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:07.680]   by swiping.
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:10.680]   You really don't even have to look at the iPhone to do that.
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:13.680]   How many times have you been stuck in traffic?
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:15.680]   You're going at, you're on the highway.
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:17.680]   You're supposed to be doing 65.
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:21.680]   You're actually doing like closer to 35 and you know you're going to be really, really
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:26.680]   good and it's so tempting to simply reach out and try to send a text message to the person
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:28.680]   you're meeting with saying, "Hi, I'm sorry, I'm in traffic.
[01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:30.680]   I'm going to be really, I'm going to be a little bit late."
[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:33.680]   But you really, really can't do that even with Siri.
[01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:34.680]   It's kind of dangerous.
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:39.680]   Instead, there's a button that says Quick Text where you just have, you just preload it
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:43.680]   with the person that you would like to send a text message to and you preload it with a
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:47.680]   typical generic message such as, "Hi, traffic, running late.
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:49.680]   I'll update you whenever I can."
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:52.680]   So you really just reach out, tap one button, tap another big button.
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:56.680]   Again, practically without even looking, it's about, it'll get like maybe one third of a
[01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:59.680]   second of your attention and you can do these things safely.
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:02.680]   It has a whole bunch of just those kind of simple little features.
[01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:05.680]   It's 99 cents, I think.
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:10.680]   And I really would like to see more apps that are like this, that are sort of optimized
[01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:17.680]   for allowing people to do things that are logical to use a device for inside a car, but facilitates
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:24.680]   using them safely because I mean, I tried early on to try to use Siri for text messaging
[01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:27.680]   when, again, you have to send that, "Hey, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm going to miss
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:28.680]   my 120 train.
[01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:31.680]   I'm going to take the 210 instead and I'll see you later."
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:36.680]   Unfortunately, you have to make sure that Siri's, you know, you push the, you hold down the
[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:38.680]   button, you're not even looking, so that's fine.
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:45.680]   You say, "Hi, message Dave, message Dave, sending a message to Darvon Stationary."
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:46.680]   No!
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:47.680]   Dave?
[01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:48.680]   Okay.
[01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:50.680]   What would you like to say to Dave?
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:52.680]   "Hi Dave, here is your message."
[01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:53.680]   No!
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:54.680]   That's not the message.
[01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:56.680]   You didn't wait for me to tell you what to say.
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:33:00.680]   And so now I've got road rage, but I'm, you know, I wish that Siri were in a car that
[01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:03.680]   could crash into out of spite instead of just on my dashboard.
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:06.680]   So it's great app, 99 cents.
[01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:08.680]   It's definitely at the level where you can buy it, you can install it.
[01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:12.680]   If it doesn't work out, then it was a good experiment for 99 cents.
[01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:16.760]   But it's likely that it'll let you do things safely that otherwise you wouldn't have access
[01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:17.760]   to.
[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:22.960]   Yeah, it looks like, I think in the notes it says, it's an introductory offer.
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:28.680]   So maybe it's 99 cents temporarily, 50% off of $199 or something like that.
[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:33.720]   I really wish the store would force these people to say it's an introductory offer and here
[01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:37.520]   is exactly the date at which we will stop introducing this because all these introductory
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:43.320]   offers, they seem to last, I don't know, roughly and through the end of the Obama administration.
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:45.520]   Yeah, just until you start telling everybody.
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:46.520]   I think about extending it.
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:47.520]   Yeah.
[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:48.520]   It's a dollar and then they go, no, it's not.
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:49.520]   It's $2.
[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:51.720]   You say, well, that was four years ago.
[01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:52.720]   That's good one.
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:53.720]   That's drive.
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:54.720]   99 cents.
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:55.720]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:56.720]   Renee, your fixer.
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:57.720]   Yes.
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:02.560]   My, a while ago there was an app introduced called Clear for the iPhone.
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:06.000]   It was designed by Phil Ryu, who's amazing and it was coded by RealMac.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.560]   And I didn't end up using it because I can't really use it to do or a task sort of list
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:12.720]   that's only locked on my iPhone.
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:17.880]   But last week they actually introduced Clear for Mac and it uses iCloud sync.
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:20.560]   So now you can use Clear on your iPhone.
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:24.800]   You can use the iPhone app on your iPad and you can use the new Mac store app on your
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:25.800]   Mac.
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:31.440]   And the challenge for this was Clear did a very almost Metro-esque, a very gesture oriented
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:33.000]   interface.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.880]   And I was wondering how they would translate that to the Mac because most of us don't have
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:37.880]   touchscreen Macs.
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:39.880]   And they did a really good job.
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:41.640]   It's full of keyboard shortcuts.
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:44.960]   It's designed so you can enter new tasks extremely fast.
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:48.560]   The sync between the two versions is split second.
[01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:50.680]   And I've been using it quite a bit over the last week.
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:52.720]   It's not, it's more like reminders app.
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:57.200]   It's not a full, uh, omni focus sort of a getting things done app.
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:01.160]   But for just quick lists and sorting through them and marking them is done, it's a very
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:03.280]   nice alternative to the built in.
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:06.160]   I guess it all comes down to can you use it?
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:10.340]   You know, does it make you feel like you're more organized, you're getting stuff done
[01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:11.340]   more easily?
[01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:14.440]   Whatever that is, that's the good app.
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:18.520]   All right, Jason, do you have a tip for us?
[01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:19.520]   I do.
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:20.520]   I have a pick.
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:21.680]   It's called control plane.
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:24.720]   You can get it at controlplaneapp.com.
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:27.720]   They call it context sensitive computing.
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:28.720]   It's a free app.
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:35.040]   And basically it looks at your max environment and, um, and figures out where you are.
[01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:39.320]   And then you can set it to do various things like set it to full printer or update your
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:43.360]   iChat or message status and a bunch of other stuff.
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:49.720]   And the reason I got it was I wanted to have my chat status say when I'm at the office
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:53.440]   and say when I'm at home, and I didn't want to do it myself, but I didn't want it to be
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:54.440]   wrong.
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:58.680]   And control plane, you can actually go into great detail and say if you see these wife
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:03.640]   I find networks or if you're attached to this kind of device, this probably means you're
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:06.520]   in this location and you can actually stack things up.
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:11.400]   So if it sees, you know, if it sees that I'm attached to an external monitor and I'm looking
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:14.800]   at my work, Wi-Fi, 100% confidence of my work and it sends it.
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:19.640]   So it's just a run a clever way for your Mac if you've got a laptop to know where it
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:24.000]   is and to do things based on that context, which is something the system doesn't let
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000]   you do.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.080]   It's not built into the system.
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:27.560]   So this app is the bridge.
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:31.240]   It'll look at your Wi-Fi and your devices and your network configuration and all of that
[01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:32.240]   stuff.
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:34.000]   And then you can fire off Apple scripts.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.640]   You can have it, you know, control your Mac in different ways.
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:38.640]   And I like it.
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:43.040]   I think it's cool if you've got a laptop that it can just intuit where you are when you
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:46.160]   open it up and do some work for you.
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:47.160]   And free?
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:48.160]   Free?
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:49.160]   Wow.
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:50.160]   A low, low price of free.
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:52.160]   Yeah, that's a great price.
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:53.160]   Yeah.
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:54.160]   Free.

[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:01.320]   That's it?
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:02.320]   Love it.
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:04.400]   Sorry, you guys had pics.
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:05.400]   I kept calling them tips.
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:08.400]   You had three really good pics, not, well, I guess they're sort of tips.
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:09.400]   I can't miss the line.
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:10.400]   I'm going to install the software.
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:11.400]   Exactly.
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:12.400]   That's it.
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:13.400]   Install it.
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:14.400]   All right.
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:17.280]   Well, I think we've come to the end of a very good Mac break weekly.
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:23.520]   Thanks so much to all of you gentlemen for sticking with me two weeks in a row.
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:29.440]   Andy, I believe, if I'm not mistaken, that you are the pilot on next week's Mac break
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:30.440]   weekly.
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:31.440]   Exactly.
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:32.440]   We've got a special musical episode.
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:36.560]   I've got same day with junior Robert Goulay and the Queen Martin Singers.
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:39.920]   So be sure to be rolling tape on that one.
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:40.920]   Yes.
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:41.920]   How could you not?
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:48.200]   Of course, Andy Anatko, senior lead writer at the Chicago Sun Times, technology columns,
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:49.200]   friend of Twit.
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:50.200]   I don't know.
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:51.200]   You're just great.
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:52.200]   Renee Richie.
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:53.200]   What donor?
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:58.200]   A donor proud donor and user of safe apps while driving.
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:00.680]   Renee Richie, editor over at iMore.
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:05.560]   You mentioned that you've got a pretty interesting post coming out later today, although you
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:07.320]   don't want to spoil anything.
[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:10.120]   Anything else interesting happening over at iMore these days?
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:11.120]   Yeah.
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:12.120]   Well, actually, it's not so much a post.
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:16.000]   It's a brand new-- it's an interview that we did with Lauren Bricter.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.360]   It was myself and Guy English.
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:18.360]   Oh, nice.
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:22.480]   A long interview with Lauren Bricter about how he built and the challenges he had in the
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:26.480]   future of iOS, everything about letterpress and Twitter-- sorry, Tweety.
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:29.200]   So there's a lot of really good gems contained in there.
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:30.200]   Oh, it's great.
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:31.200]   We'll look out for that.
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:32.200]   And that's going up later today.
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:33.200]   Later today.
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:34.200]   Awesome.

[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:40.440]   You sound very busy.
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:42.200]   There's a lot going on.
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:43.640]   That's a lot of websites.
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:49.200]   Anything of note happening that we should know about in your world this week?
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:55.760]   Come visit our websites and check out my podcast, The Incompromable, which is all about sci-fi
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:56.760]   and geeky stuff.
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:58.320]   And you can search for it on iTunes.
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:38:59.320]   And you'll find it.
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:02.480]   It's the only one called The Incompromable because it's incomparable.
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:03.480]   Awesome.
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:06.200]   Well, thanks to all of you for joining me.
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:09.040]   And thanks to everybody for watching or listening.
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:12.480]   I got this wrong last week, so I'm going to try to get it right this week.
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:14.480]   And now, break time's over.
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:16.480]   Get back to work.
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:18.280]   That get right.
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:19.280]   Nice.
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:20.280]   See, I'm not going to work together.
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:21.280]   Nailed it.
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:22.280]   Nailed it.
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:23.280]   He's stuck.
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:24.280]   He's probably not.
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:26.000]   You have a very friendly, warm voice.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:40.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
