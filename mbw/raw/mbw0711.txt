[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly Renee, Andy and Lawyer all here.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.200]   We're going to talk about the worst product Apple ever made.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.640]   Can't figure out what that is.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:16.200]   Apple's shift to arm processors in the Macintosh starting next year and a zero-day alert in
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.200]   Apple Mail.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.920]   Is it really a zero-day exploit or has it been oversold?
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.160]   Renee Richie has the deets.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.560]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.120]   Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.480]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest Apple news.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.880]   From the Apple experts, Lori Gill is here.
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.520]   It's kind of like sunset in your hair.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.520]   The sun is going down, the darkness is in your hair.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.200]   There's a little bit of the pink still showing through.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.920]   You're nervous as sunset.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.720]   I love it.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.720]   Lori liked the rest of us.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.000]   We were all talking about how we're not getting the hair care we usually get from the trained
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   professionals.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.440]   I myself have developed wings in a variety of parts of my head.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.840]   That doesn't seem right, but I just love that.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.160]   The other other choices Lisa could cut my hair.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.080]   She says she will, but I think what's worst, a bad haircut or no haircut?
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.880]   You've got a handsome head, Leah.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.880]   We've seen you've all before.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.880]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.880]   Hey, there you go.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.880]   That's Mr. Renee Richie of YouTube.com/ReneeRitchieFame.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.720]   Leah, I'm looking like the illegitimate lovechild of Brooklyn and Don King.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.720]   It's different.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.800]   Are these new glasses?
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.320]   What is, what's going on here?
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.640]   No, it's just like it's my, this, this situation.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.920]   And you know if a young person on Vine or dating myself already on TikTok, they don't have
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.920]   no expectations.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.920]   This would be great.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.920]   I would just be going like this.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.920]   I feel like I have to hide my shame.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.400]   I'll never forget the day I found Kevin Rose and Dan Huard.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.960]   This is back in the screen savers in the dressing room putting product in their hair, making
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.960]   their hair stick up and out.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.960]   Messy.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.960]   Yeah, they were.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.840]   They were literally using a product called Bedhead.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.560]   Why don't you want to comb it?
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.040]   Oh, god, Leo, you're so old and he's got our surface.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.040]   You find more surface.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.600]   Andy and I co is also here.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.800]   He's smart enough to wear a hat.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.800]   Hello, Andy.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   Hello.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.560]   Actually, I'm thinking about finally living the dream and getting the haircut like Vivian
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.120]   from the young ones.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.120]   Yeah, very nice.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.120]   Very much like.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.480]   Colds, likes, calls, likes, calls, likes.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.360]   Now without professional tending to the sideburns go crazy or.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.080]   Oh, no, I always I do.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.640]   I've always been trimming my sideburns.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.680]   I think I think that now this is this is the I'm not judging anybody who's there are a
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.880]   lot of people who are growing beards for the first time.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.080]   I'm not judging.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.880]   Go fly fly whatever flag you want to fly.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.440]   It's you know, you be you.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.440]   I'm just saying that there is a difference between having a beard or mutton shops or facial
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.720]   hair or mustache and simply not wanting to shave.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.280]   And that difference young men is in grooming and trimming.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.200]   Meaning you you at first you have to grow it out so that you get a shape, but then you
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.600]   have to get scissors or clippers or something and trim them into shape.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.760]   This way you don't at the park.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.280]   They don't just let the hedge go wherever it wants to go.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.600]   At some point you got to square that thing off.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.760]   That's what I'm talking about intent young people intent.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.760]   Yes, it's not.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.760]   Yes.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.600]   So as a result, I do have like the barbershop grade buzzers like with with the with attachments
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.480]   like in my in my bathroom.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.920]   And I'm pretty sure that within the next couple weeks, I'm just going to buzz my hair.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.360]   Yeah, it's just it's it's a because I think if I try to give myself a haircut, it'll look
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.360]   kind of pathetic.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.400]   Whereas if I just simply say how about a half an inch, let's like 30 mill all around,
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.600]   that'll be okay.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.080]   I have to do it.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.680]   And Sunday Ian Thompson was here and Ian has used quarantine to grow what is perhaps the
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.000]   most lovely mustache I have ever seen.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.160]   He looks like can you see him?
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.160]   He looks like James Bond, you know, or well, or maybe who is that British actor with a
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.960]   salt and pepper must do so isn't it?
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.960]   Clueso.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.960]   Clueso.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.960]   It's kind of.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.960]   It's kind of.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.960]   It's kind of.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.960]   It's like this.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.960]   I feel like you should have a writing crop.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.960]   I don't know.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.320]   But Reynolds, he looks like for Reynolds.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.320]   It's pahoe.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.320]   It's pahoe.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.320]   Oh, wow.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.520]   We we decided to do a formal wear on a Twitter on Sunday.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.640]   And mostly it's because of Ian's mustache.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.720]   It's just like it's just, you know, if you if you have a mustache like that, you've got
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.720]   to wear a dinner jacket.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.720]   I mean, you got to lean into it.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.960]   You got to lean into it.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.560]   If I thought I could get a mustache that looks like that, I would do it a handle bar lio
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.200]   or like a is that how you would go like like full on side leaning with a Sunday whiplash?
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.200]   I I don't know.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.640]   Go for the full Swiss beer competition.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.600]   The kind that like actually like is like a big novelty pretzel.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.520]   When when this all began in our area was March 17th, because I remember it was St. Patrick's
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.400]   Day, I told Lisa that this is a great opportunity.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.600]   I just won't shave till quarantine's over.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.000]   She said no sleep till Brooklyn.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   No.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.200]   Yeah, he's got a definitely basil faulty look to it or almost a Mr. Bean could almost be
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.600]   a Mr. Bean.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.920]   Anyway, it's very British.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.920]   You can tell.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:09.920]   Very good.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.920]   Very good.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.560]   Also, also one last tip, make sure you have an upper lip because you you want or if you
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.440]   I have I have I have an overbite, which means that like if I if I were to like it which
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.800]   is fine, mostly, but if I grow a mustache, like the upper lip sort of collapses when I
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.800]   close my mouth.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.720]   And so it looks like I've just I'm just holding a pencil between my upper lip and my nose.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.720]   That's not good.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.200]   How can you figure that out ahead of time?
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.520]   There must be an app for that.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:45.040]   Well, chiefly chiefly because like I used to write these things called books, which meant
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.680]   that for the last month for deadline, I would not shave at all because I have no mental
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.440]   bandwidth for anything but typing and researching and yelling at certain software companies say,
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.520]   Hi, you said that this feature in this pre release operating system, you're going to
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.160]   be readies in a time.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.720]   Anyway, so that's at some point you have the entire beard and then once you're done and
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.920]   you shave it off, all men all men understand this.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.680]   You never shave off a beard in one go.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.440]   You always just do the work with real real transition.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.880]   Say, how would I look like?
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.880]   What would I look like?
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.880]   Mustard.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.880]   What would I look like?
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.880]   And I go tea.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.160]   What would I look like in a mustache?
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:27.400]   And then you go for the, let's say the Stan Laurel toothbrush mustache because you got
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.400]   it.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.400]   That's the long the arena.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.560]   That's the long the over.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.120]   Oh, Indian man, man, I'm rocking that like that.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.120]   That's my winner.
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.120]   Look, you got the one.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.040]   I wonder if beard grooming companies are going to be making a lot of money right now.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.040]   We actually have a new sponsor, Manscaped.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.040]   It's perfect for this.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.960]   Unfortunately, on the show today, I wish they were.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.200]   I'd love to do a Manscaped.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.200]   That's right.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.200]   Right.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.760]   The story of the week is really kind of a surprise.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.520]   I just got the, I finally got it.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.520]   Took them a little while.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.800]   The magic keyboard to go with my iPad Pro.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:07.960]   And I had kind of hypothesized that with the new iPad OS mouse and trackpad support,
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.640]   that maybe Apple was just going to not try to make its Max be arm based.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.960]   Maybe they were just going to see a natural division as I do between the Intel based trucks.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.640]   And then the iPad and iOS would become the kind of the mobile operating system.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.440]   Well, according to Mark Gurman, I was wrong, wrong, wrong.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.400]   Apple starting next year will sell Max with its own chips.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:37.040]   Of course, his own chips will be somewhat akin to the A13 arm architecture based.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.040]   So my speculation clearly wrong, Apple.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.600]   They were just waiting for you, Leo.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.480]   They waited until you set it on a show.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.000]   They just always do that to us.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.160]   So I guess it wouldn't be the A13, be the A14.
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.960]   What do we know?
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.560]   First of all, do you all think this is credible?
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.240]   Laurie, is this, I mean, Mark's pretty good on this stuff.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.000]   Yeah, I mean, yeah, definitely.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.520]   I think this is, this is most likely where Apple's going.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.320]   And 2021 seems like a reasonable amount of time considering how long we've been hearing
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.520]   this kind of rumor come out.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.440]   I think actually it was originally estimated that they might be out by 2020, but I'm sure
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.160]   there's a lot of reasons why that would get pushed back.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.840]   And just the fact that the chips not ready yet.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.240]   And we know Apple's been working on this kind of thing.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.520]   So 2021 seems about right.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.680]   One computer, all of them, the project is called Kalamata.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.680]   Kalamata is a Greek olive.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.960]   I don't know if that's a clue of any kind.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:39.320]   Yeah, I mean, the first, the Intel one was codenamed after the aliens from South Park.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:44.240]   So I was hoping that this would be named after the aliens from like Seth McFarland show or
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.240]   something.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.720]   But what's weird to me is that there's been so much back and forth chatter, like a bunch
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.160]   of analysts leaned really hard earlier this year saying Apple was not going to go arm
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.160]   on the Mac.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.560]   So hard that I was wondering if they were hearing things from AMD.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.800]   And a lot of people have been asking for AMD Macs now, especially when we've seen the
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.520]   relative performance gains.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.120]   They've gotten first on desktop with Threadripper and their rise in architecture.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:11.200]   And now on the latest laptops that have come out that are just, you know, they're spinning
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.000]   boards around what Intel is doing at the moment.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.200]   But then, you know, Gurman who reported on this a year or so ago, I think you already
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.720]   mentioned Kalamata and a bunch of other parts of this reiterated that they were going to
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.640]   go this way.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.200]   And it's interesting to me because what is the strategy?
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.200]   We don't know.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.320]   And I'm saying like outside of Apple, we don't know how high they've scaled these ships.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.360]   Like obviously their performance is as good as a Mac book.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:40.680]   Do they have anything internally that is as good as a iMac, as good as a Mac Pro?
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.920]   What would that look like?
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.400]   Would this be like, right now we have ARM co-processors and Intel main processors.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.640]   Would that switch around?
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:52.480]   So we'd have ARM main processors and Intel co-processors, at least for a few generations.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:58.000]   Or would they go split it between ARM and AMD and just leave Intel out in the cold?
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.040]   It's such a fascinating time right now.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:06.680]   This is the tweet which maybe, uh, can crystallizes it a little bit.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.960]   New story, Apple plans to start switching.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:17.560]   I think that's an important word here from Intel to custom Mac ARM processors by 2021.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:23.080]   Company is working on at least three chips, some with 12 plus cores.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:30.480]   Now, I don't know what a 12 core A14 would look like compared to say a 10 core Intel chip.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.120]   I think that's how you scale ARM though, right?
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.440]   I mean, when we've seen on servers, they scale cores and then they scale blades because it's
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:41.760]   a very different architecture than X86 and ARM 64.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.760]   Right.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.880]   So, is it even not even comparable?
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.040]   Can you can't even compare ARM?
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:53.320]   My only experience with ARM running desktop operating systems is Windows on ARM, which
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.000]   is not very fun.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.520]   No, Windows 10 X or 10 10.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.960]   I'm so confused about what an X means.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.520]   That's an X I think in Microsoft terms.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:09.920]   But even that, they've released HP, released the HP Envy X2, which was a horrible, unusable
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.920]   ARM.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:17.960]   The Surface Go, I think the Surface Go is ARM and I think the Surface X is ARM.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.320]   And or am I wrong on that?
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.520]   Maybe the Go is Intel and the Surface X is ARM.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.520]   Surface X is ARM.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.520]   It's ARM.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.640]   It's not great.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.080]   There's also compatibility issues.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.600]   Now I know Apple would do a better job.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.080]   They did with the Intel transition.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.640]   What kind of performance can we expect?
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.200]   Even with a 12 plus core ARM.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.120]   A laptop way better than Intel is giving us right now.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.800]   It's not performance so much as it's performance, what do they call performance efficiency,
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.920]   which is a fancy analyst term for how much performance you get for how much watt of power,
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:53.200]   which in our purposes means how hot does the damn thing get and how long can it sustain
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.120]   performance before it has to throttle down?
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.160]   Well, you know, all that's important.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:02.400]   But sluggish is not good even if it's low power.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:08.040]   And you know, I mean Windows on ARM is all, Microsoft says all day battery life.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.040]   Great.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.880]   But if it's sluggish, no day bad.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.920]   It's faster than a MacBook now.
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:13.920]   Yeah.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.600]   Well, unsynthetic benchmarks.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.600]   Yes.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.720]   The problem is iOS software doesn't run this isn't the same as Mac software.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.720]   It's not the same.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.360]   So we don't know.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:30.240]   I do think that this will help partition Apple's pro line versus its consumer line of Macs.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:36.360]   For years of consumers have been been given sort of conflicting information or can let's
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.240]   say conflicting indications of gee, I've got a thousand bucks.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.080]   I've got a 1200 bucks.
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:49.920]   Should I buy a mid range or low range MacBook or should I buy a top of the range iPad and
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.880]   toward that effect, there are a lot of new apps, there are a lot of new functions that
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:58.600]   are designed to be transparent between whether you're which platform you're using.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:05.560]   So I could easily see them deciding to switch to ARM for all the consumer oriented Macs,
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:10.160]   anything that doesn't have a pro on it because this is where you can get the most efficiencies.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.600]   It's not just about speed.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:16.160]   It really is about appropriateness as Rich said.
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:22.240]   This is a place where if you are buying a super, super slim, ultra book style MacBook or MacBook
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:27.840]   Air, you really do want the difference between getting eight to 10 hours of battery life and
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:33.080]   10 to 20 hours of battery life is the difference between absolutely positively for sure having
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:38.760]   to make sure you recharge it at the end of the night to you checked out of your hotel
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.600]   at 11 a.m.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:46.840]   So your flight your flight home is that eight, it got delayed in other four hours, but but
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:51.240]   and you unexpectedly had to be able to use your notebook for 20 hours and you just barely
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.240]   made it.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:57.200]   So I don't I don't know when I say I don't know if they will put ARM on the pro level
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.200]   machines.
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:03.840]   I'm saying literally I don't know because my every time I've talked to engineers about
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:11.720]   different chip structures, they've never introduced the ARM platform as an option to
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.800]   consider as an engineer for high performance computing.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:21.640]   It does scale up very nicely, but in terms of making a single desktop computer, it has
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:27.240]   limitations that they don't like, but unfortunately I didn't get a really, really clear explanation
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.440]   on the real technical details of why.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:34.200]   So I'm saying I don't understand my knowledge set right now does not include arm equals
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.600]   potentially the sort of stuff that would give you really, really someone who would spend
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.680]   two or $3,000 on a Mac would not expect the performance that I associate with arm processors
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.960]   to no matter how you configure them.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.600]   But it's all this is all speculation.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.520]   We don't know what Apple is creating under the hood.
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:57.440]   And the last part of this is that one of the reasons why arm on in arm on on Windows doesn't
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:04.000]   work as well as most people would like is that Microsoft has the ability to propose
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.800]   to encourage to urge.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:10.080]   They don't have the ability to say, number one, we are building and we are designing
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.520]   every component of this laptop.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:17.760]   We are making every hardware choice and architecture decision based on the fact that we are just
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.960]   we can speak an engineer and build anything that we want to go into this.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.840]   Also we are building not only we're not just building the operating system.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:29.960]   We are we have the ups on we have the absolute dictatorial ability to arm twist every single
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.440]   developer to doing exactly what we want to do.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.160]   Because if they if they want to be able to sell a Mac app, they're going to have to be
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.400]   able to sell it through the Mac App Store.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.440]   And if we want to say that by the way, you're going to have a you're going to have to have
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:49.200]   a bouncing flying toaster logo going through your entire app at all times, they can make
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.360]   that demand and make it stick.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:57.240]   So there's there's so much potential here on the Mac platform that isn't there on on
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.720]   Windows, even Linux.
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:02.400]   So it's very exciting.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:09.200]   So at some point is Intel out of the entire loop or are you saying that you think they'll
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.520]   be some high end like a Mac Pro or an iMac Pro will be until continue to be in.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:20.680]   If I were to put money, I would say that they would hang on to Intel for if for no other
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:27.280]   reason the fact that the fact that there are a Mac will last at least five or six years
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.360]   that that unfortunately they don't build crummy computers at Apple.
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:37.480]   And I've got a 20 I've got a 2012 Mac mini right here that's still working just fine.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.880]   I finally out of boredom, almost out of boredom.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.600]   I'm going to be upgrading it like later this year.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.040]   But then this Mac man this Tony 12 Mac mini will go elsewhere in the office and still
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.960]   do daily productive work.
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.840]   So they're going to have to support Intel for the linear future.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:18:00.920]   However, I do think if my if my understanding of what chip you use with what type of system
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:06.200]   is still current and it may not be like I said, I would assume that they're going to
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:10.640]   still go with Intel for the super high performance stuff.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:14.840]   If only because they're going to have to they're going to they're going to need a long a long
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:19.920]   period of convincing the people who are who buy computers based on the money they can
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.720]   make with them that you are not making a bad bet.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.920]   You're not going to have a situation where your Photoshop plugins do not work.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.200]   You're not going to have a situations where you're not going to be able to do this 8k
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.720]   this app that you need to do this 8k project.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:36.000]   They haven't built they haven't built an arm version of this product yet.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.840]   I feel as though we're going to see it's kind of it's going to be a situation where the
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:46.000]   user does not does not know what CPU they're running in the system.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.160]   They're going to make that as transparent as possible.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.800]   Nonetheless, if you anything has has a pro sticker at the end of it is almost certainly
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.200]   going to have it until CPU in it.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:00.120]   You got to imagine their their deal with Intel is such that they get profound advantages
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:03.480]   from sticking completely with Intel because I know everybody sort of says why wasn't
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.680]   the Mac Pro arm.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.600]   Sorry AMD why wasn't the Mac book pro AMD like Apple would switch off on a one to one basis
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.960]   based on product but they get early access to Intel silicon until makes things specifically
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.880]   changes the board designs for them.
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.600]   They work with them on things like power nap before the chips come out and Apple suffers
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.440]   because those chips are quite often delayed but still I don't think that they would enjoy
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.960]   the relationship with Intel they have if they started doing piecemeal and Apple just doesn't
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.480]   buy commodity parts period but if they started doing sort of a piecemeal thing I don't think
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.400]   that they would have the same sort of advantages.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:38.520]   So just the timeline for the last time Apple did this the power PC to Intel transition.
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.840]   They announced it at WWDC 2000.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.320]   Wasn't that a great announcement though like when he said it's been living a double life
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:50.680]   and then he zooms in on that building in Cupertino and he showed like that was like
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.000]   it's up there as one of Steve's best presentations.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:00.080]   They completed it by the end of 2007's so it took them a year and a half and they had
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.160]   no more power PC max period.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.280]   The software transition of course takes longer they had Rosetta for a long time they went
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:12.440]   to that carbon and cocoa they had a variety of platforms but they could do that now that's
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:18.640]   one of the reasons I'm sure that's one of the reasons for what is it called?
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:27.920]   Carmel, Carmel, Carn, Avocado what do they call the putting arm apps on a Macintosh.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.440]   I can't remember.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.440]   Catalyst.
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.800]   Catalyst I knew it was one of them.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.600]   It was Marzy Pan originally you got the fans in the van.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:42.120]   So I'm sure part of the reason for that is that's the same kind of application layer.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.680]   And so it's opposite.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.680]   It's the wrong direction.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.920]   Yes, it doesn't go both ways.
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:52.840]   Except if you think about it what they would like to do is have everybody develop arm software
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.960]   from now on just stop doing Intel software and if we could still run it on old machines
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.040]   okay that's fine.
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:02.720]   That's kind of what we'll play to a bigger part in that right because you just describe
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.280]   that like this is a button and it is red and doesn't matter if it's running on arm or
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:10.720]   Intel doesn't matter if it's running on an iPad or an iPhone an Apple TV or a Mac you
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:15.800]   have done like everyone gasped at WWDC when they did that but that declarative power when
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:19.520]   I think we started thinking about transitioning architectures and they're so smart that they've
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.560]   been doing and this might all fall apart but I'm going to say they are so smart and that
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.800]   they've been doing things like abstracting the silicon layer so you interface with metal
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:31.760]   and it dispatches it to the CPU the GPU or the accelerators on the T2 chip without you
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.960]   knowing about it which is why they don't work with Nvidia by the way but like they've done
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:39.200]   that and they've done the bit code where if they changed the processor they went to 64
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.440]   bit on the Apple watch and didn't have to tell anybody anything it just worked.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:47.920]   So that's a good point metal helps a lot with this transition because it abstracts
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:53.760]   the hardware layer yeah and then this is and this has been part of theology at Apple for
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:59.480]   I think now decades that was part of the sales pitch on OS 10 from the very beginning that
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:03.600]   it was built from the ground up to be processor independent so if they wanted to pivot at any
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:09.360]   point in the future they could do exactly that and the message from Apple consistently
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:14.960]   over the past five or ten years has not it's it has been so consistent it has not been
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.320]   please write for the hardware that we tell you to write it's always been here are the
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:26.440]   rules we are creating for creating Mac software we insist that you stick by these rules only
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:31.760]   to the considerable pain of a lot of top tier developers out there where look we the thing
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:36.720]   is this new since this new API that you've created doesn't work or does not suit our
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:42.320]   purposes in any way shape or form but we've got this old we're using your your old API
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:46.720]   that we've been tuning for 10 years and works perfectly and flawlessly and not only that
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:51.800]   but is the the linchpin of one of our users favorite features and now you're telling us
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:57.600]   to drop all of our tools stop supporting our actual users and devote nine to nine months
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:03.200]   to a year of development to totally retool our app from the ground up just to support
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:09.040]   what we think is a faulty API where you come from Apple but part but the they can't what
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:14.240]   they can't say is that we are trying to move to a world in which nothing that you write
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:19.800]   will ever depend on the presence or absence of any piece of hardware existing in any
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:27.040]   Mac so that the people oddly enough the kids that are 10 to 15 years old who maybe grew
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:32.120]   up coding Swift are in a much much better position to create a new word processor right
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.680]   now than the people who've been writing Mac software for 30 years not because they're
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:40.280]   necessarily more clever but because every scrap of code that they put into you know
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:46.480]   their their Pikachu text editor has been based on the very very latest API is just trusting
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.800]   Apple to use whatever they're throwing at them so they're the they're the people who
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.800]   will be able to click a checkbox or actually there probably won't be a check checkbox
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:58.200]   the next code it'll just automatically create an arm build of this thing they're the ones
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.880]   that will never the stability I don't know why these older people are complaining it was
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:06.680]   easiest by to create a version of my app for arm well that's one big difference between
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:12.160]   this power PC transition Intel Apple is much better poised Laurie do you think Apple dips
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:19.400]   in with just one device next year slowly moves yeah I do I think they will start small maybe
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:24.640]   with laptops only maybe with the lower end laptops only and then work their way up and
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:32.040]   I think it that has to do with fear from pros as to whether or not this is going to be as
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:38.920]   good as it needs to be so you start small you start with the consumer based Mac books
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:43.880]   like a Mac book air and if everybody's cool with that then you move on to something a
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:49.960]   little bit bigger so that the the people who need the pro machines aren't just just like
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.920]   oh no this is terrible I just bought this this computer and it's awful so it kind of
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:59.040]   gives them a concern yeah if they spent some ran on a Mac Pro yeah yeah yeah so I think
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:05.760]   they'll roll it out slowly lead already yeah yeah when it went so so give us a so sketch
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:11.440]   out a timeline Laurie what do you see next you know with with your the way you described
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:17.080]   when when Apple had had previously announced moving to Intel now I'm starting to wonder
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:23.040]   if it's not that that they will announce in 2021 that they're moving though the discussion
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:27.200]   that we're having now which is that you don't really have to tell anybody you can just do
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:36.440]   it so I'm gonna say 2021 around WDC around June so that by the fall those new Mac book
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.840]   year the first one you do if they're still making a Mac book you do in your 12 inch MacBook
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:46.480]   and yeah either a 12 inch MacBook or a new MacBook area actually if you did the Mac book
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:50.880]   because the Mac books always perform terribly so if you did if you did a Mac book and it
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.280]   actually performed better than the old one they see it expect hey the other thing that's
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:59.160]   super interesting is that back then you were super dependent on things like Adobe and Microsoft
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.720]   Office where there's like people just use Google Docs online you know people are using
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:06.080]   that on the iPad well the whole world and so that's actually the truth is the whole world
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:11.360]   is changing systems are relevant now because basically everything's in the cloud and everything's
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:16.000]   through a browser so what I wonder is if it's because last time they had these clunky developer
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.680]   machines but I wonder if they say for developers only we're not putting Mac OS on on iOS devices
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:27.000]   but for developers only download these special builds onto your iPad Pro or brand new whatever
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.720]   8k Apple TV and you can use that to simulate Mac on arm while we're getting all the new
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:37.240]   hardware ready yeah I think you can you magic keyboard I feel as though if they did that
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:44.160]   it would be under double secret NDA probation because the left because as soon as if anybody
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.840]   knows that they're that there is some piece of code that will allow them to write to run
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:54.720]   an actual Mac app on this on this iPad probably particularly the one that they just paid a
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:58.880]   thousand dollars or thirteen hundred dollars for there's good you know that there are going
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:05.000]   to be people in iMore at 9 to 5 Mac on XD on every every site that will say here is how
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.560]   to here is here is where to get the code here is how here is how to install it here's all
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:13.880]   this command line stuff you need to get it done and the last thing they want but it is
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:19.880]   but it is a great point that they think that we've been seeing this merging of the low end
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:26.400]   Mac stuff with the higher end or the productivity oriented iPad stuff for several years now I've
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:31.480]   complained to so much so that I've been complaining about it that you're not you're not you're
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:37.080]   clipping the Mac's wings so that it will it can fly in the in the under the envelope that
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:43.000]   is provided by iPad you're not laying the damn things or and it's an interesting idea
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.320]   to see now that they share CPUs one of the one of the one the little side note advantages
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:52.680]   of switching to Intel at the time was that hey I wonder if Apple will be able to actually
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:58.160]   run Windows apps natively and of course now there's a dual there's a dual boot mode now
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:02.760]   the I think the other side note will be what if you don't even have what if there is actually
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:08.520]   shared CPU between these two platforms would it be possible for me now to as opposed to
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:14.480]   having a Mac app and a iPhone app that communicate well with each other and have a consistent
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:19.440]   experience why don't I is it possible that I can run an app on my Mac that doesn't even
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:24.640]   know it's running on a laptop that runs Mac OS that is simply running the it's simply
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:30.080]   a different instance of this exact same app for some apps it would be it wouldn't be limiting
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:36.120]   so much like an Instagram app you don't really care a Facebook app you don't okay you should
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:41.520]   care because you care enough not to run any Facebook app ever but the idea that you can
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.880]   there's their apps that are low overhead enough and and that you can finally be able
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:51.320]   to run let's say TikTok as a as a map as a Mac app all the stuff we've been asking for
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:55.440]   gee it would be great to be able to post from my Mac what if it was just you don't have
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.520]   to even choice choose you can just simply run the exact same app you're running on mobile
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:04.480]   it is interesting to look at what at least what Mark Gurman says and again we're going
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:10.280]   to assume that he has good sources the first Mac processors will have eight high performance
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:15.080]   cores code named firestorm this is much like they do with the iPhone in the iPad right
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:20.040]   now and then for energy efficient codes as course known as ice storm because they're
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:24.800]   running cooler that's kind of what they do right now with iOS they have and this is
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:30.920]   the advantage of custom silicon you understand much better than any general chip manufacturer
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:37.840]   could understand what the needs will be so you can really balance it in some max apples
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:44.520]   designs will double or quadruple the number of cores that Intel provides the current entry
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:52.120]   level Mac book here is dual core I think this very interesting how much how much of an arm
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:57.400]   processor will it be and how much of a apple processor will it be they own well so they're
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:01.720]   like but they're they're architecture but they're architecture license yes so it has
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.760]   to be the instruction set or it wouldn't it wouldn't function like that's that's the
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.440]   whole thing so it's going to be apple design like they're not using an arm reference design
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:11.920]   which some companies you like they get the cortex A13 or or something and then they
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:16.560]   implement exactly the design of the processor that arm has created and they just make their
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:21.440]   version of it apple uses the instruction set so it's compatible with arm but the design
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:26.600]   is completely apples so it'll be a hundred percent arm in terms of how it works 100%
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:32.160]   apple in terms of the way like the complete design of the silicon from how wide it is to
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:37.840]   you know how much cash it has to how many see like all of that is apple arm is a risk
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:46.880]   processor reduced instruction set and it operates somewhat differently than Intel I'm not you
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:52.960]   know I used to be more up on on how things how things work is it is it big end in or
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.380]   little Indian or is it is I get in trouble for saying it's big little so to me like I
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:02.640]   enter because apples architecture since the A10 has been what they call fusion and that
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:06.720]   means they have performance cores and they have efficiency cores that's that's the efficiency
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:12.080]   cores will run normally yeah yeah the current ones are lightning and thunder and so thunder
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.680]   is the efficiency cores and there's four of those and then there's two high performance
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:20.280]   cores lightning but they use a lot more power they try to use those more conservatively so
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:24.680]   they're really performance dot efficiency not big little because they're not they're
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:27.840]   not it's not in terms of the bite size that they're operating on it's in terms of how
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:32.280]   much actual processing power they need and that's how apples doing and apples efficiency
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:36.360]   cores are more powerful than their old performance cores which always blows my mind and more
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:40.400]   efficient if the whole thing is nuts there's a certain advantage to doing it in house I
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:45.000]   mean big time advantage right Google's trying to do it again like Google and Samsung was
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.760]   doing exenos processes for a while and that's just recently collapsed but you know they're
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:53.240]   trying to keep some part of it going Google was Google was pillaging like Silicon Valley
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:57.600]   hiring everybody and for some reason the team fell apart and now they have a new team that
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.920]   might also be working with the Samsung team and it's very interesting but it shows you
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.000]   and Google does custom silicon for their servers for years they're really good at it
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   they just haven't done mobile silicon but it really shows you how much apple is getting
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.680]   out of that and how many other companies want to start getting and of course Keerin from
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.760]   Huawei has been going for years too.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:20.000]   Part of the reason it's hard to do exenosis because of licensing with Qualcomm and radios
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.560]   and all of that they never could use exenos in the US.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:27.040]   Apple doesn't care Samsung doesn't care Apple doesn't care Apple doesn't care that's the
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:31.400]   right and it's unforgiving like silicon is absolutely unforgiving when people when they're
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:35.320]   when they're a bugs in software you know like they can be fixed when there's bugs in hardware
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.720]   it's like hemming and when there's bugs in silicon as Intel it's learned painfully over
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.480]   the years that's that's it that's it for generations.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:46.880]   Yeah that's why I still think that it's going to start off with the lowest end Macs out there
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:52.120]   they're they're most people who spend X dollars at the bottom end of the other market the CPU
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:57.320]   on that device spends most of its time causing your cursor to flash while you consider the
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:02.680]   next keystroke so and they're not necessarily making money off of these as long as essentially
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:08.880]   a Chromebook that runs games and if you and some other nice nice Mac apps out there so
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:13.880]   there's there isn't a lot of skin in the game to making these people quote suffer unquote
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:18.980]   CPU wise or even reliability wise so long as you give them things that are really tangible
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:23.600]   features for them such as a really really wonderful seven hundred ninety nine dollar
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:29.280]   entry level MacBook or the ability to have an 18 hour battery instead of a hopefully
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.400]   10 to 12 hour battery.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:35.320]   Remember though that from Apple's point of view they can lead the way with software because
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:43.320]   there's they make I would guess the most popular programs to run on Mac OS between pages and
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:48.200]   numbers and final cut and I mean they don't they they still have to they're still a little
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:53.920]   beholden to Adobe so they'd have to convince Adobe to put out armed versions of their program
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.200]   they can't even get good Google versions of the iPad app so there's going to be a limit
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:01.400]   to what they can do but I think like if the demand is high enough they can shame some of
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:05.960]   the companies and Adobe's busy porting Photoshop I mean they've got some Photoshop on iPad already
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:11.680]   yeah what what if they said to Adobe look we're gonna this is crazy talk this is the
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:15.840]   exact opposite of what you all been saying what if they said our highest end machine is
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:22.320]   going to be on a new a 14 X processor and Adobe if you want to play you better get a
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.360]   version of that out running and of course all of Apple's I'm not sure somebody at Apple's
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:34.400]   working on that right now to make sure that final cut works on it logic what what if they
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:38.440]   did that what if they said hey pros we got a new way to go you think Laurie that that
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:45.480]   would offend the people who've bought Mac pros this year I don't know it's so different
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:52.640]   it's it is yeah so maybe they can say because power is not an issue with the desktop at
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:58.400]   all you can you your TV you could be as high as you want and it's quite high on the Zions
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:03.480]   hmm but are you really going to get thirty three thousand dollars out of somebody and
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:09.080]   say oh by the way this is a brand new architecture we were the first people to try it please tell
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:13.680]   us if it blows up but what what if you could say credibly it's faster it's better it's
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:16.960]   does everything better but there's gonna be a whole bunch of people it doesn't be a whole
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:21.040]   bunch of pros who are going to tell you flat out getting the last generation Intel Mac is
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:25.040]   such a better buy they getting the first generation arm Mac and they're gonna believe
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:30.080]   that for two like Alex Lindsay's are gonna sit back and okay you guys are you sure you
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:35.520]   tubers have they hate Intel at this point yeah but it's the devil they know and as opposed
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:38.600]   to the devil they have never met before and might you know be even worse but they're not
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:42.480]   quite sure yet and they're willing to let you play with that devil for a year so see how
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.960]   it really runs and then they'll make the move when they have to because they buy an enterprise
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:51.880]   scale and that's and that's a very very wise move for them and even I just as a regular
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:57.200]   consumer I'm not very keen on by every time that Apple switches to does a redesign of
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:03.160]   the Macbook when they when like when the case design particularly changes radically I don't
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:09.560]   want to be the first person to buy that platform I want to buy the rev the rev B mother board
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:14.520]   right we even want to buy the next version of that next year not be not be only because
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:20.480]   only because you are the the first that group is the last level of beta testing you don't
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:25.360]   know what the weaknesses of a certain designer gonna be until you get people using them by
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:30.520]   the hundreds of thousands on actual day to day business and people who are again taking
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:37.400]   yeah I got 30 if we forget exactly what thirty two thousand dollars can buy if you're if
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:41.760]   you wanted customer symbol something that runs Linux or Windows that is a bit and the
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:46.120]   people who have thirty two thousand dollars to buy they really don't have loyalty to anything
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:53.600]   except for the ability to get things done so I I think that it would be interesting if
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:58.920]   Apple were to as part of the pitch that they make to everybody saying that our first model
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:05.040]   is our first model is here's the road map for for for arm for AMD our first model of
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:09.840]   course is gonna be where where it benefits the consumer consumers best and those consumers
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:16.000]   are our casual consumers our consumer consumers but but here is like they will actually maybe
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.240]   even actually have it on the on the dais with just to prove to ourselves that this is scalable
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:27.080]   we've created the most powerful Mac in the that's ever been which is also the most more
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:32.640]   powerful than the most powerful desktop that's ever been created and they'll be the beautiful
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:37.200]   glamour shot of the thing that kind of looks kind of has like a crappy case on it because
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.400]   they want to indicate that this is not for sale but just to prove ourselves that this
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:45.800]   thing will actually work we made this on as it's the best Mac you can't possibly buy and
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:53.520]   then beat one two three yet they'll have to actually demonstrate that yes if you are if
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:58.200]   you are invested in the Mac this is not a good opportunity for you to finally switch to windows
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:03.280]   as some up starts in your in your community or up starts in your business have been saying
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.960]   because we are not going to trash our performance or our reputation on a new platform that has
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:13.200]   a really really hard ceiling on performance on it but they kind of like the lawyers said
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:17.520]   about the low end Mac first like if you get out the 12 inch MacBook or whatever replaces
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:21.200]   that and maybe it's got whiz bang features because it's got an a 14 and it does face
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:25.680]   ID now and a bunch of stuff like that bezel is designed it's really pretty but it's clearly
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:30.400]   not a pro machine the pros can sort of sit back and watch us like we're in a zoo and
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.720]   they're just like looking outside the cage throwing a couple peanuts and like we're
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:37.800]   tapping away on these things like okay they're not pro machines yet but I can see where you're
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:41.560]   going with this apple and then like a year two years three years the pro version comes
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:46.000]   out and they've all been boiled in the water and now they want that you know that the performance
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.840]   that they're seeing out of the machine they're begging for it at that point right like if
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:55.560]   apple does this well and markets it well we're going to hear a pro saying no fair where
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:01.280]   is my arm and then they'll be excited for it they've done this just it's some that maybe
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:06.320]   there's an analogy with the move to metal pros were using open GL apple never really
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:11.880]   supported it very well pros wanted open CL apple was pushing it and then said ask for
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:18.000]   it we're to do metal and that's very similar to this right saying looks just stop it with
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.720]   the open GL open CL I remember Alex and Apple Apple wasn't thrilled about it it certainly
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:29.280]   made it impossible to use Nvidia but at the same time if you could say look we've made
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:35.880]   this transition here's a better technology I would you know and remember also pros I'm
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:41.520]   not a pro so we'll ask Alex but I would guess pros don't mind buying another hundred thousand
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:45.120]   dollar system every few years because they're just going to charge it back to the customer
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:51.680]   they want the best fastest thing that's out there at any given time I doubt very many
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:57.320]   pros stayed with a trash can Mac for more than a year no they gave them down though those
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.800]   were there with the people the poor people in the render farms are dealing with those
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:07.600]   like I feel like everybody Intel has really earned a terrible reputation at this point
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:12.760]   well down in delays and they're being unable unable to get to the latest process nodes until
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:19.880]   now yeah it's just one thing after another nanometer chip yeah now I have to get quantum
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:24.160]   interesting at that point well that's right in fact that TSMCs is they're looking at a
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.600]   three nanometer process which is absolutely that's a marketing name it's not it's not
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:33.240]   it's not really a three nanometers yeah the X factor though is that on a lot of the
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:37.560]   performance you can get on Linux and Windows is because you have people who who have known
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:42.680]   how to program how to target these specific processors for a long long long long time
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:46.800]   and they're squeezing so much performance out of there that Intel frankly never baked
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:51.840]   in to begin with so there's I don't think that it's enough to trump the idea of having
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:59.520]   a true agile modern processor however there's gonna be a I have to assume that as is true
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:06.640]   in gaming that in certain high level high level apps high level pro apps that a lot of the
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:10.880]   performance is not necessarily because you're using a Intel processor that's based on a
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:16.400]   very very old architecture and a company that can't is so busy providing the CPUs to the
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:22.160]   entire world that they can't provide the best processor for your specific computer they've
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:26.400]   been they've been allowing developers to have far greater access to the mechanics of their
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:33.200]   CPUs than Apple or any any sane any sane creator would ever allow so we're gonna see
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:37.160]   some performance differences that come not from hardware but because of the skill of
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:42.840]   software developers and we're gonna we fortunately the Mac is a closed case it's a it's its own
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:46.960]   little ecosystem is there and developers are not used to being able to create those performance
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:51.400]   tweaks as they have on other platforms but it's there's a lot of variables that we're
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:56.960]   gonna be coordinating through so but my spreadsheet has gone eight layer and 3d at this point
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:00.120]   and trying to figure out how this will how this will change the terrain for the next
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:03.640]   five years you kind of made one point that I think is interesting there's not a lot of
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:09.960]   differentiation at this point if you're a pro between Linux Mac and Windows yeah so this
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:15.880]   would be a big differentiator this would this would be you would be saying look we're only
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:22.400]   Apple makes these chips the only way you can get this is Apple I think yeah I can convince
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:27.640]   people that there's the performance benefit and Jerry Hilden Rennes article on Android Central
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:31.960]   about the advantages of Apple's custom silicon and the iPhone SE just blew up all over last
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:35.800]   week and if you think about it there's no such article like that for max yeah and that
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:41.360]   for company that lives that thrives on differentiation to create better experiences that's a problem
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:44.760]   that needs to solve you can I mean look it's clear you could see Apple's reasoning for
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:49.520]   doing this that's crystal clear I really was surprised when they this announced the Intel
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:54.960]   move because I really liked power PC chips I really really liked them they did the right
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:43:01.960]   thing and it was a necessity yeah but this but this time you can really see a lot of
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:08.040]   strong reasons for Apple just to abandon Intel and differentiate the market and who cares
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:15.320]   about x86 anymore is there anybody who says oh x86 it's got to be x86 I don't think so
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:20.240]   I really don't I wonder if I say six fanboys yeah well there's always those fanboys but
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:24.160]   I really wonder if there's not an opportunity for Apple to say look we're going a different
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.760]   way and you should come along because it's going to be much better and nobody thinks
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:32.440]   Apple's gonna license x86 and make their own x86 chips right no just no way out there
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:39.120]   no why that that is a good even Intel didn't want to do x86 they try to abandon it for
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:44.840]   years yes and they couldn't and now AMD is doing chiplets that's why by the way yeah
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:50.000]   that's exactly why Intel want to get rid of yeah but just quickly that is a good observation
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:56.560]   we all we often think of the fact that that the Adobe Creative Suite is not only multi-platform
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:01.760]   you really can't if whatever skills that you learn on Mac you can easily transfer over
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:07.920]   to the Windows version of it everything most people's understanding of docs is through Google
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:11.360]   docs or something else that's multi-platform if they're office people they're working on
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:16.520]   Microsoft Office which also is easy to switch from one one to another if Apple can it does
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:21.840]   this really really well we've been talking so much about about the pros if but if if Apple
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:27.080]   even doesn't necessarily try to start competing with five or six hundred dollar Intel based
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:31.520]   Windows notebooks which are really really excellent machines or three or four hundred
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:36.520]   dollar Chromebooks if they simply say that we are competing with the bottom of the high
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:42.120]   end of Windows so but for nine hundred dollars we are going to be able to deliver the performance
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:46.040]   that you would normally have to get off of a thirteen hundred dollar fourteen hundred
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:52.600]   dollar fifteen hundred dollar i7 or i9 based based laptop that only lasts for five or six
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:57.880]   hours on battery and yet not only are you editing these videos in premiere just as fast
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:01.920]   as you are on that machine that costs twice as much but also you are getting a full day
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:07.440]   of battery life out of it we can we can is it's the world the world has turned upside
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:11.760]   down in just three or four months but not so maybe this maybe this is my attitude that
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:17.040]   am i actually foreseeing a future in which possibly Apple says that you should buy a
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:21.760]   Mac because it's cheaper it's cheaper than a Windows machine for the stuff that you want
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.280]   to do with it.
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.920]   It's just made me think that we don't care about battery life anymore because all of
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:30.480]   us are sitting at home everything's plugged in all that's going to even sell battery
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.480]   life anymore.
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:34.960]   I think we are all are so fixated on the idea that arms is going to give you this great
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:39.560]   battery life that we're thinking Mac book or Mac book here I'm thinking maybe they won't
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:43.200]   go that way or maybe they I mean obviously they will but maybe they will also say we
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:47.000]   could also make a very credible case for high end the high end.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   Well look at the iPhone SE like the iPhone SE has the exact same battery life as the
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.760]   iPhone 8 but with the processor that is immensely more powerful with much more powerful radios
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:00.680]   Wi-Fi all of those things same battery life and that's the other way you can go because
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:05.040]   again it's not just performance is performance efficiency so you can get more performance
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:09.280]   at the same efficiency level and then they could say well look the old Mac book you know
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:12.600]   these core I'm never not going to not call them core and Intel I don't care how many
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:17.240]   times you change the core and you look at these core and that was can't even do one
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:21.440]   stream of work a look at this one awful six streams of 4k.
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:25.240]   Yeah yeah yeah well that's why I'm saying you know it might be sensible for apple just
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:29.760]   to say go all in I don't know what this is going to be well they have to have to start
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:34.480]   they have to start small and they have to start with the impact because it's it's about
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:40.400]   appropriateness for what they can do what what can they accomplish right now just this
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:46.000]   I keep thinking about the about the conversations at NASA in the 60s I'm sorry for another twisted
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.920]   analogy but at NASA after they after they after Sputnik they were like what can we do
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:56.240]   right now okay yes the moon that's that's that's on the chalkboard for 10 years from
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:00.320]   up we can't do that right now what can we do right now well planning is for five years
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:05.120]   minimum but but but it's not just things are it's not completely under their control
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:09.920]   the the persons that they need to so that they can most easily sell to first are the
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:15.000]   people who do not know and do not care what's inside their machine all they care about is
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.840]   price and features and suitability for what they want to do this is something they could
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:24.380]   app that apple can absolutely explode out the door with whereas if they if their first
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:31.260]   offering is we're here's our $10,000 pro model here's our high end model you have everybody
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:36.700]   who is asking you okay but how many but how many cores okay but how many cores are dedicated
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:40.900]   to this okay well how many channels do you have for this address bus and do you have an
[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:45.260]   actual running demo of this app that I always always use you can easily get the people who
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:51.820]   are walking in with expecting to spend $1,300 who unexpectedly are walking out with 200 extra
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:56.020]   dollars in their pocket with machine that is as good as anything they ever asked for
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:48:00.900]   and more that's the thing and once you've got that base already in there once you've
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:06.900]   got the people who who whose needs are once again let's load up a web page let us load
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:11.860]   up Google Docs let us let us be able to use our games and our simple simple things things
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:16.420]   that don't really stress things a lot they collect a year or two's worth of data on here
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:21.660]   is what here's how the CPU behaves under actual conditions that we can't control and that
[00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:26.500]   we never wired up for back in the labs and that stuff informs the decisions that go into
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:32.180]   the $10,000 pro level max and that's when when you're making pitch developers in the
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:36.700]   rest of the world you're saying that this is a true proven architecture here we've got
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:43.700]   here is the stability feedback that we've gotten off of it off of 10 years of Intel and here's
[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:48.100]   the stability data that we've gotten back in real world experience off of two years of
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:54.460]   RAMD and as you can see if anything we've seen that our new architecture is even more reliable
[00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:58.620]   than what we've been getting on Intel so this will get people this will you it will
[00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:05.020]   help to establish the credibility of this really really really big leap with people
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:08.940]   that don't even understand or care that it's a big leap to begin with I think that's the
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:13.380]   concept you need a proof of concept before you do anything else what about software
[00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:18.940]   is there will be a software compatibility layer or Rosetta they'll have to be right
[00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:24.180]   I don't think they want to go there they don't even care I don't I don't I think they have
[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:29.500]   the ability to again inflict a change upon developers tell developers look we put a switch
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:34.980]   in Xcode it's your job to flip it see ya yeah I think I think that hey your text editor
[00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:40.460]   doesn't work with armed with with armed based max that's your problem however our arm based
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:45.780]   max are unstable and slow in certain apps that's our problem we'd rather you have problems
[00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:50.020]   that we have problems that's really interesting I think you're right I think that's a sense
[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:55.740]   it really it requires Apple to flex its muscle in the marketplace and and that's the question
[00:49:55.740 --> 00:50:00.060]   is does Apple have that kind of muscle let's take a break because I know you Lori Gill
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:04.900]   and you Renee Richie have an iPhone SE you both did your reviews I'd like to hear your
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:12.300]   thoughts I finally got my magic keyboard for the iPad Pro I know you've been playing with
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:18.140]   those we could talk about that there's lots more still to come Renee Richie from youtube.com/Renee
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:24.020]   Richie I want to say from something do you have a company name or I don't I don't again
[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:28.180]   it was just it was simpler it was easier it was expeditious this way from the autonomous
[00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:34.620]   Renee Richie yes I don't know okay Lori Gill from imore.com Andy Inaco from Boston Public
[00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:40.780]   Radio we're talking Mac and Apple and more of it's coming in a bit our show today brought
[00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:47.260]   to you as always literally brought to you by cash fly our content delivery network CDN
[00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:53.300]   cash fly has been a the best CDN in the business since 1999 we've been using it for you know
[00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:58.660]   14 years 13 years since the very earliest days of Twit and one of the things there are
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:02.540]   a number of things I like to get back cash fly first of all it's fast it's faster than
[00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:08.940]   any other form of delivery it's even faster than other CDNs so that's fantastic it's
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:15.740]   also affordable about 20% less than other CDNs and one of the reasons I like the cash fly
[00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:20.700]   model is because instead of billing you instead of having to worry have I exceeded my limits
[00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:25.580]   this month or whatever because my content's very spiky the podcast but I guess probably
[00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:31.260]   most content is we get a lot of downloads on a certain day or whatever with cash fly they
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:36.100]   work with you to spread your usage out throughout the year so you pay you know what you're going
[00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:39.940]   to pay every month and you don't ever have to worry about spikes taking you out of one
[00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:44.140]   tier into another tier it really makes it simple they've just added something I really
[00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:50.140]   like it takes a little harder for me to explain this but I want to talk about 100% cash shield
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:57.220]   you know that of course a CDN is cashing servers all over the world you also probably know if
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:03.140]   you're using a CDN that one of the things you really want to avoid is a cash miss because
[00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:08.820]   that means now the content that isn't in the cash has to be loaded from your site from
[00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:14.980]   your s3 bucket whatever you're storing that and that means expense to you so cash fly
[00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:20.060]   is introducing something they call 100% cash shield with this new feature you're going
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:26.300]   to benefit from a drastic reduction in data transfer fees with things like Amazon's s3
[00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:32.580]   by increasing your cash hit ratio to 100% it also means less buffering customers want
[00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:37.420]   their 4k content to be delivered instantly right they're not every second you buffer
[00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:44.500]   is audience lost whether it's a web page video games you just have to be faster these days
[00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:49.700]   and if your cash diners are being evicted for large one-off requests costing you a fortune
[00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:56.420]   in data transfer out fees that's no good with 100% cash shield and cash flies guaranteed
[00:52:56.420 --> 00:53:01.780]   availability you can avoid this it's a next generation content delivery solution for
[00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:07.340]   today and tomorrow it's a dedicated storage space on cash fly just for you so you keep
[00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:12.100]   your data and content closer to your customers without the traffic from other companies you
[00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:17.260]   don't have to download stuff from other companies you could buy as much space as you need your
[00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:22.420]   data will always be fetched from 100% cash shield rather than from your origin which
[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:29.300]   reduces your origin spend by in many cases thousands of months and guarantees no cash
[00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:35.560]   misses it'll also remarkably improve your download speeds no buffering guaranteed availability
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:40.300]   highest quality of service you can easily and reliably scale your video streaming to
[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:45.940]   reach global audiences of any size you get hyper fast download speeds low latency it's
[00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:50.340]   a great scalable solution for gaming that's why all these companies use cash fly is why
[00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:56.060]   we've used cash fly for so long if if you're a podcaster your podcast will be delivered
[00:53:56.060 --> 00:54:00.340]   quickly and reliably without delays without timeouts it's one of those things where I
[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:04.780]   don't know if customers notice it but it's just it's a it's a quality of life issue for
[00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:08.820]   our audience we don't want you to have to ever worry about oh it's taken forever to
[00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:12.860]   download the show we just want when you want the show it's there that's what we get with

[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:22.020]   no matter where your customers are cash flies global throughput performance dominance make
[00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:28.500]   sure any cash misses are delivered five times faster than from your origins they've got

[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:14.860]   more twit.cash fly.com iPhone SE it's really interesting to see start to see people really
[00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:21.060]   wowed by this phone it was a very big seller when it first came out the new SE is as fast
[00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:27.100]   as the current crop of iPhone 11 this is a really fast chip in an iPhone 8 4.7 inch
[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:32.940]   form factor it's hysterical to see Android police big Android blog say things like the
[00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:38.820]   iPhone SE is faster than enough topple line Android phones even better you've got black
[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:43.500]   lorry that's not silicon I love that that's that silicon yeah you've got white nobody
[00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:48.860]   product red huh I want red no mark has got the product red that's the one I want so
[00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:55.180]   Laurie what do you think is it what I think this phone this one is so much better than
[00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:59.820]   I expected it to be I think the last time when it was first announced and we were talking
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:04.260]   about it and I was making such a big deal about how it's not a 4 inch iPhone blah blah blah
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:10.820]   blah well let me eat my words a little bit because I end up liking this phone so much
[00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:18.460]   that I am I'm I put I switched my sim card over to it from my iPhone 11 pro meaning I'm
[00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:22.820]   trying to go full time with it I don't know how long that's gonna last but we're we're
[00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:29.740]   gonna see right now it's been you know since last Thursday I think or last Wednesday so
[00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:34.460]   it's been almost a full week that I've been using just the iPhone SE and I love it I there
[00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:40.100]   are some things that that I miss from it some little things that I miss about not having
[00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:46.100]   face ID that makes it just easier to just swipe up the gesture based stuff night mode
[00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:51.100]   I didn't I didn't miss it as much as I thought I would I realized I very really actually
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:57.980]   use night mode on the iPhone 11 so it's I don't miss it that much it's it would be nice to
[00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:04.620]   have it but what I have learned is that the computational processing of the iPhone SE taking
[00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:10.300]   photos at night it's really really good it's not as good as night mode of course but I went
[00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:16.340]   in my garage when it was really really dark it took these incredibly bright well lit pictures
[00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:22.540]   in the dark better than I remember the iPhone 8 ever being so there's a lot of good computational
[00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:26.700]   software going on in the background to make up for things that this iPhone doesn't do and
[00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:32.340]   the size and the weight and the thinness this wins me this is it it's the thinness and
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:37.900]   the lightness that just win me over big time to you agree with Flossy Carter it's the iPhone
[00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:50.420]   for peasants.
[00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:55.380]   People happy with the iPhone SE reviews because all across the line people finally had a little
[00:57:55.380 --> 00:58:00.740]   bit of consideration and empathy for mainstream users like usually it's like oh this 12 inch
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:05.300]   MacBook doesn't have as many ports as a pro it's not for me therefore it sucks but they
[00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:10.720]   were actually able to step out of themselves and say you know we're we're top gear we're
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:14.980]   racing Ferraris all day but when our family comes with us and says what car should we get
[00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:19.860]   we're not like oh you need the Bentley no no no the mistake we actually say no the camera
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:26.300]   is really good the Toyota's last forever and then there were a couple cranky people no
[00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:30.260]   names who were like oh look they're reviewing the new iPhone it's not the iPhone any of
[00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:36.420]   them would get but they're telling other people it's fine and it was just such a regressive
[00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:41.140]   attitude but this really like my family really does want this my mom is gonna wait for a
[00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:46.780]   plus version I think because she's she's gotten used to the plus sized iPhones now but my father
[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:51.700]   and again he's not he's not like dumb he was an IBM engineer for decades he was like where's
[00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:56.820]   the next home button iPhone I don't like these other iPhones and my all these people
[00:58:56.820 --> 00:59:01.580]   that I know they're just comfortable with this design they wanted this but better and
[00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:05.980]   Apple gave them this but better and most of the tech community was gracious enough to
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:10.180]   actually think about those people and what would be good for them and they're just a
[00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:13.980]   few last people I want to just take take my hand and lead them over and just say it's
[00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:19.620]   okay not every phone has to be for you there can be some for your family too and you know
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:31.420]   I think go ahead I think one of the reasons that it helps to have this the reason that
[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:37.540]   the iPhone got a lot of positive reviews is the price I think that really blew a lot
[00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:44.460]   of people away that the price of the iPhone SE originally back in 2016 was the same price
[00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:51.020]   as this iPhone SE is today but there's a lot more for that price you're talking but more
[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:56.860]   storage capacity the faster processor the better camera computation it's it's amazing
[00:59:56.860 --> 01:00:03.340]   that they packed in that much stuff at that price range I think that is a really positive
[01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:07.820]   thing that these reviewers who are who are always saying well you know I can't believe
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:11.420]   that iPhone would make a crappy phone like this for this much money well they can't say
[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:16.580]   that with this they're saying the exact opposite I can't believe they put this much technology
[01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:22.140]   in a phone for this price yeah no I agree I agree with everything that both of you folks
[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:26.380]   have been saying which has been very very positive so unfortunately it falls to me to
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:34.220]   be Mr. to be the John Lennon and say that I thought everything that you are you got you
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:38.300]   you guys been thinking that is great it's great that they didn't skimp on the places
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:42.340]   where you can't possibly skim not only that but they didn't give it give people a cut
[01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:48.100]   rate phone they gave them a fully modern phone let's just not forget however that they always
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:54.220]   if this is proof that they always had the ability to deliver a really great phone at this price
[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:59.260]   it wasn't really an engineering problem it was something they simply didn't want to do
[01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:03.740]   and I really feel as though it was because the markets sort of held their feet to the
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:09.260]   fire on this now that the market has been the market for really expensive phones has
[01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:14.660]   been fairly weak even when you create a really really great thousand dollar or twelve hundred
[01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:18.740]   dollar phone even nine hundred dollar phone that there's so much room to be made so much
[01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:23.300]   opportunity in the sub five hundred dollar market but the fact that Apple is not well
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:28.900]   is still not willing to do a okay fine will be will re will will rebad something old and
[01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:33.380]   will give you will give you a special color that you can't get on our modern phones know
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:38.940]   they get something really really good I also want to say now when I'm not gonna have much
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:43.140]   to say because I'm the only one who does I don't have an iPhone SE neither do I also
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:47.180]   you're not in the same same exactly but but you also not a present
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:57.940]   again we refer to be called riffraff the human and also Leo has the new like magic keyboard
[01:01:57.940 --> 01:02:04.180]   and I don't I just we have a solidarity of unmagic but I feel as though I need to bring
[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:09.420]   something like to the party so you guys don't have a 1973 cassette player that looks like
[01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:19.340]   our 2d 2 that's so cute Alex see so there had one that is so cool that's when I graduated
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:30.580]   from high school I probably wanted that bad I wonder if Apple's just like one of those
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:35.300]   special little cases where their their focus ends up being tunnel vision sometimes and it's
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:40.900]   really no more complicated than we we paid down the iPhone 5s now we're making the iPhone
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:45.980]   SE we paid down the iPhone 8 now we're making the iPhone SE 2 when we paid paid down the
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:51.220]   iPhone 2020 will make the iPhone SE 3 and they and maybe they don't shift like if the
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:55.020]   market says shift earlier shift earlier yes but we haven't paid it down it's like almost
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:58.940]   like Sheldon from Big Bang Theory yes we haven't paid it down yet no but it would be really
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:03.140]   great if you put it out of you but we haven't paid it down yet and it's just okay.
[01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:06.500]   Yeah it's just that simple.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:10.820]   To go with what Renee is saying and Andy this is me disagreeing with you just a little
[01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:17.060]   bit on the one hand I agree with you that you know Apple will hold off you know lowering
[01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:21.420]   the price of things as much as possible obviously but I don't think that the only reason they
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:25.860]   lowered the price is because of the market I think they have like what Renee is saying
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:30.420]   they have this phone chassis paid down they have so much of this phone paid down they
[01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:38.340]   can do this now it's it's because this particular casing this particular model is cheaper to make
[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:42.740]   they can't do that with an iPhone 10 or they can't do that with an iPhone 11 because that's
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:48.580]   still not paid down yet so you have to take into consideration things like just the backlog
[01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:54.700]   of stuff that they have on the line and in my own mind I think of it as when you put out
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:04:00.260]   your first 500 vinyl records it's going to cost you way more than it is to repress those
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:05.140]   vinyl albums because you already have the plates so the biggest cost is those plates
[01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:09.180]   that you have to have made but when you do the second run it's less expensive so it's
[01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:15.580]   the same kind of analogy here is that Apple isn't necessarily holding off though they
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:20.740]   probably are because they're a company but it but in this case I think market was right
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:24.700]   and timing was right and the ability to make it that cheap was there.
[01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:29.860]   Also Andy this is this is for you I have got my old block man tape.
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:37.020]   Oh wow this one is from 1980 something I don't know exactly what year but I can use
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:39.100]   it right to hand you must use it.
[01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:43.180]   I haven't actually use this in a long time.
[01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:48.260]   I just want to do a dance off to save the galaxy right now we're all we're all for the
[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:53.140]   end of all infrastructure at one point at one point we will all be able to just have
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:58.500]   to do see fine sea sized batteries and and and type two cassettes to get by.
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:02.460]   It also is the case that Apple knows there's a market for this didn't the original iPhone
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:07.140]   SE sell very very well I think it's no it's no it's everyone says it didn't every way
[01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:10.940]   there's this thing been going on for the last month where people are like oh the iPhone
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:15.820]   it sold bet like it outperformed Apple's demand forecasting because they thought people
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:19.580]   like cheap iPhones would buy it they didn't realize so many people like small iPhones
[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:23.740]   would buy it so they could not keep it in stock and there's also like oh Apple discontinued
[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:28.420]   it after a year they discontinued the very lowest and the smallest gigabyte version
[01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:32.740]   after a year they kept the other one going so like there's all this weird sort of misreporting
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:36.380]   going on but it is far as I know it was popular enough that Apple is keeping the SE going
[01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:42.820]   well and the more popular the iPhone 10 was the 10 are I think Apple knows people it's
[01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:48.620]   not just small people want less expensive they know that yeah yeah and there's also a
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:53.900]   massive market and a very profitable market because there's people like me who are not
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:06:01.700]   persons who's been ungrateful you really like about you try to put us down you you are
[01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:05.660]   the man don't mean that in a positive way really like about Apple's current strategy
[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:10.180]   though is that because they they are getting very aggressive about putting in new technologies
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:13.940]   which is amping up the price because Apple's unwilling to change their margin structure
[01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:16.980]   and there's a whole other conversation about their margin structure but they're putting
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:20.940]   more expensive parts in so the higher end stuff is getting more expensive especially
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:24.740]   with the edge to edge redesigns and then you all these things and their great products
[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:28.860]   they're great products but they've been putting in the lower end ones like the iPad pro was
[01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:34.420]   more expensive in 2018 but then they introduced the 329 the Apple watch series 5 more expensive
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:39.500]   than they introduced the 199 one iPhones were got more expensive and now 499 and I think
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:43.980]   that sort of averages like people and people don't feel like they're getting less than
[01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:47.980]   like I think the 10 R would have done better if it didn't feel like oh I couldn't afford
[01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:52.380]   a 10 S but with the 11 they flipped that and now the 11 pros those are for snooty pros
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:58.260]   those are for those people I have the 11 turns out there's more risk right and there is us
[01:06:58.260 --> 01:07:02.620]   I don't have an old iPhone 8 I have a new iPhone SE and that simple psychological change
[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:06.620]   seems to really make people feel better and then buy more you want you want your breath
[01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:14.140]   taken away price and iPad pro 12.9 inch with the Mac with the keyboard suddenly this thing
[01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:21.940]   not only weighs more than my max suddenly it costs cheap yes but it is very okay so you
[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:27.580]   don't have it Renee and Andy you don't have it Lori my company you got the Logitech or
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:32.940]   the bridge I have the magic keyboard I have I wrote a review of yesterday if anybody wants
[01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:41.900]   to check it out I I'm not gonna say I'm disappointed in it that's not the case I think I had very
[01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:50.260]   high expectations that Apple was gonna solve the problem of laptop not laptop but lap usage
[01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:55.820]   with the keyboard and on iPad and frankly they didn't solve it it to me I have the same issues
[01:07:55.820 --> 01:08:01.940]   with wobbliness and you know it tips a little bit if I'm not at the right angle I have to
[01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:08.140]   have my my knees at a 90 degree angle you're you're putting it there yeah yeah because that's
[01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:12.420]   what most people are gonna do like there's sure there's gonna be some people who are gonna
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:17.380]   sit there at their desktop the whole time but most people are gonna be sitting there watching
[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:23.420]   TV with their iPads on their lap and and that's that's you know what I what I'm trying to
[01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:27.460]   appeal to is the people who are like me who just want to sit there and kind of type away
[01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:32.820]   while they're doing you know just lounging around so you have the you have the 11 inch
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:38.340]   I do yeah correct yeah yeah and so you feel like well see I'm it you know my got mine an
[01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:43.820]   hour ago so I don't know do you mean do me a favor one of the things that you should do
[01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:50.380]   yeah sit on the couch and keep it on your lap and don't don't have your legs at a 90 degree
[01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:56.860]   angle and and see what happens it's a cross like this so yeah yeah yeah and it you it didn't
[01:08:56.860 --> 01:09:01.260]   solve for that problem so I was a little bit not and again it's not that I'm disappointed
[01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:08.500]   I I think it's great and I think they did successfully make as much compromise as possible
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:15.300]   that the way it's angled makes it a very good idea for for its ability to try to compromise
[01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:20.460]   with that with that balance and the you know the the fact that it's a little top heavy it's
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:28.740]   a very creative idea and a creative way to do it but for that price I it didn't solve
[01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:34.900]   that problem for me which means they overcomplicated it and still didn't fix it so that's where
[01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:39.980]   I'm at with I feel like if I'm gonna use that my lap I'm gonna take it off anyway I'm not
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:45.180]   gonna use it that way I'm gonna use it and be swiping and touching this is to me a laptop
[01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:49.900]   replacement more than anything it's a dog I think that's the thing that some people missed
[01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:52.980]   like there was a bunch of different reviews on it and some were like I don't get it it's
[01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:57.420]   heavier than the other keyboard case but when you watch that Craig Veneriki video he comes
[01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:02.580]   over slaps it down when he's finished he picks it up walks away with the tablet it it looked
[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:07.140]   very clearly intentionally like a dock more than like a carrying case to me that's that's
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:12.780]   a good point to just pop off it's really easy to pop off and just hold it in your lap like
[01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:17.900]   a tablet absolutely actually it is that's the best part about it yeah it is a dock in
[01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:23.620]   that sense it comes right off yeah and yeah it's very solidly attached to it I feel like
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:28.300]   if you're on a table Lori and maybe this oh yeah by the way I did seem to be the people
[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:32.620]   were using the 11 inch liked it less than the people who using the 12.9 inch so it might
[01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:37.220]   be it's better suited to a larger iPad I don't know yeah it could be because it might make
[01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:42.460]   because you know 11 inch an 11 inch laptop is too small it's just in general nobody makes
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:48.620]   the 11 inch laptop because they're small so I'm 0.9 inch pro give it to me now but I want
[01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:55.180]   to do I do I do have to say that once you have once you create this dock with an integrated
[01:10:55.180 --> 01:11:02.100]   keyboard you really are asking people to think of this as a laptop configuration so I don't
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:07.140]   I don't necessarily disagree but I think that a lot of people are going to be by I think
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:11.540]   that they at minimum should do some education on what people should expect about the stability
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:19.100]   of this configuration yeah I mean like I said on I said on the phone over on the desk it's
[01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:25.500]   pretty right right when I'm I use my laptop on my lap sitting on my lap I don't only use
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:31.100]   my laptop on a desk I I sit in front of the television on my catch with it and and so
[01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:35.340]   you know absolutely the stability there is there and it's it's fantastic when you're
[01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:44.740]   at a desk but again so are a hundred other keyboards that are half that price and that's
[01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:51.740]   what I was thinking of is that oh no I agree with you at that price I wanted this to be
[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:59.140]   a miracle I wanted it to make them to you know and it it wasn't so to me it's just as
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:04.300]   good as and frankly a little bit better than every other keyboard case out there because
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:12.420]   the magic keyboard keys oh my gosh it's a real it's a real it feels so good yeah but
[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:18.060]   for that price I think that it I I expected more from it that's where I where I'm at with
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:24.940]   it well and this relates back to the the iPhone SE conversation which is that Apple clearly
[01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:30.220]   is willing to say price is no object what's the best thing we can do and then understands
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:36.820]   that that's still prices definitely an object for most people so what can we do for a lower
[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:41.420]   price I wonder if they'll make a lower price you know once they I think they outsourced
[01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:45.700]   a Logitech for that that's probably what it is huh the third party they use Logitech
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:48.540]   and Belkin and a couple other people to sort of make the stuff that they don't have the
[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:53.540]   bandwidth to make at any given time but really would like for launch for me and again I just
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:59.260]   got it so I can't judge it but I think what's to me this is an inter a very interesting
[01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:04.140]   thing it's an interesting form factor to take an iPad and turn it into a laptop it's
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:10.460]   a cool look is a very interesting idea to me an idea that I want to explore a little
[01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:18.820]   bit more because it may be this is the laptop I actually want you know myself and some of
[01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:25.620]   my co-workers at iMore Brian Brian Wolf and Christine Chan and Joe Keller we have made
[01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:31.860]   a pact we are working exclusively on our iPads for one week straight and Brian is actually
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:35.020]   going to do it for a month straight because he's going to write the full article about
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:40.500]   it and give give our feedback on our the things we thought were great and the pain points
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:48.060]   that we had because when it when we start thinking about can you use a laptop or can
[01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:55.500]   you use an iPad as a laptop where we get stuck is what we're used to and if we could let
[01:13:55.500 --> 01:14:03.500]   go of the familiarity of a laptop maybe an iPad could be a laptop replacement and the
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:08.580]   one way to do that is to immerse yourself in that experience and not use anything else
[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:13.780]   so right now I'm on my iMac because I got permission for this week to be able to use
[01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:18.020]   my iMac just a podcast but everything else that I've been doing has been exclusively
[01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:23.180]   on the iPad and there are some definite pain points but what I'm realizing is that I'm
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:28.780]   quickly learning how to overcome those and compensate for the shortcomings of for example
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:32.820]   not being able to have multiple windows just kind of open and peppered all over my home
[01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:41.380]   screen so yeah I think the key though is you have to put the lock on your Mac to to see
[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:45.020]   whether or not this legitimately is something you could do because you're it's going to
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:50.100]   be hard you're going to say this sucks I don't want to do this there's so many things missing
[01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:55.420]   but once you get used to it I I wonder if maybe we we could change our minds on that the gestures
[01:14:55.420 --> 01:15:01.020]   are very natural I have like a concern yes Renee so my my concern is this like I don't
[01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:06.140]   ever want to force the iPad to be my laptop I want it to be an iPad and I think that excitement
[01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:11.060]   Steve Jobs had about introducing the iPad was so vital so important and I still remember
[01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:15.300]   the iPad to all of my high school teachers were there buying them people for whom traditional
[01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:21.180]   computers were always so alienating and unapproachable and I and for a long time Apple resisted making
[01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:27.140]   the iPad into more of a of a traditional computer but nerds are so loud we're so vicious we're
[01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:31.660]   on Twitter all the time where's our file system where's our this and I understand that because
[01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:37.100]   again we want every product to be for us and I I use the iPad I use it as an iPad I draw
[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:41.900]   on it all the time I write I do all these things on it but I use my Mac for very Mac-ity Mac
[01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:46.340]   things like multi-window things Final Cut Pro podcasting where I need to use things like
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:51.180]   Roga Miba software for routing audio and all sorts of new and wonderful ways I love
[01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:56.580]   I have a very West Wing feeling about this where I want to let the iPad be the iPad let
[01:15:56.580 --> 01:16:01.220]   it evolve to be more but I don't ever want it to be sort of constrained by what we think
[01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:06.780]   a Mac and what traditional computer users think should be their domain that's that's true
[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:13.140]   the only note I dad is that these are they've Apple is to be applauded for making really
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:17.040]   amazing three hundred twenty nine dollar iPads but they also make a thousand dollar
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:23.260]   iPads iPads that cost more than a mid-range Windows notebook on that basis it's not necessarily
[01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:27.020]   inappropriate for someone who spent that amount of money to say well why can't I use amounts
[01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:31.860]   with this boy I would or say I really really want to be I really really would love to have
[01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:37.620]   an iPad I'd love to have an iPad so much more than than a Windows notebook but the thing
[01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:41.580]   is this one that's what I need to be productive it doesn't let me be productive.
[01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:45.700]   No I think that's fairly fair I just think it's not like I would like a Mac it's not
[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:50.260]   the iPad is shinier and newer and damn it it should be a Mac like I think like there's
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:54.620]   a lot of you cases where I think it will one day be more profound than that and I like
[01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:57.940]   that Apple takes their time it's not like they're going we're gonna take the Mac mouse
[01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:02.940]   model and just superimpose it on the iPad which they didn't do the pointer system is
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:06.620]   completely different maybe it's better maybe it's worse but I like that they're investigating
[01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:11.900]   new way they're not just carrying over the baggage of the previous type of computer they're
[01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:17.060]   trying new things I just want to make sure that you know if you if you really do prefer
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:20.220]   a Mac it is okay to use a Mac.
[01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:25.820]   And Renee I think there's there's there's there's kind of the world has changed so there
[01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:31.420]   was a time where first of all nobody had a computer in their own home and when the people
[01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:35.460]   did get them in their own home that was crazy and then there was a time where everyone had
[01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:39.140]   a computer in their own home and they had to and they had three and then they had a couple
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:43.980]   of laptops so computers were everywhere and they were ubiquitous and then tablets came
[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:49.820]   out and now we're stuck in this thing which Renee and the one hand I agree with you were
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:54.980]   a bunch of nerds who say I want my computer but there are so many people in this world
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:18:02.020]   who never needed a computer they just fell for the marketing scheme and and I think what
[01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:07.540]   needs to happen now is that we need to start recognizing that most people don't need a
[01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:12.300]   computer they need something they can browse the internet with check their emails with
[01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:17.820]   the little simple things they do at home and then the other group of us the nerds we get
[01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:22.500]   our max we get our windows computers they don't there doesn't have to be it doesn't
[01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:27.460]   have to be both we can have two separate things we can have max and we can have iPads that
[01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:34.540]   are very close to the the abilities that a Mac can do but are also separate from that
[01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:39.340]   and I'm so glad to hear you say this because I agree with I've been on this campaign frankly
[01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:43.820]   especially on the radio show because people just go oh I need a Windows computer no you
[01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:49.340]   don't you probably don't even want a Mac you need an iPad or you need a Chromebook the
[01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:56.140]   all I mean I would without hesitation recommend this to anybody who says well I need a computer
[01:18:56.140 --> 01:19:00.700]   this I'm by this I'm holding up the 12.9 inch iMac and the keyboard the only problem
[01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:08.180]   is the price because the two of these together start at 1400 bucks and up and that's a little
[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:12.420]   hard to tell people that you know that's why they probably will end up getting a Chromebook
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:19.860]   instead but honestly I completely agree with you Lori the days when you had to buy a general
[01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:24.860]   purpose operating system are long gone and most people should not they just shouldn't
[01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:31.580]   yeah yeah and this is an excellent boy this is everything I can't think of anything I mean
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:36.380]   this is so much more than a Chromebook I mean it's not just a browser I've got all these
[01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:42.340]   great apps I could do my photography with this this is a really nice system it's just
[01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:46.420]   a very easy to say native performance it's incredible I just wish it weren't so pricey
[01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:52.100]   is the only although like again you can get the 329 is really good like I use it all the
[01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:56.220]   time for a ton of stuff and some of the keyboards for those are like they're they're not like
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:20:00.580]   this I'm sure they'll get better now the trackpad support is out but boy when a really good trackpad
[01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:04.060]   keyboard comes out for that three port that three twenty nine one that's gonna be a killer
[01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:09.780]   combo a mhm logitex can make that they're making one now for the air are they gonna make it
[01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:13.900]   for the less expensive because no I'm sure it'll be competitive you'll have to be Bluetooth
[01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:17.300]   because there's no smart keyboard connector and that's three twenty nine same with the
[01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:21.700]   air in the mini you don't have to keep kind of either so they're just doing Bluetooth
[01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:26.680]   yeah yeah all right yeah well that's that's that's a that's a great observation I've been
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:34.300]   using my my iPad mini has reached end of life it was the first model that had had touch
[01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:39.680]   ID and with the latest update it really is just too slow for even just like the web browsing
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:44.640]   in the casual use that I need like a really to really tiny computer for and right now
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:49.880]   I'm contemplating getting a 7.9 to fill that role it's bigger but it will be able to do
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:55.120]   much more than that thing will do and the fact that it now has trackpad support means
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:21:03.880]   that for 329 bucks I can have the what is for me a really important part of my my arsenal
[01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:08.480]   which is the machine that I need to have with me because I need to just do this one thing
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:12.960]   but it does involve real work for for 20 minutes but it's not worth taking an entire
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:18.320]   machine in with me and the fact that Apple has this kind of diversity across of its product
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:24.040]   line is just wonderful lately I have really been recommending the three twenty nine iPad
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:30.000]   I think that's a great choice and what is like about 150 bucks extras so now you're
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:36.160]   staying 500 bucks for what is easily a much better computer from 99% of the people in
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:45.960]   the world easily but they use software library yeah as we go ahead just just to clarify the
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:53.160]   Logitech combo touch which is the one that we've been talking about it is it is it does
[01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:58.000]   have a smart connector it uses smart connection and it is available for the iPad Air third
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:05.480]   generation and the iPad Pro touch 5.10.5 and for the seventh generation iPad so it does
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:09.840]   how would it work the three twenty nine I've had it's only a hundred and fifty dollars
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:13.920]   because there is no smart connector at all on that yeah so it's just it's it's probably
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:20.400]   smart connector for the iPad Pro 10.5 inch that's right yeah yeah yeah that's a little
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:24.760]   confusing Apple needs to fix that by the way maybe they can't do it for three twenty nine
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:29.600]   but I bet they could it'll it'll filter down like the next one will have one more
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:33.800]   P like it got the pencil then it got the keyboard like they'll just keep filtering those things
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:39.680]   down I think face ID is so great on this pro oh no the air does have this smart connector
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:43.880]   because it's it's the old pro it's the old generation smart connector it's not the current
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:48.320]   one it's the it's only it's the cheapest iPad that doesn't support it's the three twenty
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:53.480]   nine iPad yeah that's the one that has pencil now and then and now it's got the bigger screen
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:57.760]   and like all those things will keep adding to it and it has a fingerprint reader and
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:03.160]   I mean I honestly think that I stand by my recommendation it's hard a lot of people get
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:07.160]   mad at me when I say you'd be crazy to buy windows why are you buying well it's just
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:10.720]   the overhead like every time we all have this like the friend of your parents it's not your
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:14.360]   parents your parents you can handle but it's your parents neighbors who find out that they
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:18.240]   have their that your parent has someone in the family knows tech and they bought a PC
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:21.960]   and it's like it's riddled with viruses and it's like it's barely connecting to the internet
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:25.360]   they don't know what to do with it and it's just so much work and then you have the awkward
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:28.720]   discussion about how much tech support you can give your parents neighbors and it's just
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:32.120]   it's no good for anybody I've had it so much simpler well and I'm sitting I'm a sitting
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:37.720]   duck on the radio show I get all those calls I get your parents neighbors calls and yeah
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:43.880]   and it just I mean I don't I can't tell somebody you know I mean I had a lovely older woman
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:51.360]   call me who has a Windows 7 machine she called and said can you call Microsoft and tell them
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:57.640]   to keep Windows 7 around I can't afford to my machine I can't use Windows 10 and I can't
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:01.680]   afford a new machine and just during covid would it would could you just tell them to do
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:06.720]   that I said I wish I had that kind of cloud but I don't and even if I did I don't think
[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:13.000]   they would even consider it and I just feel bad for this woman who yeah probably you know
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:19.120]   bought a Windows machine that's 10 years old at least when everybody was buying Windows
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:22.120]   and that's what they had at work and that's what everybody uses and so that's what you
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:30.240]   get when you I'm buying a computer oh yeah means you get a Dell the most important consideration
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:35.680]   is to always abstract your decisions I think I think just in life in general not just one
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:39.520]   buying computer but particularly buying computer you don't think I need to buy a new iPhone
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:44.120]   or I need to buy a new Windows notebook you say I need a device that will do these following
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:48.040]   things for me and that's when you realize that in the five or ten years since you last
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:52.600]   bought an item of this kind there is something else that does that job much much better and
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:56.760]   it might even be a phone and I would say if I twenty years you start with what you want
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:01.740]   to do not with what you want exactly and and I thought I wouldn't agree with you'd be
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:05.920]   nuts to buy a Windows machine because some people they really do need something that
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:11.320]   can be very they really do need the Toyota Corolla they really do need something that
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:16.760]   is very very conventional that that a lot of what they do has been it's not so much
[01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:20.120]   eighty percent of what they need to do that can be handled by just about anything it's
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:25.120]   the ten to twenty percent that comes to oh well they sent me a PDF file that I now need
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:29.720]   to open and sign and then print out and then mail back to them or whatever which you can
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:40.080]   do it okay okay okay if you can do if you can do it electronically be if you can there
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:44.480]   are a lot of steps involved I chose a bad example but I'm saying is that there are
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:48.960]   a lot there's a reason why notebooks sell extremely well and number one reason is definitely
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:54.240]   enterprise purchasing but the number two reason is why it does it does everything that a
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:59.040]   lot of people need to do it has a common sort of set of functions and functionality that
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:02.080]   everyone's familiar with so that's the only thing I'm disagreeing with is that you be
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:07.160]   nuts to buy to buy a Windows notebook or notebook in general but I agree 100% that
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:10.840]   this is these are the conversations that I think we all have and so many times where
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:16.320]   I'm trying to sort of nudge somebody into getting an iPad or nudge somebody into saying
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:21.120]   that it sounds like since you spend almost all of your time on your phone I mean you
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:25.560]   even do your banking on your phone now as matter of fact you just told me that you get
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:29.600]   you find it so much easier to do your banking now that you don't have to sit in front of
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:34.200]   papers or in front of a screen you just do it like because you got alert on your phone
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:38.240]   and it got into doing 12 minutes of making sure that this gets paid here making sure
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:43.640]   that this goes into the into the retirement fund maybe you just need to get maybe she
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:48.200]   replaced your eight year old phone with one that doesn't annoy you quite so much.
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:52.840]   Yeah Andy I think my only you're exactly right it's when it comes down to is yes there
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:59.560]   are a certain group of people certain types of people who do need an actual desktop computer
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:03.840]   but then everybody else at this point just like you're saying they might even only need
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:07.640]   a phone they may not even need a tablet there's a lot of people out there who don't need the
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:12.120]   kind of technology that we have on our desk and by the way the people who know who need
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:17.000]   Windows know enough not to listen to me say don't buy Windows they know what they have
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.360]   thought they're assisting software right and they're they know I want to run auto cat
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:26.120]   okay fine or they want to play crisis or whatever the late you know they want to play
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:31.680]   a game that's those people look that's the responsibility you take I'm I need Windows
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:39.320]   fine you're your IT department period Windows is designed to be used I'm all up in this
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:44.480]   registry the oh yeah Windows has gotten much better but yeah that used to be I would open
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:48.200]   it by I would open a conversation by saying I'd be happy to help you I just and I don't
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:52.080]   want to prejudice your decision I just want you to extract information from my ground
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:56.040]   rules that I will I will guide you towards whatever you whatever the best machine is
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:28:00.080]   but if you wind up buying a Mac I will give you lifetime technical support if you buy
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:04.680]   Windows you get to play that card three times well get ready for some heresy because I
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:10.080]   also tell them don't buy a Mac well that while the Mac is better it's not enough better you
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:14.960]   don't need a general purpose operating system right I'm saying my mom my mom had computers
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:21.400]   our entire lives we had an Apple Apple 2+ when I was a kid we had DOS boxes Windows boxes
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:26.000]   she's had Macs I gave her an iMac a while ago the best computer she's ever used she's
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.840]   on it all the time is her iPad it just they she calls her computer and it's just the and
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:35.640]   again she's super smart she was a university lecturer by no means and married for years
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:40.480]   to an IBM engineer and it's the first computer that didn't make her feel like like dumb or
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:45.680]   weird using it it just let her do what you wanted and that's such an empowering feeling
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:51.320]   it does require and that's also something most people actually want they just feel they
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:56.240]   drink we all we all drink the Kool-Aid in terms of needing a desktop computer we don't
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:00.440]   need them most of us don't need them I'll just say you know if you like to edit batch
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:06.200]   files you should get a Windows machine actually we had we had I have a great caller who calls
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:13.920]   in from time to time who's former NASA engineers she writes Cobol software and she should have
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:17.840]   a window she should have whatever she wants you know whatever you want you should have
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:21.720]   I was she was saying should I install Linux on my Windows machine I said yeah absolutely
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:26.480]   you should if you're a mechanic like that's fine right it's just if you're a race car driver
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:30.200]   that's fine if you just need something to drive around the neighborhood right different
[01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:35.960]   place and it's a shame unfortunately you know people don't want to kind of spend a lot of
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:40.000]   energy thinking about this and those are exactly the people should be playing an iPad by the
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.920]   way but instead they're default is well everybody has Windows so you know that's the best buy
[01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:49.320]   the geek plot said this compact was on sale actually yeah and and the people who don't
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:54.680]   want to think a lot about it that's the last person who should buy Windows last patch Tuesday
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:30:03.360]   a week ago 113 flaws were fixed on Windows 113 on Windows 10 it's it's out of control
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:07.360]   it's not it's an operating system that's been around for so long it's just a mess now to
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:14.760]   be fair there is a zero day that's affecting iOS mail right now Apple says we've found
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:24.400]   yeah well yeah I mean this is a debate Zekops which is a company that protects high-end users
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:32.360]   maybe yes fortune 500 executives spies government officials they say that they've found a number
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:37.040]   of their customers who have been infiltrated with a zero day they believe is out in the
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:47.200]   wild involving Apple mail Apple responded saying we don't we don't think there's a problem
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:52.920]   out there we can't find anybody's been affected by this so there's a little to put it in so
[01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:56.640]   they said that so as far as I can remember and it was it's been a little while so I might
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:31:01.160]   have the details fuzzy he named several exploits and Apple looked into it because you know it's
[01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:05.400]   literally their job to look into the things and they found the errors in the code and they
[01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:10.120]   fixed the errors in the code but they didn't see how those could be exploited right and
[01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:13.440]   then I talked to a bunch of people you know all the people you normally talk to and I
[01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:17.280]   looked at what Will Saffick said and Patrick Wardell said and you know I just everybody
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:22.280]   in the industry and what it what it came down to for me is it looks like these were issues
[01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:26.680]   they weren't issues where anyone had a complete at least no one could and absence of evidence
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:31.320]   is not evidence of what that whole thing being understood this could be part of an exploit
[01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:35.400]   chain you would need the exploit chain to go with it there was no evidence of it being
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:42.560]   used as part of an exploit chain and it's fixed and some some companies have a more sensational
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:47.240]   way of disclosing vulnerabilities than others so I think he got a lot of attention for this
[01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:51.360]   which is probably what he wanted and Apple got to fix the bugs which is what I definitely
[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:56.560]   what I wanted so the argument is whether this was like in the wild seriously affecting people
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:01.040]   right now or who we've got we found this and it's fixed and I think it leans more towards
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:04.560]   the wolf we're glad we found this and it's well what the missing piece might be and
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:09.000]   Zeckop's even said the emails that were sent we are gone because whoever got into the phone
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:14.440]   immediately deleted them and that's standard operating procedure they they claimed that
[01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:18.720]   their customers who were victims were individuals from a fortune 500 organization in North America
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:24.800]   an executive from a telephone carrier in Japan spearfishing right a journalist yeah I would
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:31.160]   guess it's purely guess we'll have to ask Steve Gibson but these are nation state actors
[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:36.540]   targeting specific people and there is a missing piece to the exploit chain that Apple doesn't
[01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:41.200]   know about that because they've said there are a number of vulnerabilities and that's
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:44.600]   how it usually works is they use it well he also said he wouldn't give them everything
[01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:49.280]   which is like understandable but also less than optimal and he may not have had everything
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:55.240]   also I don't know so Apple said we conclude these issues do not pose an immediate risk
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:33:00.560]   to our users however we are going to patch there are three issues in in in mail but they
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:07.360]   were insufficient to to get to control the iPhone or the iPad and we have found no evidence
[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:12.120]   they were used against customers that no evidence doesn't mean it wasn't I believe
[01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:18.280]   the Zecops probably isn't making this up they were real vulnerabilities weird reputation
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:23.240]   that's only thing is that if it was if it was like Google and even Google's like zero
[01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:26.800]   what is it day zero zero day zero day they push back a little bit on it too I forget
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:30.920]   which one of them but if it was them you know I believe it 100% because they are just yeah
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:35.160]   they're just methodical about it he's been a little bit more I don't know what the right
[01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:42.000]   word is for it but I just like you're gonna have to prove it was okay good and and yes
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:48.600]   but fix it of course yes it's gonna be fixed those three will be fixed and and this is
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:56.160]   often the case I have to say it doesn't mean you're gonna be attacked nation states have
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:34:02.760]   vast resources and very talented hackers and collect these zero days often paying millions
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:07.920]   of dollars for them specifically to use against targeted individuals they're not being used
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:13.360]   by hackers and mass attacks so unless you're working for a three letter agency in McLean
[01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:18.880]   Virginia or you know you're a you know executive of a big company I wouldn't worry about it
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:23.040]   too much and if you are you probably have security working for you to protect you anyway
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:29.600]   I hope you do there is one thing that might affect you I think it I think it hit me Friday
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:36.040]   night all of a sudden my phone froze up and then rebooted I didn't see any messages with
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:41.000]   the Italian flag in it but this is this is not I don't know if this is the same bug that
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:45.560]   hit before I remember there was a you could carefully craft a message that would crash
[01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:49.720]   it's not just one bug that there's there are constant errors in Unicode parsing across
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:54.120]   a myriad of system for some reason the Unicode system was built the Unicode parsing system
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:58.840]   was built in such a way that if you ever find anything that it is not prepared for it just
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:03.200]   falls down in cries yeah it's happened over and over and over again has multiple times
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:08.080]   said it's hard to interpreters are hard and that's what it is this parsing system is
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:14.280]   an interpreter and you can't you you're supposed to sanitize your inputs and make sure you don't
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:19.240]   misinterpret what you receive yeah it's a challenging thing to do this bug which includes
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:24.920]   an Italian flag emoji and characters in the Cindy language affects iPhones iPads, Macs,
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:31.880]   even Apple watches when you get a notification with that text in it your device and this
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:35.800]   is exactly what happened sometimes will crash other times it completely stops responding
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:43.240]   to touch input I had both so I had a weird issue where tweet tweet bot on Mac would just
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:46.920]   crash on launch and eventually it would just crash everything online try to reboot so
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:50.600]   I stopped using it and like today it's fine again but for three days I couldn't use it
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:56.520]   and Twitter on Twitter.com when I went to Twitter.com to try to use Twitter on the Mac
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:36:00.840]   I got Andy's last mention to me and then nothing else for two days so it goes happy because
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:05.400]   Andy was top of Twitter for me for like two days which is great but I had to use tweet
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:08.560]   bot on my iPhone and I was the only way I could use Twitter for two days.
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:15.640]   So the way this works it's they're all using Apple's renderer which is on all these platforms
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:19.520]   but it could be in other messaging apps it could be on Twitter it doesn't have to be
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:23.720]   through an Apple product everybody uses the renderer built in the Apple the unicorn renderer
[01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:29.160]   and this is not the first time so it's just a hard it's a hard problem and which is not
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:32.640]   to let Apple off the hook but these things happen from time to time.
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:37.240]   The really thing that's kind of amazing I wonder what kind of brute force process people
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:41.480]   were using to try to find these Unicode strings they're not doing it by hand I can't imagine
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:42.480]   they're doing it by hand.
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:45.200]   It's been Cyrillic it's been all it's been an array because it's been all sorts of different
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:46.200]   characters.
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:49.920]   It's almost always those non-Western character set it's something it's something using the
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:53.560]   high end of the Unicode space probably.
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:37:00.280]   By the way the latest you can leave out the Italian flag it's the Cindy characters here
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:06.760]   if you want to see it this is a tweet from everything Apple Pro of the crash can't play
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:09.360]   it on my Linux box so never mind.
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.920]   It's protecting Julio.
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:16.920]   It is I don't want you to experience it.
[01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:23.480]   So I now when I you don't see that message now and that's why Tweetbot works.
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:27.200]   Maybe Twitter went through their database and deleted all occurrences of it.
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:31.720]   I never saw a message like that on my phone so maybe it's just a coincidence.
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:33.360]   I don't know.
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:35.520]   I don't know.
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:41.800]   Anyway just I bring that up just to just to show I'm not biased against Windows all
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:43.920]   all computers break.
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:44.920]   They're all terrible.
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:45.920]   They're all terrible.
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:46.920]   They need to get better.
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:49.080]   Five years baby.
[01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:52.080]   It's been five years.
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:57.160]   We've had the Apple Watch gosh it seems longer.
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:03.880]   Seems like it does seem like we've had it around for it's so part of our lives now that
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:06.680]   it seems like yeah it's always been there.
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:11.960]   Yeah it's such a big deal that 20 or 30 years from now if there are movies that are set
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:16.400]   in this period the set designer and the cost designer is going to say okay about 20% of
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:18.800]   these people need to be wearing Apple watches.
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:19.800]   Yeah.
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:23.240]   It's a weird little can you find those weird little external communicators.
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:26.040]   Remember when they had external communicators they weren't built into our ears.
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:28.640]   Oh yeah yeah can you find some of those?
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:29.640]   Little stems.
[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:31.360]   Got to have stems.
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:38.560]   Think about what the Apple Watch was marketed to us as and what we thought of it as five
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:39.560]   years ago.
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:46.520]   It was this sort of like it was a way to put down your iPhone but still stay connected.
[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:48.000]   It was all about notifications.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.000]   It was a side card.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000]   It was a side card.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000]   It was a side card.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000]   It was your.
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.000]   Remember how heartbeats and set and so I was rewatching I rewatch the entire event like
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:01.520]   they're both the September pre-introduction and the March it's time to go one and they
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:05.960]   spent so much time showing like the heartbeats and the little sketches that disappear into
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:09.760]   a theory of things that you don't even exist anymore.
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:15.400]   There's so many that that is such a textbook presentation that I don't think there's ever
[01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:21.960]   been a piece of technology that was launched so badly but recovered so dramatically.
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:25.480]   You're also overlooking two things.
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:31.240]   The demo of and I got a text message from my kid saying they can't get into the garage
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:36.200]   and here I am watching opening the garage via my watch while watching live video of the
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:37.200]   garage door opening.
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:39.160]   I say wow thank you.
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:43.680]   You have definitely solved the problem that I really really have because I wish I could
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:51.840]   watch the garage door opening on my watch and that but it also included the single stupidest
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:56.640]   product Apple has ever made or I hope ever will make I would actually nominate it as
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:00.320]   the stupidest tech product ever made by a large manufacturer.
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:01.320]   Wait a minute.
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:02.320]   Let me think.
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:03.320]   What could this be?
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:04.320]   Don't say.
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:05.320]   Oh I don't have it.
[01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:06.320]   I don't have it.
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:07.560]   And this is my dog had three because four of them would be ungracious.
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:10.640]   It's an exercise in a riddle for us all.
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:11.640]   Alrighty.
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:14.720]   The twelve thousand dollar solid gold.
[01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:15.920]   Oh there you go.
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:16.920]   There you go.
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:18.840]   Okay I'll give that to you.
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:19.840]   Yeah.
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:22.320]   Apple hasn't lost touch with the consumer with that product.
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:23.320]   Was it was it?
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:25.080]   I think it was even more than that wasn't it?
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:27.160]   It was 18 carat gold and it started at that.
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:28.160]   It went up.
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:29.160]   That was the cheap one.
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:31.480]   That was the one with the factory radio and no air conditioning.
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:33.480]   It was solid gold.
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:38.560]   And remember that Apple like created a whole new section of the store with security as
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:41.080]   a concierge service for it.
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:42.720]   And the box was great.
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:44.240]   I'm not complaining about the box.
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:48.160]   If you offered me a box I would probably pay okay money for it because it was a lovely
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:49.160]   box.
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:50.440]   Oh you want to band with that?
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:52.560]   That'll be seven thousand extra.
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:53.560]   Yeah.
[01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:59.320]   It's like you know what though they're their today version of this of the luxury version
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:02.240]   of the Apple Watch the ceramic.
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:03.240]   I buy that.
[01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:04.240]   It is really good.
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:05.720]   I have the titanium.
[01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:06.720]   I bought the titanium.
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:07.720]   Me too.
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:11.120]   I don't know why because honestly I'm going to get another one the minute the new one comes
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:12.600]   out so it's silly.
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:14.160]   Every year I say I'm buying the Nike.
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:15.680]   The Nike is the absolute best value.
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:17.960]   And they're like oh have you seen titanium?
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:20.280]   I know it's going to be like tungsten.
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:22.720]   It weighs 13 pounds but it's the same size.
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:24.760]   It's tungsten and I'll be like yes.
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:25.760]   Arm curls.
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:26.760]   It'll be great.
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:27.760]   The ceramic is beautiful.
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:29.760]   Laurie you're absolutely right.
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:30.760]   It's gorgeous.
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:31.760]   It's so pretty.
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:36.480]   And I think that the Apple Watch edition as a concept was a good idea because it is
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:38.360]   a $12,000 one.
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:44.000]   And especially that there's nothing there's nothing about this design that demands it be
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.280]   made out of gold.
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:46.280]   There's nothing of it.
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:50.760]   It was just hey I know it's not as simple as oh well we used to we were pouring aluminum
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:51.760]   into this mold.
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:53.720]   We decided just for giggles will support some guy.
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:55.480]   I know it's a lot more complicated than that.
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:58.280]   I think they actually made a big deal of it's not just gold.
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:41:59.280]   It's arm.
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:04.080]   We sampled a million different versions of gold to choose this version of gold and it's
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:05.080]   like.
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:09.520]   Really this is really what you're really what you're spending your time on.
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:13.880]   You're actually saw the gold one with their own eyes.
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:14.880]   Not me.
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:20.280]   And I did you and I called while wearing two of them on her wrist at the same time surrounded
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:21.280]   by Apple people.
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:24.440]   No she had to stop both of them on at the table.
[01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:25.440]   That was our strategy.
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:27.400]   Do we know anybody who's one?
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:29.320]   No I do.
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:31.840]   You do you do I do.
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:34.680]   You seem embarrassed that you know someone.
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:39.160]   So you have to understand so like at launch day and a total story before Jim Dowel and
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:43.520]   I went to the Palo Alto Apple store and it was like a bonanza like you expect.
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:46.760]   But then afterwards we went to the coffee shop and we were sitting there and there were
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:49.840]   these these Silicon Valley nerds going.
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:52.640]   Oh which of the Apple Watch Gold watches are you going to get?
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:56.080]   Oh I think I'm going to get this one and I just it's that same conversation at the beginning
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:59.800]   of the show where certain people have enough zeros in their bank accounts that none of
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:04.000]   this like they buy twenty five thousand dollar plane seats you know they buy seventeen thousand
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.920]   dollar dresses they wear once they stay in minimum six dollar it's a different world
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:10.960]   and I'm sure they enjoyed them for the year they had them and I'm sure they're just as
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:12.520]   happy with their Nike version now.
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:16.160]   I'm going to guess that ninety percent of the people who had them were given them by
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:18.840]   Apple like Beyonce and others to wear them.
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:21.680]   I think they were emerald sales I think I heard that there are large portion of them
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:24.400]   were in places like the Abu Dhabi and the Dubai Apple stores.
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:30.040]   Yeah I mean I make if you're if you're a multi multi billionaire you know at eighteen
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:33.480]   thousand dollar watch it's like a five dollar watch for you and me it's nothing.
[01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:35.880]   That's not a good look for Apple is it?
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:36.880]   Oh it's terrible.
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:37.880]   Yeah.
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:44.280]   But also we should overlook that at that at that at that media event there were so many
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:48.560]   high ranking people from the fashion world there and I'm not talking about Instagram influencers
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:53.120]   I'm talking about like I think Anna Wintour was there like leading leaders of like so
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:54.120]   many different designs.
[01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:58.360]   It was on the cover of Vogue for crying out loud.
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:02.320]   So and when we were standing the PR was so different too because I've been to several
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:05.840]   Apple events now but there was a bunch of people dressed like you would see dressed
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:10.000]   on reality shows like just completely like things coming out of everywhere going oh
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:14.200]   this feels like a fashion event doesn't it feels like a fashion event.
[01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:18.680]   Was that a bad idea was a really a bad idea maybe it was a good idea maybe they were really
[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:20.720]   got a lot of attention because of it.
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:25.920]   No that was that was definitely a good idea because their whole idea was to they they put
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:30.840]   so much into making this not look like a gadget watch if there is one imperative of this
[01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:36.920]   launch it was to not hey it's got nixie tubes on it's the size of a can of tuna but look
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:38.600]   at that it's got a fly on it.
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:41.600]   I mean if they have to say they have to make the quote that we know how to design something
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:45.160]   that people are going to want to put on their wrists because this is not going to be just
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:49.720]   a gadget that they use for productivity this is going to be part of the style statement
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:54.200]   that they make just like I apparently made a style statement by putting on a sweater vest
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:58.320]   over a t-shirt today you know it's but that's they really did have to make that statement
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:03.360]   and they put this is this is why it was one of the worst launches from the point of view
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:09.160]   of I think was very clear that apple didn't know who was going to buy this they also didn't
[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:13.320]   have a lot of it really really working I think at that time so we really put them on their
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:18.360]   on their back foot there but they they knew that if we get the hardware right you can
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:23.920]   always put new electrons in there we can't get we can't just push out an update to the
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:28.680]   style of this thing and they got the style so right that no one is complaining that oh
[01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:33.480]   gosh it's so boring it's five years and we haven't seen a new case design like no you
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:39.200]   let us have really really cool different straps we let us up you let us upgrade the from let
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:43.120]   me upgrade from the from the aluminum one that I can afford five years ago to the stainless
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:49.200]   steel one I can afford now we're good just just give me just give me custom watch faces
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:55.360]   and then we'll be perfect I want the next iPhone to be platform agnostic I think that
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:46:01.280]   right now it's become a literal lifesaver the apple the only thing that they should do
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:06.760]   next is make it so that anybody can have their life saved with an apple watch I think that's
[01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:10.600]   that's the next step that they should do that's never gonna happen I feel like I know same
[01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:15.160]   reason we're not gonna see I messages on Android apple doesn't even know and I think there's
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:19.440]   a way so I think there's a way because the iPhone went the iPhone originally was tethered
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:24.200]   to iTunes and then it went free with iCloud and the iPhone had capabilities beyond an
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:28.200]   apple watch like I think they've been slowly adding things to it like they added LTE and
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:32.480]   they've added an onboard app store what I think I think apple can have some of their
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:36.800]   cake and eat it to if they remove the last tether like you no longer have to have an
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:42.680]   iPhone you can just buy an apple watch but oh if you if you have an iPhone wow is it
[01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:47.760]   easier to manage all these things because we're not making apps for Android like no you have
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:52.040]   an apple watch and it'll do it'll it'll sink the way any Android watch things but if you
[01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:56.720]   want like our Apple watch app and our activities app and all these things that show you your
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:01.560]   like it's no extra features but as you get to see your trophies and big phone print they
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:06.160]   would even have to mention my server apple they would even have to mention no no no no
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:11.280]   no joke I was I was wearing I'm an android phone user but but I was wearing an apple
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:16.160]   watch daily for a long long time when I stopped wearing it it wasn't because of incompatibilities
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:21.400]   with Android it was just that I fell out of that I became more of a fan of the I pick
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:25.000]   up this watch for the everyday for the next five years without ever having to recharge
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:29.400]   it that was the that was the only thing about it if app if apple made the apple watch which
[01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:33.960]   is now can connect to the internet all by itself with by Wi-Fi it can and now has its
[01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:39.880]   own version of the app store if all it all it all came with was the basic app that you
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:43.640]   would get with an android where watch is simply say here's how to put it here's how
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:49.520]   to establish on your Wi-Fi network and here's a to do list or whatever they would absolutely
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:57.040]   run the table yeah on on Android because I I did buy last week a fossil android where
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:02.440]   watch and that's the only reason why I got it was because they're they're clearing out
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:08.560]   the the generation for model now that there's a generation five I got the $275 watch it got
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:12.520]   for like a hundred hundred bucks hundred ten bucks for that amount of money okay I will
[01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:16.880]   buy an android where watch that lets me do Google pay and has GPS great and mostly buying
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:25.560]   it as a fitness watch if you if you were to I would have 100% paid $300 for a new apple
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:30.280]   watch instead of that if I could have gotten the same sort of community communication this
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:35.880]   basic fitness watch level I'm talking again talking about $100 fitness watch communication
[01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:42.760]   with a phone if that were possible there is no chance I would have even been aware of
[01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:47.000]   what's going on in WearOS and you're talking to you're talking to a fan of Android here
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:52.480]   it's just it's not competing with anything that costs more than a hundred and fifty dollars
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:57.880]   out there it just isn't so apple would just run the table if they made this thing compatible
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:06.800]   yeah yeah and actually you just made me think of something apple pay compatibility on apple
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:13.280]   watch so for people who don't you know like like so you who doesn't have apple pay set
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:18.320]   up on a phone can use apple pay because that you know apple makes money off of that they
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:23.520]   want people to be using apple pay so if they could somehow make it so you could set up
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:28.720]   apple pay just on your apple watch and use your bank card to make purchases but you're
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:32.440]   doing it on your apple watch I think that would be a big deal to you to be able to add
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:38.480]   that if they can figure it by the web that would be good enough I think also what also
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:45.080]   bumps me out is that I've got I have iPads I've got multiple iPads like but but you're
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:49.040]   running iOS on both of these devices you're saying that I don't get to be part of the
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:54.400]   club even though I have an iPad come on please here's the stack of them I've got five iPads
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:50:00.160]   here let me set it up with an iPad and they'll never connect to whatever again I just what
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:04.800]   was so when the iPad apple watch first came out it was I was skeptical it didn't really
[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:08.960]   seem like it made a lot of sense it seemed like an expensive accessory for your early
[01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:12.320]   like everything else they waited a day like they waited a decade of power PC they waited
[01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:16.160]   a decade of smartphones they looked at every problem that existed and they figured like
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:20.280]   we hate our phones how can we make a good one we hate these tablets how like I can't
[01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:23.760]   believe that my wife's stupid friend at Microsoft things I can make a better tablet than me
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:28.440]   like it was like real motivators there with the apple watch there was pebble and very
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:32.640]   little else at the time and so apple found itself in an unusual position where they were
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:36.880]   making a lot of the mistakes in public and figuring out the problems as they went and
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:40.960]   I'm I was sort of excited to do that with them but when you look at like two three four
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:45.320]   years later that's like that's when apple would have released the phone or the tablet
[01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:49.680]   and it had sort of that level of polish by the time you get to series three series four
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:52.280]   one of the things somebody in the chatroom said all right give me three reasons why I
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:57.200]   should buy an apple watch and one of the reasons it's hard to do that is it seems to
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:03.200]   have a different reason for every user has a different reason for wearing it right there's
[01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:07.560]   different purposes for it it's that great Andy and not cometaphor where it's like it's
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:11.320]   the dollars worth of this and a dollars worth of that and start at the end of the day like
[01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:17.640]   it's worth it to you I would I would argue that there is one single feature that I that
[01:51:17.640 --> 01:51:21.960]   I would like some people to switch over from android for it's that big of a deal which
[01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:30.360]   is fall detection and ECG monitoring I think apple does this amazing job of this and I've
[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:37.000]   read so many articles of people who young athletes that they didn't even feel like there
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:40.200]   was anything wrong with them but their apple watch is suddenly telling them we're noticing
[01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:43.680]   that there's something weird about your heart maybe you should talk to your doctor and that
[01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:49.280]   stopped them from having an early heart attack people who have fallen off the edge of cliffs
[01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:54.120]   out in the middle of nowhere and their apple watch automatically called 911 and they were
[01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:58.320]   rescued and saved and didn't starve to death out in the wilderness these are to me are
[01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:03.800]   like really like that's the feature that's the single feature that I think is why people
[01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:08.240]   should buy an apple watch because android where devices do have ECG monitoring but as
[01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:15.080]   far as I know they don't have the same mechanism for determining what it means when your heart
[01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:19.480]   rate is not doing what it's supposed to do and I don't think there's any android where
[01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:23.960]   device that has fall detection not that I know of so that's the app that to me is the
[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:28.880]   reason to get an apple watch even the best android where watches they have they have
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:33.080]   sensors but they don't have features if that makes sense there and there's nothing that's
[01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:38.600]   that kind of package and once apple figures out how to do O2 saturation sensing through
[01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:45.000]   an apple watch that will then be the oh man why are you not letting this be available
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:49.400]   to everybody I especially in the age of covid if we had oxygen and if we had temperature
[01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:53.480]   on this I don't know if you can do temperature on the wrist maybe you can't but if they had
[01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:58.760]   that people would buy it just because it'd be a covid detector it would be hugely valuable
[01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:02.960]   except in a transfer they wouldn't get them the location data yes right but that's
[01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:08.720]   it but that's yeah but that's it's not just people are going to become healthier in general
[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:14.320]   not just when there are devices on their wrist that inform them hey your your pulse
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:21.040]   has been racing for the past two hours or your or your your your your you've got a normal
[01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:26.680]   ECG for some reason it's when it's just a simple fact that it gives people greater day
[01:53:26.680 --> 01:53:32.680]   to day awareness of what their normal is day to day to day to day that it's I do I keep
[01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:38.880]   the my oxygen sensor like on the on the desk here not because I feel as when I when I when
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:43.320]   the Rona gets me it's going to get me when I'm at my desk it's so that it's so that every
[01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:46.960]   it's every every now and then every day I will take a reading and I will be able to figure
[01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:52.920]   out okay 98 99 that is my normal so that if suddenly there it's 92 I'm feeling pretty
[01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:57.760]   much okay maybe a little bit tired I'll know that oh wait that is that is really really
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:54:02.840]   low I'm gonna have to really keep on top of this just the other day I was I did my first
[01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:08.000]   my first big grocery shopping for three weeks because it's such a it feels like such a pain
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:13.600]   in the butt to do now but I first grocery shopping three weeks so I had like 15 20 pound
[01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:19.440]   like carrier bags of groceries I make three I think four trips up the stairs to get them
[01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:23.760]   into my house and at the end I don't I don't want to make I don't want to get people
[01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:27.520]   worries that I felt like I was having a heart attack but I was like you know what I could
[01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:32.080]   have taken those stairs a lot slower than I did or made more trips than I actually did
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:37.680]   I feel like I just want to really sit down right now and stay sitting down for until this
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:44.520]   passes but because I have a because you have numbers to back you up it's like okay immediately
[01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:49.320]   I'm saying that no it's not as though like my blood is sufficiently oxygenated I'm just
[01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:56.000]   out of breath not not not to say that I would say okay well now I can't see in color anymore
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.480]   and my my face is drooping and my my left arm's gone painful but hey this watch says
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:05.360]   that my blood it's not if I would have done that it's just that I have an awareness that
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:09.400]   for the next three or four minutes I'm not gonna worry about it let's I know that I can
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:14.000]   I know what normal is but if I got that sensor on and no this is not normal okay let's keep
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.440]   it on and keep taking a look at it and that okay my blood oxygen level has been going
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:23.480]   lower and lower and lower even though I just feel tired I'm going to have to take the next
[01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:27.560]   step on this so that's that's what's exciting to say nothing of what what machine learning
[01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:32.440]   will do once it's basically comparing your normal to other people's normal and looking
[01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:39.160]   at deviations comparing that to not only that but he also stumbled a lot more over the past
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:43.920]   three or four weeks than he has normally we can also tell that it is on the on the same
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:49.640]   foot we're not going to diagnose something but we are going to give him and they we're
[01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:54.320]   going to create a report that's once because we see on his calendar thanks to communication
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:58.960]   with his general practitioner that he has his annual checkup next month we are going
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:03.600]   to get every year but when you have a checkup you push a button it will generate a PDF of
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:07.920]   just data that if you want if you want to review it and you want to share it with your
[01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:13.680]   doctor you can that's the stuff that will continue to create miracles and I just hope
[01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:21.240]   that Android users are deemed worthy of saving what was it for you Renee the bands right
[01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:26.840]   so so well I mean but when before it was even announced like there was things I just
[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:30.480]   knew that I wanted like I wanted a way to better get my notifications I wanted a way
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:34.200]   that didn't mean every time I opened my iPhone I'd I'd dive into Twitter or YouTube for half
[01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:38.320]   an hour and I wanted things that were just like effortless like you know you go in and
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:42.240]   it recognizes you it authenticates you there were these major things that I wanted and they
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:46.560]   delivered all of those things with the first one it wasn't fully formed yet you know and
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:51.880]   there was a lot of of of cruft on top of it that they whittled away nicely over the intervening
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:55.960]   years but it's gotten to a point where like if I if I forget to charge it or I forget my
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:57:00.680]   charger and I'm not wearing it my arm feels like worse than naked and I'm just so used
[01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:05.680]   to looking at it and now I have like during most days I have the infograph watch face and
[01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:11.200]   it has my entire day had me I can see everything in a glance and tap to pays been ubiquitous
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:16.720]   in Canada for a decade so I just I tapped back when I could still leave the house I tapped
[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:22.680]   to pay for everything it was just so easy it it could it uses analogy and it just it's
[01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:26.320]   apropos for me is my father got the apple to because he didn't want to have to drive
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:31.880]   downtown to get on the IBM mainframes and I got an iPhone and I could run iMore for years
[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:36.400]   on an iPhone if I had to and didn't have to go running back to my Mac and I have my Apple
[01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:40.880]   watch it can't do anywhere nearly what my iPhone can do but it can do a small critical
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:46.960]   brief subset of those things so well so conveniently and so without further distraction that has
[01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:52.760]   just become invaluable to me and I can't I can't think of not having it anymore yeah just just
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:56.200]   very very quickly one the one the other reasons why I pulled the trigger on buying that watch
[01:57:56.200 --> 01:58:00.480]   was because I find that I'm missing text messages particularly from family members and they'd
[01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:05.680]   like to like text message because I don't have the need to I'm leaving the house rarely
[01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:10.400]   enough that it's usually just to take half our walk we're going to be doing nothing so
[01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:15.440]   I don't oftentimes like my phone will just like stay on the charger or stay on the desk
[01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:21.600]   for days and days at a time without being anywhere near my my range of attention and
[01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:25.400]   the ability to simply have like on my wrist oh by the way here's it here's it I can get
[01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:30.640]   it I can get the stuff that I really really want to have access to without needing to carry
[01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:35.880]   around my phone even or even have the temptation that I'm G I'm I'm bored for 10 seconds but
[01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:41.360]   hey I'm gonna I'm gonna go and I'm gonna go and check Instagram or see like if I got
[01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:44.520]   any photos I need to post so that's what I really wanted that's really really wanted
[01:58:44.520 --> 01:58:53.720]   for instance I get to have and you can't you can't tell your family now oh sorry my phone
[01:58:53.720 --> 01:59:00.560]   wasn't near me well unfortunately I'm sure that whatever app they want to use the message
[01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:06.240]   me with is not supported by this inferior device my mom likes the bigger phones the plus
[01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:09.680]   size phones because she reads just everything on them but they're so big she doesn't have
[01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:13.440]   it all there is either in her purse or like on the table and now her apple watch she looks
[01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:18.160]   at it and she can see if it's like one of her kids or one of her friends texting or calling
[01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:23.400]   and the microphone and and speaker are so good now I can't tell after time when people
[01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:28.520]   are answering me on their Apple watch yeah yeah it's pretty amazing by the way public
[01:59:28.520 --> 01:59:34.000]   service announcement from iMore if you send your Apple watch to Apple for service take
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:40.040]   the band off or it will not come back yeah what are they doing with all those extra
[01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:47.840]   bands I wonder well I mean obviously that's a good looking band I want to it's actually
[01:59:47.840 --> 01:59:54.560]   in their Apple support document it says don't include any accessories because we're not
[01:59:54.560 --> 01:59:59.640]   going to send them back they take them off yeah there's probably a bucket next to the
[01:59:59.640 --> 02:00:02.600]   mail in the mailroom where they just throw all the well if you've been sweating with
[02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:09.040]   that for five years I'm doing you a favor but he wants filthy sweaty DNA field bucket my
[02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:15.280]   guess is this this recent this was recently clarified because there's there's probably
[02:00:15.280 --> 02:00:20.520]   a level of just I don't want to have to deal with trying to remember to make sure to send
[02:00:20.520 --> 02:00:26.600]   this watch band back I bet there's been a number of times where the support tech people
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:30.520]   they you know they have to take the band off so that they can do the work and then they
[02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:35.040]   go oh where did I put that band does it go with this one or does it go with this one
[02:00:35.040 --> 02:00:39.200]   and some people may have not gotten their bands back or they got someone else's band
[02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:44.840]   so just no band so they probably decided let's not worry about this anymore let's you
[02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:49.040]   know not put it on the on the tech guy to have to worry about sending the right band
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:54.880]   back with the right case let's just tell everybody if you send in the your watch band with your
[02:00:54.880 --> 02:01:01.160]   with your watch you probably won't get it back just that's it yeah I and of course I
[02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:05.240]   always tell people when they bring in their laptops to copy your hard drive because there's
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:10.120]   no guarantee it's coming back with the same data on it yeah I always I always do it's
[02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:16.360]   a wipe and reinstall yeah yeah yeah last item and then we're gonna get to your picks of
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:20.840]   the week this could be my pick if you happen to have four hundred ninety nine thousand
[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:30.800]   dollars lying around this is a replica of a 1979 Porsche 935 that apple sponsored at
[02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:37.720]   lemons it's beautiful really look I shall are a cue written all over it oh just gorgeous
[02:01:37.720 --> 02:01:45.920]   it's not the original it's a replica DuPont registry is selling it or you know if you
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:50.560]   can't afford half a million four thousand four hundred fourteen dollars a month no big
[02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:56.200]   for like a hundred years but you have two percent cash back if you pay for it with the
[02:01:56.200 --> 02:02:04.480]   apple card apparently jobs and was were interested in the lemons racing dick barber racing has
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:11.880]   had apple or had apple it's a sponsor for years and so I love the old six color wheel
[02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:16.320]   you're burying the lead they announced carplay for older Porsche and that means is so many
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:21.400]   people in Silicon Valley are making appointments right now to get well I was one of the not
[02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:24.880]   the most recently but a couple of years ago singers were super popular there and that's
[02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:28.760]   when you take an old Porsche and you fully modernize it but it's still an old vintage
[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:32.800]   Porsche and I think they started like a million dollars and they were just people talking
[02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:37.040]   like there's it's that car culture in Silicon Valley there are so many engineers who have
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:42.480]   like original next stock or like original or like they they all they want to do is code
[02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:46.000]   they have no need for material things they have more money they can ever spend but boy
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:50.680]   do they like their car I think the most interesting thing I learned in this article is that the
[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:57.760]   original is owned by Adam Corolla it was originally he bought it for four point eight
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:01.640]   four million dollars is now worth eight to ten million dollars man I gotta get some of
[02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:08.760]   that podcasting money this guy it's clearly no he owns twelve race cars driven by Paul
[02:03:08.760 --> 02:03:14.200]   Newman it's in that collection what you need is a channel called powerful Leo and then Leo
[02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:20.280]   clips and then you need like a bike how did Adam Corolla get so loaded was it that much
[02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:25.880]   money in the man show what's going on there okay but I can give you I can give you a lower
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:29.520]   cost option this is this has been I'm gonna show you something that's been kicking around
[02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:35.640]   my my office for a while maybe this is the time I build it up you can buy model kits of
[02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:40.360]   like that model of Porsche just because lots of companies make it in like one one 24th
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:47.360]   scale somebody has gone eBay has gone ahead and made a sticker set like a decal set oh
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:53.440]   oh you're just so cute just put the stickers on your car so if you so if you buy that that
[02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:58.920]   model any maker's model kit of that car that year that scale it's like only like ten or
[02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:05.920]   twelve bucks if you just do like a if you just do a an eBay search for like Porsche Apple
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:11.080]   racing car sticker set I've had I wouldn't do that just for a year I know I know this
[02:04:11.080 --> 02:04:16.320]   is I've added that to my list of things I might want to do during quarantine projects
[02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:21.600]   want to do I was I was I was just I'd seen that are I'd seen that article and that got
[02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:28.080]   me like putting a couple of these model kits on my on my watch list but yeah this is and
[02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:32.840]   like they're just like standard like decals and they're going to like slip off decals
[02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:39.760]   so yeah and you get the whole set man I love that yeah did you do models when you were
[02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:46.560]   a kid oh yeah yeah although I never I never did them the way that I never twig to the
[02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:51.400]   fact that the reason why they look so good is because people custom paint these things
[02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:57.680]   so they don't they just so why is my race car gray supposed to be like I did the Star
[02:04:57.680 --> 02:05:02.320]   Trek models when I was a when I was a kid all like the Klingon ships and the enterprises
[02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:07.800]   and those were fun so yeah you can buy their models for this you can buy and I think putting
[02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:14.760]   those decals on would be really great that's a yeah so so cool mmm Laurie your pick of
[02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:22.280]   the week my pick of the week this week so I'm I this isn't new to most people everybody's
[02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:28.600]   going to have heard of them John Krasinski has a YouTube show right now called some good
[02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:36.040]   news and I I am brought to tears every I almost I'm almost brought to tears right now just
[02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:43.240]   talking about it so amazing it's nothing better Hamilton yeah yeah yeah it's nothing
[02:05:43.240 --> 02:05:48.920]   but good positive stories feel good stories heartwarming stories about things that are
[02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:53.600]   going on right now it ranges all over the place so sometimes it's talking about health
[02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:59.040]   care workers or sometimes it's just talking about you know somebody who got married over
[02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:03.760]   the Internet you know just all good stuff and you're just constantly choked up with joy
[02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:08.880]   and happiness every time you see it and I was watching the episode the second it was
[02:06:08.880 --> 02:06:14.880]   the second episode where the cast of Hamilton sings to this this young girl who couldn't
[02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:20.640]   go see Hamilton because of the the shelter in place order and they all saying to her
[02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:25.480]   and it was so sweet and just this kind of stuff that's going on and John Krasinski
[02:06:25.480 --> 02:06:31.520]   having a level of celebrity that allows him to kind of make these like bridge these these
[02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:35.920]   gaps between you know the everyday people and the celebrities it's just such a sweet
[02:06:35.920 --> 02:06:40.280]   thing to see that happen and gives you just gives you something to feel good about this
[02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:47.600]   week he had a potluck with Guy Fieri Martha Stewart David Chang and Stanley Tucci a Zoom
[02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:55.800]   potluck what an idea huh yeah yeah he's you know what I don't know whose idea was for
[02:06:55.800 --> 02:07:00.840]   him to do this this is only the fifth episode he does one a week they're clearly heavily
[02:07:00.840 --> 02:07:07.320]   produced lots of money going into these I can I have to feeling that I thought this when
[02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:11.640]   I first saw it oh his manager and agent and been trying to get him a late night gig for
[02:07:11.640 --> 02:07:16.920]   a long time here's an opportunity this guy's better than anybody else on late night right
[02:07:16.920 --> 02:07:22.000]   now he's the next Tom Hanks he's lovable he's asleep he'll falls through in case the mark
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:30.520]   and to watch Stanley Tucci make a Negroni in his kitchen is is well worth the time I could
[02:07:30.520 --> 02:07:35.040]   do without Guy Fieri but that looks like some pretty good chili in there anyway yeah I agree
[02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:40.720]   100% with you yeah it's just it's just sweet and good and just makes you feel good about
[02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:49.680]   it so yeah really amazing Martha Stewart by the way very very nice kitchen I I do have
[02:07:49.680 --> 02:07:55.720]   kitchen envy I have serious kitchen envy over Martha's kitchen mr. Annie Naco your pick
[02:07:55.720 --> 02:08:06.560]   of the week mine might be actually a dual pick because I'm a big fan of the of the of
[02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:12.000]   the YouTube series called Project Binky and it's a they you don't need to know what it
[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:20.320]   really is about they're taking a night like a piece of junk 19 1982 mini Cooper awful
[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:25.480]   arrest and they're upgrading it with like a turbocharged engine and four wheel drive
[02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:30.040]   and all this sort of stuff and it's not like one of these and now a montage in which 30%
[02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:36.440]   of the work gets done it really is like building a car from scratch because as they're going
[02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:40.960]   they're they're they're making every single choice like well since we have the doors off
[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:45.160]   I really want power windows and I really want to have some sort of like a crash protection
[02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:48.960]   bar in there and they have to redo everything because they didn't think about it's the most
[02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:54.000]   it is super super entertaining but what I'm actually recommending is they they use a
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:09:03.200]   tool that I have to buy for myself this is the digi pass electronic level and so because
[02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:07.640]   I you're used to these analog levels so you're also maybe used to the stuff on your phone
[02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:12.360]   but this has two really cool features a digital readouts you can actually see like when you
[02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:17.680]   get to zero and also I don't know if the microphone will pick it up they when they of course they
[02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:20.360]   have to make sure that things are good and level when they build things so they'll place
[02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:26.520]   it on something and then drop it off the I heard that pretty good I'm recommending it
[02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:30.600]   for like so if you want to make sure your webcam is nice and level you can put it on
[02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:40.360]   top there and then make the noise I can't get a little because yeah okay but yes it's
[02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:44.720]   I just like it so much and I'm putting up lots of shelves now and I do have like torpedo
[02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:49.360]   levels I got like a three like a two foot long like bar level for carpentry but then I'm like
[02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:55.200]   I know I don't need this but I really want this is gonna be like two days of love really
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:09:59.720]   boring tedious work and I just want to be that to be interrupted every now and then by
[02:09:59.720 --> 02:10:03.840]   being able to put this thing on top of the shelf and adjusting it until it's level then
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:10.840]   here make the noise that's great 40 is 40 is 40 bucks so it's maybe twice as good as a
[02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:16.800]   decent torpedo level but it's making me happy and sometimes it's a lot less expensive than
[02:10:16.800 --> 02:10:22.200]   alcohol and a lot less damaging I think very nice.
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:24.600]   Renee Richie your pick of the week.
[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:29.120]   Alright so my eldest godson really really really wants me to pick Castlevania because
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:33.240]   he's been going through the entire Simon Belmont series of games on the Game Boy while he's
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:37.600]   been at home and thinks they're just magnificent so he wanted me to tell the world to please
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:42.960]   experience the awesomeness that is Castlevania with them but I'm also going to mention Pokemon
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:47.240]   Go has been doing this is near and dear to mine and Leo and Carsten and Lisa's hearts
[02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:51.160]   has been changing to try to get people to keep playing while they're stuck at home with
[02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:55.240]   covid and they've done some dumb stuff they've done some really smart stuff and it seems
[02:10:55.240 --> 02:10:59.320]   now they're doubling down on the smart stuff so they've increased the range of gyms and
[02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:04.080]   stops you can spin them from twice the distance which is really good for me because I was
[02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:08.760]   just barely out of range of one and now I'm in range of a book of stuff which is great
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:13.080]   but they also just yesterday added remote raids so before you have to get a group of
[02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:17.880]   people together and go to a raid and do it and now as long as you can see the gym you
[02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:21.400]   can tap on it you have to get something called a remote raid pass and right now you have
[02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:26.880]   to buy them in the store but they're selling three for a penny at the moment you can tap
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:30.920]   on it use one of these raid passes and raid even if you're in your home as long as you
[02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:35.480]   can see the gym and you can get a bunch of people to do it with you and I believe they're
[02:11:35.480 --> 02:11:38.680]   going to be adding invitations so at some point maybe it can invite you or Carsten or
[02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:45.760]   Lisa or Laurie to a raid with me that would be really nice I'm sure it helps them maintain
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:49.920]   their earnings I'm sure that you know that's a huge consideration for them given all this
[02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:54.640]   but it's also it's really nice to be able to play without having to get all these people
[02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:59.280]   in cars and it's just it's so much nicer and they're going to be doing a bunch of legendary
[02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:03.920]   raids like Darkrai and Virizion and a bunch of interesting things and they're doing an
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:08.320]   event where every week there'll be a special focus on a certain like Kanto and then Sino
[02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:13.040]   and you'll have Mewtwo available as a special bonus and just a bunch of things that I think
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:16.480]   are really going to appeal to people who are stuck at home but still want to play a little
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:21.400]   bit so credit where it's due I think they've done some good stuff over the last week yeah
[02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:25.560]   the Harry Potter also apparently has added some yes features that make it a little easier
[02:12:25.560 --> 02:12:31.600]   like roving fortresses yeah time of quarantine that was always my complaint about Pokemon
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:35.920]   go because we live in a smaller rural area and so it's not quite as easy as if you live
[02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:39.960]   in a big city where eating is a snap so I think it's nice to make this a little bit
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:45.160]   easier for people who are in less populated areas and it's a fun game if you haven't
[02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:49.320]   played it it's really a lot of fun Lisa and when you do go for your city proofed
[02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:53.800]   while like your one city approved walk a day you can still enjoy that yes really you
[02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:58.560]   only get one walk a day no some people talk about that because I think in some places that
[02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:02.440]   really is a rule but here they'll ask you why you're out and you'll see you multiple
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:07.240]   times I'll ask you why you're out multiple times yeah I mean it's a whole other like
[02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:11.560]   people should be able to take walks all they want wear a mask keep this social distance
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:15.640]   see you don't wear a mask though like I see very few people here with masks or xme and
[02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:18.720]   they're talking about opening the elementary schools to build herd immunity which is not
[02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:21.360]   something I want to hear from my provincial government oh god but that's against a whole
[02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:28.400]   other topic I'd be having so much better mask masks I got a bought a sewing machine
[02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:36.280]   I know I just bought a big work table it's getting a very expensive habit those massive
[02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:41.920]   weeks each but man it's so much fun to make masks for family and friends and yeah I've
[02:13:41.920 --> 02:13:46.560]   been looking for new designs and stuff and you can donate them too so that keep making
[02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:51.720]   them yeah there's a lot of organizations you bet yeah yeah yeah and here we have to wear
[02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:57.200]   masks now anytime we're out of the house in Sonoma County so it's worth it I kind of
[02:13:57.200 --> 02:14:02.480]   had a feeling that was coming so we've been making some nice masks it's fun unfortunately
[02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:09.520]   this is something the chat was pointing this out I really like having t-shirt material on
[02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:14.000]   the inside because it's soft yeah and I cut up a bunch of red t-shirts and so the masks
[02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:19.160]   can't get washed because they've got red in them I have to wait a little red load before
[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:28.320]   I can wash my mask so use color neutral colors safe materials in your mask my suggestion anyway
[02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:34.080]   I think we have wrapped up this episode I thank you so much Renee Richie he's available
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:41.000]   on YouTube as Renee Richie also on Twitter hard to remember as Renee Richie follow him
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:45.120]   subscribe so boring are you getting enough did you get enough sufficient numbers now to
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:51.480]   really get you know the I'm getting there about a third of where I was before so I'm
[02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:55.840]   going back and forth with YouTube on some of it and because I figure they're over work
[02:14:55.840 --> 02:14:59.360]   now so everything is taking forever and this used to be a lot of confusion but I'm trying
[02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:03.720]   to work through it so I'm about a third of the way I want you to get that hundred thousand
[02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:10.600]   but baby you got to get that silver oh thank you man me too yeah yeah yeah do they do you
[02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:14.960]   know I think somebody said if you if you publish every day it's better for you you're
[02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:20.400]   publishing almost every day now yeah I mean like they say consistency but like again like
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:24.840]   you there's just so many factors they just rolled up a new thing telling you what time
[02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:28.880]   it's you most of your viewers are online but then at the bottom it says time of publication
[02:15:28.880 --> 02:15:32.300]   does not affect long-term viability of a video and I was like what are you saying to me
[02:15:32.300 --> 02:15:35.740]   at Google are you saying that we bugged you so much for this feature you're giving it to
[02:15:35.740 --> 02:15:39.980]   us but telling it us it's useless at the same time it's just so passive aggressive so I
[02:15:39.980 --> 02:15:46.700]   don't know I you know at this point when you first go to a channel and you see four or
[02:15:46.700 --> 02:15:51.680]   five videos it's like well I know I don't want to invest in something if he's good at
[02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:57.420]   but it's pretty you know now your grid starting to fill up the quality looks good the contents
[02:15:57.420 --> 02:16:01.800]   phenomenal I think that what's gonna happen is it's gonna be a snowball and it's gonna
[02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:07.000]   start really roll I really do I really think you so much I'm really happy for you Renee

[02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:34.340]   always have a thing in my heart for GBH you grew up listening to them in Providence
[02:16:34.340 --> 02:16:38.840]   Rhode Island they used to have books reading every Saturday night I used to listen to that
[02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:43.600]   it's the first place I ever heard the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy so there's a special
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:48.640]   place in my heart for GBH to be that is the public radio station I wish I wish my parents
[02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:54.440]   had lived long enough to see this happen because they would have been like yeah your parents
[02:16:54.440 --> 02:16:58.680]   like they they love that you're doing well but when you're in a job like mine they don't
[02:16:58.680 --> 02:17:03.000]   understand what it is I do for a living because that job really didn't exist when they were
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:07.420]   during their day and like wait a minute WGBH we know what that is radio we know what that
