[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, Episode 182, a very special Mac Break Weekly,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   thanks to Mr. Merlin Mann, who has suggested this for the last three or four years.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And we're finally getting around to do it.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Merlin Mann is here from 43folders.com.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Hello, Merlin.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Hello, friends.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   How are you?
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   It's nice to see you, Leo.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I'm doing kind of some moody lighting today.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   I hope that's great.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   I like it.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   It's very yellow.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   My honey, do I look like I'm in honey flight?
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   You're honeyed.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   How many dipped Merlin Mann?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   That's a favorite.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Crowd favorite.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   That's unfortunate.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   So your idea was to have us do just all picks because we always do a deal with this show.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   My only contribution to this show in the 14 years that I've sometimes been on here, I think,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   was the addition of the pick of the week, which is my favorite part.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   The whole reason I'm into this Mac stuff is not because of the numbers and the chip sales.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   I just love the applications.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   I love that there's so many things on the Mac that really make me happy and make my life
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   better.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   I'm glad we're doing this.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I hope people enjoy this.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Can I pimp my little thing here?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Pimp your thing.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   So anyway, I'll leave this up after we've recorded this, but merlinman.com/macpix.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I'm going to be...
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   People always want to see what's the link for this, what's a screen grab.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   So with this extremely loud, tactile Pro 2.0 keyboard that I use, we hear a lot of clacking.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Yeah, I'm going to post...
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   So you'll be able to see all this stuff.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I'm sure it'll all go up on MBW.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Yeah, yeah, we'll have to figure out a way.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   We've got a friend feed room going and if people see a pick not showing up there, please
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   add that to that.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   The buzz is started at buzz.com, so we're going to have various ways.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And by the time the show's over, there'll be good show notes with all of this information.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Luckily, we have 52 minutes of this stuff already, yeah.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Yeah, our pick masters include Mr. Alex Lindsey from thepixacore.com.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Hello, Alex.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Hello.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Good to have you here once again.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Good to be here.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Also from the Chicago Sun Times, everybody's favorite Mac journalist, Andy Enoco.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Hello.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   So...
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I think it's Hollywood Square's Charlie Weaver, Half Wave.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Yeah, well, you're in...
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Let's see, you're in the corner square to block, so it's appropriate.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   There's no...
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   You know, if we did this right, we'd have a few more...
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   We'd be three by three instead of two by two.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Then we could play tic-tac-toe with you guys.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   So let's kick it off, Merlin.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   This is your idea.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   So pick number one goes to Merlin Mann.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Okay.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I'm going to start with one that...
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I don't know if I've ever overtly talked about, but I want to toss it out there because it's
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   something that's just been an evolving usage for me, which is textmate.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Now, I know there's all kinds of religious wars about text editors that go way, way, way
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   back, but I used to be a BB Eddy guy back in the day.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   They're all great, right?
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Even if you use whatever VIE, Max, or whatever, there's reasons to use all of them.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   I don't want to just recommend textmate because that's kind of dumb.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   I want to recommend one reason why I like textmate.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   So textmate is a text editor, like Guinea.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   You don't really need this if all you're going to do is open and type because you've already
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   got text edit, which, by the way, a lot of people don't know text edit will also open a
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   pharum number of Microsoft Word files as well.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   It does, isn't it?
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   It's a very robust program.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   You got Google Documents.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   So for the basic stuff, you don't really need to buy an app.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:46.800]   Textmate is the closest thing to--it's got all of the GUI of a good Mac program, but
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.400]   it's got a tremendous amount of power under the hood because it works--it's integrated
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.680]   so well with really just pretty much any kind of programming language, anything you
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.840]   want to do.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.640]   So if you like Pearl or you like Ruby or you like anything, there are at least dozens,
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.000]   and I want to say maybe hundreds of bundles that you can install.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.600]   A bundle is like a plugin, but a bundle is something that includes--it's got a language
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.000]   file, it's got a commands file and so on and so forth.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Long story short, you can expand the functionality of textmate by adding these bundles.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   And if you're just thinking, "Oh gosh, great.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   I can build Rails apps that I don't need."
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   No, there's a lot more to it.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   You can have a task paper to do list bundle.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   You can have--I'll put up a screen grab on my bundles.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   You can do stuff like--I'm going to pull mine up real quick.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   I'll do a new list.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   I use it for--in Subversion is a way to share documents with another writer.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.400]   Yeah, and so the first part of it that's amazing is, for example, if you don't like the stock
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.840]   HTML bundle, there's like a really amazing one called ZenHTML that adds a lot more
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.840]   functionality.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.120]   Now, why would you want all of this stuff?
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.400]   Well, first of all, you get basic stuff like syntax highlighting.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.360]   So if you're used to working in an IDE, if you're a coder, you're used to having a lot
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.800]   of control over what your environment looks like, how you set things up.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.800]   Not alone is pretty cool.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.800]   You get that anywhere.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.720]   If you really, really, really, really know Perl or something, you could do all this on
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.720]   your own.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.280]   But for most of us who are kind of like a power user, let's say, I'm not exactly a--I
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.680]   don't know Perl to save my life.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.000]   I love the fact that somebody else can build this bundle.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.200]   I can grab it off of GitHub or wherever else--wherever else--toss it at--textmate.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.200]   And now I've got stuff like what?
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.680]   You can edit your mail.app messages from inside of here.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.440]   You can post via XML RPC to your blog from in here.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.880]   Just GitHub, just.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.600]   You can post a Flickr from in here.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.360]   Like Unix itself, it is, as they say, small pieces loosely joined.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.360]   All these things work together.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.960]   Beyond the syntax highlighting, you get things like snippets.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.720]   I use snippets all the time, for instance.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.040]   There's some stuff I type into my wiki a lot.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.120]   And this just does it all for me automatically.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.120]   It's really fantastic.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.600]   And if you're used to text expander, for example, which is--I probably should come up
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.120]   today because text expander on the iPhone will change your game.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.760]   Text spanders is great, but I think text expander mostly explodes based on things like
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.760]   spaces.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.520]   So at the end of the word, you type a space.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.280]   Textmate takes all of this to another level.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.280]   I don't want to get too nerdy, but with the way textmate gets really powerful and where
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.000]   people don't really always see why it's great is through something called scope.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.640]   And scope is just a way of saying that different things happen in different contexts based
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.440]   on what you might need.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:30.920]   So in one context, if you type, for example, let's say, control command W, that might be
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.760]   that might pull up something that lets you post your blog, it might pull up something,
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.120]   it all depends on where you are.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.760]   So in some cases, for example, you'll only see certain commands pop up if you're inside
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.760]   a meta tag in the head of an HTML document.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.600]   You're not going to see everything you can do.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.840]   You're only going to see the stuff that's contextually necessary inside of there.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.040]   You've also got things like languages.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.560]   You've got an ability to tweak this.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.960]   This is less educational than hopefully to excite you.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.840]   I want you to just have a look at this.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.080]   It's very much worth the money.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.880]   I think it's, I don't know, almost like 40 bucks, but I'm not sure.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.880]   55.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:03.880]   55.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.720]   And it's easily some of the best money I've ever spent.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.640]   You can post your Tumblr shell scripts.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.240]   There's this one dude that blows my mind.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.320]   This guy, his name on GitHub is Subtle Gradient.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:18.040]   And he's a tremendous nerd that has written some of the most amazing bundle stuff I've
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:22.920]   ever seen, including stuff like you can iterate, like if you've got a row of data and you're
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.760]   in block editing mode, you can iterate everything by 10 or 20.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.640]   He's written all these amazing things, I think mostly in Pearl.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.680]   Anyway, just have a look at it.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.680]   And so, so here's a couple quick ones for you that I really will specifically recommend.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.080]   Markdown and multi-markdown.
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.080]   I live in multi-markdown.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.720]   I haven't used multi-markdown.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.720]   How's that doing?
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:45.120]   Multi-markdown, much to Groobers, Chagrin, much to my joy, ads, footnotes, references,
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:50.320]   oncari, I'm writing my book in multi-markdown.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:55.640]   Another one, not to miss, is kind of a meta tip, which is one called Get Bundles.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.280]   And that's a bundle that keeps your bundles updated without having to get into GitHub
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.280]   if you wanted to.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.280]   Very nice.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.360]   You basically choose which one of these you want, which repository and it pulls it down
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.360]   for you.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.360]   Textmate, it's at macromates.com.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.360]   And I love it a lot.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.840]   Highly recommended, very, very well worth the money.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.640]   Alex Lindsey, you are next.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.800]   So I have a new one.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.680]   Yay, one we've not seen before.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.320]   Not one, and one that I hadn't seen until a couple of weeks ago.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.680]   And I saw a go by and I've been noodling with it.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:29.080]   So here's the background, is that I said DJ.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.600]   And DJing has some challenges, getting beat mixes right and getting all the stuff kind
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.600]   of moving.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.440]   You want to make a good party mix and you want to mix a bunch of things.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:41.240]   These songs all come, evidently they do not all work at 120 beats per minute.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.240]   As much as you'd like them to.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.240]   They wish they would.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.400]   They wanted them all to be at 120 beats, but some are 113 and some are 123.
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.400]   And you want to make cool mixes.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.920]   And it's something that I always wanted an iTunes.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.400]   It's great for iTunes has kind of a stupid cross fade.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.560]   You know, like it just does a cross fade from one to the other.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.680]   And it doesn't matter what it is and it doesn't do it to the beat and it doesn't pay attention
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.520]   to any of those things.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.800]   And you want to have something a little bit more intelligent.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.400]   And so anyway, so I saw this application go by and it's pretty nifty.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.600]   It's called MixMeisterExpress.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.800]   MixMeister!
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.320]   MixMeister!
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:20.080]   And MixMeisterExpress is, there's MixMeister is a, there's this whole suite of products.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.760]   So this is the little one.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:28.120]   There's MixMeister Studio and there is MixMeisterFusion and MixMeisterFusion plus video.
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.520]   And these are, those are like pro apps.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.320]   When you hear, this is the kind of software.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.600]   I'm not saying this is always the software that they use, but this is the kind of software
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.720]   you'd hear for like remixes that you'd see on a CD, you know, the dance remixes and so
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.920]   and so forth where you can add stuff in.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:47.560]   And what it does, what the pro ones do that has, you know, also gotten into the MixMeister
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.680]   Express is that they of course do all the beat mixing for you.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.680]   So that they match the beat.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.400]   So you can cross-fade two songs and it just, it blends the next, you know, and it slowly
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.720]   brings one from the what it was to what it is now.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.680]   And all the things that we used to do on, you know, that used to take a lot of skill.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.400]   You know, you know, now it's just like, oh, we use Adam and it's incredible.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.280]   You can import your entire iTunes library and you watch it just work through the BPM and
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.920]   it's sitting there just calculating all the BPMs for all your songs.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.920]   So it has the, you know, it figures out what the...
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:18.920]   How would it have done?
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.920]   That's pretty impressive.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.240]   So there's a bunch of different ways to do it.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.760]   One way to do it is a, is you do a low pass filter.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.880]   So you do a low pass filter where you grab only the boop boop boop.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.400]   You know, like you can isolate the boop boop and then you count that and then you figure
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.040]   it out per minute and then you put it in.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.480]   So anyway, the, I don't know how they're doing it, but that's one way to do it.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.720]   Anyway, they get the BPM.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.760]   And so you have all of the BPMs for your songs already figured out.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.360]   And then as you add them, it'll simply drop and you can say like, I want to beat Mix
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:54.200]   and it'll simply drop, you know, over there you can, you can snap to measure, you can snap
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.440]   to beat, you can snap to, you know, so it really, it figures out what all those things
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.440]   are for you.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:03.640]   And I said, this is kind of a pro DJ kind of thing to do, but now it's something that
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.640]   you can do.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.880]   If you really want to make that great mix and if you're like me, you know, it's great
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:13.320]   to have a playlist, but like when I'm having a little barbecue, I really want, I want all,
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.640]   because I used to do DJ, I want all the songs to blend together.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:20.240]   I want them all to kind of create a tapestry of music in the background.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.000]   And so this is my kind of application.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.040]   So anyway, it's 69 bucks and it is.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.000]   So you're saying it really doesn't make it a beautiful mix?
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.440]   Well, it makes it easy for you to make a beautiful mix, you know, and then you can export it
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:37.600]   out to, you know, you can burn it, burn a CD from the application or you can export out,
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.600]   you know, to iTunes.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:42.480]   And so those are the, you know, it just makes it quick and easy to kind of put all that
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.480]   stuff together.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.480]   So anyway, that's it.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.480]   There you go.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.640]   And it's my static smister.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.720]   And it is mixedmeister.com Andy Enoco, your first pick of the day.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.800]   My first pick of the week day and year is the Logitech Squeeze Box.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.000]   Squeeze Box is an old and venerable name.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.480]   Logitech bought it about a few years ago.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.440]   And I think it's one of the two great ways to use your iTunes library throughout the
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.840]   rest of the house.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:14.320]   One way is to buy yourself a $99 airport express modem, a base station and plug in a
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:19.680]   pair of speakers and use your iPhones, your remote control app to access your library
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.040]   and change the, you know, change the playlist, change the tracks.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.440]   The other way is the Logitech Squeeze Box radio system.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:31.560]   It is what looks like a very cool, like little console, like tabletop radio, but it has Wi-Fi
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.560]   built in.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.400]   It can, you, it can connect to any machine you've got inside your entire house, running
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.640]   either Mac or Windows.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.680]   That's also running a special little invisible Squeeze Box server app that does nothing but
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.640]   wait for requests from this radio to have it serve content.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.240]   It's very, very slick.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.720]   Anything that's inside your iTunes library, including smart playlists, will be very,
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:57.280]   very easy to access throughout the, through the on-screen control.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:02.280]   In and of itself, it can also do things like it can connect to Pandora radio, Last FM,
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.120]   Rhapsody, all these other really cool services.
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:10.800]   And it's, it's the, it's the smartest way to access your library without having, without
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:16.360]   feeling as though you are doing sort of a semi-clugy sort of thing to find your remote
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.400]   server and connect to it and control it, control it.
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.160]   It really does feel as though you just have this cool little desktop tabletop radio that
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.200]   can connect to every song and every podcast and every internet radio station that you
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.680]   ever access.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:33.560]   It's maybe not the most appropriate solution for something like your living room, but for
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:38.840]   something like, I, I, I have a, they're not their cheapest model, but their second cheapest
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.840]   model in the bathroom.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.360]   And that's what I listen to when I'm shaving, brushing my teeth and showering and stuff.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:49.320]   And the cool thing about it is that it'll be very, very easy for me to simply start a
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:54.840]   piece of music playing or start like a podcast playing from my notebook in one part of the
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.880]   house and then go in and just do morning ablutions.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.480]   But it's another thing to suddenly decide that, you know what, I'm really not interested
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.480]   in this track.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.920]   I think I just want the next one or I suddenly I want to listen to this audiobook that I
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.280]   downloaded a couple of days ago.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.480]   And you can just simply reach up, you know, turn the dial just like you're turning a
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.960]   radio has a very, very, has a color to the, the squeeze box radio model, which is the
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:19.520]   cheapest one, 199 has a color screen of really cool iPod ish interface.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.480]   It makes it very, very easy to navigate and access.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.600]   And you just make a, make a difference change, make a selection and it's up and running in
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.600]   just seconds.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.760]   So that's, I, it's, I didn't really get it at first.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:35.080]   I think it was because I was trying to use it as an office radio.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.000]   And I realized that why the hell do I want an office radio?
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.400]   I've got the computer right here.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.040]   But, but when you're looking for something for the kitchen, when you're looking for something
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:45.720]   in the bathroom, one of those rooms where you're not likely to have a computer handy
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.720]   when you need it.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.040]   It really is a slick, slick solution.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.600]   It's not that much more expensive than buying an extra airport express.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.640]   And it's just a much, much slicker solution.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.480]   199 bucks at the start.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.800]   It supports media fly, which means it would support our broadcasts as well.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.760]   You get all the Twitch stuff on there.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.960]   That speaker sounds pretty good, you think?
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.960]   Sounds very, very good.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.920]   I have the, the tabletop version of stereo with a lot of nice bass.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:10.840]   I think this, the airport, excuse me, the squeeze box radio for 199.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.840]   It's the small.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:17.680]   It's just smaller and it's mono, it's a mono, but I believe it has a good amount of bass.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.520]   If you want to improve things, it also has headphone jack.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.240]   So you can plug in a good pair of like, you know, cheap pair of $30, $40.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.920]   So you have the boom.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:25.920]   I have the boom.
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:26.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.240]   And I'm not, it doesn't have the color screen, but it has, it's the first model that a lot
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.240]   should have came out with.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.240]   That's 300 bucks.
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.000]   But it's a much better experience.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.240]   It's sort of like what the iPod high-fi would have been if, if any other, if any company
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.200]   other than Apple had developed it.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.280]   Does it do receiver?
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.600]   Receiving the dot com?
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.000]   I don't know if it does.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.080]   I'm not aware of it.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:53.880]   This is a website that internet radios support.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.720]   I have a couple of internet, I love internet radios.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:56.720]   I love the whole idea.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.480]   I'm pretty sure Logitech does support this.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.520]   So you go to this site, it has a directory of 14,000 internet radio stations.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.560]   That's the largest directory I know of.
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:09.480]   You create an account, you can create a station list which you then can send to the radio so
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.760]   that the rate is much easier to find stations.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.480]   If you're listening to internet radio, much easier to find stations.
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.480]   But like you, I end up listening to Panda.
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.840]   It must, it probably has something similar to that because right in the website, there's
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.800]   a wizard that says, if you, if you want to listen to like an actual radio station, type
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.960]   in the call letters here, right?
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.440]   I tell you whether it's, whether it's, whether it's available by streaming.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.440]   So for instance, yeah.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:34.200]   So I just checked to see if has WPOS, like a good rate, good station here at Boston.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.000]   Of course, it is available in squeeze box.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.840]   And you just easily tune into it right with the spots right here.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.560]   Has alarm clock has all these other cool stuff.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:46.120]   So think about the money you're wasting on those $15 alarm clocks that you've got on
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:50.400]   your bedside is pay for itself in just, well, a couple of years.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.720]   So I thought we might do 10 of these.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.720]   I don't think we're going to do 10.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.720]   We haven't even done four.
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.440]   We've done three.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.440]   But we have more to come.
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.440]   I'm going to do mine.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.760]   Actually, this is kind of a follow up on yours.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:02.920]   I was going to do a little later on.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.800]   But since you mentioned the squeeze box, this is a wonderful solution.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:10.920]   If you want to get that you said for the living room to go one step higher, the Sonos
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.640]   Zone Player S5.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.360]   This is such a cool player.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.280]   First of all, these speakers sound really good.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:24.560]   Sonos, very much like the squeeze folks, pioneered kind of this Wi-Fi radio idea.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.960]   This is not an iPod dock.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.960]   It is a standalone.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.160]   In fact, it looks just like a speaker.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.480]   The only wire on it is a plug into the wall.
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.160]   It has a volume and a mutes button.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.600]   And that's it.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.280]   You can buy one or as many as you want.
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.560]   Each of them will then bond to your Wi-Fi.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.320]   They can see your iTunes collection, but they can also see all of those things that
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:51.000]   this sling box plays, the, you know, the Rhapsody, the Last FM, the Slacker.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.560]   I put Pandora on it all the time.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:57.000]   It does internet radio as well so I can hear all my local stations on it.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.880]   And it has an incredible iPhone interface, which will be even better on the iPad.
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.160]   I can't wait to see this on the iPad.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.880]   Sounding on the couch.
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.600]   So it allows you to control it through the iPhone.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.000]   I can actually show it to you.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.440]   I have it on my iPhone here.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.080]   We won't see much because I don't have a Son player here.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.000]   I end up buying, there's two 99 each.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.040]   The quality is so good.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.520]   I end up buying one for the living room, one for the kitchen, and one for the bedroom.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.720]   It's become our bedroom radio too.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.720]   Hi, I'm Lindsay.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.720]   Here's Lindsay.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.120]   Let her tell you all about it.
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.280]   I'm just pot Lindsay down.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.400]   But she's, this is a demo that's on the site that allows you to see how it works.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.400]   Really, this is the iPhone app and it's just spectacular.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.320]   It allows you to search for radio stations and then they play through it.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.440]   You can have separate zones.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.440]   So each player can have its own separate music.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.960]   So as many players as you have is how many different stations.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.560]   So you can have something different in the kitchen, something in the living room.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.640]   But you can also have them all play the same thing if it's party time.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.640]   So that's very handy.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.640]   Which is this?
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.280]   $2.99 per.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.440]   They also have for the S5?
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.440]   Yeah, the S5's.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.440]   I'm player S5.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.440]   Sure, so $3.99.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.440]   Maybe it's $3.99.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.440]   You'll probably write it as $3.99.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.960]   Thank you for correcting me.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.120]   They have a little device, smaller device.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:14.720]   Maybe that's the $1.99 that attaches to your Wi-Fi.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.120]   And that's what I actually use.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.480]   I attach that to the Wi-Fi.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.840]   And that's if you have a stereo, so you can hook a stereo up to it as well.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.040]   It is the sound quality.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.240]   Do you have these, Andy?
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.760]   I've tried them out.
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.520]   I think they're a little high-end for my taste, but you're right.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.000]   They're very, very high quality.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   They're pricey.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.800]   It's like a stereo system.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.760]   It's like buying a tuner amplifier.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.520]   But there are two different kinds of markets for these.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:44.000]   There are people like me for whom, you know, they're not, if you're not really an auto-faudio
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.280]   file, you just want really good, a really good sound quality without feeling as though
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.480]   you've got your live at BuduCon.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.960]   But for people who want that extra experience, they'll always be companies like Sonos to
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.960]   fill the void.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.960]   Right.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.520]   This is, I just, you're right.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:04.640]   This is for somebody who wants, basically, you know, this is for the person who in years
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:09.040]   past would have had to wire the house, you know, to have separate zones in the house
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.640]   and the very elaborate, very expensive systems.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.080]   I now basically for three.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.320]   My grandfather had speaker wires.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.320]   He ran through the entire house and all got back to the bar.
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.400]   This is all wireless sound quality superb.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.840]   These speakers as small as they are sound really good.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.720]   We had a dance party and people were dancing to it.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.720]   So yeah.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.720]   In many rooms?
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.720]   Huh?
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.720]   You had a dance party in many rooms?
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.720]   You could.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.720]   You could.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:32.720]   I had actually different programming in each room.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.720]   It was our Christmas party.
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.720]   You were there.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.720]   And so I had dancing in one room.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.720]   I had Christmas music in the other room.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.720]   It was great.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.920]   I got to the front and I just had the cheese.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.520]   The cheese was good too.
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.800]   Oh, and oh, s.com.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.640]   This is own player, s5.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.080]   I'm going to have to get a couple, I think.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.080]   Come over and listen.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.080]   I'm definitely going to check it out.
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.880]   The iPhone has to put it over the top.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:54.960]   I mean, it's just incredible.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.840]   I have to say that this is exactly the kind of thing that I've been looking at.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:03.200]   And just imagine with the mixmeister software, you could make your own mixes.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:07.400]   If we could only get text made to work with this, we'd have a theme here.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.840]   Where's the text made hook?
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.680]   I was like, we're going to probably be done.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.240]   Something I'll make one by the time we're done.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.840]   So we're going to take a break, come back with more of your picks in just a little bit.
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:18.840]   This is fun.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:19.840]   This is a lot of fun.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.400]   Introduce a brand new sponsor to the show, and I'm really glad to have them.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.920]   And it's something that I think will fill a need that a lot of our listeners may have.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.960]   You have gadgets you no longer use.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.480]   Gazelle is the solution.
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.680]   I'm very excited about this.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.360]   We're going to-- I've actually been going around the studio today collecting stuff.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.320]   So here's like a Nokia-- let's try it.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:46.520]   A Nokia N93i that I no longer use.
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:51.880]   They take smartphones, mp3 players, laptops, gaming consoles, even old movies.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.920]   We know you all have gadgets that you are just dying to get rid of.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.400]   You go to Gazelle.com/macbreak.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.440]   You can find out how much Gazelle will pay you for.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.240]   They even send you a post page box.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:07.320]   You don't have to worry about listing it on eBay or anything like that.
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:13.000]   Just go to Gazelle.com/macbreak.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.240]   And then I'm going to enter in the gadget here.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.740]   It's a Nokia.
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.040]   And they'll tell you exactly how much they'll pay you for.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.040]   N93i.
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:25.760]   There it is.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.760]   Search.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:31.040]   They send you a shipping box and they send you a check.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.280]   Does it make a call successfully?
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.280]   Yes.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.280]   Is it free of water damage?
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.280]   Yes.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.280]   Overall condition?
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.280]   Perfect.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.000]   I have the AC adapter, the rechargeable battery, the original software CD, and the original cables.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.240]   They even show you a graph of the price of this.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.800]   That's time has gone by.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:53.600]   Now they calculate the offer and they're going to send me a check for $101.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.600]   That's awesome.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.080]   I am very happy.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.520]   This has been lying around the office.
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.320]   They're just going to send you that check.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.320]   Yeah, first I have to send it to the mama's.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.320]   Once they get it.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.560]   I press the button, add it to the box.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:04.560]   Assuming that it's good.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:08.920]   Yeah, as soon as I didn't lie about it, I'm adding it to my box.
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:09.920]   They pay for shipping.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.920]   You want to sell another one?
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.560]   What do you got anything you want to sell?
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.320]   I want you all to try this now.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.320]   This is so cool.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.400]   G-A-Z-E-D-L-E.com.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:23.080]   It's a marketplace so you can watch the rates go up and down so you can say, "I'm going
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.080]   to wait.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.080]   I see the value is going up."
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.080]   Then they'll send you a check.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:29.880]   Yeah, once you accept their offer, you enter your mailing address because they'll send you
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:30.880]   a box to send it in.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.040]   In most cases, they pay postage.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.080]   That may be US only so you should check.
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.080]   So the wait time.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.720]   You select the payment you want.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:42.160]   You can get a PayPal check, an Amazon or a Walmart gift card.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.280]   If you use Amazon gift card, they bonus at 5%.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.200]   There is so much stuff in my house that I could just wait a minute.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.400]   I'm telling you, I just made another $5.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:53.160]   Now here's the other thing that I really like and I actually really praise them for
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.160]   this.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.320]   They can also donate it to a charity.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:59.880]   In fact, if you are a charity, a little league team or you're trying to raise money, this
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.720]   is a solution that you can use.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.920]   You can fund a cause.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:06.560]   Turn your gadgets into cash for a cause.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:10.240]   So you set up a personalized gadget drive webpage.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.680]   The donors, you tell all the donors, go to Gazelle.
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:18.720]   Here's our page and they'll send the dollars to your cause.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.640]   It's so cool.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.000]   iPhone's about 400 bucks.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.280]   MacBook's about 600 bucks.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.240]   You have to check current rates, of course.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.120]   Round up all your used gadgets, go to Gazelle.com/Macbreakbytheway.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:34.760]   So it's like an online pawn chart without the pawning.
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:35.760]   Without the pawning.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.760]   With a box.
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.260]   With a box.
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:43.560]   For a 10%, I want to tell you one more thing, for a 10% bonus, an additional 10% on the
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.120]   value, use the code Macbreak.
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.280]   Gazelle.com/Macbreak.
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.440]   So this solves the E-waste problem.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.440]   This is really good.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:59.920]   And by the way, if there's recycling, they also help you do the recycling.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.120]   They have to find a whole little party, a little pixacord part.
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.120]   I know.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:09.120]   Hey, gazelle.com/Macbreak.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.400]   We're really glad to have them on board.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.400]   This is a great sponsor.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.760]   This is a great, very light kit.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.400]   I feel really happy about these guys.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.120]   Yeah, I like them a lot.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.640]   Because it's a win for everybody.
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.480]   So we're really glad to have them on the show.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.480]   Alright, let's see.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.480]   Who did the last one?
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.480]   Me.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.080]   So it's your turn, Mr. Merlin Mann, for your pick of the week, sir.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:27.080]   Hi, everybody.
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.080]   This is my second pick.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.560]   I think my hair fell down.
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.960]   Alright, this is two that we've definitely done before, but I want to talk to you about
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.960]   a use case.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.960]   It's really cool.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:43.560]   I want to talk about the combination of Expand Drive plus Skitch plus whatever you use for
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.400]   hosting.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:50.440]   Right now, let me just quickly go over what these two are.
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:53.520]   Probably everybody knows these, but I just want to make sure you know what you can do
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.520]   with this stuff.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.520]   Expand Drive and Skitch.
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:03.400]   First of all, Expand Drive, which is at expandrive.com/mac, is something that, let's be honest, should
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.840]   be built into the Finder.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:09.160]   Expand Drive lets you bring up basically FTP sites, SSH, logins.
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:13.320]   If you've got a web server running on your Chubby, you can pull that up.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.880]   Anything you can SSH by the way.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.480]   My Chubby does not have a...
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.480]   Oh, Chubby, I'm sorry.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.480]   Sorry.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.480]   Hey, Dr. Rader, I'm going to go to the doctor.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.480]   He had to lance it off.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:25.480]   If you're going to go into your Chubby, you're going to want an extremely secure socket.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:29.240]   That's SSH, SSH one.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.400]   SSH one, baby.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.480]   So Expand Drive is this thing though.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:35.280]   And again, this is one of those things that once you see it, it's like the first time
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.360]   I use Transmit, the wonderful FTP app.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.120]   I was like, "Why is this not everywhere?
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.320]   This makes so much sense."
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:44.280]   If you have, in my case, I'm on a lot of different shared hosts, dedicated hosts.
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:49.440]   I've got a lot of things out there I've got to either SSH into or SFTP into.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:54.720]   And Expand Drive basically mounts that on your desktop because it treats it like any other
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.160]   mountable drive.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.120]   So basically, if you've got, what if you're on parrot.com, you're on.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.560]   In my case, Libson.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:06.840]   I'm not doing the podcast stuff like I used to, but now every time I want to post something,
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:12.040]   I just toss it into my Libson folder and I created an Expand Drive shortcut that prepends
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.000]   the name of the file with the path to it.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.120]   So wherever I go, I can just type and all of a sudden I'm just dropping stuff in and
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.080]   it goes anywhere I want.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.560]   Now it's me where this gets a little sexier is where you also...
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.200]   The first of all, you're going to need a host to do this trick.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.360]   But it's pretty great to have a host that's got a lot of capacity and doesn't meet her
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.360]   on their bandwidth like Libson does.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.360]   But it does matter.
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.600]   Well, they support S3, so you can always use S3.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.600]   Could be S3.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.360]   S3 is so squirrely with permissions.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:41.280]   I don't understand why they can't figure out how to make permissions easier to deal with.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:46.480]   So just, again, just substitute Libson with the name of whatever you use that's SFTP-able.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:50.720]   But I just got to say, it is so much easier to know that you can just drag something into
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.080]   the equivalent of a folder and it's online.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.480]   Of course, there's half a dozen ways you could do this.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.240]   You could also do this with something like Dropbox.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:03.280]   Dropbox has not pinged me on bandwidth yet, but I would not be surprised if they did.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.080]   I would be careful if they're on public.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:10.040]   Well, it says right on the tin, we reserve the right to blah, blah, blah.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:13.120]   Because if you're serving something out of your public folder, that's going to put a
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.120]   hurting on them.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.120]   Yeah, that might...
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:19.920]   Yeah, because we use Dropbox to send gigabyte files all the time to our partners.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.920]   But not public.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:21.920]   Yeah, it's not public.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.920]   It's not a lot of hosting servers.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:24.920]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.120]   Yeah, they open up like, you know, 10,000 HTTP streams.
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.120]   That's going to be a lot.
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.120]   You're going to get some attention.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.120]   You're going to get some attention.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.920]   And so anyway, whatever you use, but here's where it gets sexy, in my opinion.
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.800]   You're saying it's going to get sexy.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:36.800]   I keep waiting.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:37.800]   Shut up, I rock.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.800]   Everybody needs to skip.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:39.800]   Everybody needs to skip.
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:40.800]   You're going to skip.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.520]   You're going to get off the screen, try to be huge right now.
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.960]   How are you going to tie this in with Skitch?
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:46.960]   I don't get it.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:47.960]   Here it comes.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:48.960]   Finish.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:49.960]   Just let me finish.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.960]   Skitch, let's see these screen grabs.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:52.960]   Everybody knows that.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:53.960]   It's super cool.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.960]   And you may even know in that little lower right hand corner where it says web post,
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.320]   you could post it to Flickr.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.200]   You could post it to your FTP site.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.960]   You could post it to Skitch's hosting servers.
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:02.960]   This is all pretty great.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:03.960]   I do that.
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.840]   As I'll demonstrate on my site in just a second, though, my favorite use of it is to combine
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.520]   it with, in this case, Libsyn for me, or it could be any other server.
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:14.400]   Basically, I enter my credentials for my hosting site inside of here.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.320]   And I can very easily take a screen grab, hit it, boom, put it up.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.320]   I'll do it right now, just for fun.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.320]   Let's see.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.320]   You're kidding.
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:24.320]   You're going to do this right now to MerlinMan.com/MacBreakPix.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:28.320]   Okay, so here's me.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:33.120]   It's actually not a Mac breakpix.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.280]   It's MacPix.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:39.760]   So I just did that.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:40.960]   I'm hitting web post.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.960]   I'm hitting the MacPix.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.680]   Okay, so he's been working.
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.680]   Boy, you've been working.
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:46.680]   Look at all this stuff you've been posting.
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.680]   Geez.
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.680]   I'm typing.
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.680]   Look at that in.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.680]   And...
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.680]   Any minute now, this will refresh.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.040]   This is going to be way too big for this, but just to get the effect here.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:59.360]   Okay, and then all I got to do is go and drop this in and...
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:02.720]   So what you're saying you use expand-grabbing instead of...
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.000]   I'm for ever posting screen grabs.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.760]   It's something I'm always putting on my site on Kung Fu Grip.
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.720]   I'm always putting stuff somewhere.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.360]   Well, that's a little oversized.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.360]   But it's not...
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.360]   That's what she said.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:17.360]   I couldn't say that.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:24.560]   Is this a utility for using your existing FTP service and file sharing services?
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:29.680]   Or is it a service in and of itself?
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.280]   The tip that I'm offering is if you have a service that especially if it doesn't need
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:38.600]   her in the way that most do, it's nice to have a notional junk drawer where you can just
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:39.600]   throw stuff.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.760]   Ideally, having your own hosted junk drawer is the best because obviously if you ever decide
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:49.320]   to go with somebody different, you're not going to be screwed with all of your old
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:50.320]   URL.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.760]   So I'm taking a little bit of a risk by doing that.
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.840]   But what I love about this, I said this before, I think Skit was a pick of mine a long time
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:56.840]   ago.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:57.840]   I love Skit.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.680]   Usually it's become the lingua franca for communicating visually, right?
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.000]   Whether it's you're doing funny macros or whatever it is you're doing, you're doing
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.520]   ingo reload and it should work now.
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:07.520]   It just makes it...
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:10.720]   What I'm having that area where you can throw this stuff and then having a really easy workflow
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:15.200]   for getting anything online without what used to be a huge pain in the butt, used to be
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.680]   had to go to the command line and get all this stuff.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.920]   I really like the idea of having a junk drawer where you can throw this stuff.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:25.680]   Both expand drive and Skit are affordances for throwing stuff on the web very quickly.
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:29.440]   And I got to tell you, once you get in that habit of hitting that web post button so quickly
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:32.040]   in Skit, you're never going to look back.
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:37.440]   The days of having to have a dedicated fetch or something open, those days are open.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.440]   Is this your desktop?
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.200]   That's my desktop.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.840]   Look how clean it is.
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.920]   Look how clean his desktop is.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:45.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:46.920]   Surprise, right?
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:47.920]   Wow.
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.560]   It's just us and them.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.560]   Expand drive.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.560]   I think it's a terrific...
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.360]   Expand drive by itself is great.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.880]   Skit by itself is great.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:55.880]   I just like this.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:01.040]   I got to tell you, increasingly as I've moved away from the productivity porn stuff as a
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:05.240]   primary interest, it's becoming clearer to me that if you can figure out these low friction
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:09.400]   ways to join together little bits of functionality, everything gets so much easier.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.520]   So this basically mounts...
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.320]   It's like an eye disc, except that you can have a point anywhere.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.320]   Is that it?
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.320]   You mean expand drive?
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:24.840]   So if I understand what expand drive does, it essentially gives all the features of a
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:28.280]   real FTP client app into the Finder.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:33.960]   So if I install expand drive and a point or two, like say, my web server, I won't have
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:37.040]   to use transmit or arch or something like that.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.040]   I can just simply double-click on it.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.640]   Yeah, it's using Mac Fuse.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:40.640]   I don't know.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.640]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.080]   I mean, Mac Fuse is the basis for it.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:48.760]   If you're a Mac Fuse, you could string this together on your own.
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.600]   It's just that it's what I like about it, like Dropbox.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:55.000]   Dropbox is kind of something that anybody could make if they had five years to put it
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   together.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.680]   It's just that it's so polished and easy.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:58.680]   Expand drive for me.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:02.920]   To me, this is the heart of a good Mac app is I don't want to have to make my own catch-up.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.000]   Also, this reconnects automatically.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.800]   So it's basically like a Mac drive.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.800]   It amounts at login.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:11.960]   So basically when you log in, you can back to my Mac.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.400]   Let's say you want to just a quick way to get to your Mac at home.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.200]   This will come up automatically and you don't have to deal with iDISC.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.200]   So it's pretty--
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:21.160]   You could theoretically do this with iDISC, but you don't want to.
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:27.680]   I have not historically had great luck with iDISC and dependability.
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:28.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:29.680]   Okay.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:32.480]   But that's probably pilot error.
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.360]   No, I think it's not expensive.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.640]   It's like 20 bucks.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.840]   They have maybe it's a little more than that.
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:39.840]   They have a--
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:40.840]   When he does version, $40.
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:44.320]   It's just still like-- I don't understand what's going on.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.080]   Chris Pearson, you're out of your freaking mind.
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.080]   He's--
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.080]   He doesn't charge for it.
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.080]   --charging for sketch.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:52.000]   This is-- what's the name of his wonderful company that I always forget?
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   They do the comic.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   They do that awesome comic application.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   Class, K-L-A-S-Q.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.200]   I think sketch is on its own now.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.200]   Is it?
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.200]   Oh, is it really?
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.200]   But the--
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.200]   Keith Lane doesn't.
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.200]   Keith Lane doesn't.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.200]   I love it so much.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.200]   It's so great.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:08.600]   The tip inside of the tip is to revisit these things and really instead of just looking at
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:12.560]   it as porn that you have fun with for a couple minutes, think about how you can potentially
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:15.120]   alter your workflow just a little bit to remove friction.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.360]   Go into the preferences, learn what's new, learn what's there.
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.400]   And then just really work it.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:23.200]   Like, my workflow is getting, like, just simpler and simpler all the time.
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.400]   And it's a good feeling.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.400]   It's a really good feeling.
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.400]   Sketch is a blogger's dream.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.240]   I mean, if you're a blogger, having Sketch is so fantastic.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.160]   And it's just-- it's really, you know, the interface is just so well thought out.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.360]   You know, it's not just another like, oh, we can kind of grab something.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.360]   Right.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.360]   You know, it's--
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.360]   You have it on all my systems.
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.360]   Is it free?
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.360]   No, you pay for the application.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.360]   But the storage is free.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.360]   Or--
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:46.360]   It's free.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.360]   I don't--
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.360]   Sketch is free too?
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.360]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.360]   For Expand Drive?
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:51.360]   Spand Drive is not free.
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:52.360]   Expand Drive is 40 bucks.
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.360]   Yep.
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.360]   Yep.
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.360]   Yep.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.360]   Sketch is, to my knowledge, still-- I don't know if they're still calling it beta, but last
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.360]   time I checked, I mean, everybody's like, come on.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:59.360]   Let me pay for this.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.360]   I want this to be here forever.
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.360]   It's so cool.
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.560]   I think it works with S3.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:05.760]   I wish it did.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:06.760]   Expand Drive does.
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:07.760]   It says it does.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.560]   Expand Drive does, but I don't think Sketch--
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:10.560]   Oh, I see.
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:11.560]   You want to just use their storage.
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.560]   Their storage is free, right?
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:14.560]   Sketch is--
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:15.560]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:16.560]   Sketch.
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:17.560]   That's insane.
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.560]   It makes no sense at all.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.160]   And now what's neat is the other nice thing with this-- and sorry to be all over the place,
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:25.560]   but WordPress now-- I'm not doing so much with WordPress anymore, but when I did inbox
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:29.160]   zero, I installed-- there's a plug-in you can get for WordPress now that will work with
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.160]   S3.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.760]   If you want to get out of that ghetto of being stuck on your shared server somewhere, it's
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.480]   really easy to have all your graphics and all your thumbnails and everything actually
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:42.080]   go onto your own S3, which is not too costly if you're just kind of like a mid-level blogger.
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:44.960]   S3 does get expensive at scale, but it's not too--
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:45.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:46.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:47.960]   It's always like, "Oh, S3's so cheap."
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:48.960]   But I'm like--
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:49.960]   Yeah, start using it.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:50.960]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:51.960]   All right.
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:52.960]   Good.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.360]   We're going to add two then to your list, Mr. Merlin Man.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:59.880]   You've got Sketch and Expand Drive, so you're pulling ahead, but Alex Lindsey's not far behind
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.880]   with his sit-up straight pick of--
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:02.880]   Okay, okay.
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:03.880]   A moment.
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:04.880]   I got one.
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:05.880]   I got one.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:10.400]   All right, so I needed a new-- I know that this is really more of a Merlin pick except
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.480]   that he's picked many of these, and-- but I needed something specific.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:17.640]   I need to be able to take notes, and here's what I needed to do is I was walking around
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:24.000]   through PMA yesterday, so this was-- or the last two days of the Photographic Marketing
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.560]   Association, so it's like the Mac world of photos.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:31.280]   And I needed to prep all my shows, and what I wanted to be able to do is take pictures
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:35.560]   of the-- of what I was interested in covering, and then write some notes.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.720]   "Oh, you know, I like this part.
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:37.720]   I like this part.
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:38.720]   I like this part."
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:41.960]   I didn't want to ever know it because I didn't-- the connection was spotty.
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:42.960]   You know, so I just--
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:43.960]   Really?
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.760]   I wanted it to be-- I wanted it to all be local.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.440]   I just wanted everything to live on my iPhone.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.760]   I didn't want it to go to a web page.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.800]   I didn't want to try to connect to anything.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:58.120]   I just wanted to-- you know, in a convention center, the Wi-Fi, and the 3G SMS.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:05.040]   So I just wanted it to be fast, and I found-- there's a nap for that, evidently.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:09.000]   It's called PhotoNote, and PhotoNote is simple.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.720]   It is not complicated.
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:12.280]   It doesn't do a lot of things.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:15.720]   What it does is I can take a picture, and I can type a note.
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.680]   I can put it into categories of things that I want to do.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:23.240]   I can mail that note to myself if I want to send it out.
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.240]   I didn't really need to do that for what I was doing.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.920]   I just needed to stack them up somewhere.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:30.760]   And it was just-- it made a huge difference to give you an idea.
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:36.000]   I mean, usually, it's an all-day process, and I might shoot 15 or 20 episodes.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.320]   And we shot 27 episodes in like three hours.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.880]   And the reason was, is because of this-- this application.
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:46.200]   Me sitting there being able to take pictures for a day, and really type in what I was
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.640]   interested in, why I thought it was important, what
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:52.520]   I was going to want to say when the camera came back up.
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:55.120]   And I just-- I couldn't have any overhead.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.520]   I couldn't have it be complicated.
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:57.760]   I couldn't have it do anything else.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.960]   So that's your teleprompter.
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.000]   You got in your hand there.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:00.320]   It was.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.480]   Well, I look down at it.
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.560]   I look down at it for a second.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:03.640]   I go, OK, I'm ready.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:04.280]   And then we--
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:04.760]   [SIGHS]
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:05.520]   --re-and-a-ween record it.
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:06.960]   And then I look down again.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.400]   And I used it to build a map.
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.720]   We built a map, and I took notes and organized it.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:15.040]   But it just-- I didn't want it to do anything more than what this was doing.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.800]   Evernote and a lot of other ones do a lot of great things.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:21.080]   And they do more than I needed for what I was doing.
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.440]   So any photo note is my next pick?
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.840]   Photo note.
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.080]   It's 99 cents or something.
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.800]   It's $1, $2 or something.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.560]   Now I have to say Evernote does now have offline syncing.
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.520]   You can sync all your notes.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:33.480]   All I know is here are the things.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:34.560]   I downloaded Evernote.
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.160]   And I started-- it was one of those things.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.480]   I keep getting this position that I'm defending Evernote.
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.000]   I banged on it.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.720]   What happened was is that I have to admit
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.680]   that I'm pretty picky about when I'm in a rush
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:44.680]   to try to figure something out.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.120]   I open up the application.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.920]   And if I can't figure out how I'm going to do what I need to do with it,
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:53.440]   especially for a note-taking application, if I can't figure it out in 60 seconds,
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.600]   I'm really like, OK, I'll move on to the next one.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.320]   Because I downloaded four of them.
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.080]   And then photo note was the first one that I just opened up.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.240]   And I went, oh, yeah, yeah, this does exactly what I need.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.280]   There were a couple other ones.
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.840]   Evernote probably does a better job at a lot of things.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.960]   But this one, I figured out super fast.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.880]   And I was walking around taking pictures.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.600]   And it saved my little butt.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:12.560]   It's for photographers.
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:13.440]   And I really don't think--
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.400]   Evernote's one of those apps.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.440]   I like it a lot.
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:21.040]   It's grown in a way that did not go the direction that I needed it to go.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:25.160]   But I would highly recommend it to people to try, because it's just a terrific app.
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:29.440]   And what's neat about it, though, is it-- well, neat or downside is like Devin
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.560]   Think, for example.
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.160]   It's really more of a lifestyle than ever because--
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:32.640]   Right.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:34.480]   Devin Think-- it's way beyond me.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:35.480]   So I understand what you're saying.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:39.000]   I feel that way now about notational velocity, which I probably should do.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.520]   Man, if I could do anything with real, like adding tags and stuff,
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.600]   no question, text mate.
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:48.400]   Because I mean, text mate does stuff like you select something
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.280]   and then hit a bracket.
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.480]   And it puts it in brackets without you having to type it.
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.160]   Like it's an editor's dream.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:57.240]   But all I'm trying to say is that for all of these apps, again, with workflow,
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:00.680]   you've got to find-- like Alex says, some of these are worth learning.
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.960]   But a lot of them really are like, stop what you're doing for six months
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.680]   to learn how to use this.
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.080]   I don't find that with Evernote.
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:07.800]   I really don't.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:08.880]   I'm excited to mean to apply that.
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.200]   It is a great app.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.760]   It's just not kind of for me.
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:15.800]   You just don't have Evernote shape hole in your heart.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:20.440]   And what I would say is that I had a very, very, very specific need
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:21.520]   that I needed it to fill.
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:24.920]   And this filled it perfectly.
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:28.280]   This is from Banana's design.
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.960]   What's your favorite use case for Evernote, Leo?
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:30.840]   I'm just curious.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.480]   Because the iPhone, I suppose I was talking to Alex the other day,
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:37.480]   the wonderful-- one of the kind of evangelists for the app, I think, that's his role.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.840]   But what's your favorite use case?
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:39.640]   What's your favorite use case?
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:41.720]   Well, there's almost an infinite number of use cases.
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:42.560]   I can give you a few.
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:47.200]   I'm yesterday buying Bordeaux in Costco.
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.840]   They have a new shipment of Bordeaux in our no-vada Costco.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.240]   It's a--
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:52.960]   Costco is having a new shipment.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:53.360]   And they're good.
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:54.200]   A box opening.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:56.120]   So we had about eight bottles of Bordeaux.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.360]   And we tested one.
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:01.080]   And I took-- so what I did is I take a picture of the label in Evernote.
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.280]   We make some notes about what we thought of it.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.960]   Evernote, by the way, does do text to--
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.800]   I mean, picture to text, which is very handy.
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.440]   I've done that before with a menu item.
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:14.600]   If I want to remember a menu item, I do it all the time.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.760]   For instance, I have serial numbers on the back of the disk that
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.360]   came with my new NIC software, though I bought out the NIC
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.240]   collection for Aperture.
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.240]   They're all on the back there.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.640]   There's like eight serial numbers.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:25.480]   I take a picture of it.
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:28.720]   It's now in my Evernote and transcribed.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.720]   If I park, I take a picture of where I parked,
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:32.000]   so I can find it again.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.840]   I can record audio as well as text--
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:34.320]   Deaf and live stuff.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:35.560]   --as well as picture.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:36.160]   And it's your lifestyle.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:37.080]   It's all lifestyle.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:40.400]   Keep all my serial numbers and passwords in it encrypted.
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.400]   It is the ultimate notebook.
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:44.960]   And because it works on the iPhone, also on the Android--
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:47.440]   I use two phones, mostly the Nexus 1,
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.600]   but it's on the Nexus 1.
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:49.480]   It's on the iPhone.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.120]   It's on my Mac.
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:51.640]   It's on my Windows PC.
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:52.320]   It's all synced.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:54.880]   It's also available on the web at any time.
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:58.800]   The new iPhone update downloads and stores the notes
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.000]   if you ask it to on your--
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.200]   so if you're disconnected, your notes are still there.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.040]   And when you're taking notes, it'll store them low-pitched.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.000]   Yeah, of course.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.600]   And then upload them as possible.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.320]   So everything that that photo note does, I think--
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.320]   I mean, you could take a picture.
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.920]   And it stays in there.
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:14.400]   Plus, it does text transcription.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:14.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:16.840]   Why do I keep getting in this position of defending every note?
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:17.360]   No, I got it.
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:17.840]   But you're right.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:18.360]   It's a good app.
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:19.640]   You know what else is great about it?
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:21.880]   Is it remembers where you captured it?
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:22.280]   It does.
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.840]   It puts geographic location in, absolutely.
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:25.640]   Yeah.
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.800]   Like, did you ever notice that there's a smart group
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.040]   or whatever they call it, where you can say,
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.040]   like you can say, like, show me everything?
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:34.200]   You know, so basically it's got this way of whittling down
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:35.600]   based on what text it's like.
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:37.720]   Unlike the Jimbo, they have folders,
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.200]   which is something that always bugged me.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.760]   But Rich just refused to put folders in the Jimbo.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:45.600]   The bare bones guys are kind of adamant sometimes.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:47.360]   They just said, no folders are a bad idea.
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:48.720]   You should-- it's too hierarchical.
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:49.440]   So you can't do it.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:50.600]   Out of scope, out of scope.
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.000]   You can save searches.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.920]   As you said, you have attributes.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:54.280]   So you--
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:55.600]   It should show me, like, by location.
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.000]   You can even say-- you can say things like,
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.040]   show me by location.
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:59.920]   And then, you know, I got to tell you,
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:02.080]   Alex, if you hear this, you probably will,
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:03.920]   because you follow these things.
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:05.880]   The thing that would get me to look at Evernote again
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:09.520]   for one use case is if the text that it captured
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:12.560]   from photos, which is like magic,
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.040]   if that was captured into something
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.200]   besides a search field.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.560]   Right now, it's only searchable.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.880]   It's not exposed as text.
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.080]   No, that's exactly right.
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:20.640]   That would be huge.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.560]   Like, I took a-- we went to--
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.240]   I'd say, speaking of wine, we were in Noe Valley.
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:25.000]   We got to dinner.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.760]   And this really good wine had a funny label
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.000]   to say, Peter Sellers is the name of the vineyard.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.160]   So I took a picture of it.
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:33.280]   See, I would say in the past, oh, I'll remember that.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.840]   And then I get home and I'd say, Richard Burton,
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:36.880]   you make a discount for it.
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:39.400]   How many pieces of paper do you have in your house
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:40.200]   with seven digits on it?
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:41.200]   Exactly.
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:41.680]   Exactly.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:44.680]   So, I mean, this is really, really handy.
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:48.000]   Anyway, that's not-- I guess that'll be my pick.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.120]   Since you did photo note, which is a 99 cent application
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:55.680]   for the iPhone, I'll do Evernote, which is free everywhere,
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.480]   although you can do Evernote Pro, which gives you more storage,
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:59.880]   faster updates, and so forth.
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.880]   So I think it's worth taking a look at all of these.
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:04.680]   I have practically every note application on there.
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:05.160]   Right.
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.560]   Because I'm looking at all of them.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:08.200]   I put simple note on there because you recommended it
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:09.040]   Merlin for the sinking.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:13.000]   And I think that's-- for that, that's very handy.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.040]   But to me, Evernote is just such a winner.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.240]   If you don't have Evernote, you should really be looking at it.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:20.160]   Anyway.
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.480]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.040]   We are doing our picks.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:23.280]   This is fun.
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:27.080]   We are now 12 down and only 38 to go.
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:27.760]   28 to go.
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.600]   Oh, we're almost home.
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:30.600]   I don't think we're getting--
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.200]   We're in a different shape because the lightning round is
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:32.720]   coming up.
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:33.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.120]   We are going to do a lightning round.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:35.680]   Next lightning round.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:36.160]   You know what?
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.000]   Next round?
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:37.440]   Lightning round.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:37.920]   Lightning round.
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:38.880]   What do you say?
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.480]   I didn't get to do a big, like, mouthy, offy pick.
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:42.080]   Come on.
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:43.480]   Don't start the lightning round before we--
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:43.480]   Wait a minute.
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:44.520]   Did we skip Andy?
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:45.520]   No, Andy.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:46.840]   Do your mouthy, offy.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:47.840]   Do your mouthy, offy.
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:51.160]   He's got a different hat on, so he's a little bit more edgy
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:51.520]   about it.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:52.560]   He's got his Yankees head.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:53.720]   No, no to us.
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:54.720]   No, no, no.
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.720]   No, no, no.
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.720]   No, no.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.400]   All right, Mr. House of Ruth built.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.360]   What do you got?
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:02.360]   Well, let's see.
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.320]   That's so mean.
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:06.000]   It's just-- that's like low.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.240]   I'm rendered speechless, but I shall soldier on.
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:12.840]   If the Red Sox fan, I'm used to suffering for a while,
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.280]   and then somebody putting it past me
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:16.640]   for the purposes of commerce.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:16.960]   Well done, sir.
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:20.960]   Anyway, let's see, because I'm going through all my tabs.
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:22.800]   You're trying to figure out which one to pick,
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.560]   because I know we're running short.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:25.960]   No, no, no.
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:26.440]   Oh, I see.
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.240]   I do prioritize.
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:29.120]   Yes.
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.160]   OK, I got two more-- two long ones to do,
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:34.200]   but I'll do one that's-- one is an oldie but a goodie
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.560]   that I like talking about.
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:37.880]   I'll go with one I haven't recommended before,
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:41.840]   because I've started-- my favorite iPhone game
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:44.680]   is now a drawing program called Layers.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:45.480]   No, it's not a game.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.320]   It is a drawing program.
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:50.520]   I love the fact that a really good creative app
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:52.480]   for the iPhone, by virtue of the fact
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:55.240]   that the iPhone is always with me, and it's so easy to use,
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:58.680]   allows me to be creative during those times of--
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:01.280]   those short moments where you just have five or 10 minutes
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:04.120]   to fill, and you can either-- you can listen to music,
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:06.080]   you can read something, you can consume media,
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:07.760]   or you can create something.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:09.560]   Layers is a terrific drawing program
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.680]   that works the way that a lot of the other iPhone
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.800]   drawing programs do.
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:16.280]   You get tool palettes, you get-- you can draw on the screen,
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:17.880]   do all that kind of cool stuff.
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.320]   Layers is cool, because as the name implies,
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:22.360]   it lets you draw in layers.
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:24.880]   So what I keep doing is that I'll just be--
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:27.760]   I'll be-- I was in Coffee Square the other day,
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:30.240]   and it was like 45 minutes before my train home.
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:33.000]   And so I just took a picture of the John Hancock Tower
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.680]   in Trinity Church, and I just simply sat in that bench
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:37.160]   in front of the Boston Public Library
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:38.800]   and started drawing on top of it,
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.880]   and the coloring in parts of the building,
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:43.320]   and drawing in people who are a little dog that
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:45.160]   was on the sidewalk in front of there,
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.560]   each one giving it to its own little layer.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.960]   And before long, just by simply tracing over the photo
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:52.240]   that I take, and I had this really, really cool little piece
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:54.320]   of artwork, or you can do cool things
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:59.720]   like erase parts of buildings, and take funny pictures
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:02.000]   of other people who look like they're maybe attacking
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.160]   the building like Godzilla, but that other layer,
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.520]   that reorder the layers so that it'll set
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:07.360]   they're coming in from the sea.
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:10.320]   It really allows you to do a lot of really cool, fun things.
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.880]   It only occurred you at the time,
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:14.720]   because you have a half hour until your train arrives.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:17.200]   It has some slick extra features.
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:20.040]   It also works with Photoshop so that if you export it
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:22.160]   as a Photoshop file, it will export,
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:24.960]   and it will retain your layer information
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:27.320]   so you can take this, then keep building upon it.
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:30.440]   When you get back to your MacBook or your desktop,
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:33.040]   I'm not sure how good it is as a serious drawing tool,
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:36.840]   but again, as a way to fill those 20 minutes that you have,
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:40.880]   and be done, but just be noodling away at something,
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.400]   and only when you're done, do you realize that,
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.560]   wow, I actually have something on my iPhone right now
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:47.640]   that's really cool, that didn't exist there 20 minutes ago.
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.160]   It pays for itself pretty quickly.
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:54.040]   - So there are other drawing apps on the iPhone.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.640]   In fact, Steve showed one on the iPad.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:57.920]   Is this the one he showed on the iPad?
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:58.800]   Is this the one that was done
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.760]   that the New Yorker cover was done on?
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:02.920]   - No, I think that's a problem called brushes.
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:03.760]   - Brushes, that's right.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.360]   - The famous famous famous artist type program.
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.760]   And that's also another good pick,
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:12.320]   if you just, for just, I wanna do a little bit of drawing,
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:14.680]   or even better, I've taken a picture of something.
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.680]   I wanna draw a note on it before I send it on
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:18.720]   to someplace else that they know what I'm talking about,
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:21.040]   that me, I'm at this building over here,
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.760]   and when you get off the train,
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:25.000]   go to this big tower right here.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.800]   That's very handy for that sort of stuff.
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:29.280]   What I like about layers is that it makes it a lot easier
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.840]   if you're not very good as an artist,
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:34.800]   because it allows you to keep the,
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.160]   if you wanna enhance an existing photo,
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:38.840]   it lets you keep that photo intact
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:42.320]   on a rearward layer and just draw on top of it.
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:43.160]   Then when you screw it up,
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:45.800]   you can simply erase the stuff that you add
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:48.600]   and you still have what was behind, perfectly good.
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:51.680]   Or you do some drawing on one part of it, that's great.
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:53.480]   So I'm gonna keep that, I'm gonna start a brand new layer
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:55.440]   so that whatever I do after this won't screw up
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.480]   the good part that I just created.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:00.680]   If you have very little talent or very few guts,
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:04.000]   it's a very, very safe drawing program to play with.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.480]   - Another good one in that same vein
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:09.400]   is Sketchbook Mobile from Autodesk.
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:11.280]   They took, they had a Sketchbook application
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:16.040]   that was an application that was for the desktop,
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:20.440]   and they basically kinda squeezed it into the iPhone.
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:22.080]   And it's an experiment on their part,
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:23.960]   but it's done really well.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:24.960]   So it's not another one.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:25.800]   - There's some good stuff,
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:26.640]   it's amazing what they're doing for this.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.360]   - It's a lot of fun, and it's gonna be so much fun
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:29.880]   with the iPad, you know?
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.920]   It's like, you know, I asked someone at Autodesk,
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:34.840]   I was like, so-- - So wait, are you gonna,
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:36.280]   are you gonna make Sketch,
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:39.000]   what are you doing for the iPad with Sketchbook Mobile?
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.760]   And they're like, we can either confirm or deny anything,
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:45.240]   but of course they're like the big smile, like we can't wait.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:48.320]   - So, but they didn't say anything, but said enough.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.800]   It's pretty, this is a very sweet application I have to say.
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:51.880]   I'm looking like in this layer,
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:54.560]   so it's what you can do with this, pretty cool.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.840]   All right, let us, and mine was Evernote.
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:58.000]   I went out of order.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.280]   - And I added another one, when no one was looking.
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:01.280]   - Yeah, he's sneak.
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:02.280]   (laughing)
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:03.720]   - He's a sneak picker. - That's how I do it.
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:04.800]   - You're a sneak picker.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:05.640]   I know you're tight.
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:07.480]   - Ash, well you snuck the Evernote in, so I--
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:09.080]   - Well, I did that in order, but I didn't really--
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:12.680]   - I had to defend Evernote against the onslaught.
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:14.320]   (laughing)
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:18.880]   - All right, let's quickly get our lightning round ready folks,
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:20.160]   and we are gonna move on.
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:21.320]   But before we do, I do wanna mention
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:23.640]   in our friends at squarespace.com.
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:25.560]   This really is a Mac pick in some ways.
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:27.720]   I mean, Squarespace is such a great place
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:30.200]   to bring your website, not blogging software.
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:33.760]   It's really, kind of a pains to say this is really
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:37.720]   a hosting plus software content management system
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:38.880]   that makes it easy to do any kind of website.
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:40.560]   - Anybody, it's crazy. - It's crazy.
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:42.040]   - Yeah. - It's totally crazy.
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:43.600]   - Are you, Merlin, are you--
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:44.440]   - You were talking about-- - Now, that page
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:45.920]   that you're reloading is on Squarespace.
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:49.680]   - Is it, you know, it's funny because we brought Gazelle down
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:53.400]   with the last ad, but MerlinMan.com.
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:54.400]   You can't take it down.
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:55.240]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:57.080]   - Yeah, all those five or six people looking are--
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.760]   - No, everybody's going, it's the same people
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:01.480]   are going to MacPixes or going to the Gazelle--
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:03.040]   - There's like this horde watching, you know,
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:06.160]   the horde of live viewers that just simply attack
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:07.320]   every site that we talk about.
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:08.160]   - Can't bring it down.
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:09.080]   - It's a good test.
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:10.400]   Peter Sellers.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.240]   (laughing)
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:12.080]   - It's like, cool.
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.480]   - I love that.
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:14.360]   So this is Squarespace.
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.720]   Now, see, I would have never known
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:18.040]   because this looks just like, say, a WordPress blog.
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:21.120]   I mean, you chose a very simple template
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:22.800]   and you didn't dress it up much.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.480]   And I don't see anywhere where it says Squarespace,
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:26.800]   which by the way is another nice thing about Squarespace.
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:27.880]   You don't have to announce to the world
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:29.400]   you're using Squarespace, but you'll know
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:33.400]   because even when the site gets mentioned on MacBreak Weekly
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:37.320]   and 2,000 live viewers go there, it's, look how fast it looks.
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:38.800]   - Well, and like, you know, okay, so first of all,
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:41.000]   again, now that we're all worried about disclosure,
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   I must disclose that they're giving me a free account.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.240]   But like, holy crap, I mean, this is another step away
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:49.880]   from the days when you had to learn Pearl and Apache
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:51.440]   to have a website, right?
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:54.560]   It used to be like, you really had, and like, this is,
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:56.840]   at this point to me, there's like very little ramp up.
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.440]   And yeah, like, let's give you an example.
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:02.080]   Okay, all I gotta do, okay, like, go reload the site.
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:03.680]   - You're kidding, you've already changed the site?
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.080]   - Well, like, just go reload it.
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:07.040]   - He's changed the site, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:07.880]   Here we go.
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:09.520]   Yeah, it looks just like Google Buzz, I know that's not it.
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:10.840]   - Wait, hang on, did that work?
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:13.240]   - I thought I changed the template.
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:14.640]   I'm not very good at this stuff.
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:15.800]   Switch templates, that's why.
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:17.160]   But no, all these great little templates
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.480]   already built in, all your stuff is populated.
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:23.120]   You don't have to learn about WordPress hooks.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:24.000]   And nothing gets WordPress,
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.920]   it's just that that's the pain of my existence.
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.720]   But like, anyway, so go and reload now.
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:29.360]   - It was too much trouble, like WordPress
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:31.080]   and all the other ones were just too much trouble for me.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:33.520]   And now I sit there, I talk with Carolyn,
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:36.040]   with Carolyn, who works on the site with me.
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:37.600]   And the two of us can be sitting on Skype,
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:39.320]   talking about it and making changes.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:41.120]   - He changed it all.
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:42.480]   - Yeah, you like that.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:43.920]   - I, yeah.
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:44.760]   I mean, but that's--
[00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:45.600]   - Let's try another one.
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:47.440]   Here we go, this one's really pretty, let's do this one.
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:49.040]   - See, the other thing of course is,
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:50.680]   these are stock templates, but then you can drag
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:51.720]   and drop the borders in there.
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:53.040]   - Well, this is where it gets sexy.
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:54.640]   And this is something that,
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:55.600]   I'm trying to reloading it again,
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:56.440]   I'm a little more girly now.
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:58.800]   - Again, all right, he's made it more girly.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.600]   All right, let's do a hard review.
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:02.400]   - But what I love about is that you can override anything.
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:04.040]   Like if you want, you can go in and say,
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:05.960]   "Hey, I don't know, what did that work?"
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:07.400]   You can go in and make whatever you want.
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:09.720]   If you want to go disable all of the style sheets,
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:10.560]   you can do that.
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:11.400]   - Right.
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:12.240]   - Anyway, I don't--
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:14.160]   - CSS is supported, JavaScript is supported.
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:18.360]   Some great tools for measuring your traffic,
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:19.920]   incredible stats tools.
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:22.400]   The best iPhone app for blogging ever written,
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.960]   just spectacular, I'm gonna go on and on.
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:25.400]   Look, try it free right now,
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:28.320]   go to squarespace.com/macbreak.
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:29.920]   And you'll get 10% off if you decide to buy,
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:31.920]   start at $8 a month, it's very affordable.
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.400]   Really, this is the place to go,
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:36.120]   even if you just like want to do your first website.
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:37.300]   'Cause it includes the hosting,
[00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:39.080]   includes the domain, includes--
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:40.800]   - And it works with XMLRPC.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:42.600]   I mean, you can set it up so it's the additional--
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:44.040]   - Oh, it's completely buzzword compliant.
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:46.240]   - You can give a copy of Mars editor, Ecto,
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:47.240]   and they're good to go.
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:48.840]   They don't ever have to touch the code,
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.960]   which is, I think, a nice plus.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:52.120]   - Yeah.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:54.320]   Squarespace.com/macbreak.
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:56.160]   We thank them so much for their support of our show,
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:58.880]   Mac Break Weekly, and they're doing something
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:01.040]   really nice for Twitch, which I don't know if I should say
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:03.840]   yet, but they're being very generous to us.
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:04.680]   Not website.
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:06.760]   I'm gonna move the tech guy website over to Squarespace.
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:08.560]   I finally decide I give up.
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:09.560]   (laughing)
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:10.480]   I've been fighting it.
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:12.480]   I've been fighting it, but they just can't run
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:13.780]   on a wiki anymore.
[00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:17.120]   They're gonna give us some office space in New York.
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:18.280]   - What?
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:20.280]   - The new show.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:21.840]   Which I haven't really announced yet.
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:23.240]   - What's your own?
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:24.080]   - Yeah.
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:24.960]   - Gosh, you're busy, Leo.
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:26.440]   - Well, we want to do a show.
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:28.840]   I'll say it now, we want to do a morning show.
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:31.440]   - Oh, I want to do that with you look nice today.
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:32.920]   I'm so jealous, that's such a good idea.
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:34.440]   - Well, you could do it, but we'd love to be part
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.280]   of that.
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:36.840]   That's the point is we're all.
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:38.720]   - Who has, who has, who, you know?
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:41.400]   - I just want to audition because I'm capable of
[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:44.800]   saying interesting things by holding a coffee cup.
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:46.480]   Just like this, but then saying,
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.480]   so, it looked like we're with Nick Nolte.
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:49.480]   (laughing)
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:51.560]   - Andy, Andy, how was your weekend?
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:54.560]   Did you get a chance to see that stuff that was going on?
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:55.920]   I'm telling you, Congress.
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:56.760]   (laughing)
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:58.240]   - See, I got caught on a morning show.
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:59.560]   - I'm on a morning show.
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:01.320]   - They're a big capital.
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:02.880]   - I always thought about that social light
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:04.560]   and her antics, what about that?
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:05.400]   - I was thinking it would be--
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.480]   - Yes, he's very wealthy.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:10.160]   - It would be that, but it would be intelligent.
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:12.560]   So it was kind of crazy, crazy, I know.
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:15.040]   And kind of geeky, it'd be about geek stuff as well.
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:16.280]   'Cause people get up, I get up in the morning,
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:17.480]   I look at Twitter, I look at Buzz,
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:18.720]   I look at front feed Facebook.
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:20.040]   I want to see what did I miss,
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:21.720]   what's going on, what are my friends talking about?
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.200]   We want to, yeah, of course you're all going to play,
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.040]   I hope.
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.680]   - Yes, who's, you can get on like a famous--
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:27.520]   - I'm nearby, I can walk over.
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:30.080]   - We're looking desperately for a famous host.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:31.600]   Now it doesn't have to be famous, but somebody,
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:33.200]   it's all going to depend on who can carry it.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.680]   I'll probably move out to New York for a month
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:35.840]   just to get it started.
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:39.040]   But we want to do money, this is why it's going to be hard.
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:40.120]   We're going to do money through Friday,
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:41.720]   six to nine AM East Coast time,
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:42.840]   repeat it on the West Coast,
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:44.280]   that's why it has to be on the East Coast,
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:46.560]   six to nine East Coast time.
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:48.800]   And the point is that we are on every portable platform now,
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:51.360]   we're as good as radio because we're on every phone,
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:53.080]   on every, you know, anywhere you want to be.
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:56.200]   So you can wake up to us, take a shower with us
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:58.400]   on your squeeze box.
[00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:02.800]   You can get-- (laughing)
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:04.320]   - A shower on your squeeze box.
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.360]   - A shower, squeeze box, bye.
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.640]   - You know what, we can do a special section.
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:09.960]   You know, it's at 733.
[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:11.920]   - It's shower time, everyone go take a shower.
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:14.080]   - Squeeze box, shower time with Andy Nocko.
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:16.480]   - We've got a red egg on, squeeze our shower box.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:17.320]   Come on, everybody.
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:18.560]   - Andy, if we could Skype to you
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:21.280]   and you're naked from the waist up in the shower
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:24.560]   and you do a bit, I think it's going to be fantastic.
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:25.920]   - We'll have a PayPal account,
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:28.320]   and the more money comes in, the more I read rest.
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:30.520]   - There you go, they pay you to get this.
[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:31.520]   - That was always, I'll be up like this.
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:33.400]   - You see the potential here, you see what I'm saying?
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:34.520]   - It's there. - You see what I'm saying?
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:35.560]   And we've already got-- - If I've got
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:36.840]   a license to print money, my God. - It is a license
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:38.480]   to print money, we've already got two sponsors
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:40.040]   very interested in it.
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:42.600]   And Squarespace, this came up because Squarespace,
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:44.240]   we asked Squarespace, they moved into a,
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:45.280]   or they're moving to a new facility
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:47.240]   and they have got a long lease on their old one
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:49.880]   and I said, well, we'd love to have a little--
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:51.040]   - That's awesome. - studio in there.
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:54.240]   We'll give you Squarespace morning show if you want.
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:55.080]   - Right.
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:56.360]   - And so that's, yeah.
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.320]   And I think being in New York is good because there's a lot
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:00.920]   of talent out there on the East Coast, I hear.
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:05.200]   - You could do it in London and it'll be the middle of the day.
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:06.200]   - Yeah. - No, it won't.
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:07.880]   It's the other way around.
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:08.960]   - Oh, in London it would be like the middle of the day.
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:11.600]   - Oh, London, you could do that at about two o'clock
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:12.720]   in the afternoon. - Yeah, be the London
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:13.920]   midday show for them.
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:14.760]   - Yeah.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:17.680]   - Anyway, they take, I don't think they take showers
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:18.880]   in the morning anyway in England.
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:20.480]   - Ooh, it's too cold.
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:22.000]   - I'm gonna stay away from that one.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.840]   - Let us move on, it is now our lightning round.
[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:26.160]   - Okay.
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:30.320]   - Wow, so you're gonna get, I'm not gonna do a timer.
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:33.240]   By the way, we had a sound effect set up for if anybody
[00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:35.920]   duplicated and nobody so far has duplicated.
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:38.840]   I keep waiting 'cause we have a very divergent.
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:41.920]   (dramatic music)
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:43.200]   We're waiting for the duplicate.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:46.360]   So let's start with "Merly Man Lightning Round" timer.
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:47.440]   - Okay, this is something I love.
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:49.520]   This is not specifically maxed, but I think it's amazing.
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:50.760]   I don't know if you guys can see this.
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:52.280]   This is an SD card. - Yes.
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:55.200]   - It's a four gigabyte SD card, which first of all
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:56.120]   is kind of amazing to me.
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:58.240]   It's called the Sandisk Ultra 2.
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:59.320]   And I'll tell you why I love it.
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:00.280]   I learned about this from my pal,
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:02.600]   Nevan Mergan, who works over at the wonderful Panic.
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:05.880]   What I love about it is it flips and turns into
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:09.920]   a USB drive mountable thing. - Sick.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:12.480]   - All you gotta do is turn the card and it exposes
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:15.000]   a little thing that lets you pop it right into your USB drive
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.280]   without a adapter.
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:19.560]   Should I do that again?
[00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:20.840]   - Yes.
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:22.000]   - Okay, you got a SD card.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.760]   - No, no, it's the lightning round.
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:24.960]   We got it, thank you, "Merly Man"
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:26.400]   - I thought these are an old one.
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:28.600]   - Yeah, it's actually, it's been out for two years.
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:30.040]   It's okay, no big deal.
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:30.880]   - Oh my God.
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:33.520]   - I saw it at PMA two years ago in Florida.
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:34.360]   Actually-- - You guys seen
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:36.040]   this Quicksilver program?
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:37.000]   - No, that's a really good one.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.200]   The thing is picks about picks,
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:41.640]   it doesn't have to be new because everybody,
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:43.160]   there's always gaps.
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:44.560]   A lot of people didn't know about that, Marlon.
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:46.120]   Don't feel bad.
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:47.440]   - It's pretty cheap too, like 20 bucks.
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:48.880]   - Yeah, four gigs.
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:49.960]   Have you seen, I can't wait.
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:51.800]   I forgot it on order, pre-order.
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:53.920]   The new IFI X2 Pro.
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:55.280]   - I know. - Four gigs,
[00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:56.120]   or is it eight?
[00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:57.840]   - I think it's eight gigs. - Eight gigs.
[00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:59.760]   It does raw, finally.
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.520]   - Well, that's good and bad.
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.360]   - That fills up a lot of time.
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:04.280]   I mean, you know, it's--
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.880]   - Well, if you're on Wi-Fi, it's okay.
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:07.520]   - Yeah.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.280]   - It's built in Wi-Fi into this SD card.
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:11.640]   - Yeah. - I can't wait.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:12.720]   - You know what I mean?
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:14.000]   - Really, really exciting.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.040]   Marlon, you changed your template back already.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:16.880]   - I love this. - I did, exactly.
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:17.720]   - You know what's funny?
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.040]   It updated it automatically.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.960]   I didn't have to refresh it.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.240]   The pages-- - Yeah, oh yeah.
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:23.080]   You know, I did that thing.
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:24.680]   I had to not refresh that Dushi thing
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:26.440]   where you have an auto refresh.
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:27.720]   Hey, look at me, I'm Nick Denton.
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:29.880]   Blah! (laughing)
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:30.960]   - More pages, more often. - That's how he talks.
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:31.800]   That's how he talks.
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:32.640]   - That's how he talks.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.160]   - So, but I was gonna do that as a pick,
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.520]   but I was hoping it'd be out by now,
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:36.840]   but it is not yet.
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:40.320]   IFI X2 Pro watch for it carefully.
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:41.520]   That is gonna be a--
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.360]   They were showing it at Macworld,
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.360]   and that's gonna be-- - Coming soon.
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.120]   - Yeah, any day now.
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.320]   What else is it?
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:49.520]   It's Class 6 reading, right?
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.960]   Which they need 'cause the early IFI's are real slow.
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.600]   Yeah, IFI's really slow.
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.640]   Alex Lindsey, your lightning pick.
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:56.680]   - My lightning pick is--
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:59.720]   - Many people ask us how we backup all those video files.
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:01.600]   - How do you back up all those video files?
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:03.160]   - We put them on raw drives.
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.560]   So we don't actually have enclosures for the drives.
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:07.400]   We just put them on raw drives and put them in little.
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.960]   So we use them, and we have little tape cases that we get
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.320]   from we protect them, we put them in there,
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:13.080]   and we store them like tapes.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:15.400]   And we put them on two different drives,
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:16.240]   so we have backups.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.960]   But anyway, it's a lot cheaper than actually having
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:20.440]   an enclosure for stuff you just wanna put into the shelf
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.000]   and put away somewhere.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.080]   But one of the things you need is a way to read that drive.
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.840]   And the one that we use all over the office
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:29.160]   is the newer technology Voyager Q.
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:32.600]   And so the Voyager Q, it's a great little slot.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.960]   It has ESATA, USB, FireWire.
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.000]   So it has all the connections.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.320]   You can connect it to any computer.
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.400]   If you get the ESATA, it's about as fast as being
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:40.240]   an internal drive.
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.840]   If you otherwise, it'll be a little slower based
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.160]   on however you're connecting it.
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:48.280]   But you just drop the drive in the top and you read away,
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:51.040]   and then you read right and so on and so forth.
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.240]   But if you need to do a lot of backup,
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:56.320]   the newer technology Voyager Q is the key
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:58.640]   to the whole operation, or at least one of them.
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:59.960]   - And don't forget the best part of it.
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:03.640]   They decided to be smart and realize that this is almost,
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:05.160]   there's almost no point in developing this
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:07.200]   unless we have a lever up at the front
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.480]   so that you can eject this thing
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.520]   like it's a slice of toast coming out of a toaster.
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.040]   - It's awesome.
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:12.880]   - It's levery, just go ahead.
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:15.000]   - And before you come with it, you run mounted as usual,
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.320]   but you have to press down this toaster style lever,
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.680]   go chink, so it pops out and just connects
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.600]   and you can pull it out like a pop tart.
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:24.160]   - And it works as much as the actual features of the thing
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:25.400]   which are in and sells very often.
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:28.640]   - Unfortunately, it does not cook the drive most of the time.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:31.000]   - I bet if you put like one of them sausage patties
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.840]   inside there, because the money's being
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:35.120]   in the fair and warm, there's at least five volts there.
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.600]   So you can get it nice and warm, I'm guessing.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:38.840]   - So tell me the full name again,
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:39.680]   so I can add this to our shoes.
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:42.280]   - It is the newer technology Voyager Q.
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:44.920]   QUE or--
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:45.840]   - No, no, just Q.
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.040]   - I see it, here we go.
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.720]   Okay, newer tech, Voyager.
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:55.320]   - Quad interface, Firewire, I like big hard drives.
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:57.040]   - Well, and it's just great because you just
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:00.160]   back the stuff up and you, and this was a secret
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:01.480]   that I was talking to an editor and I was like,
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:02.720]   how do you deal with it?
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.480]   We're trying to figure this out and he said,
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.800]   always put them on raw drives.
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:08.040]   And we have, I mean, we have like 200,
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.640]   we just got cases for 100 of them
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:10.640]   and we're still going through them
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:13.560]   'cause we just had them in static wrap until a week ago.
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.880]   And I think we have like 200 raw drives full of--
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:16.800]   - You see that, Rach?
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:17.640]   - Gear.
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.600]   - There you go, see?
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.160]   Now the other little quick pick on this blazing pick
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.560]   is the Weeb Attack is the only one
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.120]   that really makes a good case for those.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.360]   They look like tape cases.
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:26.640]   - It's a Weeb Attack, but it's a,
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.920]   'cause I have like what 20 or 30 hard drives
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:29.760]   just sitting up there.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.200]   - Yeah, so you need to gather a little case
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.880]   in there, little Mylar view bags.
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:34.200]   - Put them in the little cases and then you stick them
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.840]   up there and then you just look like a set bag.
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.520]   They look like a set and then you just pull them out
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:38.520]   as you need them.
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:39.600]   - And we're gonna make you use them.
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:42.120]   - And we're gonna pick, please.
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:43.560]   I'll get back to the whitening.
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.920]   I love locations from Codehackers.net
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:48.840]   'cause it solves a basic, basic problem.
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:51.400]   I need to have my book configured differently
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:52.800]   depending on what network I'm on.
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:55.760]   When I'm on my home network, it's Wild Wild West.
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:59.080]   Contact, open up all the ports, connect to all the services.
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:03:59.920]   That's great.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.920]   When I'm at the coffee shop with a Wi-Fi,
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:04.000]   I still wanna be able to access certain services,
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.800]   but I sort of trust the location.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.600]   So some things on, some things off.
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.240]   When I'm at Mac World or a trade show,
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:12.280]   I assume that everybody out there is out to get me.
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:14.400]   And so I want to turn off all my file sharing,
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:18.440]   turn off all my music sharing and all that other sort of stuff.
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:22.240]   Locations lets you, will take a snapshot of where you are
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.440]   in terms of what the network looks like,
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.960]   what servers are present and uses that to let you define
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:29.360]   what do you want this thing to do whenever you wake up
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:31.840]   your MacBook and it discovers it's on this network.
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:33.640]   It can do some really sophisticated things,
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.640]   not just turning on and off file services or closing ports,
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.240]   but also things like, as soon as I get to the office,
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:43.600]   immediately mute the volume, close down this application,
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:46.600]   open up this contact manager document,
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:49.400]   connect to this server, lock my system key chain.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:51.800]   There's a whole list of things on the fact page
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.240]   that of what you can do.
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:55.920]   It can even do things like as soon as you recognize
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.880]   that you're on your company's network,
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.480]   automatically run this Apple script
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:00.600]   or this automated workflow.
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.720]   So if the first thing you wanna do is check in
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:04.240]   on a whole bunch of different projects,
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:05.960]   the simple fact that you've lifted the lid
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:08.600]   of your MacBook and then simply gone off to get some coffee,
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:10.320]   means that by the time you come back
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.960]   about 10 minutes worth of stupid file dragging and emails
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:15.720]   and status updates have already been done for you.
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:16.840]   - That's awesome. - Yeah.
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:18.160]   - Very, very slick.
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.080]   And you can multiple, what I also like is that
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:23.040]   it also has a setting for what happens when you're on a net,
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:27.480]   when the MacBook is on a network that it does not recognize.
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:30.440]   So you can set up a state that simply says,
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:33.360]   if I've not told you about this network, assume the worst
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:35.080]   and make sure you do not expose anything
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:37.560]   'cause I do not wanna have exposed automatically,
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:40.960]   set the screensaver to lock, do all kinds of really cool things.
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.000]   It's very, very flexible, not very expensive.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.200]   And it saves me so much random clicking and dragging
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:47.360]   and setting changes every time.
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.560]   - And possible trauma. - And possible trauma.
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:54.360]   - I've left notes on people's desktops in airports,
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:56.680]   going, I'm on your desktop, I just want you to know
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:59.400]   that you're wide open and I left this note on your desktop
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:01.560]   if I had been a hacker or anyone with anything else,
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:02.680]   this would have gotten a whole lot worse.
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:06.000]   You should probably try to think about locking it down.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.040]   - I got two quick picks for you.
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.840]   They're both iPhone apps.
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:11.880]   Oh, Merlin, you're on my camera five.
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:13.880]   You're killing me here.
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:15.120]   - I don't know what's going on with my hair.
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:17.120]   I can't believe you can stop it.
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:18.880]   - Oh, if the camera five's all squeezed,
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.000]   I can't show you the iPhone app.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.200]   So I'm just gonna have to mention the two of them.
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.960]   One is I can't stop playing is words with friends.
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:27.360]   You like Scrabble?
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.320]   You like to play Scrabble?
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.040]   Don't play this, don't get this game on your iPhone
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:33.040]   because you play Scrabble like three games.
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:34.200]   - I'm already installing plants and zombies as it is.
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.200]   - Yeah, plants and zombies is just--
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.720]   - I have to get it off the iPhone.
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.640]   - Words with friends and chess with friends
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.320]   are from the same company.
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:42.560]   They're both of them, they're from New Toy.
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:44.400]   I think they're 99 cents each.
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.520]   They let you play over the network Scrabble,
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.000]   a Scrabble like game, 'cause it has its own Scrabble.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   So they changed the rules a little bit.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.640]   - There is a Scrabble, isn't there a Scrabble for the iPhone?
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:54.640]   - It probably is, but this one is just so cool
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.600]   'cause it's networked, just does a great job.
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.400]   I have five games going at once.
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:02.080]   And so you never had a loss for Scrabble action.
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:04.000]   (laughing)
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.320]   And then chess with friends is another spectacular way
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:08.480]   to find good chess plays.
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.600]   'Cause the truth is both Scrabble and chess
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:12.560]   are the kinds of games that computers don't play well.
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:13.400]   Actually they play Scrabble.
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:14.720]   - And it's no fun, if you're not playing with somebody
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.480]   who's at the right level, it's no fun.
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.720]   - The problem with Scrabble is
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:19.280]   that computer can play perfect Scrabble,
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:20.960]   and that's not good.
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:24.640]   So I prefer not to play Scrabble against computers.
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:28.400]   And chess actually is kind of the same thing.
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:30.600]   Computer can beat you every time if it's good enough.
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:33.440]   So this way you get to play real humans
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:34.800]   and they play like humans.
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:36.160]   And you're right, Merlin.
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:39.240]   If somebody warms me, I don't play Scrabble with him again.
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.880]   - Especially Scrabble, like, yeah, also like people don't know
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:43.800]   like how to leverage the dictionary, like I don't.
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:44.800]   Like I would never play Hodgman
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.600]   'cause he plays it like 10 times a day.
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:47.440]   - Right, right.
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.520]   - You wanna play somebody who's like you.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:52.040]   So you wanna play somebody who just wants to have fun
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:53.800]   while drinking coffee with each other,
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:54.640]   as opposed to the ones who just--
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:55.560]   - Exactly.
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.120]   - Somehow is turning Scrabble into Machu posturing.
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:01.080]   - If somebody knows that QI and ZA are words,
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:02.400]   I don't wanna play with them.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.240]   - What?
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:05.000]   That's like the intro to Scrabble.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:05.840]   - I know, I have to--
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:06.680]   - Oh my God, you could have--
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:09.520]   - You have Clergebo right there, several hours now.
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:11.200]   I can't think of this.
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:14.120]   - And then one more I'm gonna mention is a SMS app
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:15.120]   called What's App.
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:19.400]   This uses your 3G or Wi-Fi connection to do SMS.
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:21.600]   It adds, you know, it looks for people
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:25.040]   who are in your contact list, adds them automatically.
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:26.120]   They, if they have an iPhone,
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:27.680]   you can talk back and forth with them.
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:29.520]   I think it's a BlackBerry version as well.
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:34.520]   But it's more than SMS 'cause it's very easy text audio.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:37.480]   So you could say something and it goes in the SMS,
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.160]   pictures or video as well.
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:42.000]   So it's a very, it's a rich media kind of texting
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.160]   that doesn't use SMS messaging,
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:45.720]   it just uses the bandwidth.
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.760]   So it's a free way effectively to SMS people.
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:50.440]   And I just find a much richer conversation,
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:51.360]   it's much more fun to do.
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:54.560]   So that's What's App, W-H-A-T-S-A-P-P,
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:56.160]   and Words and Chess with Friends.
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:57.000]   Those are three.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.760]   We talk about lightning, am I fast?
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:00.320]   - That is way faster than we are.
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:02.600]   - You guys are slow-pokes.
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.360]   One more commercial than what should we do?
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:05.680]   We should do our final round, I think,
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:06.520]   'cause we've been going online.
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:07.360]   - Final round.
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:08.200]   - Final round.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:09.400]   - How about we just say the name of the product
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:10.400]   as quickly as possible?
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:11.240]   - There you go.
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:12.080]   - You could do that.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:12.920]   You could say two or three if you have a bunch.
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:14.120]   Why don't you just go through your list?
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:14.960]   That's good.
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:15.800]   - I'll prep those.
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:17.200]   - Prep those.
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.720]   Make it so number four.
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:22.400]   - I'm number four.
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:23.240]   - You're number four.
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:24.080]   - I like that.
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:24.960]   - You're on camera four.
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:26.720]   So I think of you as number four.
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:28.920]   - He's the face man of the show.
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:31.520]   - I don't have enough squeeze box camera.
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:32.960]   - He's the red shirt guy.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.920]   I want to talk a little bit about go to meeting.
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:38.240]   Go to meetings, a great site, great program,
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.080]   I should say, for people who are stuck
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:42.000]   having a phone call meetings,
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.440]   I mean, that really can really be the kiss of death.
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:46.000]   Go to meeting from Citrix is based
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.040]   on the Citrix remote access platform,
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:52.640]   which makes it very easy to set up, very easy to use.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:55.080]   And that's important, especially if you're using,
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:58.200]   you know, this product to, for instance, pitch prospects.
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:09:59.640]   The last thing you want to do is say,
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:00.840]   you're going to have to jump through 80 hoops
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:04.000]   to see my presentation for you to buy something from me.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.120]   Go to meeting is always welcome.
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:08.200]   Saves you a business trip, saves them having to,
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.040]   you know, wine and dine you.
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:12.840]   You get to work, you get to make your clothes more deals,
[01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:15.040]   you can be more effective.
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:16.800]   It's great for training, great for collaboration.
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.880]   As I said, great for sales.
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:20.520]   And I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:23.560]   You go to go to meeting.com/I've typed the wrong URL there.
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:25.040]   Macbreak, go to meeting.com.
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:28.040]   Macbreak is the URL.
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:31.600]   And you can set this up literally in a minute.
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:33.400]   And then it's ready to go.
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:35.800]   And the next time you're on the phone, go and crazy,
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.920]   try to describe something visual.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:41.080]   You merely say, hey, look, go to go to meeting.com.
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:42.280]   Here's the meeting ID.
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:43.640]   I would love to show you this.
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.520]   And they see your computer on their desktop.
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:47.880]   In real time, they see the mouse pointer move,
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:49.600]   they see slides move.
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.400]   It's just incredible.
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.320]   Now they'll see what you're talking about.
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.200]   Go to meeting.com/Macbreak.
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:58.520]   Please give it a try free for 30 days.
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.720]   I know you're going to love it.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:06.400]   All right, now I guess it's kind of wrap up with a few of them.
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:08.080]   We're just throwing names out.
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:10.200]   Is that the deal?
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:13.560]   Well, if you have a-- look, I know we prepared 10.
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:14.320]   And we've gotten to what?
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.760]   Three or four.
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:17.120]   So if you have a couple that you really
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.440]   don't want to let slide, go right ahead.
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:20.480]   Yeah, that's the idea.
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:22.160]   Yeah.
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:24.560]   Starting with you, Mirsta, more than nine.
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:25.480]   Oh, hi.
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:26.680]   Hi, internet.
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:28.320]   Shoot, I got the wrong name for this thing.
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.280]   I really like this thing called Screenlet.
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:32.080]   Screenlet.
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:34.840]   Yeah, so if you are like a big nerd
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:37.480]   about having access to screen sharing,
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:39.040]   it's usually kind of a pain to open that stuff up.
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.240]   Screenlet hangs up in your menu bar.
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:43.200]   And you pull down, and it just instantly pulls up
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.360]   anything that you have the credentials to go and log
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:47.360]   in to with the screen.
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.280]   Screenlet.
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:49.400]   I think it's what it's called.
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:50.360]   Can anybody find it?
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:50.880]   Dane.
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:51.240]   Dane.
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:51.760]   Is it out there?
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:52.480]   Is Screenlet that was--
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:55.080]   I'm seeing screenlets.org, is that it?
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.640]   I want to say it's called Screenlet.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:57.480]   Pretty sure that's right.
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:00.120]   Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.360]   no, I think that's what it's called.
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:02.640]   I'll double check that.
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:03.240]   Screenshots.
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:04.280]   Let me show you some screen shots.
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:05.480]   See if this looks familiar.
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:06.760]   Yeah, tell me my other box.
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:07.680]   I use it down.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.040]   No, this is an enhanced desktop.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:10.240]   That's not it.
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:11.320]   Yeah, check that chat room.
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:12.600]   Anybody know what I'm talking about?
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:13.280]   What am I talking about?
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:14.120]   That's called Screenlet.
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:15.200]   You know, I don't see the name of it.
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:16.280]   I just use it up in the thing.
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:17.280]   I'll sell Screenlet.
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:17.840]   You sit up in the thing.
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:18.440]   Is this the thing?
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:19.120]   OK, you look it up.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:19.800]   I'll do one more.
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:20.800]   One more quickly.
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:21.800]   It's in the thing.
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:21.800]   Yeah.
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:22.800]   Have we done pay spot?
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:23.200]   Are you guys doing it?
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:26.640]   By the way, Screen Sharing Menulate.
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:27.760]   Is that it?
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.200]   That's probably it.
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:31.560]   Let me look it up.
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:34.080]   Screen Sharing Menulate, is this it?
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.240]   It is from Climb Claim, K-L-I-E-I-M.
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:39.760]   Does it have a little like that?
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:40.760]   You know what I'll find it not posted.
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:41.120]   No, that's it.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:41.640]   I think that's it.
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:43.880]   Connect to local computers via Screen Sharing
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:44.360]   from the menu.
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.360]   Is that it?
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:46.360]   Totally, totally simple.
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:47.360]   It only does one thing.
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:48.360]   It's totally awesome.
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:49.840]   Have you guys done pay spot for iPhone?
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:50.840]   We already done that?
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:51.840]   No, mention it.
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:52.840]   It's great.
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:53.840]   OK, this must be used.
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:55.960]   This is a huge part of my workflow.
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:58.480]   One of the-- now that we've got copy and paste, the thing that sucks on the iPhone is
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:12:59.960]   you don't really have multiple clipboards.
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:02.720]   If you're trying to do anything with blogging, you know, you don't want to have to do a lot
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:03.720]   of typing.
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:05.200]   I'm still going to write this up.
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:09.200]   It's going to be a combination of my workflow that involves a simple note along with text
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.120]   expander and so on.
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.440]   The thing that's amazing is pay spot.
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:17.600]   Basically, I think it holds up to 99 buffers of pasting.
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:21.360]   What happens is I keep it down on my dock and every time I copy something I'm going to
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:24.600]   want to reuse, I hop into pay spot and automatically grabs it.
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:25.600]   I go somewhere else.
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:26.600]   I put other stuff in there.
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:29.440]   That's great, but then on top of it with pay spot, you can go in and it's got a basic
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:32.080]   set of things you can do to whatever's in that clipboard.
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:34.440]   Again, there's multiple, multiple clipboards.
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.920]   You can go in and you can take out HTML entities.
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:37.920]   You can quote stuff.
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:41.920]   But then the real sexy-- to me, this is on another level.
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:48.120]   There's an equivalent-- or there's a preference pane on your Macs, on your multiple Macs that
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:53.400]   lets you send to and from your iPhone over your Wi-Fi using pay spot.
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:57.160]   If you just want to quickly send a little chunk of text, it says easy as just opening
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:59.680]   that application and hitting a button, it sends it over.
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:03.520]   I love applications like this that tie your desktop to your phone.
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:04.520]   Totally.
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:09.400]   These are the same guys that did convert bot and wait bot.
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:12.120]   I had no need for wait bot.
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:13.920]   I just like the way it feels to use.
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:17.120]   The little clicking noises and the transitions, they're exquisitely made.
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:20.960]   I forget the name of the company, something bot.
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.920]   Tapbot.com.
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:23.920]   Tapbot.com.
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:24.920]   It's fantastic.
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:26.480]   T-A-P-B-O-T-S.com.
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:31.840]   Any final thoughts, Alex, Lindsey, some quickies you want to mention?
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:35.120]   I don't know if I've talked about this one before, but I've really gotten into using my
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:36.360]   little PED3.
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:40.560]   This is my thought out products, I think, or thought out.
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:41.960]   It's just a little stand.
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:42.960]   It seems simple.
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:44.400]   There it is.
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:46.960]   It's a little stand and I use it all the time now.
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:47.960]   It's so great.
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:49.520]   What I mostly use it for is I'm watching the news.
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:55.000]   If I want to watch streaming news, I watch a lot of either CNN or Al Jazeera English.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   Well, what's that?
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.240]   I think somebody just drove off.
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:04.800]   If I want to have it just playing in the background and now that there's actually streaming TV
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.320]   and stuff like that, it just works great.
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:08.320]   It's a great little iPod stand.
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:11.400]   You can stand next to you and have it streaming stuff while you're doing it.
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:13.360]   So, PED solid steel too.
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.360]   PED3.
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:15.360]   Then also, I just want to--
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:17.200]   That's from thoughtout.biz.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:18.720]   I want to recommend this next one.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:22.880]   It's not new, but it is going to be gone soon.
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:31.440]   The rumor is that the Canon HD40, which is the last Firewire camera that I know of,
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:35.880]   is kind of long in the two weeks and probably gone by June.
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:36.880]   It's the rumor mill.
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:40.600]   I don't know of any other ones that are out there that are like HD, like great little
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:41.600]   consumer cameras.
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:44.920]   They've all moved to USB and why that's important to you is because there's no good way to catch
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:45.920]   up.
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:50.000]   I mean, to connect your camera, get a live feed out of it other than using the HDMI.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.520]   If you're going to use the HDMI, the cheapest way to do that is a black magic intensity
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:57.960]   card and that will get you uncompressed if you're shooting green screen.
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:00.040]   Those are three all tied together really quick.
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.040]   Very good.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.040]   Very nice.
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:03.040]   Very well done.
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:06.600]   Andy, not go any ones you don't want to leave out?
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:11.520]   Well, for my last one, I guess I want to go to my pick of all picks, which is the Scrivener
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:12.520]   word processor.
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:14.520]   Yes, but totally changed.
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:18.440]   I mean, I'm a professional writer and it totally changed the way that not only that
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:23.000]   I write, but the way that I do my business, that it's the only, it's the most modern word
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.920]   processor I've ever seen is completely free of gimmicks.
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:30.120]   The only features that are in it are ones that can save you time, organize your thoughts
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:33.920]   and help you get to the end of the project faster.
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:36.520]   The more I use it, the more ambitious I get with it.
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:39.520]   I'm right in the middle of a project right now that started off with, "Hey, wouldn't
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:41.680]   it be a cool idea to try this?"
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:45.720]   All the way to sort of getting lots of little random notes together to organize them into
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:51.800]   a form, to creating like a 50 page story Bible, to creating a 30 page additional project
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:54.560]   Bible for all the people who are going to be working on this project.
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:59.400]   And now we get into the nitty gritty of actually turning this into a working observable usable
[01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:00.400]   thing.
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:04.520]   And it's all, we're asked even just a year ago with Scrivener, I might have used Omni
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:08.080]   Outliner for parts of it, another note taking tool for other parts of it.
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:12.520]   Now I just realized that it's just so easy to do it all within Scrivener.
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:17.160]   And no matter how complicated the project is, no matter how many chapters there are, it's
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:21.680]   all in one document, all in one binder that can easily be copied, easily be put onto a
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:26.440]   flash drive, easily backed up to someplace without fear that you lost the outline or
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:29.520]   you lost some research PDFs or something.
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:35.800]   I just, you know, if right now, the only thing that could, if the iPad ran Scrivener, there
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:38.120]   would be a good chance I would not need a MacBook.
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:39.960]   That's how dependent I am on this.
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:40.960]   Wow.
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:43.880]   It's just 40 dollars and I cannot praise this app enough.
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:48.240]   And anytime there's something I think it can't do or that I think I need to have another
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:52.680]   organizational tool or another writing tool in order to make it work, I realize that no,
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:55.080]   I just haven't looked at Scrivener hard enough.
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:59.680]   Just the other day, it was kind of funny because I didn't, it has one of the things that first
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:04.480]   attracted me to it was the fact that you could simply, it allowed you to have a thermometer
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:06.360]   at the bottom of your document window.
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:09.960]   If you told it to the target for this is 800 words, then it will just simply give you a
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:12.440]   thermometer that says how close you are to it.
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:16.600]   And so I, for the past two years, ever since I started testing it out with a view towards
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:21.720]   writing review, I've read, I've written and researched every single Sun-Times column in
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:24.160]   Scrivener all in the same binder.
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:27.600]   And just for fun, I clicked one button and did the word count.
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:30.560]   Just realized that, wait a minute, I could just simply say, please do a word count of
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:33.080]   all the documents inside this project binder.
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:40.360]   I realized I just surpassed something like 150,000 or 200,000 words of columns just in
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:42.760]   the past year, year and a half.
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.000]   I cannot be enthused.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.040]   So I'm so enthusiastic about Scrivener that if I ever thought about getting a tattoo,
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:53.240]   the first three would be very personal but the fourth would probably be different.
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:57.400]   Can I, can I glom on to that Andy by adding a total nerd insider, nobody cares thing
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.160]   that changed my game with Scrivener?
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:00.160]   Yes.
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:04.120]   Scrivener, first of all, it's like you could just, you could learn this thing forever.
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.080]   Like Pathfinder, like all these wonderful apps.
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:08.080]   You don't have to use everything in Scrivener.
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:11.040]   And until you really understand what you're doing, you might not want to use every single
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.040]   thing.
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:15.760]   But for one second, let me just say that for the first year, I just used it as a word
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:16.760]   process, right?
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:19.160]   I did not use any of its organizational tools.
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:21.920]   And then once I said, well, what happens if you click this and then suddenly I see,
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:26.240]   wow, everything I've written for the past year and a year and a half is now nicely organized
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:28.040]   into core boards and then outlines.
[01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:30.880]   Anyway, you can zoom, you can zoom straight in.
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:34.480]   And when you talk about like word count, you see a word count for whatever selected.
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:37.400]   So if you just want to see what are these three chapters, you can do that huge amount
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:38.400]   of power.
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.400]   Here's just, this is a nerd thing, but it's a huge nerd thing.
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.400]   I don't know about you.
[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:42.400]   I write everything in Markdown.
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:45.080]   What doesn't matter what you write it in.
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:48.600]   Just when you say that's the girls that they.
[01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:49.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:50.600]   Oh, no, that's pretty huge.
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:52.600]   I got to get a stick.
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.400]   Swipe them away.
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:55.400]   Here's the neat thing.
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.160]   So in Scrivener, you can write however you want.
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:58.160]   You can write an HTML.
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:00.600]   You could write in mostly, most people write an RTF.
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:04.080]   And this is a little hard to learn at first, but you can export as any format you want.
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.960]   Because it plays well with a lot of different forms.
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:07.040]   I do everything in Markdown.
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:13.720]   If I export an entire document from Scrivener as a Markdown file, Fletcher Penny, who's the
[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:18.960]   guy who did multi Markdown, he's very into XSLT, try and follow this.
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:21.480]   You can round trip using Markdown.
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:24.480]   You can round trip with OmniOutliner.
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:25.480]   Yes.
[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:29.920]   So now that means it writes the Markdown into OmniOutliner form and then changes made in
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:32.000]   OmniOutliner come back in as Markdown.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.760]   Let's say you're in OmniOutliner.
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:36.240]   There's already an OmniOutliner export from Markdown.
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:37.440]   So you put it out as Markdown.
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:38.840]   You got a .md file or whatever.
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:44.600]   That a .md file can now be imported into Scrivener or write into text made or whatever.
[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:52.600]   But then the sexy part is there's an OPML plugin that Fletcher has written for Markdown, where
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:56.880]   it'll take your Markdown document and export it as an OPML, which anyway, you see where
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:57.880]   this is going.
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:20:59.800]   This is, we're getting one step closer to total round trip.
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:04.720]   So if you think well in OmniOutliner or you organize well in Scrivener, you're no longer
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.040]   bound to one program.
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:09.280]   I'm not saying you should be this fiddly, but you're not stuck.
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:10.920]   You have a totally portable format.
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:14.560]   And then through stuff like XSLT and Latex, you can turn that into anything you want.
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:15.560]   Yeah.
[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:19.360]   Fletcher's got a drag and drop for turning stuff into PDFs or whatever you want.
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:20.360]   It's mind-blowing.
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:22.720]   That's something that I wish I'd mentioned.
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:27.160]   There's a feature that is so cool that it totally abstracts the idea of what you're writing
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.360]   to what the final result needs to be.
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:34.480]   So first is just for the Sun times, it used to be that I have to create one version for
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:38.880]   when I finished writing the column, I'd have to send a copy to one desk that does the web
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:42.800]   stuff and one desk that does the print edition because the editor who works on the print
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:45.400]   edition wants a text file that's marked up a certain way.
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:48.240]   The person who wants the web edition wants HTML.
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:52.400]   It used to be that I have to use these custom tags that they'd have to sort out for themselves.
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:57.040]   Now with Scrivener, all I have to do is I simply have, I burn each of them a separate
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:00.040]   copy of the exact same column formatted the way they want it.
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:03.800]   Simply go to a pop-up and say, "Please burn me a copy of this for the," it's literally
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:06.320]   called Chicago Sun Times web.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:09.840]   It's burned to exactly the specifications that they want, including, "Do you want smart
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:10.840]   quotes?
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:11.840]   Do you want dumb quotes?
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:13.880]   Do you want RTF codes?"
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:14.880]   All this sort of stuff.
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:18.700]   After I spit out that copy, I spit out a second copy with another second custom set
[01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:21.480]   of settings for the print edition.
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:26.360]   It's, again, this could be the Scrivener show, really.
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:29.200]   We should do a Scrivener show at some point.
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:30.200]   Scrivener break week.
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:34.160]   I bought Scrivener on your recommendation and I'm still using it, and barely as a word
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:36.000]   processor, so I really do need to understand it all.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000]   I just bought it right now.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000]   I just bought it right now.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000]   It's a great $40 word processor.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.680]   But the round tripping was very interesting to me.
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:44.240]   I don't know of anything that does that.
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:46.360]   That's very hard to do.
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:48.280]   That's intriguing.
[01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:50.280]   That's from literature and lattes.
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:51.880]   The guy's a novelist.
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:52.880]   The guy's a writer.
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:54.400]   He's one reason I totally respect the guy.
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:23:01.040]   One of many reasons is people are always saying, "Sir, can it run shell scripts and
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:02.040]   make tea?"
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:03.520]   He's like, "Nope, this is what it does.
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:04.520]   Does this thing?
[01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:05.520]   It already does plenty.
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:07.360]   I'm not going to add a bunch of any more bloat to it.
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:08.840]   It's got everything you need right here.
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:11.280]   You should go build your own app if you wanted to do more."
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.280]   I love the Auteur attitude.
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:14.280]   Yeah.
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:17.200]   He, by the way, also says, "Not going to do an iPad version."
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:18.360]   No interest.
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:19.360]   No interest.
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:24.080]   But that's what I don't mind because I'm sure that I could spit it out in pages format,
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:26.400]   edit it in pages, then spit it back in without any problems.
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:27.400]   I can't.
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:29.240]   I wonder how much people are going to be writing on an iPad.
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:32.000]   I'll really be curious to see how that works for you.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.120]   It just seems like it's going to be tough.
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:37.880]   That's the reason why I hack and toss my netbook because to me, the difference between
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:41.400]   a real computer and a travel computer is the ability to run Scribner.
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:46.840]   If running under, in the case of the LHP, running under a very, very tiny storage footprint
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:50.120]   was the price of being able to run macOS and running Scribner, that's good.
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:53.120]   I'll take it.
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:55.600]   One, a couple of picks from the chat room.
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:56.600]   Wait a minute.
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:57.600]   Did you, wait a minute.
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:59.440]   Alex, did you do?
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:00.440]   You did your picks.
[01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:01.440]   I did mine.
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:02.440]   I didn't mind.
[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:03.440]   Andy, have you done yours?
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:04.440]   You did Scribner.
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:05.440]   Do you have any other ones you want to do?
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:06.440]   I'll save it.
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:07.440]   It's good.
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:08.840]   I'll save it for next week for my pick.
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:14.020]   This is the chat room saying that you should look at a new drawing program that he says
[01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:15.880]   is the best on the iPhone.
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:18.000]   I'm going to give him a little chance to plug it.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:24.040]   This is MCH Europe says, "Art Studio," which just came out on the iPhone.
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:31.200]   Is 25 brushes, simulated brush pressure, line smoothing, drawing modes, layers, six levels
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:32.200]   of undo, redo.
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:34.040]   It's even got built-in drawing lessons.
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:37.880]   It sounds like a very intriguing iPhone app.
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:39.320]   I'll take a look at that.
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:43.840]   That might be something that we'll be recommending in the future.
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:45.600]   Thank you, MCH Europe.
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:47.560]   We got a lot of great recommendations out of the chat room.
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:49.320]   A lot of things they'd like to recommend.
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:52.040]   I'm going to talk about a couple of programs I just use all the time.
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:55.400]   Busy Cal is one and it comes from you, really, Merlin, because you recommended the company
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:58.240]   that does it to sync with the Google Calendar.
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:03.320]   I live in Google and Busy Cal is now my complete I-Cal replacement because it's just so well
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:05.400]   integrated with the Google Calendar.
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:08.840]   It's just a really fantastic calendar application and they're constantly updating it and making
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:09.840]   it better.
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:10.840]   We got a segment.
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:15.200]   Alex will eventually put up a segment that I did with Busy Mac.
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:19.240]   If they added some nice little touches, it's just, if you're on the face of it, it looks
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:20.240]   like I-Cal.
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:21.480]   It's like, "What do I need another I-Cal for?
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:22.480]   I already got I-Cal."
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:23.480]   I-Cal.
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:24.480]   But it's subtle.
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:25.640]   So many nice little touches to it.
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:26.640]   Subtle.
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:28.000]   Yeah, I really enjoy it.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.240]   Another one that I use all the time is called Paka.
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:34.040]   It was a recommendation a while ago.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:38.600]   From CodeSaucery Workshop, you might say, "Why would I pay for a tool to help me bookmark
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:39.600]   files on Delicious?"
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:45.800]   Well, if you use Safari, I make Paka be my, you can see, in fact, if you look at my Safari,
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:51.480]   it's the first bookmark and that means that all I have to do is command one on any page
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:57.960]   and I immediately, Paka runs and launches a little bookmark to Delicious.
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:00.480]   We use too much, so much Delicious bookmarking on the show.
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:02.000]   This is easily the easiest way.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.880]   There is one, free one for Firefox and so forth, but Paka is spectacular.
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:10.520]   I'm just mentioning stuff that I use all the time and those are a couple of programs
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:13.360]   I just use all the time and worth $17 to me.
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:16.560]   Hey, everybody, this was a lot of fun.
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:17.920]   There wasn't that much Mac news.
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:25.320]   We can couple of stories, Apple's banning 5,000 sexy apps from the iTunes store.
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:26.320]   About time.
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:27.320]   Yeah.
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:28.880]   It didn't bother me.
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:29.880]   Did it bother you?
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:31.360]   It bothered me when they were there.
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:35.440]   I mean, because it was turning iTunes into a trash.
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:41.240]   The problem was is that you go to every area of the apps in the app store and you'd see
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:42.920]   all these stupid things.
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:46.520]   It was like when YouTube became that thing where they put up kind of a racy girl and
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:47.520]   it was just a picture.
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:50.200]   You know, and they were just trying to get numbers or whatever.
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:53.720]   It was that whole thing that YouTube ended up redesigning what they did to push that
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:56.800]   all back and Apple needed to do something too because otherwise it was going to be the
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:58.760]   front page of every app area.
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:26:59.760]   Right.
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:01.280]   Yeah, I think that's probably why the virus.
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:04.600]   My problem was that they were not approving some really great useful programs and they
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:08.160]   were allowing this to jump through and it was like, well, if you're going to censor,
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:09.160]   then censor.
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:10.160]   If you're not going to censor, okay.
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:11.160]   Right.
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:13.880]   But if you're going to censor, like at least tell us what the rules are.
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:14.880]   Right.
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:15.880]   You know, it's just consistently.
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:16.880]   That's the only thing.
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:17.880]   Right.
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:20.160]   Apple also depends so heavily on first impressions that they probably don't want somebody coming
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:23.240]   in and doing a search and having a bunch of boobies show up, you know.
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:24.240]   Right.
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:25.240]   It's small.
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:28.800]   If it were, it's not like I'm joking here, but if it were a good sexy app, I'd be all
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:29.800]   for it.
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:32.160]   But if it's just, I do a search for OGs.
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:35.720]   I need a good Microsoft Word document viewer Word document viewer.
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:38.320]   Oh, so it's the nurse boobies movies.
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:39.320]   Viewer.
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.320]   Thank you very much.
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.480]   That has everything to do with what I was looking for.
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:45.800]   You know what's weird though, is they kept playboys app.
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:49.680]   They kept, you know, they kept the sports illustrator swimsuit app neither of which are
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:51.440]   any different from the others that they banned.
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:53.240]   Maybe they're the good contracts.
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:54.240]   Right.
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:55.240]   They're money.
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:57.240]   Money, money, money, money, money.
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:02.880]   Boy, there's so many in the chatroom I really would like to mention, but I guess we'll just
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:05.240]   have to collate those and put them somewhere.
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:09.920]   Maybe we should, maybe in maybe not next week, but we should have one where your folks,
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:11.360]   the people vote or whatever you want.
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:12.360]   No, we'll do.
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:13.360]   We could easily do.
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:16.680]   And I would like to do this and we'll take some production time is have people go somewhere
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:22.080]   like we were using, but we're using for a while.
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:28.080]   Goodly, have them go to vid.ly and record a pick.
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:29.520]   And then we could go through their picks.
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:30.600]   That would be really fun.
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:31.600]   Yeah.
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:34.280]   So we'll save that for another day, but because it's going to take some time going through
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:35.280]   all the picks that we'll get.
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:36.280]   But we'll let you know.
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:37.280]   We'll let you know when we're going to do that.
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:38.280]   I think we'd like to do that.
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:39.280]   That'd be a lot of fun.
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:44.120]   Merlin Man blogs at Merlin Man dot com and you can go to Merlin Man dot com slash Mac
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:46.520]   picks to see what he did today.
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:47.680]   I'll type up my other ones too.
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:50.280]   I mean, it's kind of a haphazard job here, but I'll type up the other ones that I've
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:51.720]   got on my list as well.
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:58.320]   Also, the great productivity blog is 43folders.com, the number 43folders.com.
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:01.400]   Really a must for everybody.
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:05.640]   And he is one of the hosts of You Look Nice Today, which is simply put the funniest podcast
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:06.640]   on the internet.
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:07.640]   That's better than all that other stuff, actually.
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:08.640]   All that other stuff is nonsense.
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:09.640]   If you look nice today, it's really good to know.
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:10.640]   I love it.
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:12.920]   And you guys will, you know, if you wanted to be part of the morning show, you'd like
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:15.280]   to, you know, a regular appearance on it.
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:16.280]   That would be so much fun.
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:18.960]   We should do a thing where we call prank call people and tell them somebody in the
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:19.960]   family died.
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:21.600]   That's I always love that.
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:24.120]   I love morning shows because they always, they take it and they turn it.
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:25.360]   They turn it for sweeps.
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:27.360]   Save it for sweet, sweet.
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:31.720]   Andy Inaco Chicago Suntimes and his website is CWOB.com.
[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:34.320]   Always great pleasure to have you on, sir.
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:35.320]   Thank you.
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:38.600]   As your dog dressing to sexy, we'll have a veteran known talking after this break.
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:39.600]   Good morning.
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:42.680]   The man with the mug on to it.
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:43.680]   That's it.
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:44.680]   That's how they're going to know you.
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:45.680]   That's how they're going to know you.
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:47.440]   It's ongoing audition process.
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:49.560]   I know that you're going to be looking for the right chemistry.
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:50.560]   That's sort of thing.
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:53.200]   You got chemistry and the mug and you got the mug.
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:54.200]   I don't have a mug.
[01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:58.060]   Alex Lindsey does not have a mug, but he does have the Pixelcore at Pixelcore.com, a great
[01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:02.960]   guild of multimedia artists learning and working in the big, our new rollout.
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:04.720]   It looks like it'll be next week.
[01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:05.720]   Oh, so good.
[01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:06.720]   Pixelcore.com.
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:07.720]   I'm fine.
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:08.720]   I'm more next week.
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:09.720]   Yeah, next week.
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:10.720]   It's cool.
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:12.920]   And Pixelcore.tv is where all the podcasts are and you find all of the PMA podcasts.
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:14.920]   He was just based back from the photo marketing show.

[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:21.520]   features.
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:27.000]   We're talking about GPS and 3D and I actually saw some great 3D on a TV.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000]   That's awesome.
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000]   It was actually really awesome.
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.680]   And a lens that was like the size of a telescope.
[01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:33.680]   It was pretty nifty.
[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:34.680]   I'm Leo LaPort.
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:36.120]   We do thank you for being here.
