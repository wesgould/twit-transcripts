[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.800]   and the big news in our neck of the woods is back from her triumphant tour of Japan.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.300]   It's Lori Gill of Sickburn from the USA.
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.300]   Yay!
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.300]   Yay!
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.300]   I'm back.
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.300]   Is it kind of hard now to go come back down to earth like a normal person
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.300]   instead of the rock star that you were in Japan?
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.300]   It kind of is.
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.300]   I've been on tour with bands in the past, but this one was so intense and so amazing that
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.300]   I did come home and came home and was like, "Oh, here we are, back at the US."
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.300]   I'm going to do laundry again.
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.300]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.300]   You said a reminder on your phone, do not quit all of your regular jobs for at least 60 days
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.300]   until you come down from this high.
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.300]   It might be a good idea, but let's wait.
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.300]   That's Andy Inako from WGBH Boston, Anako.com.
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.300]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.300]   Hello, Leo.
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.300]   Hello, Andy.
[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:36.300]   Also, Lori's a cohort in crime at imore.com, Renee Ritchie from imore.com/vector.
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.300]   Hello, Renee.
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.300]   Hello, I'm Lori's little helper.
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.300]   I'm damn proud of it.
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.300]   Is it sweet?
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.300]   Noie in Montreal today.
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.300]   It's not.
[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.300]   It's cold, but most of our snow has disappeared.
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.300]   Oh.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.300]   I'm sure it's going to come back.
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.300]   It's just trying to encourage us outside so it can freeze us again.
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.300]   It's just teasing you now.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.300]   Yep.
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.300]   And in studio, as always, well, not as always, but as lately, which is great.
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.300]   Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core.
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.300]   It's great to have Alex.
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.300]   He's got a little time off for the holidays, and he goes back on the road.
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.300]   I'm sure in 2020, but we're glad to have you while you're around.
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.300]   So, Lori, anything, just highlights.
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.300]   We have some pictures, which is kind of fun.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.300]   Oh, no.
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.300]   Don't play the video.
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.300]   It'll blow people's ears.
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.300]   It's too loud, too noisy.
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.300]   And they're mine.
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.300]   I said, no matter how long I live, I will never be this badass.
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.300]   She up.
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.300]   Oh, no.
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.300]   Really badass.
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.300]   We have to turn it down because we don't break your speakers.
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.300]   This is you performing in a small club, a little thrash court, a small club.
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.300]   And where did you say?
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:46.300]   That particular club was in, right in downtown Tokyo.
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.300]   I actually can't remember the suburb.
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.300]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.300]   The name was very hard for me to remember.
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.620]   Those pictures right there were taken in.
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.300]   That was taken in Kashi Gawa.
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.300]   Kashi Gawa.
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.300]   Man, I'm having trouble remembering these names already.
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.620]   We also got to say in Asi Kaga and Osaka.
[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.780]   You spoke perfect Japanese while you were there.
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.780]   So that's really...
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.300]   So just surprisingly, it just came out of my mouth.
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.300]   It really was a fun time.
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.300]   Yeah.
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.300]   We had a great reception from everyone there.
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.300]   It was incredible.
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:26.140]   I expected to be sort of dismissed at, you know, at least one or two of the shows, but everybody
[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.420]   that watched us was really friendly and excited.
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.900]   And they just had a really great time and tried really hard to talk to us, even though
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.060]   we didn't speak the language at all.
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.060]   Very patient with us.
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.060]   It was really nice.
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.660]   Everyone was nice there.
[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.420]   We never met a single person that was, you know, kind of blasÃ© or dismissive or anything.
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.420]   They were all super friendly there.
[00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.420]   It was really great.
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.420]   I love Japan.
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.420]   It was so much fun.
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.740]   Thanks to the band photographer, Yoh Sid 27 on Instagram.
[00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:52.740]   We don't even know who he is.
[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.300]   Yoh underscore Sid 27, but that's where the pictures live on Instagram.
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.460]   Obviously a Japanese fan who went to the shows.
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.460]   So great.
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.460]   Yeah.
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.460]   Congratulations, Laurie.
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.460]   That's really neat.
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.460]   Thank you.
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.460]   Thank you.
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.460]   You played the Buddha con.
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.260]   Well, in my mind, it was...
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.260]   Oh, okay.
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.260]   All right.
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.260]   Next trip.
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.260]   Next trip.
[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.260]   Yeah.
[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.260]   Next trip.
[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.540]   You were established for a certain team that's going to go out there and make sure that the
[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:21.900]   ground spell happens.
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.100]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.100]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.660]   We just said that we laid the groundwork for the fame that will come later.
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.980]   You've created that first generation of people that are going to say, "Oh, well, you...
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.220]   I'm glad they're so popular, of course.
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.580]   I saw them in a 50-seat venue like in the suburbs and I still have them on cassette."
[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.580]   Yeah.
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.700]   Yeah, and now they're sellouts.
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.060]   Apple had a little event.
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.100]   Turned out it wasn't really the event that we were hoping for.
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.540]   Like we were all going to go and stream it live and talk about it.
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.540]   This was yesterday.
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.780]   Renee, I guess you were the one who talked me down on this one and said, "No, no."
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.380]   That was a misunderstanding.
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.380]   Yes.
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.380]   Somebody...
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.380]   Yeah, I know entirely.
[00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.420]   Lance Eilinoff, former editor at G of PC Magazine, posted the invitation on Twitter.
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:17.300]   And everybody was all a Twitter about, "Oh, Apple's got a December 2nd event in New York.
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.100]   Oh, the best of 2019."
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.660]   But this is kind of what they've done for the last few years, right?
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.860]   Yeah, I said this on Twitter just because people were going nuts over.
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.860]   Like, "Where's the stream?
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.860]   Why isn't it up on Apple.com?"
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.860]   Apple does like 3 trillion of these a year.
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.020]   They have these all over the world.
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.420]   Not the Apple Awards, but they have small gatherings where they do specific things, developer
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.460]   meeting greets, things around different kinds of apps, different kinds of accessories, all
[00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.460]   the time.
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.500]   This one just got posted on Twitter.
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.540]   And because it's your end awards and they had a fancy logo for it, it kind of took off
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.460]   and had a life on its own and people were thinking, "Oh my God, Apple's going to have
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.180]   new hardware at the end of the year."
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.180]   And no, I'm sorry.
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.180]   No, yeah.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.180]   And this...
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:02.940]   Yeah, they didn't announce anything at all, right, except just the award winners.
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:03.940]   Just the award.
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.420]   And I was funny because there were people like...
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.140]   Some of the Apple sites were like staking it out.
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.140]   What's going to happen?
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.140]   Where are people?
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:15.180]   And meanwhile, like friends of ours are jetting to Hawaii for this huge Qualcomm summit.
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.940]   And all like, everyone else is like, "What's happening in New York?
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:18.940]   No, nothing.
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:19.940]   Pay attention elsewhere.
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:20.940]   It's fine."
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:28.140]   Billie Eilish took top honors, global artist of the year.
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:34.500]   And I guess it's your reward because tomorrow at 6.30 Pacific, 6.30 PM Pacific, they're going
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.180]   to livestream performance at the Steve Jobs Theater.
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.180]   Wow.
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:46.580]   What a great coincidence that they were able to book this performer after announcing that
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.580]   they...
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.580]   It would have been harder...
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.580]   Or that...
[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:50.580]   Or the book...
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.580]   Or the book or later Andy.
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.060]   Or that they happen to have this date free.
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.060]   Yeah.
[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:55.060]   And wow, that's amazing.
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.060]   Yeah.
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.620]   No, it's hard to book an Apple award winning artist.
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.340]   You've got to book them before they win the Apple award.
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.940]   Well, you are a cynic like me, Andy.
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:04.940]   I know.
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:09.660]   It was hard for me not to note that Billie Eilish was also on Saturday Night Live two weeks
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:10.660]   ago.
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.860]   And maybe she's got an album just about to...
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.540]   Oh, yeah, the full length debut album.
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.420]   I just feel like this is kind of the Music Industries award as much as anything else.
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.420]   The Music Industry has gotten itself a little...
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.420]   It's a little behind the...
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:30.700]   It can't quite figure out how to catch up now because both Billie Eilish and Little Nas
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.660]   X, which is also listed there.
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:33.660]   So both of them are...
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:38.300]   Well, both of them are TikTok stars and they really got their launch much faster than
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.300]   the industry was ready for.
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.300]   Oh, interesting.
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.300]   You're like, they're songs...
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:47.420]   Even the song that really launched Eilish in a lot of ways was not what they had planned
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:48.420]   to put out.
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.860]   It just happened to have a sample that people started dancing to.
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:57.860]   And so I think that they're trying to kind of figure out how to do that.
[00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.220]   So the Music Awards were also...
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.500]   They did Game Awards as well and App Awards.
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:09.540]   So we'll do the Music Awards first artist of the year, Billie Eilish, who evidently doesn't
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.100]   know who Van Halen is.
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.100]   Yeah, that was...
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.140]   That was going to make an answer on Twitter.
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.140]   Yeah.
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.980]   But she's 12.
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.780]   Well, the funny thing is...
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.540]   But Van Halen, then they asked Eddie Van Halen...
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.780]   He doesn't know who she is.
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.780]   No, Eddie Van Halen doesn't listen to music.
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.980]   That was the craziest thing that came out of some interview.
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.980]   He said, "I only listen to the music that I'm working on at that moment."
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.140]   He doesn't even listen to his old music.
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.380]   Like, he listens to what he's working on.
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.380]   And he said, "I find the other stuff."
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.780]   I said, "Sometimes he listens to Yo-Yo Mom because he likes cellos."
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.460]   But outside of that, he literally just thinks about what he's playing and he doesn't think
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.460]   about anything else.
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.900]   Actually, I was thinking about that the other day.
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.580]   If I were a songwriter, I might not either.
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:52.740]   Because how hard is it not to accidentally repeat a riff?
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.740]   You just did pure.
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:54.740]   You just did pure.
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.740]   Did you have you seen The Mandalorian?
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.740]   Not yet.
[00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.740]   Yes.
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:00.740]   So listen to that theme.
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.740]   And then go back and listen to Rocky.
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:03.740]   Oh, geez.
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:04.740]   No, no, no.
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:08.740]   Go back and listen to Rocky while he's working out or whatever.
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:09.740]   It's the...
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:10.740]   Gonna fly now.
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:11.740]   Yeah.
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:12.740]   Go to those.
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:13.740]   Gonna fly now.
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:14.740]   Just listen to those two back and forth.
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.740]   And it turns out that the composer for The Mandalorian actually worked on the last two Rocky films.
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.740]   So it didn't come back hard.
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.740]   It got a very hard accident.
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.740]   Well, remember the Ghostbusters theme.
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:23.740]   Huey Lewis.
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:24.740]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.740]   The new suit.
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:26.740]   Right.
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:27.740]   And one...
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.740]   That was a...
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:29.740]   That was like a blatant...
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:34.500]   They asked them to do that song.
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.500]   And when they turned it down, they hired...
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.860]   I can't remember the guy who did it.
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:39.860]   Yeah.
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.740]   Thank you, Ray Proctor, Jr. to make a song that sounded just like that.
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.740]   So, you know, that was like an actual...
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.900]   George Harrison and My Sweet Lord.
[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:48.900]   Yeah.
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:49.900]   That's a classic one.
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.180]   Because you know George Harrison did not intentionally do that.
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.900]   But of course he knew he's so fun.
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:56.900]   He's so fun.
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:57.900]   Well, I think...
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:58.900]   He knew...
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.700]   He knew that as a teenager he heard that song many, many, many times.
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.900]   He wanted a huge hit.
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.900]   And then it was just in his head.
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:08.220]   And that's why I don't really blame Eddie Vaille for not listening to music.
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.780]   But he doesn't sound like it doesn't sound like he's doing it to protect himself.
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:11.780]   He just doesn't...
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:12.780]   He's just not interested.
[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:13.780]   You know, it's just a fascinating...
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.340]   Hey, I don't listen to podcasts.
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.340]   Actually, I do.
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.340]   But...
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.140]   I don't as much as I should probably.
[00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.140]   I'm in the business.
[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:26.420]   I've interviewed somewhere with Eddie Vaille and shot horribly and the audio is mixed quality.
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:30.260]   But of him playing and how he got what he does, it's amazing.
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.340]   Like the content is amazing.
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:32.860]   The video is not.
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.620]   But it's on YouTube somewhere.
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.260]   And it's...
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:37.260]   You should watch it.
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.900]   If you like Vaille, it's amazing to watch him go.
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:45.980]   So are there winners?
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.900]   By the way, that's a picture of, for no reason, Billy's brother.
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.900]   He wrote one of the songs he wrote.
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:52.900]   The song of my life.
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:53.900]   Finneas.
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:54.900]   I agree with this one.
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.220]   Breakthrough Artist of the Year, Lizzo.
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:01.100]   I think what's clear is these all are new artists, all of them, right?
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.780]   Or new-ish artists anyway.
[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:07.460]   And you know, I don't feel like there is a dearth of music industry awards.
[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:12.660]   In fact, they point out that Lizzo got eight Grammy denominations.
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:16.340]   So it's not like she hasn't won her share of awards.
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.540]   There's the AMAs, the Grammys.
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.060]   They have music, video awards.
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:22.580]   I mean, there's just an endless number of music industry awards.
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.380]   I do think that the online industry is about to start.
[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.300]   I think we're going to see more of this where the online...
[00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:29.300]   And I'm not talking...
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.300]   Well, is it iTunes?
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.300]   The number...
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.980]   I don't know if it still is, but for long it was the number one music place people watch
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:34.980]   music.
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:35.980]   Like, buy music, I think so.
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.100]   Yeah, buy a large shot.
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.900]   Now I don't know if people even buy music anymore.
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:46.140]   But I think that online retail, whether it's video or audio, is about to assert itself.
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.780]   Because they're the biggest game in town now.
[00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:48.780]   And I think that they're tired.
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:49.780]   Like this whole...
[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:50.780]   I think we talked about this last week.
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:54.700]   But we're not going to care about the Oscars in ten years.
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.100]   There's going to be online awards that are...
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:02.020]   If the Oscars don't embrace the online streaming platforms, the platforms will build their
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.020]   own awards and they're going to slowly push them off.
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.180]   I mean, they've already dropped 20% in viewership.
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:11.620]   So the three awards we just did, which are Global Artist, Songwriter of the Year and Breakthrough
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.340]   Artist of the Year, those are selected by the editorial team.
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:21.020]   There are awards to awards based on streaming data, which is a little less subjective.
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:26.460]   And the Song of the Year, the most played single on Apple Music, Little Nas X's Old
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:30.340]   Town Road, which I admit I contributed five or six of those plays.
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.420]   One of those songs, it's so short, it's two minutes.
[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:38.620]   You've got to play five or six times just to get a normal length out of it.
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.620]   And it's really...
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.620]   It's catchy.
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.340]   It's catchy.
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:46.460]   They don't say if it was his version of Old Town Road or the one with Billy Ray Cyrus
[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:47.460]   on it.
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.300]   It's their both his version.
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:55.340]   You see, we make fun of Billy Ray Cyrus and his Aiki Breaky heart, but as the decades
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.380]   roll on, his influence just keeps getting greater and greater.
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.220]   He's the right shank-ower of Marvel Marvel.
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.700]   The evolution all the way back.
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.700]   That's actually been a model.
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.620]   If you look at Despacito, there was like, I don't know the ten versions of it with different
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.620]   stars.
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:09.620]   That's what they do now.
[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:14.100]   The model is bringing those names in with this person.
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.260]   It's all marketing.
[00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.500]   One thing that is unique, I wish they'd called these the cookies.
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.060]   Okay, they don't.
[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:27.340]   But one thing that is unique, they have these awards are actually a silicon wafer.
[00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:28.340]   That's pretty.
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.340]   That's really pretty.
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.340]   They're fab.
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.340]   Is it a fair thin wafer?
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.340]   It's a 12-inch...
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:33.340]   What?
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:34.340]   It's a wafer.
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:38.540]   The 12-inch wafer of silicon with nanometer-level flatness.
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.140]   I'm sure Billy Eilish will appreciate that.
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:45.780]   Copper layers are deposited and patterned by ultraviolet lithography to create connections
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.420]   between billions of transmissus.
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.420]   Oh, shut up.
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.860]   Well, we don't care about your manufacture.
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:55.180]   I know you're really pleased about your manufacturing processes, but how about you get someone to
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:59.460]   design something as iconic as an Emmy statue or as an Oscar statue?
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:00.780]   How about that?
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.180]   They don't brag about...
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:06.820]   And you know that the tolerances for the molecule displayed at the Emmy is holding is
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.220]   down to "We don't care.
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.580]   It's just a really pretty statue, even if it meant nothing, which kind of it does."
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:12.580]   It would be a pretty object.
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:13.580]   I'm sorry.
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.580]   Can I say one...
[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.500]   I have one question.
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.900]   Does Apple have a fab?
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:19.900]   No.
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.060]   So this isn't even made by Apple.
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:27.660]   It's made by TSMC or somebody.
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:28.660]   Is it a real fab?
[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.460]   I mean, it could just press the foundation and press it off.
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.420]   It could be made up.
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.540]   This though, for people who don't...
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.620]   I have one of these wafers on my wall somewhere.
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:37.620]   I love these things.
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:38.620]   Actually, it's...
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:39.620]   Oh yeah.
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:40.620]   They're very pretty.
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:41.620]   I have some too.
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:42.620]   Because what they do is they cut these up and that's how you get the individual chips.
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:43.620]   So they make hundreds of them.
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:44.620]   And they're working on a money suit, right?
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:45.620]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.140]   But in order to make this, you have to have a fab.
[00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:52.380]   So Apple's waxing, rhapsodical about somebody else's manufacture.
[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.220]   I just want to point that out.
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:55.220]   They're also...
[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.220]   They're also...
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:57.220]   They're also...
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.220]   Well, these of course were rejects that were...
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.220]   Oh yeah.
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.460]   That didn't have quality inspections of no use.
[00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.220]   So that's the music awards.
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:07.020]   And I have to say, it feels a little like a marketing ploy.
[00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.020]   By the way, I...
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:09.020]   Oh, well, of course it is.
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.140]   I wouldn't be surprised if Apple had a small fab to do tests.
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:12.140]   I wouldn't...
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.940]   You know, like they might be able to actually produce that.
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:14.940]   Maybe.
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.580]   They have a CNC machine in Apple Park just to do fabs.
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:18.580]   We laser...
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.740]   We use our laser printer to make it.
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:21.740]   Apple's charts.
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.740]   Apple's still the best apps and games of 2019.
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.540]   Now this one may be a little bit better.
[00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:29.820]   And I would guess these are based on downloads.
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.580]   They are all newer apps.
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.180]   I think you knew this year.
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.180]   This is Apple editorial.
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.180]   It's not downloads.
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.620]   My real understanding is this is Apple editorial picks.
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.620]   Okay.
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.620]   These are always fun.
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:43.060]   I was just checking to see and it doesn't...
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.700]   Unfortunately it doesn't say.
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:49.500]   These are always good because they really are people who are...
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:55.100]   At Apple who love well-made apps, trying to point out, my goodness, this person really
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.300]   did an amazing job.
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.260]   As often as not, it's not just, "Oh, here's a really hot game that came out."
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:04.980]   But it's something like, "This interface is just so clean and so perfect and so elegant."
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:07.540]   I don't care if you don't manage a bowling alley.
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.540]   This is just a beautiful app for managing bowling alleys.
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.220]   You're going to want to download it and look at it.
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:16.020]   By the way, somebody in the chat room says, "If you want wheels on your Apple award, that's
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.020]   100 bucks."
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.020]   Sure.
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:19.020]   How many wheels?
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.020]   Stand.
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.660]   Stand does not include.
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.580]   So the app of the year for the iPhone, and I have to agree with this, I think, is from
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:29.900]   Lux Optics, they did halide, which was probably last year's app of the year.
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:34.780]   They're a Spectre camera, which is their long exposure app is really, really good.
[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:35.780]   Yeah.
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.220]   And Sanoski is the best gen to it.
[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:45.380]   We've not only talked about it, many times made it a pick, I'm sure, at least once.
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.580]   That's a good choice.
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.260]   That's their iPhone app of the year.
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.060]   Their iPad app of the year, I don't agree with.
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:56.300]   But it's the new Flow Drawing app from Moloskine.
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.980]   This is a very fat category.
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.580]   There's a lot of drawing apps.
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.460]   I think many better than this.
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:07.060]   But it's simple.
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.060]   I don't know.
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.460]   Anybody want to defend it?
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.460]   I don't know.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:12.460]   It's nice.
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:13.460]   It just didn't...
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:16.340]   It looks like a well-made notebook app of which there are several.
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:17.340]   Yeah.
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:23.820]   I mean, gosh, there have been apps with pencils and markers for years on the iPad.
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.500]   My daughter is mostly procreate.
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.980]   Procreate is a little more, obviously, elaborate.
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:28.980]   Fantastic.
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.980]   Yeah.
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:33.260]   So, I don't know why that got picked, but it did.
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:37.500]   I do think the app of the year for the Mac probably deserves it.
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.460]   There's Herif Labs, there's some great stuff.
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.340]   Affinity designer, Affinity Photo.
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.340]   I didn't even know.
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:43.340]   He designed the invitations.
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.340]   Did you notice that?
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.340]   He had a bit of a monitoring picture of the...
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.340]   Interesting.
[00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:47.340]   Interesting.
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:48.340]   Yeah.
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:49.340]   Interesting.
[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:50.940]   I had no idea that they did a desktop publishing app.
[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:51.940]   Affinity publisher.
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:56.620]   I think the publishing app is a better fit for them than the photo, than their image app.
[00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.660]   Well, that's what Serif did for years, was desktop publishing.
[00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:00.660]   Right.
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.660]   So, this is not a new category for them.
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:09.020]   Yeah, I think it's also the way that they approach how they process is better for publishing.
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.020]   Right.
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.780]   And the photo stuff is lacking a lot.
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:12.780]   Oh, interesting.
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:13.780]   Yeah.
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:17.180]   Well, I also find the UI on the iPad is impenetrable.
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.420]   It's just so many little buttons.
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:20.900]   This might make a better Mac app.
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.220]   I haven't really found photo editing on the iPad.
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.220]   Great, yet.
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:28.340]   I like pixel-made or photo and dark, dark room a lot.
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.140]   It depends on how much detail you're trying to get.
[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.740]   Well, I do it on my desktop when I need to do it.
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.260]   I think I'm too old-fashioned.
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.180]   Even Photoshop on the iPad is disappointing.
[00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:37.180]   Yeah.
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.980]   Well, Lightroom is pretty good.
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:42.980]   Lightroom is fine, because I'm not trying to edit alpha channels or transparent.
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:43.980]   No, exactly.
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.820]   The whole point of Lightroom is it's a front end to your desktop.
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.220]   So you can do the rejects and you can do the pixels.
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:50.220]   I think that works great.
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:54.180]   I think when you're doing just basic photo correction and some light editing, you can
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.780]   mean I think the iPad works great.
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.740]   I think if you're actually trying to do real heavy lifting.
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:19:59.740]   I think they haven't.
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:05.180]   Most of these apps on the iPad are probably doing what people who use Instagram want,
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.580]   as opposed to what people like you want.
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.900]   They're doing social media sharing.
[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:10.900]   Yep.
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:15.140]   Anyway, the Mac app of the year, Affinity Publisher from Serif Labs.
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:19.660]   Now, of course, this is a category, Apple Zone, since the Mac came out.
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:21.980]   Remember PageMaker?
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:22.980]   And then Quark?
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:23.980]   Yeah.
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.900]   You know, I spent a lot of years in Quark.
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:26.900]   And a lot of money.
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:27.900]   Same.
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:28.900]   And that's the benefit.
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:29.900]   I didn't have to do that.
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:33.460]   That's what Affinity Series has done so well.
[00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.340]   Of course, these are all very low costs.
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.340]   Yeah.
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.980]   Now it's a good to those.
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:42.020]   So the Apple TV App of the Year, I'm not familiar with.
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:45.180]   Maybe you guys are the explorers.
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.380]   I have actually not heard of this one.
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.780]   No, neither.
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:53.140]   It looks like it's a bunch of clips of the Earth.
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:58.940]   Like if you took BBC Planet Earth and created photos and clips of it.
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:20:59.940]   Yeah.
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.780]   I don't think that's going to check it out.
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:02.780]   Yeah.
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.620]   That's what the Apple TV is a perfect for, right?
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:09.820]   It's beautiful visuals on your 4K HDR screen.
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:15.620]   The app trend of 2019, this is very much like the kind of editorial you'd see in the
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:20.340]   app store anyway, storytelling simplified.
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:23.940]   And they include Anker, the podcast app, which is excellent.
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:24.940]   Canva.
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:25.940]   Lea Culver.
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:26.940]   Unfold.
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.020]   Did Lea Culver do Anker?
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.020]   Yep.
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.980]   I had no idea.
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.300]   I love Lea Culver.
[00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:34.300]   She did pounce.
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.300]   Remember pounce?
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.300]   Yes.
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:37.860]   The better Twitter.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:38.860]   She is Anker.
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:39.860]   Yeah.
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:40.860]   I had no idea.
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:41.860]   She did OAuth too, didn't she?
[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:42.860]   Of course, I'm part of the OAuth side.
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.740]   I hope she made a lot of money when Spotify bought them.
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.140]   I hope she cashed in because that's...
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:51.300]   And I, at this point, I've gone through many recommendations with people's...
[00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.300]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.300]   I'm wrong.
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.300]   She did breaker, not anchor.
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.300]   I'm getting confused with my clients.
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:56.300]   This is different.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.300]   Yes.
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:58.300]   I apologize.
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.300]   Yes.
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:00.300]   I don't know what breaker does.
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.300]   What does breaker do?
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.500]   Breakers a podcasting client that tries to do the sort of social matching that a YouTube
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:04.500]   recommendation timeline would do.
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.500]   Oh, I got it.
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.020]   Anchors for actually making podcasts.
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.020]   Yes.
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.020]   They store it.
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.020]   They make it for free.
[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.020]   Spotify owns it.
[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.020]   And when people who ask me how do...
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:17.300]   How do I get my podcast, which people have been asking me for 15 years, my answers have
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:21.540]   changed over the years, but now it's very clearly, very simply anchor.
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:25.060]   It's an amazing app on iPhone or iPad or...
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.060]   I don't think that...
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.580]   Yes, you can do it on desktop too.
[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:28.660]   That just makes it so easy.
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.980]   And then do your RSS automatically.
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.980]   I mean, it's just amazing.
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:38.180]   Canva, stories and video maker, unfold by unfold creative.
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.900]   I'm not familiar with that one.
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:45.900]   Stellar, Spark camera over and Wattpad.
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:53.660]   These are all designed to make your stories simpler, whether they're audio, text or photos.
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.940]   I'm going to have to try all of these.
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.500]   I'm not familiar with some of them.
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.180]   I am familiar with the best game of the year on the iPhone sky.
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.180]   Children of the Light.
[00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:03.180]   That's a beautiful game.
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:04.180]   I think that deserves...
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.180]   Mm-hmm.
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.100]   Although there's so many to choose from.
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:10.900]   I almost think that games should be really their own creative category because they're
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:11.900]   things you can do.
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.060]   There are fewer, so much fewer creative limitations.
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.740]   You really are starting with an absolute blank canvas when you're running a game.
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.140]   Whereas when you're trying to write a desktop publishing app or a photo editing app, there's...
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:26.100]   At some point you have to figure out how do we do a selection and how do we do brightness
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.100]   and contrast.
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:31.540]   Whereas when you see the games give you the possibility of I had no idea this world was
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:36.380]   even possible, I had no idea that this way of interacting with other apparently thinking
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.620]   and talking creatures was even possible.
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:44.780]   And after three hours, I am left rethinking a lot of my attitudes about life and reality.
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:52.140]   This is why I think there should be an entire game separate kind of award separate day
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:58.540]   with multiple categories because I've never been as impressed with the creativity of another
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.260]   programmer so much as when I have just been...
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.540]   Had my breath taken away by an amazing game.
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.940]   I've been kind of amazed by Apple Arcade.
[00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:06.940]   My son plays...
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:11.500]   I got it tested and I didn't play very many of them, but my son just played all of them.
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.500]   Interesting.
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:13.500]   And he's...
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.500]   But he was in one game or is he...
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:16.500]   Yeah, that's...
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.180]   He went and he still plays them.
[00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:20.180]   Right.
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.260]   But there was like three weeks of him playing and he still when the new ones come out he
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.260]   goes and plays them.
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.260]   That's kind of my...
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.260]   Then he goes...
[00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:26.760]   I don't have a problem with it for five bucks a month as well worth it, but that is kind
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.740]   of the issue I have with it is none of the games really keep me for more than a day or
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:31.740]   two.
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.420]   They're not the game you keep going back to again and again at least not...
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:36.460]   I found them very creative to get to the hand point.
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:37.460]   They're good.
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.860]   Oh, I'm glad Apple's doing it.
[00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:42.860]   You know, maybe that game is already out because I haven't been able to play them all and maybe
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:43.860]   it will come out.
[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:48.700]   They did have a separate category which I give Apple credit for so that they at least
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:52.220]   have two game categories.
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:56.580]   Before we get to it, the iPad game of the year, Hyper Light Drifter from Abilite.
[00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.220]   I don't know this game.
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.540]   It's a 16-bit adventure game.
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.900]   I am not a 16-bit fan, but the kids love it.
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:04.900]   The kids love it.
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:05.900]   Because they like Minecraft.
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:06.900]   Yeah, maybe that's it.
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:08.540]   It's like, oh, it looks like Minecraft.
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.540]   I can play it.
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.260]   It looks like grandpa's game.
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.700]   Me being grandpa.
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:18.180]   And then the Mac game of the year, which I also don't know, Grie or Gris, I'm not sure
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:24.900]   which, a soul-string work of digital art, one that explores hope, grief, and the triumph
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:28.180]   of piecing a life back together after tragic loss.
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:29.660]   Oh, that sounds like barrels of fun.
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.980]   I can't remember the last time I played a game.
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:36.420]   Well, but that's exactly the sort of emotional connection that in the early days you never
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:40.020]   would have imagined that a game could evoke in you.
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:45.820]   So this is why it was so difficult to have a discussion about whether games are art
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:49.780]   like five or 10 years ago, because you really weren't seeing games like this.
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:54.300]   That would just leave you emotionally wrecked in a very positive way at the end of it.
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:57.540]   And that's such a great statement for the evolution of games and game makers.
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:58.540]   I agree.
[00:25:58.540 --> 00:25:59.540]   I agree.
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:04.340]   Finally, the Apple TV game of the year.
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:11.260]   Wonderboy, the Dragon's Trap, looks like a platformer developed by Lizard Cube with the
[00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:17.540]   cooperation of series creator Ruchi Nishizawa, Wonderboy, that a beloved game from the 80s,
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:22.580]   in which a lone half-lizard adventurer sets off in the challenge of a lifetime, gets a
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.940]   reboot with hand-drawn animation and a re-orchestrated soundtrack.
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:30.380]   So it's a big nostalgia play for some of you.
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.900]   And then here's the Apple.
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:35.340]   Oops, sorry, before we get to the arcade game of the year.
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:39.660]   The trend of the year, Blockbuster's re-imagined.
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:45.780]   And that has something to do with Nintendo putting Mario Kart and Dr. Mario on the iPhone.
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.180]   Minecraft Earth, that's the new one from Microsoft.
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.540]   Really interesting.
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:55.460]   Pokemon Masters, Assassin's Creed Rebellion, the Elder Scrolls, Blades, Alien Blackout,
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:27:02.180]   Car of Call of Duty Mobile, basically AAA games in a portable format.
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:06.180]   The arcade game of the year, they did give a separate category for arcade and it was
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:12.700]   Sayonara Wild Hearts, which is a really wonderful game, great soundtrack.
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:18.140]   The gameplay itself is not unique, but it's a fun game.
[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.900]   It's got a nice little storyline.
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:26.140]   No, there's no tragic life experience involved.
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:27.900]   Sometimes you just want something to blow up.
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:31.660]   Sometimes you want to be neck deep in the fields.
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:32.780]   So there you have it.
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:37.380]   There are Apple's awards.
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:42.020]   And don't forget tomorrow you can watch Billy Eilish, 6.30pm Pacific, I guess Apple will
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:44.620]   stream that on their website.
[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:47.540]   Maybe YouTube as well, I don't know.
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:53.140]   We're going to take a break, come back with more, but first a word from our sponsor.
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.860]   It's my app pick of the week of the year.
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:02.540]   When I traveled, it was definitely front and center on my iPad and my iPhone.
[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:06.180]   I'm talking about Express VPN.
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.700]   Don't leave home without it, as they used to say.
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:12.700]   In fact, they should hire a caller in Maldon to do their heads.
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.580]   You know you need a VPN when you're on an open Wi-Fi network.
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.660]   A network you don't control.
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:21.940]   A virtual private network protects your security by taking all the traffic coming off of your
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:27.980]   phone, your tablet, your computer, encrypting it and sending it through that encrypted tunnel
[00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:31.140]   to the server, the VPN server.
[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:35.700]   So that protects your privacy, no hackers in the coffee shop or in the hotel can see
[00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:36.700]   what you're doing.
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:37.700]   That's awesome.
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:41.620]   And also protects your privacy because in fact a lot of people use VPNs even at home
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:45.220]   because your ISP or your carrier can't see what you're doing either.
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:51.420]   And that's nice because we now know that many ISPs and many carriers sell that information
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.540]   to advertisers and others.
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:58.180]   So VPNs are even more popular now than ever before for both privacy and security.
[00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:04.700]   There's a third reason a lot of people choose to use Express VPN because it eliminates geographic
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.140]   restrictions.
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:09.580]   It could take your TV watching to the next level by unlocking movies and shows that are
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:12.500]   only available in other countries.
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:16.980]   So you can use Express VPN to binge on Doctor Who or Star Trek on the UK Netflix.
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.780]   Yeah, they have it.
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.300]   Just fire up the Express VPN app.
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.580]   I'll show you how you do it.
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:22.580]   It's pretty easy.
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.380]   I've got it on my iPhone here.
[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:29.060]   So when you tap the button and one of the things I love about Express VPN is on every single
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:37.380]   device you have, you know, iPhone, Android, Mac, Windows, Linux, you could just press
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:40.540]   the start button and it'll just connect you to the nearest server.
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.980]   That's the smart location here is San Francisco.
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:47.820]   But as I traveled around, maybe, you know, I wanted to watch American television while
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.020]   I'm in Dubai.
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.020]   Well, you can do that.
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:51.700]   You can choose other locations.
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:57.380]   These are the recommended locations, but Express VPN has hundreds of servers all over
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.060]   the world.
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:02.620]   So there's no limit to the places you can emerge on the internet.
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:03.860]   And that's awesome.
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.540]   You could choose from almost a hundred different countries.
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:09.540]   Think about all the Netflix libraries you could go through.
[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:18.020]   If you love anime, you can use Express VPN to access the Japanese Netflix and be spirited
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.060]   away, as they say.
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:25.340]   Express VPN works with any streaming service, not just Netflix, Hulu, BBC, iPlayer, YouTube,
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:26.540]   you name it.
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.860]   There are many VPNs out there.
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:36.340]   Only one protects your privacy, protects your security, doesn't log and lets you watch
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:40.260]   shows ridiculously quickly, no buffering or lag.
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:45.660]   Stream and HD on Express VPN compatible with everything you've got, including media consoles
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:46.700]   and smart TVs.
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:54.180]   If you want to get a deal on Express VPN right now, I suggest you go to ExpressVPN.com/Macbreak.

[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.820]   What's your VPN tip?
[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:20.820]   NFL.
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:24.820]   The NFL app is not blocked in India.
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:25.820]   That was the hardest thing.
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.700]   We were in Dubai and I was trying to watch the 49ers.
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.340]   So the thing is- That's a good tip.
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:32.340]   I'll have to remember that one.
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:35.380]   I signed up for it in the US and half the Steeler games were blocked.
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.380]   Yeah.
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:39.180]   And then I asked, I happened to be in India for one of the games and I signed up to watch
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:40.660]   it there like a little test, whatever.
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.260]   And I suddenly realized, oh my gosh, they're not there.
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:47.580]   So now if the Steelers aren't playing on something that YouTube TV has or whatever, you know,
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.700]   they just log into Delhi.
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:50.700]   Smart.
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:52.700]   You've got a debut able to watch your ceiling.
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:54.380]   You're still paying the NFL for it.
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:55.380]   You're still paying for it.
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.180]   Oh, they get their- They get their value.
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:59.180]   Don't worry.
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:00.180]   You're watching the ads.
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.180]   You're not skipping the- No, no, I'm paying for it.
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.580]   I'm paying for the NFL pass.
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:03.580]   Oh yeah.
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:06.340]   That's so weird that the NFL pass also blocks you.
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:07.340]   Yeah, that's the whole point.
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:08.340]   That's crazy.
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:12.740]   I paid like $100 for this and I'm not getting to actually watch the team that I wanted to
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:13.740]   watch.
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:14.740]   This is BS.
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:15.980]   I hate that.
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:18.180]   ExpressVPN.com/Macbreak.
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:19.700]   I have it on all my devices.
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:20.700]   Sorry, I probably broke it.
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:21.700]   And it really saved us.
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:22.700]   Just press the button.
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:23.700]   You're on.
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:24.700]   Boom.
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:25.700]   Steeler's fans here, by the way.
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:26.700]   Yeah, I know.
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:27.700]   We were talking earlier.
[00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:30.260]   You know, Don designed aircraft carriers.
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.540]   He does fluid dynamics.
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:33.540]   Is that wild?
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:34.540]   Oh, wow.
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:36.380]   Yeah, fluid dynamics.
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:40.500]   I don't even know how dynamic my fluids are, but I know he knows.
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.220]   I have a cousin that does fluid dynamics.
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:43.220]   Really?
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.220]   Yeah, he's a small world.
[00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.780]   He's kind of like what you do.
[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:47.780]   It's related, sort of.
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:49.820]   It's way higher than what you do.
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:50.820]   It's a lot of physics.
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:53.540]   It's way smarter than the things that I do.
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.260]   I think about those things.
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:59.620]   I don't actually- If you were going to do, you know, some beautiful water in your video
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:01.380]   game, you need fluid dynamics.
[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:03.620]   Oh, yeah, we do a lot of that, but somebody else figured it out.
[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:04.900]   I just go, I have a plane.
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:05.900]   There's physics engines.
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.540]   I drop a plane and then I-
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:08.540]   Put water.
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:09.540]   Okay.
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:10.700]   How viscous would you like it to be?
[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:11.700]   This is amazing.
[00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:12.980]   I have a little sliders and everything else.
[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:15.980]   That's not the real math.
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:22.580]   Speaking of maps, I don't know how I feel about this one.
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:29.420]   So depending on where you are, your Apple Maps may or may not show Crimea as a part
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:30.420]   of Russia.
[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:32.500]   Crimea is not a part of Russia.
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:36.060]   It's a disputed territory that Russia invaded a few years ago.
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:42.260]   Part of Ukraine that was annexed by Russia in 2014.
[00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:44.860]   Google Maps has done this for some time.
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.020]   Apple changed its maps.
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:53.580]   If you're in Russia to show Crimea as part of Russian territory, this is more of that
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:56.860]   kind of- I think the same thing.
[00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.380]   The weather does the same thing, by the way, if you're in Russia.
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:03.580]   Doesn't Google Maps list that as disputed as opposed to-
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:04.580]   Oh, doesn't?
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:05.580]   Some maps do-
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:08.780]   Well, these originally reported that and then without any form of correction that I can
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:13.140]   find in the article changed to what it currently says.
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:14.140]   Okay.
[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:18.260]   Some maps do a dotted line, which is supposed to say this is-
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:21.620]   And if you're outside Russia, it shows it to you differently than if you're inside Russia.
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.580]   See, that's the real thing.
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.340]   And you're going to see this with Taiwan.
[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:26.980]   You're going to see this with Hong Kong.
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:31.820]   Well, Hong Kong now is officially China, but-
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:34.020]   Japanese Russian islands catch me at this many places.
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:35.020]   Yeah.
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:36.020]   The difference is that Apple had an opportunity-
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:41.260]   The timing is bad because Apple had the opportunity to take a high road on this one
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:44.900]   because Russia's going to be a dead market for them anyway, because Russia's going to
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.780]   require everybody to put on Russian apps.
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:50.620]   Does that mean that you can't have an iPhone though?
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.100]   Yeah, it's going to mean that.
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:54.020]   It's going to be in the same gray market.
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.460]   It'll go gray market.
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:35:00.500]   Yeah, and so the whole thing- So Apple's going to lose this market anyway, and so they could
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:01.860]   have just said, "Screw you."
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:05.100]   You know, like, we're not going to change that.
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:09.580]   You can take our phones because it's not that large of a market for Apple anyway.
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:13.340]   So Russia's part is a much more complicated thing because it's a huge part of Apple's
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.340]   income.
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.340]   Yeah, so it is.
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:16.340]   But Russia's not-
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:19.220]   So they could take the high road, but then you would really say, "Well, why aren't you
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.180]   taking the high road with China?"
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:22.500]   And then it gets complicated.
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.980]   So it's a little easier to say if you're Tim Cook.
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.860]   Well, we adhere to the laws of the country we're in.
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:31.820]   And in this country, that's- I don't know if it's a law, but it's-
[00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:37.580]   So Russia's parliament voted that every smartphone, computer, and television sold in
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:48.300]   the country, starting in July, will have to have Russian alternatives alongside the preferred
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.300]   option.
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:53.740]   So if you bought a phone that had Google Chrome or Apple Safari on it, there would have to
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:55.140]   be a Russian browser.
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:59.220]   I wouldn't be surprised if the one reason Apple should hang on to this is it's going
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:04.100]   to be a huge spike in purchases of iPhones up until July.
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.500]   I don't see this actually as a problem.
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:07.500]   I feel like-
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:08.500]   I mean-
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.060]   They're afraid it's going to be spyware.
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:12.220]   There's going to be some spyware embedded in it.
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:15.020]   It's going to allow tracking of everybody on everything.
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:19.420]   Also, if they've established a legal precedent that the contents of the phone are subject
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:24.060]   to demands from the government, then that's one step away from them saying, "By the way,
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:27.620]   Apple, you're going to create for us a new version of iOS that has these hooks built
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:30.060]   into it that our agencies can then tap into it."
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:34.700]   Yeah, but as soon as you take the Crimea and give it to Russia on your maps app, you are
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:35.700]   doing that.
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:36.700]   Maybe a smaller step.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.340]   But it's a step in that direction.
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:39.340]   That's not the same thing, but-
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:45.140]   Well, you're changing your app to accommodate Russian law.
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:48.380]   It is- I'll both say- we're talking about two different stories here.
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:53.140]   One but again, this law that says that after July you have to have Russian- localized-
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:57.820]   excuse me- not localized, but local Russian apps that have to be pre-installed on the
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:58.820]   phone.
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:06.260]   But we're talking about changing the designation of Crimea from an independent state to something
[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.260]   that has been-
[00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.260]   No, I agree.
[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:10.700]   I think it's also less than changing iOS.
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:14.020]   It's a step in that direction.
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.740]   It's a more complicated thing.
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:20.580]   Since last week's story, I've been trying to understand how cartographers deal with
[00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:21.580]   this issue.
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:24.220]   And even cartographers say that it's a dicey thing.
[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:25.220]   It's tricky.
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:26.220]   We don't know-
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:29.740]   We don't- there's one way is to simply say this is disputed territory and have a different
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:32.820]   sort of dotted line around the territory.
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:39.100]   But that's sort of wimping out because you have to figure out if someone says that-
[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:43.940]   what is going to be the common understanding of the nationality of this region?
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:48.620]   And sometimes you- one of them said that sometimes you really do have to turn off the social
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:53.500]   justice part of your head that this is not right, but this is now, by all attempts and
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:56.420]   purposes, a region that belongs to Russia.
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:59.900]   So we will now have to designate this as part of a Russian territory.
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:00.900]   And this is what-
[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:01.900]   Well, and this is what-
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:02.900]   So there's no standard.
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:07.340]   This is what the author of the Russian bill, Oleg Nikolayev, said.
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:08.820]   And that sounds reasonable to me.
[00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:13.580]   When we buy complex electronic devices, they already have individual applications, mostly
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:16.220]   Western ones pre-installed on them.
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:19.500]   Naturally, when a person sees them, they might think there are no domestic alternatives
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:20.780]   available.
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:25.180]   And if alongside pre-installed applications, we will also offer the Russians one- the
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:28.220]   Russian ones to users, they'll have the right to choose.
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:29.380]   I don't think that's unreasonable.
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:31.780]   I could see us passing a similar law.
[00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:32.780]   If we had-
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:33.780]   Well-
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:34.780]   If-
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:35.780]   Honestly-
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:36.780]   Canadian content on TV.
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:37.780]   Yeah, Canadian content on TV, which is a law-
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.380]   The new policy-
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:40.380]   It did give us a phone.
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:41.380]   It did give us a phone.
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:42.380]   Hold on.
[00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:43.380]   Let me talk for a second.
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:48.900]   If all of our phones were made in Russia, I would- I think it would- you know, what if
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:52.740]   Russia was this big- I manufacture of smartphones?
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:53.980]   Like that's where they all came from.
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:56.700]   They used to all come from Finland.
[00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:00.780]   And they come in the United States, and they have Russian browsers and Russian map apps
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:01.780]   and so forth.
[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:04.340]   I don't think it'd be unreasonable for the United States government to say, "Well, we
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:07.940]   would love- we would insist that you install American versions of those same apps that
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:08.940]   people have the choice."
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.500]   That doesn't seem unreasonable.
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:15.100]   Well, it's not American versions of these same apps.
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.620]   It's Russian alternatives to these apps.
[00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:22.060]   And again, the requirement that you put these apps on every single phone, and there's the
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:26.900]   other problem here of- it's- think about how many of these phones are obviously going
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:28.540]   to be Android phones.
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:32.500]   And imagine that you've got a calculator app that has to be installed, but it has every
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:37.660]   permission imaginable on your phone automatically set for you.
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:42.140]   It can open your camera, it can look at your text messages, it can look at- it has access
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:44.140]   to data storage, all this sort of stuff.
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:48.340]   And what if that is exploited as a backdoor so that when you cross a border- and I'm talking
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:52.460]   about a town border, not a national border, so that they can plug in this thing into
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:57.420]   a device and get access to everything that you want- in a nation that has been working
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:40:03.580]   to create its own private Russian internet that makes it really- can make it really,
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:10.020]   really difficult to access any service outside of Russian control.
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:13.020]   This is something that is to be concerned about.
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:16.700]   And I think that if that was something that was proposed in the United States, that the
[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:22.300]   government insists that the following 12 apps be installed on every single phone, we have
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:28.220]   a history of not liking government to tell us something- tell us something we have to
[00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:32.900]   have on our phones, even when they tell us that we have to have our seat belts buckled.
[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:35.380]   So I don't think that would go over well in the United States.
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:40.540]   I think it's a biased point of view to say, "Oh, the Russians spy in their people, but
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:42.300]   the Americans don't because we do."
[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:45.860]   No, they certainly do, but- So hold on, Rime.
[00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:46.860]   Go ahead.
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:53.260]   So I think it's- it is- I think this point of view is kind of that Eurocentric point of
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:56.940]   view, "Well, these other countries, they don't have freedoms, they don't have rights."
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:01.860]   So it's okay if we send our phones to them and they better not change them.
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:07.220]   I think it's a little bit- maybe not put yourself in their position.
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:10.220]   I think it'll- I think it'll- I mean, we're assuming they're doing it so they can spy
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.220]   on people.
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:14.100]   Maybe they're just doing it because from an economic point of view, they want everybody
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.860]   to know Russia makes for- They said they want to promote local developers.
[00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:22.340]   By the way, Russian developers are very good and you believe it or not have a lot of Russian
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:24.140]   programs on your phones already.
[00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:26.100]   Right now, all they can do is hack other people.
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:28.820]   I mean, that's where the big businesses- No, there's-
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:32.420]   You know what? My favorite photo editing software comes out of Ukraine is Skylum.
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:35.620]   No, I- No, Eastern European- Eastern European- Some of the best programs in the world.
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:36.620]   Some of the best programs in the world.
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:37.620]   So- So- Incredible.
[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:41.500]   I don't think it's- I mean, the spying issue, you're going to have to take out of the equation
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:47.460]   because it- if you don't think Chrome is spyware, you're not paying attention.
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:51.780]   So I'm- No, it's- it's not.
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:56.220]   What I'm getting- what I'm getting that is though China has regulations that make it
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:42:02.140]   extremely difficult to create a search engine from the West or a chat app from the West
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:05.340]   that will pass muster with local- with local rules.
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:09.380]   They don't make it a requirement that there be a government-approved chat app on every
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:10.380]   single phone.
[00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:11.380]   That's the difference here.
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:14.380]   India requires their- the phone sold in India.
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:18.860]   Brazil requires a phone sold in- Brazil are made in Brazil.
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:20.060]   This is the world we live in.
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:24.060]   By the way, that may backfire because we're now learning that Huawei, which has been blocked
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:29.620]   in the United States and can't buy US components, now makes their phones without any help from
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.900]   American companies.
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:36.900]   Is that a benefit or a detriment to those American companies?
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:41.020]   So I think you can make- there's- you could say there's an economic disincentive to do
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:46.900]   this, but I think it's a little American-centric to say, "Oh, well, we do it right and those
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.700]   rescues, you can't trust them."
[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:53.420]   No, it's not the rescues, I don't trust this Putin, I don't trust.
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:55.180]   And you trust this Trump.
[00:42:55.180 --> 00:43:00.300]   Journalists disappear who write bad things about Russia, and that's all I'm going to
[00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:01.300]   say.
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:04.020]   That'll probably happen in the US any day now.
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:09.540]   You know, because Shogi was a Washington Post journalist murdered by the Saudi Arabians.
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:10.540]   We look the other way.
[00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:12.300]   I don't think we're so far off.
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.300]   We didn't.
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:17.340]   It's a very righteous point of view.
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:19.700]   And I don't- I think I'm just trying to put myself in the Russian-
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:20.700]   Okay.
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:24.460]   In the minds of the Russians, it's a righteous point of view to assume, "Oh, they're doing
[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:25.620]   it for bad reasons.
[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:27.020]   We do it for good reasons."
[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:28.020]   I'm not assuming.
[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:32.340]   I'm just simply noting that for future- it's a data point for future consideration.
[00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:33.340]   I think the question is-
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:39.780]   But also, what an average Russian citizen prefer to have an Apple OS or a Russian OS
[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:40.940]   when they buy the phone?
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:43.020]   I don't know.
[00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.140]   The Chinese government's creating their own OS.
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:46.140]   Go ahead, Renee.
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:50.060]   It could also be a middle ground where Apple- I think what Apple's pushing back against
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:53.820]   is the idea that governments will tell them what is and what isn't on the apps installed
[00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:54.820]   on the phones.
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:55.820]   And they already have to do that.
[00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:59.860]   For example, in some Middle Eastern countries, they can't have Face ID, sorry, FaceTime on
[00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:00.860]   some phones.
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:04.940]   And in other places, they have to always figure out which apps are allowed and which aren't.
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:09.300]   But they don't want to start- I'm going to make an awful Verizon bloatware sort of a
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.060]   joke here, which is terrible.
[00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:13.860]   But they don't want other people to start telling them what apps have to be on it.
[00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:17.620]   But there could be a middle ground where when you buy the new phone and you turn it on and
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:20.500]   get the text that you're in Russia and it's set to rush it automatically downloads the
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:23.100]   Russian pack of apps from the app store.
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:27.340]   And then it's not Apple having to- and maybe this is a distinction without a difference.
[00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:31.340]   I don't know, but it's not Apple or any other company having to install apps that are dictated
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:36.340]   by a government, but it's Apple providing those apps as an automatic download when you-
[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:39.060]   This is a big issue and it's not new issue.
[00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:44.180]   Remember that Microsoft got in trouble in the European Union because they only included
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:48.940]   the Internet Explorer as the browser and they were forced to put a browser ballot on all
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:50.780]   installations- What was the name, Schlepnir?
[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:52.900]   -Slepnir, which is I think a Finnish.
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:58.580]   It's a Scandinavian browser with a number of European browsers on the list.
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:05.300]   I'm not sure I think this is a bad- I understand why countries are provincial in this regard.
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:06.300]   It's provincial.
[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:07.860]   It's provincialism.
[00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:10.540]   But especially if your alphabet is different.
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:14.060]   I don't think it's a complete- I understand it.
[00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:15.060]   I'm not saying it's a good thing.
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.060]   I understand it.
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:20.100]   -Well, I think that all governments are a little afraid of the fact that their citizens
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:22.580]   can coordinate quickly.
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:23.580]   -I think that- -Yeah.
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:27.540]   -When we look at it like when they shut them off, when they shut the Internet off and I
[00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:31.580]   ran and they shut the Internet- like they understand like everyone looks at the Asia-
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:37.340]   the app or the Arab Spring and realize that when people can- when people are upset, you
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:42.140]   know, and they can organize quickly, it's problematic for the government.
[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:45.180]   So they're trying- they're doing the best they can to make sure that they can control
[00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:46.180]   that.
[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:52.180]   And Russia and China have, you know, used force more than many other countries to keep their
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:53.740]   citizens in line.
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.580]   -We use force to keep other countries' citizens.
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:56.580]   -Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:57.580]   -Absolutely.
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:58.580]   I'm not saying- -I'm not saying that.
[00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:00.060]   -We're the ones with the cruise missiles going out.
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:01.740]   -There's also a bigger danger here.
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:05.780]   It's that when it's Russia and China, we just feel automatically like, yes, you have to
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:06.780]   fight back.
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:08.340]   Like we've cast them as evil and- -They're the commies.
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:09.700]   -As menaces for years.
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:13.060]   But now France is doing like data localization and repatriation.
[00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:15.300]   Australia is doing anti-encryption laws.
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:16.300]   -Right.
[00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:19.500]   -It's when the country- it's like when Canada or like New Zealand starts doing it, you
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:20.940]   don't have the moral argument anymore.
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:24.420]   You just have to start under- like trying to figure out why we're getting so provincial.
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:27.220]   In a world that's becoming less and less about where we're located.
[00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:31.860]   -But you make a great point, Rade, because the- here in the United States, it doesn't
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:33.700]   happen on the iPhone because they have enough clout.
[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:37.260]   But on any Android phone, if you buy it from- of- of- of rise, it has got a ton of red
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:38.260]   apps pre-installed.
[00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:39.260]   -Yeah.
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.980]   -So in America, we don't- the government doesn't do it.
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:42.980]   Companies do it.
[00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:44.740]   You know, corporations do it.
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:46.220]   You buy a phone from Verizon.
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:47.980]   I'm going to junk it up with a ton of stuff.
[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:49.980]   I don't, you know, NFL and all that stuff.
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:55.460]   -And that's why Apple had to shop from one cell provider to another to get someone to- to
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:56.460]   sell the iPhone.
[00:46:56.460 --> 00:47:00.740]   -And it's one reason to buy an iPhone in the United States because you don't have corporate,
[00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:05.980]   you know, we- you may say it's not spyware, but I got to think those Verizon apps telegraph
[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:09.340]   my location back home to the-
[00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:10.500]   -All telemetry, Leo.
[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:11.500]   -Yeah.
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:15.060]   I mean, I- it's not government spyware.
[00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:16.060]   -Okay.
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:17.860]   -I have- I feel better.
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:23.820]   -As long as I have the- the ability to choose to not buy a Verizon phone, as long as I have
[00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:28.500]   the ability and the freedom to not choose to use the Chrome browser, to use a browser
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:32.820]   that's been specifically designed to foil any attempts to track, that's perfectly fine.
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:35.620]   And I- and Rene is absolutely right.
[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:36.980]   This is not a Chinese problem.
[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:37.980]   This is not a Russian problem.
[00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:39.380]   This is a human rights problem.
[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:47.100]   And you should- I- for reasons and motivations that would hijack this entire show for two
[00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:48.860]   more hours, so I won't go into them.
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:52.860]   I do feel as though for me it's a human- it's an international human rights problem and something
[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:56.380]   that I care deeply about no matter where it pops up.
[00:47:56.380 --> 00:48:01.660]   So when I see a regime like Putin's doing something that in any other country I would
[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:05.580]   say, "Well, that's not ideal, but oh, well, again.
[00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:11.180]   This is where I feel as though the thermometer has just risen another five degrees in the
[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:13.100]   human rights situation inside Russia."
[00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:17.620]   This is a lot of- I promise this will be on my last sentence that I speak about this,
[00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:24.940]   but we don't- it's not as though you have tanks and missiles and armed people- armed
[00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:30.180]   militia on every single street corner to keep people in line happening overnight.
[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:34.580]   It's little pieces being put into position so that when the time comes that's almost
[00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:38.660]   a push a switch or pull a switch, that switch can be pulled and boom, it slights out for
[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:39.660]   human rights.
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:40.660]   And I'm guessing-
[00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:41.660]   That's my concern.
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:46.620]   Well, based on your last name that maybe your people had some bad experiences.
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:59.740]   There were reasons why the
[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:04.860]   turn off, it's also so that it allows you to be offensive.
[00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:09.820]   If you have a steady defense, our country could do things to Russia that it chooses
[00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:11.660]   not to.
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:15.940]   And so Russia's as much as anything else, it's a missile defense system.
[00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:21.780]   Them being able to turn off their external connections to the internet is them preparing
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:24.660]   for being more offensive than they already have been.
[00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:27.940]   What's the first thing you do in a coup you shut down the newspapers radio stations?
[00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:28.940]   Well, but I'm not even talking about internals.
[00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:35.420]   If they want to attack the US or other in a higher level than they already have online,
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:38.540]   the first thing that they would do is make sure that they can defend themselves.
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:42.900]   And so them building up these defenses and hardening their defenses has nothing that
[00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:46.300]   has less to do with their own people and more to do with what they want to project in the
[00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:47.300]   future.
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:50.500]   Percutin is probably the smartest politician in the world right now.
[00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:58.260]   And he has stirred up all of the stuff using the internet between all these-
[00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:00.300]   He has done a great job of weaponizing the internet.
[00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:01.300]   Has he not?
[00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:03.900]   Probably better than anyone ever.
[00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:04.900]   Yeah.
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:09.380]   And ironically using American companies to do it in many cases.
[00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:11.580]   So all right.
[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:14.020]   Well, I think Apple will walk away.
[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:15.020]   Really?
[00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:16.820]   You think they say you cannot do that?
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:17.820]   In July.
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:18.820]   I mean, they don't have to make a decision right now.
[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:19.820]   No.
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:22.220]   But I think they're not going to- because this is, I think that Apple's willing to give a
[00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:28.100]   lot, but I think that where they stop giving is actual access to the phone.
[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.020]   And that's where they've drawn the line in the US.
[00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:32.020]   That's where they've drawn the line in a lot of places.
[00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:33.980]   They might put their iCloud server somewhere.
[00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:38.140]   They might move Crimea's lines, but the line so far that Apple hasn't.
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:42.100]   Because once Apple gives that line up to Russia, they'll lose it to the FBI.
[00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:43.100]   They'll lose it to China.
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:44.100]   They'll lose it to everyone.
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:47.300]   So I think they're going to have to make that statement that says, yeah, you can't.
[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:48.300]   Let's watch.
[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:49.860]   We'll watch with interest come to life.
[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:55.060]   I don't know how they- it pulls a string out of a sweater that would be very hard to
[00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:56.060]   put back in.
[00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:59.060]   Yeah, that was my thought, is that if they do that, then they have to really start.
[00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:00.060]   I know they can.
[00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:01.060]   But there's no, yeah.
[00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:05.140]   FBI will come down on them immediately wanting to have access to the phone.
[00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:06.140]   Right.
[00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:08.060]   Hey, you gave it to the Russians, exactly.
[00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:09.060]   Yep.
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:10.060]   Why don't we have our apps on them?
[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:11.060]   That was some close interview.
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:14.060]   He said that China had never asked for the contents of an iPhone and the US asked for
[00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:17.060]   it all the time, which was an interesting thing.
[00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:22.940]   Yeah, but I mean, it's a separate story, but China is getting very aggressive in its use
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:27.060]   of smartphone technology and face recognition.
[00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:32.700]   And a lot of it is to suppress the Muslim minority Uighurs.
[00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:40.020]   They have introduced now mandatory face recognition for mobile phone users.
[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:44.580]   If you're registering a new SIM card, you've got to do a face scan.
[00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:48.660]   That face data gets sent, of course, to the Chinese government.
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:52.540]   The guidelines require telecom companies to deploy artificial intelligence and other
[00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:59.380]   technical methods to check the identities of people registering SIM cards.
[00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:05.740]   The idea, they say, is to protect the legitimate rights and interests of citizens in cyberspace.
[00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:10.580]   But of course, it makes any mobile phone owner easier to track, especially in a country
[00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:15.220]   where you have cameras and in public everywhere.
[00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:19.980]   If I have your face data, I now know who you are and where you are and what you're doing
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:21.700]   almost all the time you're in public.
[00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:24.580]   I'll argue that we just we try to be more subtle in the West.
[00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:27.620]   I mean, I don't think that was my argument earlier.
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:32.140]   But I know I'm like the I mean, if you're in the UK, I mean, you, you was cameras everywhere.
[00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:35.740]   But what they don't do in the UK is say, Hey, you want a SIM card?
[00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:37.060]   Give us your face data.
[00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:38.740]   Yeah, they just take it.
[00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:41.500]   It's as if they went and fingerprinted everybody in the country.
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:44.060]   Yeah, you know, where else you can fingerprint everybody in the country?
[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:46.500]   DMV ATM ATM ATM.
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:47.500]   How do you do that?
[00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:49.980]   It was the camera and you're punching your keys in.
[00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:51.220]   You're identifying who you are.
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:52.220]   No, no, they don't.
[00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:55.220]   They have they know what you just put your card and you hold them who you are related
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:56.220]   story.
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:53:01.420]   It looks like paranoid that it's if you enter the country right now, if you enter the country,
[00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:04.060]   the border patrol does not use face recognition.
[00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:08.140]   If you're a US citizen or a green card holder, that seems to be about to change.
[00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:13.460]   You're going to start collecting face recognition imagery from every single person who enters
[00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:14.860]   the United States.
[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:15.860]   So you're right.
[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:20.220]   We're in a way we're kind of nibbling away at the edges of collecting all that data.
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:22.420]   Well, I remember I was trying to pass through customs.
[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:25.660]   It was right after the iPhone 10 was announced and I went through and they said, why are
[00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:26.660]   you coming here?
[00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:28.580]   And I said, I'm going to I'm coming back from Apple's event.
[00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:30.060]   And the guy said, Oh, great.
[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:33.540]   They're destroying our privacy, making a database of everybody's faces.
[00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:35.260]   And I little like 10 feet away from him.
[00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:36.260]   I just scanned my irises.
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:37.260]   Yeah.
[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:39.060]   It was an Equifax database.
[00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:40.060]   And that's fine.
[00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:42.700]   He's been saying people do that all day, every day for a decade.
[00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:45.500]   But you know, suddenly it's on a phone and that's the end of our privacy.
[00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:46.500]   Yeah.
[00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:49.260]   We've been doing facial recognition for a long time.
[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:52.740]   And we also like it's like there's nothing new about what we're talking about here.
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:55.060]   This is 20, 25 years old.
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:59.020]   Alex, you were kind of talking about how we do it subtly here.
[00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:07.300]   I think that's pretty, pretty dead on in that we, we accept these kinds of privacy invasions,
[00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:10.940]   if you will, in exchange for some kind of convenient thing.
[00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:12.100]   So we're giving it away.
[00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:13.100]   It's not being demanded of us.
[00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:14.580]   We're just giving it away.
[00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:19.940]   And as long as these companies continue to kind of dangle that carrot for us, we're
[00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:23.020]   going to just keep, yeah, okay, you know, do this, do that.
[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:26.900]   And then we're giving things away for convenience in exchange.
[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:32.140]   And they're kind of being controlled by the companies, but that doesn't mean that they
[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:34.900]   won't hand this stuff over to the government if ever asked.
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:39.620]   And they're collecting all the data and all it takes is just a phone call, you know, a
[00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:43.500]   request from the government or demand from the government and our facial recognition
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:45.540]   and all that is it's going to them.
[00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:49.500]   And we're the ones who gave it away instead of it being sort of forced upon us.
[00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:51.420]   It's subtle, just like you were saying.
[00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:56.300]   Well, it's subtle because you, you, when people knew what the risks were to the United States,
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:57.540]   they wouldn't go outside.
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:00.100]   But there, but at the same time, it's the safest it's ever been.
[00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:03.180]   I mean, you are the safest you've ever been in the United States now.
[00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:04.540]   The crime rates have dropped.
[00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:06.780]   The, you know, all of those things are better than they've ever been.
[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:09.340]   And a lot of it has to do with that data collection.
[00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:12.180]   So you know, there's other side of it that we like, we like the fact that we don't, I
[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:15.620]   mean, I work in countries where everybody's got a wall with broken glass across the top
[00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:17.380]   and a security guard at every house.
[00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:21.740]   And, you know, so it can be a lot different, you know, and we are the target of a lot of
[00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:22.740]   people.
[00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:25.780]   It does tend to be the safest places are the most authoritarian.
[00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:29.020]   So I, if you go to Dubai, it's very, very safe.
[00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:30.020]   You go to Singapore.
[00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:33.460]   It's very, very safe, but it is at a cost of personal freedom.
[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:35.860]   And here it's just that we data collect a lot.
[00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:41.580]   And, and we'll say, no, see, what's really interesting is the technology, it's, it's
[00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:44.220]   the data collection plus what you do with it.
[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:49.300]   And the technology is making it really far easier to take all these data points and
[00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:54.100]   well, create stews of information that can be used in ways that we didn't really anticipate
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:55.100]   or.
[00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:57.860]   Well, and a lot of times the hooks are, you know, the reason that the metadata was so
[00:55:57.860 --> 00:56:03.140]   important for so long for the NSA is that, you know, if you do a terrorist act in the
[00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:07.860]   United States, if we're collecting all that metadata of everybody, we can go back to before
[00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:09.620]   you even thought about being a terrorist.
[00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:12.020]   And then we can see who are you talking to at that point?
[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:13.020]   And who are they talking to?
[00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:14.020]   Who are they talking to?
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:15.020]   And who are they talking to?
[00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:18.220]   And so the thing is, is that the ability to kind of Hoover up, you know, every time someone
[00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:23.220]   shows up as a terrorist, either an idea of a terrorist or start posting angry things on
[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:28.420]   Facebook, you go back in time and you start, you just collect this huge web of people that
[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:29.940]   are connected to that.
[00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:32.220]   And you know, then, then you just start watching them.
[00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:35.580]   Like, you know, it's, it's that, I mean, that's how this, that's how this works.
[00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:40.540]   And in many people get picked up before they actually execute, we just, but the, if we
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:43.900]   told everybody that we were doing that, then we would, it would scare people.
[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:47.300]   It's interesting because this is exactly what Edward Snowden talks about in his new book,
[00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:50.500]   which is called permanent record.
[00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:54.820]   And he says, we're, you know, the NSA decided at some point we may not be able to crack every
[00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:59.140]   trans, transmission, but we're going to collect them all anyway.
[00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:02.860]   And we just have to build a big enough storage facility to store everything.
[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:07.020]   And at some point when we can read it, at least we'll have the metadata we'll be able
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:08.020]   to.
[00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:09.020]   Well, it's basic metadata.
[00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:10.540]   They don't need to listen to every, every call.
[00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:12.260]   They just needed to know who's talking to you.
[00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:13.260]   And that's not encrypted.
[00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:14.260]   Right.
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:19.380]   You know, like, like who you called and who you talked to and everything else isn't encrypted.
[00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:22.420]   I think there's never been a better time for this commercial.
[00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:29.980]   I showed it a brought to you by calm, calm, calm, calm.
[00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:31.220]   We need this badly.
[00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:37.140]   Calm is a, the number one app to reduce stress to relax your mind to help you sleep.
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:39.420]   Sleep is really important.
[00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:44.420]   You, you, every day of the year, but round of the holidays is hard to find a time for
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:46.060]   those precious sleep hours.
[00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:50.380]   You got parties with friends and family, our twit Christmas parties coming up Thursday.
[00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:54.580]   Lori's going to be there for a special episode of twit.
[00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:58.540]   You, so I bet you'll get some less sleep that night.
[00:57:58.540 --> 00:57:59.540]   Endless shopping lists.
[00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:01.860]   You got work to do places to go, people to see.
[00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:05.940]   And of course, the worst thing, flying anywhere bad for your sleep.
[00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:09.140]   When you finally get into bed, you want to make sure you'll fall asleep and stay asleep.
[00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:14.500]   And that's why I love calm, the number one app for sleep and relaxation.
[00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:19.300]   It can transform unites, which means better days.
[00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:20.300]   Check out sleep stories.
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:22.460]   They call, I'm going to run to calm.com right now.
[00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:24.220]   I have a premium subscription I have for years.
[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:28.740]   I love calm, but let me show you the new sleep story.
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:33.340]   You'll be very pleased when you go to your homepage and calm.com to see there is a new
[00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:38.580]   sleep story from one of my favorite people of all time.
[00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:43.860]   Now I've called her Eva Green forever, but it turns out here, listen to her.
[00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:44.860]   Hello.
[00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:45.860]   Hello.
[00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:46.860]   And welcome.
[00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:47.860]   Hi.
[00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:50.220]   My name is Eva Green.
[00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:53.220]   Oh my God, she's Eva Green.
[00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:54.220]   Did you know that?
[00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:55.860]   I feel so calm now.
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:56.860]   And this?
[00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:57.860]   This is her sleep story.
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:59.460]   That's called nightfall.
[00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:01.460]   Now imagine you put this on.
[00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:06.220]   This is the end of the week in the middle of the spring listening to the and the night
[00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:07.700]   was about to begin.
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:09.540]   You've got peaceful mountain league.
[00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:12.900]   I stepped outside and the front door clipped itself closed.
[00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:13.900]   No, wait a minute.
[00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:15.540]   I can't keep playing this because you're going to fall asleep.
[00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:16.540]   Stop.
[00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:19.300]   You've got to pay attention to sleep stories.
[00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:26.260]   You just the beginning, Matthew McConaughey, Stephen Fry, people from all walks of life.
[00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:28.660]   How about Nick over there?
[00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:29.660]   Hello.
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:30.660]   My name is Nick Offerman.
[00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:31.660]   The Offerman.
[00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:37.860]   And tonight I'd like to tell you a fine tale about a familiar storybook character.
[00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:43.420]   But before we get started, it's called the big bad wolf learns anger management.
[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:46.860]   The problem, if they make this too funny, I'm going to wake up.
[00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:52.740]   These are so amazingly calming and relaxing.
[00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:54.740]   And I just love them.
[00:59:54.740 --> 01:00:00.740]   Jerome Flynn, they sell sort from Game of Thrones reading about his sacred New Zealand.
[01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:02.100]   It's so great.
[01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:04.940]   I just love calm.com.
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:05.940]   But that's not all.
[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:08.220]   There's meditations, guided meditations.
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:09.460]   There's a daily meditation.
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:11.260]   Tamara Levitt does one every day.
[01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:12.420]   Welcome to the daily calm.
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:13.660]   A new one every day.
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:15.180]   That's Mary Levitt.
[01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:19.340]   And today we'll explore our tendency towards self competition.
[01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:21.380]   Oh, I got to listen to that one.
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.100]   There's great music.
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:28.100]   In fact, there's music from some of the biggest names like cigar Ross's new album is on here,
[01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:31.900]   remixed for deep sleep and relaxation.
[01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:37.860]   Ah, Moby released his latest album exclusively on calm.com.
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:44.340]   There's master classes in many different areas, including parenting, gratitude, peak performance,
[01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:46.300]   mindful eating.
[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:48.420]   There's stretch classes.
[01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:52.700]   The evening stretch, the morning stretch, a mindful warm up and cool down morning wake
[01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:53.700]   up.
[01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:55.540]   And of course, the beautiful calm scenes.
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:56.540]   Let's pick one.
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:01:00.380]   You want to go to Sunset Beach, wind in the pines.
[01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:03.100]   This is a good snowy one for for winter.
[01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:08.260]   Let's have some wind in the pines and we can, by the way, have that mixed in with our cigar
[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:09.260]   Ross.
[01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:15.500]   And now we're well, how about underwater?
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:18.580]   It's so relaxing.
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:23.620]   I think you'll find a thousand ways to use calm to calm yourself to relax.
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:25.100]   And yes, to sleep better.
[01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:26.260]   And I like it so much.
[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:29.420]   I want to give you a big discount on a premium subscription.
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:31.180]   That's what I've had for the last few years.
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:32.340]   25% off.
[01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:40.060]   If you go to calm.com, C-A-L-M dot C-O-M slash Mac break.
[01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:50.180]   It's a great gift to, by the way, I give this every year to my daughter because it's just
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:53.220]   such a relaxing, wonderful thing to have.
[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:58.420]   It's a gift that keeps on giving calm.com slash Mac break access to the entire calm catalog
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:04.020]   with new material every week, including evergreen.
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:06.820]   She was, you know, evergreen.
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:08.060]   She's been in so many great movies.
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:10.140]   You know, if I showed you her face, you'd recognize her.
[01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:15.700]   She was Vespers in, you know, Ray Al.
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:17.740]   Yeah.
[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:18.740]   Love her.
[01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:23.220]   The one woman that James Bond fell in love with broke his heart.
[01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:25.500]   You just ruined it for everybody.
[01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:26.940]   I just said she broke his heart.
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:28.580]   I'm probably 12 years old.
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:29.900]   I watched it again the other day.
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:30.900]   I love it so much.
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:33.300]   And partly because the Newt Bond is coming out.
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:35.100]   Craig is still James Bond.
[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:36.100]   Last one, I think.
[01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.100]   Last one.
[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:38.100]   He's giving it up.
[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:39.100]   Oh, James.
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:40.100]   Oh, James.
[01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:43.420]   Do we know the next bond's going to be?
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:45.380]   No, not yet.
[01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:47.020]   It'll be a woman.
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:50.740]   Yeah, there's a rumor that there will be no more James Bond's, but there will be a
[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:51.740]   new double of seven.
[01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:53.260]   Oh, that would be good.
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:54.740]   I like Idris Elba.
[01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:55.820]   He'd be great.
[01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:58.100]   But a woman could not be James, right?
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:02:59.100]   So it could be a woman.
[01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:00.100]   Who would you make it be?
[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:01.660]   We did be James.
[01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:04.740]   She could be Jamie Bond.
[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:06.180]   She could be Laurie Gill.
[01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:07.180]   That's a name.
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:08.180]   A 007.
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:11.820]   I thought it was my vote.
[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:19.500]   AirPods demand for the AirPods Pro so great that Apple has reportedly doubling its production.
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:24.820]   This comes from the Nikkei Asian review of Bloomberg Report.
[01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:26.940]   Much higher demand.
[01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:34.600]   I'm actually not surprised because the reaction to the AirPod Pro was so strong from all over
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:35.600]   the place.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:36.600]   Yeah.
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:43.400]   I think there are a lot of better, less expensive choices, including my favorite, the Galaxy
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.400]   Buds.
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:48.260]   I think it's the integration that works.
[01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:53.560]   This is where Apple got placed Apple's strength, which is that they have the hardware all
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:56.540]   working together with the software and they're able to develop it together.
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:04:00.460]   I think that's the thing that's going to be really hard for other folks to reproduce,
[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:01.460]   even if they're not.
[01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:03.460]   Technically, it's good.
[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:09.960]   AirPods were almost a joke for a while and then they suddenly became the most popular
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:15.160]   in ear headphones, at least in terms of the me-me-ness of them.
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:18.160]   That was about a year ago that that happened.
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:23.640]   Then everyone was all on board with AirPods and then AirPods Pro came out.
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:29.680]   To me right now, this was the perfect time for them to come out because everyone was
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:31.080]   on board with AirPods.
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:33.040]   Yeah, they're ready.
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:35.740]   This new version is now everyone wants it.
[01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:38.500]   A comfortable pair of AirPods that don't fall off.
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.580]   Just what I've been waiting for.
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:43.420]   How's the noise canceling on them?
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:44.420]   Is it good?
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:45.740]   Does it work well?
[01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:53.020]   I used them on the plane when I was on my way to Japan and back.
[01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:57.460]   They're not as noise canceling as over the ear or on-ear cans, but that's just because
[01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:02.180]   those cans, just like they literally just run on your head.
[01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:09.860]   What it does do though is it cuts out all of the noise but allows in just sort of the
[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:10.860]   sounds.
[01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:14.420]   If you know what I mean, the difference is- The background hum of the jets is canceled
[01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:15.420]   out because it's continuous.
[01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:16.920]   Completely canceled out.
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:21.180]   Noise canceling anything doesn't work with intermittent stuff like babies crying or a flight
[01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:23.180]   of tenants yelling.
[01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:24.180]   Those things come through.
[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:27.700]   If the flight of tenants yelling, "Get out!
[01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:29.180]   It's on fire!"
[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:30.340]   You probably want to hear that.
[01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:31.340]   You want to hear that.
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:33.740]   It's not good with rapidly changing noise.
[01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:35.100]   It's like an engine hum.
[01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:36.420]   Like anything that's just consistent.
[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:40.580]   But honestly, I think the reason frequent flyers wear noise canceling headphones going
[01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:45.500]   back to Bose is because it does cancel out that "hah" that you hear the whole time on
[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:46.500]   the flight.
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.500]   That helps a lot.
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:51.860]   I even have this great experience of just yesterday actually.
[01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:58.940]   There was a leaf blower had come by to blow the yard.
[01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:04.940]   It was- Leaf blowers are the most annoying sounding thing in the world to me.
[01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:07.300]   They cause just attention.
[01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:11.980]   I need calm.com whenever the leaf blower comes by.
[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:17.900]   So I pop in my AirPods Pro and it just canceled everything out.
[01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:19.820]   I didn't even have to turn anything on.
[01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:20.940]   I didn't listen to anything.
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:22.660]   I just popped them in my ears.
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:29.500]   And it just negated that awful, awful sound so I could kind of calm myself and continue
[01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:32.020]   working without hearing that the whole time.
[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:37.500]   It's pretty incredible that these tiny little things can have such a strong noise canceling
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:42.420]   ability and not have to be these big things that go on top of your head.
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:44.940]   Do they allow leaf blowers in Canada, Renee?
[01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:48.660]   Yeah, except you only hear them half a year because they don't- that's for the year it's
[01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:49.660]   snow blowers.
[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:53.900]   What ain't leaf blowers is snow blowers.
[01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:57.860]   I feel like some country should ban leaf blowers because I'll move there.
[01:06:57.860 --> 01:06:58.860]   Really?
[01:06:58.860 --> 01:06:59.860]   We hear them perhaps.
[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:00.860]   Some cities do.
[01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:03.700]   Well, yeah, they're often two-stroke engines.
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:05.900]   They're horrible polluting beasts.
[01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:07.220]   I'm an electric one because they're being annoying.
[01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:08.220]   Yeah, electric would be okay.
[01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:09.220]   Yeah.
[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:10.220]   It's not very powerful.
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:13.460]   Or just like, to me, fall is the sound of rakes.
[01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:14.460]   Raking leaves.
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:15.460]   Right.
[01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:16.460]   Yeah.
[01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:19.180]   And then of course the smell of smoke as we burn the leaves in a pile on the street.
[01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:20.180]   I smell them.
[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:21.180]   They can't do that anymore.
[01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:22.180]   No.
[01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:24.660]   Definitely not here.
[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:29.180]   Intel says it sold to Apple at a great discount.
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:35.900]   It was forced to do so by those sons of bees, Qualcomm.
[01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:41.420]   Qualcomm's patent licensing practice has strangled competition in parts of the market
[01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:44.180]   for modem chips.
[01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:49.820]   And Intel filed a brief with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
[01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:55.660]   Qualcomm received a judgment against them because of that.
[01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:59.100]   And they're trying to overturn it in the Court of Appeals and tells Amicus brief.
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:02.580]   It says, "Oh no, that's absolutely true.
[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:03.580]   It cost us."
[01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:07.580]   And not only that, when Apple bought us for a billion dollars, it was a lot less than
[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:08.580]   we were worth.
[01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:11.540]   "We invested billions," said Intel.
[01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:17.020]   "Hired thousands, acquired two companies, and innovative world-class products that eventually
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:21.020]   made their way into Apple's industry-leading iPhones, including the most recently, released
[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:22.020]   iPhone 11.
[01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:27.500]   But when it was all said and done, Intel could not overcome the artificial and insurmountable
[01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:33.780]   barriers to fair competition created by Qualcomm's scheme and was forced to exit the market
[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:34.780]   this year."
[01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:38.300]   And a great loss.
[01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:40.420]   I added that part.
[01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:41.420]   I'll see.
[01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:44.420]   Yeah, you've got to feel bad for Intel.
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:46.100]   It's not been going well in general.
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:48.740]   Only the ad chips to fall back on.
[01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:55.580]   Yeah, the other big story of Black Friday is how well AMD's chips are selling.
[01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:59.620]   In fact, now outselling Intel in many respects, they're basically desktop chips.
[01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:00.980]   They're outperforming Intel's chips.
[01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:03.780]   Yeah, less expensive and faster.
[01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:04.780]   And no meltdown.
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:08.500]   I mean, the latest Intel ones are suffering from a pretty big regression thanks to Meltown.
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:09.500]   Yeah.
[01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:11.580]   You're still in the 10th gen chips.
[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:15.780]   So I wonder, you know, we keep talking about Apple moving to ARM.
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:20.220]   I wonder if Apple might move to, at least on its desktop, might be looking to move to
[01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:21.220]   Ryzen.
[01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:22.220]   Threadripper.
[01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:23.740]   Threadripper.
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:28.500]   The next generation Threadripper will have 64 cores.
[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:33.220]   It'll probably be 8,000 watts, but it'll have 64 cores.
[01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:38.420]   That's the Intel X version, right?
[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:40.620]   The competitors, like a $7,000 chip, I think still.
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:41.620]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:45.140]   That's probably the Mac Pro chip or the iMac Pro chip.
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:47.500]   You imagine a Threadripper iMac Pro?
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.420]   That'd be so great.
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:50.420]   Yeah.
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:51.420]   I wonder.
[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:55.740]   No, you don't get, I think you don't get thunderbolt three natively with AMD.
[01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:56.980]   I think it's been spun off now.
[01:09:56.980 --> 01:10:00.420]   I think sometime a few months ago, it was spun off and independently licensed.
[01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:05.220]   But I think there's probably a ton of integrations that Apple does with the known target as
[01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:06.220]   Intel.
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:07.220]   Yeah.
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:10.060]   That's going to be a hard thing to do.
[01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:15.740]   Good article, I thought, enjoyed reading it in the Apple on the Apple Insider about the,
[01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:21.020]   this is Daniel Aaron Delvilger, who's a great writer, about the A7, how Apple's custom,
[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:26.100]   and this is a while ago, custom 64-bit silicon embarrassed the industry.
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:30.180]   We're talking between 2010 and 2012.
[01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:33.980]   So if you like Apple history and you want to kind of, it always takes a few years to
[01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:37.020]   get the real behind the scenes of what was going on.
[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:45.100]   If you want to know what was going on when Apple came out with the iPhone 6 and the A7
[01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:49.820]   chip and what Samsung was going through, this is a great article.
[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:53.380]   It's pretty amazing because back then, like it was silicon merchants mainly like Qualcomm
[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:57.020]   and they were intent, the longer it chips out on the shelf, the more profitable it was
[01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:58.020]   for them.
[01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:01.300]   So they were going to milk 32-bit for as long as they could before spending any money on
[01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:02.300]   64-bit.
[01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:06.260]   And I remember people being in line for that event going, and I think Mark Gurman had leaked
[01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:10.620]   that the graphics chip was going to be 64-bit, not that the main processor, but then Apple
[01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:15.100]   announced the whole thing at 64-bit and all like the Anantec people and the other, I think
[01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:17.700]   it gets extreme today, they're just draws dropped.
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:21.140]   And yeah, Qualcomm at first is like, "No, it's just a gimmick.
[01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:25.420]   Nobody needs, nobody needs, but it turned out like the ARM V7 instruction set and the
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:28.900]   security additions and all of these things were just transformative."
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:32.900]   It's really amazing to look back and hindsight at how hard that pushed the industry into
[01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:33.900]   short amount of time.
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:38.220]   I remember in 2013, people talking about, we probably talked about it too, "Oh, the
[01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:40.940]   kids don't want iPhones anymore.
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:44.180]   iPhone is grandpa's phone."
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:46.620]   And Apple took that seriously.
[01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:50.860]   And I think we can look back at the six, and especially the six S. That was the first, six
[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:52.300]   was the big phone, right?
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:53.300]   First big phone.
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:57.100]   We can look back at that and say, "That was a turning point in Apple's and the iPhone's
[01:11:57.100 --> 01:11:58.100]   history."
[01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:05.220]   When they suddenly come out with dual core 64-bit mobile processors, the A7.
[01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:08.740]   And then remember the seven, like people were like, "Oh, Apple's falling behind an
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:09.740]   AI.
[01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:10.740]   Apple's not pre--."
[01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:14.260]   And the iPhone 7 came out and it had AI built into the silicon, a neural network that
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:17.660]   they'd started three years earlier and baked into the hardware already.
[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:18.660]   Yeah.
[01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:21.260]   That was when-- you can say that was a turning point.
[01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:26.220]   It's when you start looking at Apple's silicon as, "Hey, they're doing something pretty
[01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:27.220]   amazing."
[01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:28.220]   Yeah.
[01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:31.180]   So, a little bit of Apple history.
[01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:32.180]   Yeah.
[01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:37.500]   And also it underscores how much trouble other companies like Google had been having in launching
[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:42.580]   products that-- there's like a big, big lake full of money that they should be able to
[01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:47.020]   just put a drag net into and pull money out of, but they can't because they're limited
[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:50.140]   to Qualcomm CPUs for their Wear OS stuff.
[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:55.300]   And there's really no reason for even someone who is deeply, deeply, deeply a fan of Android
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:59.020]   to even consider buying an Android Wear or Wear OS watch right now because it's just
[01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:00.020]   so pathetic.
[01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:05.820]   It's like it's so much smarter for them to buy a competitor's watch or even an Apple
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:08.700]   watch if that's the standard you're going to get by.
[01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:13.180]   So, yeah, Apple gets kudos for seeing in advance that it's going to be so important
[01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:19.420]   for them to take their own destiny into their own hands with their own chip designs to make
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:24.020]   stuff that is absolutely designed to handle what they want to make in the next five years,
[01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:30.860]   which really should make all of us really excited about what the first Mac that has an
[01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:35.300]   ARM processor designed by Apple is going to be able to do.
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:36.300]   And they want to--
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:38.300]   Like Google rated, sorry.
[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:39.300]   Go ahead.
[01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:41.580]   I was going to say Google rated Qualcomm and Apple.
[01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:45.540]   And they've got-- they've posted several really big players from both of those teams,
[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:47.260]   and they are all gone now.
[01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:49.140]   They lasted very, very short amount of time.
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:53.060]   It's very hard to put those types of teams together and keep them going.
[01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:58.340]   Uh, Philip Elmer DeWitt points out on his blog, PED30.com.
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:01.980]   Remember when market caps of Apple and Exxon were neck and neck?
[01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:08.740]   Now, now Apple is more valuable than the entire US energy sector.
[01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:19.940]   Apple's worth more than all large cap US energy stocks put together $1.2 trillion.
[01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:22.620]   Apple shares have climbed almost 70% this year.
[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:27.500]   My dad calls everything's giving to remind me that I told him to sell his Apple stock
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.500]   about six years ago.
[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:33.020]   And I think when Jobs died, I said, "It's all over.
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:34.020]   You should sell your stock."
[01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:36.940]   He calls me everything's giving to remind me.
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:37.940]   And I think the 70s--
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:40.460]   He didn't, by the way, and he calls to remind me, "I didn't.
[01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:41.460]   How's your stock doing?"
[01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:42.460]   "Shob, I'm on the yacht.
[01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:44.460]   How are you doing?"
[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:50.260]   And I think roughly the math, though, is that it's 70% because they had a dip last
[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:51.260]   year.
[01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:54.580]   It's really closer to 16% growth.
[01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:55.580]   And then--
[01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:56.580]   Yes, because only 1.12 trillion.
[01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:59.140]   I remember one was 1 trillion last year.
[01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:00.140]   Yeah, I think it's like 16.
[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:01.140]   I think it's 16.
[01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:04.780]   They had that huge drop when they said they're not going to report iPhone sales anymore.
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:06.140]   And so it looks like 70%.
[01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:10.860]   It was really-- if you bought one in the trough, yeah, absolutely, you did great.
[01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:13.860]   If you still had it, it's a smaller growth.
[01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:14.860]   And it also--
[01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:17.100]   No, I'll take 16% year over year, every year.
[01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:18.100]   The average is like 20.
[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:20.860]   I'd be very happy with my investments if they did that.
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:21.860]   No, absolutely.
[01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:25.460]   No, it's-- they've done really well if you stuck with them.
[01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:29.580]   And I think it's also being inflated a little bit because they keep on buying back all
[01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:30.580]   that stock.
[01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:31.580]   You know, well, that's true.
[01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:32.580]   So it's not--
[01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:33.580]   That's true.
[01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:34.580]   --performant stock buybacks.
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:35.580]   Yeah.
[01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:36.580]   And let's point out the energy sector ain't what it uses.
[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:37.580]   Yes, exactly.
[01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:41.780]   It's not exactly a growth industry.
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:48.740]   We got to get some advertisers for Philip on his blog, though, because his latest sponsor
[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:53.300]   is Vandalay Industries, manufacturer of fine latex goods.
[01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:55.620]   I refer it reference--
[01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:57.140]   That's the growth company.
[01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:59.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:00.140]   When you grow, we grow.
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:07.740]   I think that's their slogan, right?
[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:09.660]   Should we do the Ming Chi Quo report?
[01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:12.500]   Because I don't trust Ming Chi Quo anymore after--
[01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:15.060]   I was just thinking that when I was reading this morning.
[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:22.740]   I think the start of the sentence is something like saying something about how his predictions
[01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:24.500]   are reliable or something like that.
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:28.980]   And I thought, I kind of think at this point, he's just throwing anything at the wall and
[01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:30.780]   seeing what sticks.
[01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:32.140]   And then some of them are right.
[01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:34.140]   And that makes him not quite as reliable anymore.
[01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:36.780]   Yeah, because for instance, Ming--
[01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:38.380]   If that's your real name--
[01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:45.020]   I bought another non-Mac laptop because he said, oh, let's say--
[01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:47.820]   16 inches and come now until 2020.
[01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:48.820]   Yeah, that wasn't right.
[01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:49.820]   That wasn't right.
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:51.900]   Well, he does now say Apple will be releasing.
[01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:53.660]   I mean, anybody-- I'm going to say it.
[01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:56.940]   Apple's going to release a 12.9-inch iPad in 2020.
[01:16:56.940 --> 01:17:01.420]   And a 16-inch MacBook Pro with Mini LED.
[01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:02.940]   I know-- oh, that's the screen, right?
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:03.980]   That's that new LED.
[01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:06.060]   Yeah, that's what the Pro display XDR is made out of.
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:06.580]   It's gorgeous.
[01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:08.380]   Oh, is the XDR Mini LED?
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:09.340]   I didn't know that.
[01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:10.540]   Yeah, I'm michael-ed.
[01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:13.300]   People get those confused because they're confusing terms, but Mini LED.
[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:16.060]   Oh, micro LED is the new TV technology that
[01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:18.580]   allows you to put panels together to make a TV of--
[01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:20.980]   The pictures are like three inches big right now.
[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:21.900]   They have to get that miniature.
[01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:24.420]   So mini-display-- sorry, mini-LEDs, what we're getting next.
[01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:27.260]   And micro-LED is after that, except on maybe things
[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:28.900]   like watches and stuff in the short term.
[01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:31.220]   Oh, OK.
[01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:36.500]   So it isn't really that much to say that Apple's going to do this.
[01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:38.460]   They want to mitigate against OLED because OLED
[01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:41.660]   is a fantastic technology that has incredible problems with it.
[01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:43.580]   And they can do a lot of mitigations on a phone
[01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:45.620]   because the panel is relatively small.
[01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:48.460]   So maintaining continuous brightness isn't as big a problem.
[01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:51.820]   And they have to mitigate off-axis shift and burn and all these things.
[01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:54.540]   And what's so exciting about Mini LED is that it--
[01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:58.380]   because the LEDs are so isolated, it does give you deeper blacks.
[01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:01.940]   We've seen with the Pro display XDR that it can do really good sustained brightness.
[01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:05.220]   So you get HDR because right now the iPads are in HDR.
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:07.500]   LCD is like, we can do HDR really.
[01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:09.260]   We'll go to like 600 nits.
[01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:10.980]   You'll call us HDR, won't you, please?
[01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:13.180]   And they're like, no, no, we won't.
[01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:17.100]   And so they want to get to that technology and have it uniform over the whole panel.
[01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:19.980]   And it looks like Mini LED is way better at OLED delivering that.
[01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:23.380]   See, I have a number of OLED laptops.
[01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:25.300]   I had a Lenovo OLED laptop.
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:27.260]   The New Dell is offered to have a new LED.
[01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:28.260]   Apple doesn't like them.
[01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:31.180]   And they're expensive at that scale.
[01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:34.220]   So what is wrong with OLED?
[01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:36.580]   For instance, it's not continuous.
[01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:39.620]   The brightness levels vary.
[01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:41.020]   So again, like Apple is super particular.
[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:44.980]   They didn't do OLED on the iPhone for years after OLED was on a bunch of other phones
[01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:46.780]   because they had a certain checklist.
[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:49.300]   And it was like 80% at this and 90% at this.
[01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:51.860]   And they're like, no, we want 100% at all these things.
[01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:56.020]   And it took until the iPhone 10 before they're like, OK, Apple is now happy.
[01:18:56.020 --> 01:19:00.500]   And it's to say like the iPads and the MacBook displays, they're just not happy with.
[01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:04.140]   And they don't think that OLED is going to solve it at a reasonable yield and price
[01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:05.140]   point for them.
[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:07.540]   Because the iPhone panel is like 110 bucks already.
[01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:15.780]   We were having this conversation in the community because somebody wanted to buy a new photography
[01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:18.020]   laptop, PJ.
[01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:22.100]   And while initially said, I do love the Dell with the OLED, but I'm not sure it's a good
[01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:26.500]   photography choice because how accurate is the OLED?
[01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:28.260]   And I really love the 16.
[01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:33.620]   I think that that screen with the true tone and with the accuracy of that Apple really
[01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:36.340]   puts into its screens is very good.
[01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:39.340]   Alex, is OLED a bad choice for a photographer?
[01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:41.340]   I don't know if it's necessarily a bad choice.
[01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:42.980]   I mean, I think there's a lot of good quality there.
[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:49.380]   I think that the real issue is that the problems that we've already discussed with OLED, it's
[01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:54.060]   not so much that for photography OLED is a problem with all the things that can happen
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:55.060]   to that screen.
[01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:56.060]   OK.
[01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:57.820]   Not being able to sustain brightness and burn in.
[01:19:57.820 --> 01:20:03.140]   A lot of times when you get an OLED screen, at least on phones, people, I guess this is
[01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:04.140]   true on laptops.
[01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:07.220]   Oh, the colors really pop.
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:10.340]   And I think that sounds to me like inaccurate colors, right?
[01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:12.260]   That makes them hyper-brite or hyper.
[01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:14.540]   The manufacturers do that like Samsung doesn't turn it up.
[01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:17.020]   And some other manufacturers, they want it to jump out.
[01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:18.020]   Yeah.
[01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:19.020]   So they people like that.
[01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:20.020]   That's a photographer.
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:22.540]   That's the kiss of death because you're going to be accurate.
[01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:23.540]   Yeah.
[01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:26.500]   The bear is repeating that color is also used for user interface and stuff like that.
[01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:27.900]   So it's not necessarily a bad thing.
[01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:30.580]   But yeah, you don't want these art.
[01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:35.500]   It's hard to it's hard to give in somebody that a certain camera on a phone is better
[01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:40.980]   than other one when you're showing them pictures of natural realistic color.
[01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:43.860]   Whereas on someone else's phone is like they made the red super red.
[01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:45.300]   They made the blues amazing blue.
[01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:46.300]   Right.
[01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:47.300]   The green is a radioactive.
[01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:50.900]   Even on the iPhone with OLED, I think the accuracy is pretty good, isn't it?
[01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:52.900]   And the accuracy is amazing on an iPhone.
[01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:55.940]   But it doesn't have that bright red popiness that a Samsung.
[01:20:55.940 --> 01:21:00.300]   But if you put an excellent LED iPhone, they're almost identical, which to me is crazy good
[01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:02.380]   color calibrate the factory.
[01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:03.380]   Yeah.
[01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:08.140]   Does OLED have burning problems or other long problems?
[01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:09.140]   Yes.
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:10.140]   Yes.
[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:11.140]   Okay.
[01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:13.280]   And then there was for a while the issue of the purple dye fading faster than the other
[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:14.280]   dies.
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:15.980]   Is that still an issue or is that sort of solid?
[01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:16.980]   The blue.
[01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:17.980]   Yeah.
[01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:18.980]   A blue.
[01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:19.980]   Okay.
[01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:20.980]   Yes.
[01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:22.900]   I think they overload the blues last longer because as they die, it's still fine.
[01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:25.180]   And then enough of them die in your ears.
[01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:26.180]   Not accurate anymore.
[01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:27.180]   So all right.
[01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:28.180]   So it looks good.
[01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:31.460]   And the iPhone, but it's not, it wouldn't necessarily be the right choice for a laptop
[01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:32.460]   only.
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:33.460]   Well, it's different.
[01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:35.820]   Like the TV sets that LG makes, like LG doesn't like my LG OLEDs.
[01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:36.820]   Oh, man.
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:37.820]   Oh, we've seen that.
[01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:42.020]   And but they make better OLED at scale, like at large TV sizes than Samsung because it's
[01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:45.140]   a very different technology is filtering and a bunch of other stuff.
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:47.340]   My LG OLED is a few years old.
[01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:52.020]   It's a 2016 model, but I still my go to a phone and watch a beautiful movie.
[01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:53.020]   Right.
[01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:54.020]   I just watched down.
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:55.020]   Watch Disney Plus on it, Leo.
[01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:56.020]   It is or.
[01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:57.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:58.020]   That's the other thing that's exciting.
[01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:00.940]   These new streaming shows really look good.
[01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:05.700]   In fact, you could tell some of the Apple TV Plus shows like the morning show are shot
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:09.460]   intentionally like a lot of night scenes to show off HDR.
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:12.340]   And the bit rate is so high compared to what we're used to.
[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:13.340]   Oh, interesting.
[01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:14.340]   Okay.
[01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:16.500]   Yeah, the bit rates are stunningly high on.
[01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:17.500]   Better than Netflix.
[01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:18.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:19.500]   Interesting.
[01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:20.500]   Yeah.
[01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:23.060]   I don't even know why they spent so much money on their shows if they're going to compress
[01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:24.060]   them like that.
[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:25.060]   Anyway, they're horrible.
[01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:26.980]   Like I was trying to watch.
[01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:29.460]   I was watching the Irishman and there's all kinds of problems with it.
[01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:30.460]   I'm going to ruin it for a good.
[01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:31.980]   Well, that's some of that was shot film.
[01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:32.980]   Some of it was shot digital.
[01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:34.660]   Yeah, we're almost all about it.
[01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:36.300]   Well, there's some digital because of the CGI.
[01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:37.300]   Yeah.
[01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:38.300]   They're made to make them look younger.
[01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:39.300]   Right.
[01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:43.580]   I mean, they had some augmented a lot of the main plates were shot in my understanding.
[01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:45.180]   I thought I saw that they were using.
[01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:48.780]   They were using digital cameras because they were getting extra angles of the faces
[01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:49.780]   and so on and so forth.
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:51.060]   Oh, I think they were using those.
[01:22:51.060 --> 01:22:52.340]   So the main camera was a film.
[01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:53.340]   I believe so.
[01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:54.980]   I think they were using Panavision cameras for the.
[01:22:54.980 --> 01:23:01.700]   But it looks beautiful and then it's got these, I don't know, at least my version of it seems
[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:06.100]   to have keyframe issues where when it goes from close up to wide, you'll just see a couple
[01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:07.140]   frames that aren't quite right.
[01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:08.700]   And it may be just that I'm really sensitive.
[01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:11.500]   This is why I'm glad I'm not Alex because he can't enjoy a movie.
[01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:16.060]   There's a little frame things and usually that's from and I don't know.
[01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:18.140]   Maybe it's just what I'm getting, but I'm seeing it.
[01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:23.900]   I don't see it anywhere other than that movie where I see, you know, it jumps from a close
[01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:27.860]   up to a wide and when it does that off in the distance, you'll see this little like
[01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:32.580]   reframe reordering that goes on and it drives me crazy, crazy.
[01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:35.660]   And for those of you who watch it and see it now, I'm sorry.
[01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:39.780]   What's the verdict on Apple TV plus?
[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:46.940]   I feel like the shows are good, but there is no show that would drive people to subscribe.
[01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:47.940]   There's no Sopranos.
[01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:48.940]   There's no Game of Thrones.
[01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:49.940]   There's no.
[01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:50.940]   That's like your fate.
[01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:51.940]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:52.940]   They don't have anything quite.
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:53.940]   I got to have it.
[01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:54.940]   Did you try the servant?
[01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:56.940]   Yeah, Leo, I haven't tried it yet.
[01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:57.940]   No, new Shyamalan.
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:24:02.700]   I'm dying to watch that one and that's three episodes of that are out as of Thanksgiving.
[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:03.700]   I can't decide.
[01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:04.700]   That might be the one.
[01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:05.700]   That might be.
[01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:06.700]   I like Morning Show.
[01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:07.700]   It's good enough.
[01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:08.700]   It's not great.
[01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:09.700]   It's okay.
[01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:12.500]   I was really enjoying the little hamfisted.
[01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:15.540]   Yeah, a little hamfisted is a good word for it.
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:19.260]   A little part of that is Jennifer Aniston who really doesn't have a lot of acting range.
[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:21.660]   She seems to be angry or not.
[01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:22.660]   She's not very much.
[01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:24.980]   And this one's just a weekly schedule.
[01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:28.100]   It's been so good because everyone's talking about Mandalorian and Watchmen now and they
[01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:30.700]   would never have been doing that if they just dumped all the episodes.
[01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:31.700]   Perfect timing.
[01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:34.020]   For all mankind, it started great.
[01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:35.820]   It started to lag a little bit for me now.
[01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:39.940]   I haven't watched Sea or a lot of people love Dickinson.
[01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:42.580]   I'm here in surprisingly strong comments.
[01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:43.860]   I heard a lot of good things about it.
[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:46.020]   I can't get myself to even think that I would enjoy it.
[01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:48.380]   I was just looking at it like I own this time for me.
[01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:49.620]   It's an emo poet.
[01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:54.620]   I mean, so far, the only thing that's really hooked my family that's not necessarily Apple
[01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:56.540]   TV is the Mandalorian.
[01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:57.540]   That's Disney Plus.
[01:24:57.540 --> 01:24:59.580]   It's Disney Plus and it looks amazing.
[01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:01.860]   And Disney Plus also streams that are higher quality.
[01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:02.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:03.860]   Okay.
[01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:04.860]   That's great.
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:10.780]   I can't decide whether I hate the fact that I have to wait a week between every episode.
[01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:13.660]   But at the same time, I kind of feel like, well, there's some kind of pacing that goes
[01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:14.660]   on.
[01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:16.660]   We talk about it for a little bit and then we see the next one.
[01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:17.660]   But that's for marketing.
[01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:19.860]   I honestly wait because I don't.
[01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:21.260]   I want to see it in a bundle.
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:22.260]   I don't know.
[01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:23.620]   Binge it because I think spoilers.
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:24.620]   We are very few shows.
[01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:25.620]   I know that's the thing that I worry about.
[01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:27.860]   Very few shows do well if they're spread out week to week.
[01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:30.540]   I think it almost always shows better if you watch it.
[01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:31.540]   I agree.
[01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:34.660]   I think it depends on the nature of it.
[01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:41.060]   I watched the latest series of the crown and that is just such a, it's a river that
[01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:43.820]   flows in a constant stately.
[01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:48.180]   And so it doesn't lose anything by chopping it up week by week.
[01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:54.340]   If anything, the fact that you're the effects of Princess Margaret's behavior two episodes
[01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:57.820]   ago is feeding into what's happening in the episode seeing now.
[01:25:57.820 --> 01:26:02.620]   But then there's the shows like The Melanderlorian where it's like, you kind of want, especially
[01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:07.180]   because the world that you live in, you kind of want a week to fanboy and fan girl out
[01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:12.700]   with everybody else about what you just saw and what might be coming up next week.
[01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:14.260]   You could binge the crown, you know.
[01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:15.260]   It is all available.
[01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:16.260]   Oh, I do.
[01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:17.260]   No, no, that's what I'm saying.
[01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:19.420]   That's why that's why it's good to binge.
[01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:25.620]   I waited a while because I knew that there is no such thing as self control when it comes
[01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:27.500]   to like binging your favorite shows.
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:31.860]   It's like I knew that as soon as I saw, if I just said, well, you know what, it's 11
[01:26:31.860 --> 01:26:32.860]   p.m.
[01:26:32.860 --> 01:26:33.860]   I have to get up early tomorrow.
[01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:36.660]   I'll just like go to, I'll just watch the first episode.
[01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:40.740]   That's like, I'm not going to miss my appointment tomorrow morning because I will not have gone
[01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:41.740]   to bed yet.
[01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:42.740]   I will be on episode.
[01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:46.900]   I'll be watching episode eight, like on my phone on the train on the way over there.
[01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:54.420]   My butt is still sore from Thanksgiving because we not only do we watch three.
[01:26:54.420 --> 01:26:59.540]   Why do you think my butt sore from Thanksgiving because we watch three football games in succession
[01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:02.860]   and then the entire Irishman.
[01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:06.260]   That's 12 solid hours of TV.
[01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:10.060]   And that is my butt sore.
[01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:16.100]   I'm saving the Irishman for like a real like an entire night of the lights are down.
[01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:17.540]   The pop corn made.
[01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:19.540]   Let me make a recommendation.
[01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:21.020]   I did this and I was really glad.
[01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:26.980]   Watch Mean Streets first because that score says he's first in this gangster, you know,
[01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:33.420]   epic that he's been doing with a young 25 year old De Niro young Harvey Keitel.
[01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:35.820]   It's really something to see.
[01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:39.900]   It's not his greatest movie, but it, but, but if you watch it and then you watch the Irishman,
[01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:41.500]   you see how their book ends.
[01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:42.500]   They really go together.
[01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:43.500]   It's the same people.
[01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:45.260]   It's the same idea.
[01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:46.420]   It's really interesting.
[01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:50.420]   I thought you were going to ever, I thought you were going to advise a catheter.
[01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:53.980]   And that's the great thing about I'm so glad they didn't release this.
[01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:58.060]   Well, they did, but I'm that I didn't see it theatrically because it is too long for
[01:27:58.060 --> 01:27:59.060]   theatrical release.
[01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:00.780]   You're going to miss how long is it?
[01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:03.460]   Three, no, three hours, 209 minutes or something.
[01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:04.940]   I find it fascinating.
[01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:10.540]   My kids love watching family feud, which is completely inappropriate for kids.
[01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:11.540]   I didn't really realize that.
[01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:12.540]   It's all in you and you.
[01:28:12.540 --> 01:28:13.540]   They don't know what they're doing.
[01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:14.540]   They're starting to get it.
[01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:16.900]   They're starting to get old enough where they start thinking they're starting to laugh
[01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:18.740]   at all the right places, which really bothers me.
[01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:24.820]   So the, but I just couldn't believe how off family feud has become.
[01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:26.060]   I don't remember being that bad.
[01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:27.060]   Maybe it was always that bad.
[01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:28.060]   Is it sexier than it used to be?
[01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:29.060]   Yeah, it seems like it.
[01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:30.060]   It was really.
[01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:31.060]   It used to be sexy.
[01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:33.020]   We're talking about family feud.
[01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:34.020]   Not sexy.
[01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:35.020]   Risky.
[01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:36.020]   Risky innuendo.
[01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:37.020]   Rich, the innuendo is gotten much.
[01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:38.020]   The hubba.
[01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:39.020]   It does less than you.
[01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:41.380]   You kiss every woman on the lips, which I found disgusting.
[01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:42.380]   Because he doesn't do that.
[01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:43.380]   They don't do that anymore.
[01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:44.380]   No, of course not.
[01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:45.380]   But this is me too.
[01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:46.380]   Yeah, exactly that.
[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:47.380]   But the, anyway.
[01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:49.580]   It was disgusting even then.
[01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:52.860]   But, but it's what I find when he's like, I just remember we, we had to watch and we have
[01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:56.780]   to watch a show because it's on TV right now and you have to watch it live.
[01:28:56.780 --> 01:29:00.260]   And you know, the kids just are just so used to the fact that you just pause it whenever
[01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:01.820]   you need to do something.
[01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:04.940]   And I just realized we just don't have that anymore of that live.
[01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:07.940]   The most used button on my Apple remote is the pause button.
[01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:08.940]   Oh yeah.
[01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:10.580]   I hit that all the time.
[01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:14.700]   Is it easier or harder to get your kids to do their chores or whatever?
[01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:15.860]   Oh, it's easy.
[01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:18.980]   Because you, you, you can just make them watch TV later.
[01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:21.700]   They don't have to sit down and watch the show at a specific time.
[01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:24.980]   There's a whole bunch of chores that need to be done and there's no screen time until
[01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:26.460]   until they are done.
[01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:29.500]   And that, I don't have any problem at all.
[01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:31.580]   Like, you know, like, like there's not, like they know that it's not, like they know
[01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:34.180]   that if they come upstairs and they're on their iPads, the first thing they're going
[01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:36.660]   to ask them is that their rooms clean and their beds are made and they're, you know,
[01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:39.420]   all this stuff and it's always done because they just know that this is.
[01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:40.420]   Daddy is Teddy.
[01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:41.660]   Well, I want to watch TV.
[01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:42.660]   Daddy.
[01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:43.780]   I would say that they can we watch.
[01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:45.660]   Do they call it TV or they call it?
[01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:47.180]   Daddy, we want to watch screen.
[01:29:47.180 --> 01:29:50.100]   No, they say they so-called TV.
[01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:51.100]   The Tel-Vizion.
[01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:55.660]   You know what really makes your Apple TV sing?
[01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:56.660]   Plex.
[01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:59.220]   Oh, baby.
[01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:03.180]   Not just your Apple TV, your Roku, your computer, your iPhone.
[01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:10.020]   Plex puts together all the media you care about in one app on any device, no matter where
[01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:12.620]   you are, it was a lifesaver as we're traveling.
[01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:14.140]   I've got my Plex server running at home.
[01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:18.740]   I've had a Plex Pass lifetime pass for a long time, but so, and I do recommend the lifetime
[01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:21.780]   pass, but even without it, you can use Plex for free.
[01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:27.460]   And it is a great way to organize and stream your personal collection of movies of TV shows.
[01:30:27.460 --> 01:30:29.540]   You drag and drop your files into it.
[01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:33.660]   Plex automatically organizes it, even adds additional features.
[01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:40.100]   So it becomes like a DVD with the extras, cast interviews, trailers behind the scenes
[01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:42.860]   features, but it also has music.
[01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:48.100]   It works with your title, so it even does high res music, your favorite podcasts, web
[01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:51.180]   series, even news now.
[01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:53.740]   Give your media the royal treatment it deserves.
[01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:56.100]   Get yourself a Plex Pass.
[01:30:56.100 --> 01:31:00.820]   Premium features you can bring out the best in whatever media you have with a Plex Pass
[01:31:00.820 --> 01:31:03.140]   and antenna and a tuner.
[01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:04.700]   Forget cable, baby.
[01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:06.020]   Enjoy great TV.
[01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:07.020]   It's a DVR.
[01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:12.580]   You can record free HD broadcasts right into your library.
[01:31:12.580 --> 01:31:13.740]   I am waiting.
[01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:18.740]   I've been waiting for Silicon dust to put out their HD Home Run Prime.
[01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:20.100]   Six tuners.
[01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:22.580]   That is going to be the ultimate Plex machine.
[01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:25.380]   I'm so excited about that.
[01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:28.380]   You get offline accessibility with mobile sync.
[01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:32.460]   You can sync your movie shows, TVs, music and photos to your mobile devices.
[01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:33.620]   Get on the airplane.
[01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:37.740]   I got everything from my DVR on my iPad.
[01:31:37.740 --> 01:31:40.340]   Try to do that with your cable company DVR.
[01:31:40.340 --> 01:31:45.340]   You get premium music, lyrics, custom curated playlists based on your preferences, premium
[01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:46.340]   photos.
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:50.420]   If you put your photos on your Plex server, you get great albums, you can customize, even
[01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:52.140]   share them.
[01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:53.740]   That's another great thing about Plex.
[01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:57.380]   You can share, if you've got a Plex server, you can share your content.
[01:31:57.380 --> 01:31:58.380]   Get cinema.
[01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:02.500]   In fact, you can have different users in the house even.
[01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:06.700]   Your kids can have their Plex account with parental controls turned on.
[01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:08.260]   You can have your Plex account.
[01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:10.660]   Your wife can have her Plex account.
[01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:13.580]   It is a lean back experience second to none.
[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:15.860]   It gets better and better all the time.
[01:32:15.860 --> 01:32:21.260]   When you're a Plex Pass user, you even get advanced access to new features.
[01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:24.220]   When that new, they call it Plex Pass Perks.
[01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:28.700]   When that new UI came out, I had it before anybody else and man, I love it.
[01:32:28.700 --> 01:32:31.740]   You also get promos and discounts on partner products.
[01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:34.460]   There's some more features like loudness leveling.
[01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:39.500]   If you listen to music, you'll love sweet fades, timeline view, advanced audio features.
[01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:41.780]   Are you ready to get a Plex Pass?
[01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:45.460]   I think you really want it and I'm going to get you 10 bucks off the lifetime pass.
[01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:50.620]   This is for new subscribers only when you go to plex.tv/twit and enter the code TWIT10.
[01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:52.580]   It's still even without 10 bucks off.
[01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:53.940]   It's very affordable.
[01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:57.020]   I was happy to play for the lifetime pass when I saw how much it cost.
[01:32:57.020 --> 01:32:59.220]   I said, "Man, I'm going to use this for years."
[01:32:59.220 --> 01:33:00.460]   It's well worth it.
[01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:05.420]   Now you take 10 off when you use the promo code TWIT10 at plex.tv/twit.
[01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:08.980]   Don't forget to use the offer code TWIT10.
[01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:12.860]   They know you heard it on Macbreak Weekly.
[01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:16.140]   We love the Plex.
[01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:22.580]   It's like putting up wine in a cellar.
[01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:26.180]   After two or three or four years, when you realize that I now have the server, I've just
[01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:29.220]   been steadily adding content to.
[01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:34.460]   It not only has everything, but it's organized exactly how I want it to be organized.
[01:33:34.460 --> 01:33:37.300]   Anything I want, I don't have to go through any...
[01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:41.780]   Hey, here's a good Tuesday after Thanksgiving playlist of hots.
[01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:47.060]   It's just I can't recommend it highly enough.
[01:33:47.060 --> 01:33:48.900]   It turned me from someone who didn't...
[01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:53.300]   Who had lots of music in a library, but didn't listen to much of it back when it was all on
[01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:57.820]   iTunes to someone who listens to music every single day and always exactly what I want
[01:33:57.820 --> 01:33:58.820]   to listen to.
[01:33:58.820 --> 01:33:59.820]   Nice.
[01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:00.820]   High recommendation.
[01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:03.700]   Besides that, do you have a pick of the week, Mr. Nunko?
[01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:05.180]   Yes, I do.
[01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:12.540]   It is an upgrade to one of my favorite apps, Daniel Jalkod of Red Sweater Software, has
[01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:19.420]   upgraded his desktop crossword puzzle app to 2.0 Black Ink 2.0.
[01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:25.620]   If you like crossword puzzles, this is going to ruin your entire week because it is exactly
[01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:32.100]   every way that you would like to be able to do crosswords and manage crosswords.
[01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:36.780]   It's not just, "Hey, buy our crossword puzzle pack for $2.99 a week."
[01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:37.780]   It's no.
[01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:43.460]   It is simply like a player, a reader for other crossword puzzle services.
[01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:49.420]   So no matter where you're getting your crosswords from, you can actually use this as your puzzle
[01:34:49.420 --> 01:34:50.580]   app.
[01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:53.380]   And it is so easy to use that you forget that you're using it.
[01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:58.580]   You're just focusing on not being able to finish a Tuesday New York Times crossword puzzle.
[01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:00.020]   Oh, I thank you for this.
[01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:06.500]   I did, while I was on vacation, 25 days, 25 New York Times crosswords.
[01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:08.940]   I love them.
[01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:13.220]   And the New York Times app is pretty good, but I know Daniel, I bet he did a better job,
[01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:14.220]   right?
[01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:16.540]   He's got to give you something a little bit better.
[01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:17.820]   The original was terrific.
[01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:23.260]   And you love to see an app that's been around so long that at some point the developer says,
[01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:24.260]   "You know what?
[01:35:24.260 --> 01:35:26.620]   I'm just going to rebuild this from the ground up because it was great.
[01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:28.940]   It was the app I wrote a long time ago was great.
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:30.340]   But now we've got all these other...
[01:35:30.340 --> 01:35:32.100]   I've learned so much since then.
[01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:34.540]   I've got so many different ways to make it better.
[01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:39.780]   Another way that they've made it better was changing the registration policy, where now
[01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:44.140]   it's totally free as a crossword puzzle getter and filler app.
[01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:46.020]   So it's free for lifetime.
[01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:53.140]   If you pay the rather okay registration fee, then you get the ability to find out what
[01:35:53.140 --> 01:35:57.740]   solutions are, time things, do records of what you're doing.
[01:35:57.740 --> 01:36:02.140]   It's the sort of thing where you kind of, after using it, when I bought the first one,
[01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:06.140]   it was because I used it for a couple of days and said, "I really want him to get a
[01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:07.140]   whole bunch of money from me."
[01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:08.860]   Yeah, that's why I mean, it's 30 bucks.
[01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:14.460]   That's why I would do it because really all I'm doing is downloading the Times puzzles.
[01:36:14.460 --> 01:36:15.620]   And Times will let you do that.
[01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:19.020]   You can download the puzzles and use it in Black Yuck instead of in there.
[01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:20.020]   Good.
[01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:21.020]   That's great.
[01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:26.180]   And what other good crossword sources are there?
[01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:28.420]   I'd have to launch up my app to get it.
[01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:32.020]   I get into a crossword jag like four times a year.
[01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:36.860]   And then I either, then I admit I kind of get beaten down by hubris.
[01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:40.100]   I like, I will just like do the easy ones of that.
[01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:41.100]   Oh, you know what?
[01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:44.780]   I'm going to try the Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Friday, and then I'm like, I think
[01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:46.780]   I need another month to regain myself.
[01:36:46.780 --> 01:36:48.100]   I know exactly.
[01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:52.580]   I got to the point where I could do a Monday in about 10 minutes, I think is my kind of
[01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:54.060]   average time.
[01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:59.620]   But man, it takes by the time you get to Friday, is Saturday harder than Friday?
[01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:00.620]   Or Sunday is the hardest.
[01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:02.460]   Sunday is the, well, it's the biggest.
[01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:05.220]   It takes me about an hour and a half to do a Sunday.
[01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:08.500]   But so they get progressively harder than the New York Times.
[01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:15.300]   The thing I don't like, Thursday has, it's like cutesy games, word games and stuff.
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:19.300]   And it's kind of fun because when you finally figure it out with the trick is you go, oh,
[01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:20.380]   I get it now.
[01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:21.900]   And then it all solves fast.
[01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:24.180]   And that's, and that's another nice thing about it.
[01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:26.300]   We'll also let you just simply print these things out.
[01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:31.940]   There are times where like, if I can't, particularly though the Wednesdays where I feel as though
[01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:36.380]   I have the ability to solve this, if I take more than like a day to do it.
[01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:39.780]   So I will print it out and stick it in like my little hardback notebook that I keep in
[01:37:39.780 --> 01:37:43.060]   my bag so you can keep noodling on it as time goes by.
[01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:47.660]   Like it was meant to be done with a pencil or a pen.
[01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:52.540]   Ed Sweater, Daniel Jalkutt and his updated version, I'm looking at the, it does New
[01:37:52.540 --> 01:37:54.420]   York Times premium.
[01:37:54.420 --> 01:38:01.420]   But there's other crosswords, the American values club, Ashley L.V. Smith, Brenna Emmett
[01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:05.900]   Quigley publishes puzzles of his own creation.
[01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:09.140]   Crossword fiend, fireball crosswords.
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:12.380]   That's from the Peter Gordon, a formerly the sun.
[01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:16.060]   Grids these days, the incubator, McNamara's band.
[01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:17.180]   I've never even heard of these.
[01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:18.740]   I can't wait.
[01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:20.220]   This is great.
[01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:24.260]   Crossword puzzle fans unite.
[01:38:24.260 --> 01:38:25.260]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:38:25.260 --> 01:38:27.220]   I'm going to download it the minute I get home.
[01:38:27.220 --> 01:38:28.740]   Love that idea.
[01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:29.740]   How about you, Ms. Gill?
[01:38:29.740 --> 01:38:31.700]   What do you got for us?
[01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:39.620]   Well, in honor of a post Thanksgiving and upcoming holiday cooking, I have the meter.
[01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:41.980]   Oh, I have one of those.
[01:38:41.980 --> 01:38:43.980]   That's the greatest thing ever.
[01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:45.580]   This thing is amazing.
[01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:47.900]   It's a wireless meat thermometer.
[01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:49.940]   A plug in a near meat.
[01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:54.420]   It has an app on your phone that connects to it.
[01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:59.020]   You can set the temperature that you want the meat to reach, the amount of time you
[01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:00.020]   want it to take.
[01:39:00.020 --> 01:39:05.380]   You can even pick from pre-selected recipes, if you will.
[01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:07.460]   And it's fairly accurate.
[01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:12.100]   The first time I used it, I cooked an entire turkey, a 20-pound turkey with it.
[01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:20.260]   And I judged it off of another really good quality wired thermometer and found that they
[01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:22.460]   were just off within a couple of degrees.
[01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:23.460]   Who knows?
[01:39:23.460 --> 01:39:25.580]   Which one was the more accurate one?
[01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:30.260]   But basically, putting the meter into the meat, I could literally just walk away from
[01:39:30.260 --> 01:39:31.260]   the food.
[01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:35.340]   I didn't feel like I had to check it every few minutes and make sure that it was cooking
[01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:36.860]   up properly.
[01:39:36.860 --> 01:39:37.860]   It's fantastic.
[01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:38.860]   I love it.
[01:39:38.860 --> 01:39:40.540]   I use it all the time.
[01:39:40.540 --> 01:39:42.780]   They make just this gorgeous.
[01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:49.380]   To me, the best part about it is the design of the case that the meter comes in.
[01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:52.020]   The holder that it comes in is so fantastic.
[01:39:52.020 --> 01:39:53.500]   It's so cool.
[01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:59.700]   And it has magnets on the back so you can just stick it to your refrigerator.
[01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:01.020]   It's gorgeous.
[01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:02.860]   I think everybody should have one.
[01:40:02.860 --> 01:40:05.380]   The case charges the thermometer too.
[01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:09.540]   It's like yeah, it has a battery on the back and it charges it.
[01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:17.940]   I have such love for companies that make tech powered kitchen products that are designed
[01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:23.500]   to be used in the kitchen as opposed to people who are used to designing Bluetooth headphones.
[01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:27.540]   And now they're making a kitchen item that it will never be where you need to use it
[01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:30.700]   and it will never survive being kicked around a drawer.
[01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:33.980]   And yeah, that's such a great thing about this thermometer.
[01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:36.820]   Do you have the meter or the meter plus?
[01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:37.820]   I actually have both.
[01:40:37.820 --> 01:40:38.820]   I have the meter.
[01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:40.900]   Right now I've got the meter plus which I haven't used yet.
[01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:41.900]   I just got it.
[01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:46.740]   So I'm going to be checking out the special abilities with the meter plus because I think
[01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:48.740]   it gives you extended range if I'm not mistaken.
[01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:49.740]   Yes, that's what I need.
[01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:50.740]   That's what makes it.
[01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:54.820]   Because when I use it in the grill and I go inside, I lose my meter because it's Bluetooth.
[01:40:54.820 --> 01:40:55.820]   Yeah.
[01:40:55.820 --> 01:40:59.060]   It only gives you I think the normal one only gives you about 30.
[01:40:59.060 --> 01:41:01.140]   And I think the meter plus gives you 50.
[01:41:01.140 --> 01:41:03.380]   What's the maximum temperature?
[01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:04.380]   Better can withstand it.
[01:41:04.380 --> 01:41:06.500]   I cook it in my hot grill like 700 degrees.
[01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:07.500]   I don't.
[01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:08.500]   Yeah.
[01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:10.340]   I've barbecued with it.
[01:41:10.340 --> 01:41:11.340]   I've grilled with it.
[01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:12.340]   Yeah.
[01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:17.940]   I don't know how they do it because my grill is so hot when I use the chimney to start
[01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:18.940]   the coals.
[01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:19.940]   It's bright red.
[01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:23.060]   I feel like I'm a blacksmith taking it out of the forge.
[01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:28.180]   I want to get my hammer and of course they're always have I don't know why they do this on
[01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:29.500]   those chimneys that you start grills with.
[01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:32.940]   They have plastic handles that melt the first time I use it every single time.
[01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:33.940]   Right.
[01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:35.660]   I get a little bottle of plastic.
[01:41:35.660 --> 01:41:37.260]   I had one with a wood handle.
[01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:38.260]   And that's a fire.
[01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:39.260]   A cut fire.
[01:41:39.260 --> 01:41:40.260]   You can't win meter.
[01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:41.260]   It is a I completely agree with you, Laurie.
[01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:42.260]   I'm going to get the new one.
[01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:43.260]   That's really exciting.
[01:41:43.260 --> 01:41:44.260]   MEATER.
[01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:53.020]   And look for people who cook a lot of meat.
[01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:55.740]   They got the four meter pack.
[01:41:55.740 --> 01:41:56.740]   Look at that.
[01:41:56.740 --> 01:41:57.740]   That's pretty awesome.
[01:41:57.740 --> 01:41:58.740]   Very Canadian.
[01:41:58.740 --> 01:41:59.740]   I'm sure why anyone needs four.
[01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:01.540]   But there you go.
[01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:04.500]   It's a it's two hundred twenty eight bucks.
[01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:06.140]   So you must cook a lot of meat, I guess.
[01:42:06.140 --> 01:42:07.140]   I don't know.
[01:42:07.140 --> 01:42:08.140]   Interesting.
[01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:13.460]   Parallel processing of your meat cooking.
[01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:16.260]   Renee Richie, pick of the week.
[01:42:16.260 --> 01:42:20.700]   So peak design who makes a lot of really popular backpacks, especially for people in
[01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:23.820]   our industry, is release their second generation bags.
[01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:25.620]   Unfortunately, their website is down.
[01:42:25.620 --> 01:42:30.860]   They're doing part of the 72 company carbon correction movement thing.
[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:35.100]   But the verge has everything from that website plastered across their site.
[01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:37.380]   So I put the link for that in there instead.
[01:42:37.380 --> 01:42:41.180]   But they just they took a lot of input from a lot of people who have been using these
[01:42:41.180 --> 01:42:42.620]   bags a lot of times.
[01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:47.820]   And they've done things like improve the comfort of the shoulder straps, just the general design
[01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:48.820]   of the bag.
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:53.700]   It was always just a little bit tight if you wanted to put like a laptop and a iPad in
[01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:56.940]   there and they fixed just a lot of those things.
[01:42:56.940 --> 01:42:59.380]   I am still a huge proponent of backpacks.
[01:42:59.380 --> 01:43:03.140]   I don't like messengers because they pull your spine in two different directions.
[01:43:03.140 --> 01:43:06.980]   And if you use them a lot with heavy things, you will inevitably have posture problems
[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:07.980]   late in life.
[01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:10.380]   And I would love to spare anybody that sort of pain.
[01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:15.140]   So a really good backpack has got better hip support, better everything.
[01:43:15.140 --> 01:43:20.580]   And it has that sort of stylish YouTuber blogger credibility that is absolutely so important
[01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:21.740]   in our industry.
[01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:23.780]   I use a peeks camera straps.
[01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:26.780]   They're like seat belts on all my cameras.
[01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:29.300]   And they have a hand strap that I use as well.
[01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:30.540]   I really like.
[01:43:30.540 --> 01:43:36.580]   And like retcon five in our chat room, I have ordered the peak travel tripod.
[01:43:36.580 --> 01:43:37.780]   We're all still waiting for it.
[01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:38.780]   I have to.
[01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:43.940]   Yeah, it's expensive, but I love the idea because it's very compact.
[01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:45.900]   It was a peak site is down.
[01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:46.900]   I wonder if I could see it.
[01:43:46.900 --> 01:43:50.060]   But apparently it's better for cat for stills than video.
[01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:52.860]   I don't know what that means yet, but that's what I've been hearing.
[01:43:52.860 --> 01:43:54.780]   I don't know what that means either.
[01:43:54.780 --> 01:43:55.780]   I don't know.
[01:43:55.780 --> 01:43:56.780]   Is it a fluid head?
[01:43:56.780 --> 01:43:57.780]   Maybe a thousand.
[01:43:57.780 --> 01:43:58.860]   I don't know what that means.
[01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:00.500]   I don't know what the head is.
[01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:01.500]   The idea is great.
[01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:02.500]   It's not a fluid head.
[01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:03.500]   It's not a fluid head.
[01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:05.460]   Oh, so you can't pan.
[01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:07.860]   It's usually what cares about that.
[01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:08.860]   Right.
[01:44:08.860 --> 01:44:10.380]   That's usually what people.
[01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:13.660]   This looks like a really cool, it's expensive.
[01:44:13.660 --> 01:44:19.140]   But I guess we'll all have one when it comes.
[01:44:19.140 --> 01:44:22.500]   Alex, I left the most expensive for last.
[01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:24.340]   Alex, I don't know.
[01:44:24.340 --> 01:44:25.740]   It's not that expensive.
[01:44:25.740 --> 01:44:26.780]   It's not that bad.
[01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:30.220]   So this is the Blackmagic ATEM Mini.
[01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:36.620]   And this is actually a nod to our earlier conversation before the show about getting
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:38.180]   your camera into the computer.
[01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:41.380]   So Renee was talking about this.
[01:44:41.380 --> 01:44:44.380]   So this is a switcher.
[01:44:44.380 --> 01:44:46.540]   And it is super small.
[01:44:46.540 --> 01:44:49.700]   And for the price and for the size, super powerful.
[01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:50.700]   So this is--
[01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:51.700]   So four cameras switcher.
[01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:53.740]   You can do four cameras, four HDMI cameras.
[01:44:53.740 --> 01:44:56.580]   It doesn't have SDIN, which is fine for a lot of people.
[01:44:56.580 --> 01:45:02.620]   You have an HDMI out, but more importantly, of a USB out, and that USB will act as a webcam.
[01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:06.740]   So it will look like a webcam when it goes into your computer.
[01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:08.140]   So now you can see.
[01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:09.140]   Oh.
[01:45:09.140 --> 01:45:10.140]   Yeah.
[01:45:10.140 --> 01:45:11.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:45:11.140 --> 01:45:14.460]   Well, this is the ultimate for the home vlogger podcast.
[01:45:14.460 --> 01:45:18.700]   Well, not only that, I kind of think that we should get them all for all of us because
[01:45:18.700 --> 01:45:20.660]   it means that you could be switching between all your inputs.
[01:45:20.660 --> 01:45:21.660]   I think so too.
[01:45:21.660 --> 01:45:22.660]   Yeah.
[01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:26.980]   Because because it shows up as a webcam, it means that Skype can see it and Zoom.
[01:45:26.980 --> 01:45:28.220]   And everything else.
[01:45:28.220 --> 01:45:33.900]   So if you're doing it, if you want to impress people for your next Skype call or your next
[01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:41.020]   pitch, little pitch or whatever over anything, whether it's meet or hangouts, Skype, Zoom,
[01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:43.340]   or have Wi-Fi transitions.
[01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:44.340]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:45.340]   Picture and picture.
[01:45:45.340 --> 01:45:48.060]   It's got a single-- it's got a downstream key here.
[01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:50.820]   So you could add little lower thirds.
[01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:54.020]   But again, a lot of times, if you're trying to just do a little training or you're doing
[01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:56.740]   a presentation, this is the way to do that.
[01:45:56.740 --> 01:46:01.460]   Like enough of the little software tools that come with all these devices, they're not nearly
[01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:03.340]   going to do what this does.
[01:46:03.340 --> 01:46:07.980]   You still have the full, basically the ATEM controller, which can just be software control.
[01:46:07.980 --> 01:46:12.020]   You could actually hook an entire switcher, you know, switcher control surface up to
[01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:13.020]   it.
[01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:20.180]   But you can also use just the-- just a laptop or even an iPad to run it as far as switching.
[01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:24.260]   And of course, because it's hardware, you can just simply tap on the keys to switch.
[01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:33.020]   And this is just a great little switcher to allow you to actually be able to put together
[01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:34.020]   something simple.
[01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:39.500]   It's not a replacement for the bigger switchers that I've used by Blackmagic.
[01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:43.660]   But if this is the thing that I've attempted to carry around, if I was still doing as many
[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:48.820]   hangouts-- so we did all these over 1,000 hangouts, this is what I would have sent out.
[01:46:48.820 --> 01:46:50.820]   And the value is 300 bucks.
[01:46:50.820 --> 01:46:51.820]   Oh my god.
[01:46:51.820 --> 01:46:52.820]   Holy cuts.
[01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:53.820]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:56.100]   It says secret broadcast features built in.
[01:46:56.100 --> 01:46:57.100]   What is it?
[01:46:57.100 --> 01:46:58.100]   Secret?
[01:46:58.100 --> 01:46:59.100]   Did it say secret?
[01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:00.100]   Yeah.
[01:47:00.100 --> 01:47:02.260]   ATEM Mini even has secret broadcast features built in so it could do high-end work.
[01:47:02.260 --> 01:47:03.260]   But I don't know what those--
[01:47:03.260 --> 01:47:04.540]   Well, I don't know if it's secret.
[01:47:04.540 --> 01:47:07.300]   But I mean, it has a ChromaKey built in.
[01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:09.500]   It's got a lower third-- yeah, a basic ChromaKey.
[01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:13.140]   It's not their-- their ultimate technology, but it's good.
[01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:14.140]   So you'd have one.
[01:47:14.140 --> 01:47:18.380]   You'd have to hook up to a computer, a single, but two-shot.
[01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:19.380]   Exactly.
[01:47:19.380 --> 01:47:20.380]   And then what else?
[01:47:20.380 --> 01:47:21.380]   I don't know.
[01:47:21.380 --> 01:47:22.620]   You could have the picture out your window.
[01:47:22.620 --> 01:47:23.620]   Well, yeah.
[01:47:23.620 --> 01:47:24.620]   Or an overhead.
[01:47:24.620 --> 01:47:25.620]   Like if you're doing a training--
[01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:26.620]   Overhead.
[01:47:26.620 --> 01:47:28.540]   --over doing a cooking stream or something like that, you can have your little micro
[01:47:28.540 --> 01:47:30.420]   that's up above pointed down at it.
[01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:33.060]   But mics are audio jacks, analog audio jacks.
[01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:35.020]   They're little 3.5 audio jacks.
[01:47:35.020 --> 01:47:36.860]   And so they're fine.
[01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:41.300]   I mean, for something basic, you're going to be able to-- you could hook a mic up to
[01:47:41.300 --> 01:47:44.580]   it and you know, one of the little less expensive mics.
[01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:46.860]   I mean, this is not built to replace--
[01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:48.500]   You could even hook a USB mic to it.
[01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:49.980]   Or could you hook it up to your computer?
[01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:53.060]   You could hook the USB mic up to your computer and have the only challenge you'd have there
[01:47:53.060 --> 01:47:54.060]   is sync.
[01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:55.060]   Right.
[01:47:55.060 --> 01:47:58.140]   So you just got to make sure that the app that you're using can allow you to make-- adjust
[01:47:58.140 --> 01:47:59.620]   your audio sync.
[01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:05.060]   By going straight into the switcher, you're ensuring that it's going to stay in sync.
[01:48:05.060 --> 01:48:07.660]   And so anyway, it's 1080p.
[01:48:07.660 --> 01:48:11.820]   So it for most things is great.
[01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:12.820]   I could actually--
[01:48:12.820 --> 01:48:16.300]   I don't use more than four cameras on the tech.
[01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:18.140]   Nice to do the whole thing.
[01:48:18.140 --> 01:48:20.860]   And it's super small, super easy to use.
[01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:25.300]   The other thing that's interesting is that it's still using the same backbone that all
[01:48:25.300 --> 01:48:26.300]   the other switchers use.
[01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:28.740]   So all the APIs and everything else are all there.
[01:48:28.740 --> 01:48:30.300]   So you can run the switcher.
[01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:35.460]   If you want to write code, you can customize a lot of what it does and build your own little
[01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:36.460]   buttons.
[01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:41.260]   It works with-- and we do that a lot with the bigger switchers where we have-- we build
[01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:42.860]   custom buttons that do certain things.
[01:48:42.860 --> 01:48:45.620]   So you can run the ATEM software on a Mac.
[01:48:45.620 --> 01:48:46.620]   Or PC.
[01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:47.620]   Or PC.
[01:48:47.620 --> 01:48:48.620]   Not iPad though.
[01:48:48.620 --> 01:48:51.580]   There's iPad apps that use the API.
[01:48:51.580 --> 01:48:53.620]   So there are ways to control it with an iPad.
[01:48:53.620 --> 01:48:56.660]   And I think even an iPhone, I'm not sure.
[01:48:56.660 --> 01:48:59.060]   So there are iOS apps that people have written.
[01:48:59.060 --> 01:49:01.620]   They're not Blackmagic apps.
[01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:02.780]   But it's using the same thing.
[01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:05.820]   And so the great thing also is that if you start with this and then you go, "Okay, now
[01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:09.380]   I want a bigger switcher," the interface is-- you're not going to learn a new interface
[01:49:09.380 --> 01:49:10.380]   or a new switcher.
[01:49:10.380 --> 01:49:13.220]   You're just going to take all the stuff that you already know how to do and do it.
[01:49:13.220 --> 01:49:16.140]   So it's a pretty-- it's an incredible value.
[01:49:16.140 --> 01:49:20.700]   I mean, it's probably one of the best video values I've seen ever.
[01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:21.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:23.060]   Over 300 bucks.
[01:49:23.060 --> 01:49:27.340]   And again, one of the big things is the fact that it-- it's just a USB camera to your
[01:49:27.340 --> 01:49:28.340]   computer.
[01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:31.980]   So if you're using OBS or Wirecast or Skype or all these other things, you just simply
[01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:32.980]   plug it in.
[01:49:32.980 --> 01:49:35.580]   Even if you only had one camera, this is-- this would solve Renee.
[01:49:35.580 --> 01:49:41.980]   This kind of solves your camera issue, where even just one camera, it'll just come in as
[01:49:41.980 --> 01:49:46.900]   a-- you can use it and it should work just fine with your camera.
[01:49:46.900 --> 01:49:48.580]   But you can start adding other cameras.
[01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:51.860]   If you want to show us a close-up of whatever you're recommending or you want to jump to
[01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:56.500]   a screen or you want to do a-- there's a variety of things you can do there.
[01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:57.500]   So it's pretty much--
[01:49:57.500 --> 01:50:01.500]   What would you recommend as the cameras?
[01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:03.460]   Because it's HDMI, right?
[01:50:03.460 --> 01:50:07.260]   So you want a camera like our VIXI is that we use, they have HDMI out.
[01:50:07.260 --> 01:50:10.260]   We actually have to put a converter on it and switch it to SDI.
[01:50:10.260 --> 01:50:15.060]   Yeah, the good news is that they-- you can use these less expensive cameras.
[01:50:15.060 --> 01:50:17.940]   I mean, for me, I really like the micros.
[01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:23.220]   The micro-- there's the micro 4K, which is what I have a bunch of.
[01:50:23.220 --> 01:50:27.900]   But you can also get there's a 1080p version for like $1,000 that are these little micro
[01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:30.380]   studio cameras.
[01:50:30.380 --> 01:50:32.540]   They're almost the size of a webcam.
[01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:33.540]   So they're black magic.
[01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:34.860]   So they're small.
[01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:39.260]   And here's the thing is you're kind of growing in that ecosystem.
[01:50:39.260 --> 01:50:43.900]   So those cameras you'll keep on using, you could use them for your little studio, but
[01:50:43.900 --> 01:50:52.260]   you can-- we use them on huge events as witness cameras and overhead cameras and crowd cameras.
[01:50:52.260 --> 01:50:54.740]   So there's a lot of different ways to do that.
[01:50:54.740 --> 01:50:56.740]   That's what I would probably instantly go to.
[01:50:56.740 --> 01:51:01.740]   Those are four-thirds chips.
[01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:06.380]   For a lot of the stuff that I do, I use those as kind of like the close-ups over the table
[01:51:06.380 --> 01:51:10.460]   or that type of thing.
[01:51:10.460 --> 01:51:12.900]   It is not currently available.
[01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:13.900]   It might be back-ordered.
[01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:15.580]   You have to-- that's as pre-ordered.
[01:51:15.580 --> 01:51:16.580]   They're shipping.
[01:51:16.580 --> 01:51:21.020]   I mean, they're shipping, but the demand was-- they showed them off at IBC in September
[01:51:21.020 --> 01:51:22.380]   and the demand has been--
[01:51:22.380 --> 01:51:23.380]   Oh, okay.
[01:51:23.380 --> 01:51:25.380]   If you're not Alex, you have to wait a little while.
[01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:28.540]   There's a lot of people that want the switcher.
[01:51:28.540 --> 01:51:30.740]   Just keep talking because I'm working at it right now.
[01:51:30.740 --> 01:51:36.540]   I mean, I was prepared to mute the audio before you said the price because I didn't want
[01:51:36.540 --> 01:51:37.540]   to get my heart broken.
[01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:41.700]   I know the thing that Alex has that I deeply want but can't afford.
[01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:45.940]   But now we've got that weasel in my head saying, "We have $300.
[01:51:45.940 --> 01:51:48.340]   We're going to make another $300 very quickly."
[01:51:48.340 --> 01:51:50.340]   We can pick up on this.
[01:51:50.340 --> 01:51:51.740]   And then I can get two of them.
[01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:52.740]   Yeah.
[01:51:52.740 --> 01:51:53.740]   The hardest part will be to wait.
[01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:55.740]   You're going to have to buy new cameras.
[01:51:55.740 --> 01:51:58.020]   Blackmagic has been hitting on all cylinders.
[01:51:58.020 --> 01:52:00.860]   And so generally, everything they release now is back-ordered forever.
[01:52:00.860 --> 01:52:01.860]   Yeah.
[01:52:01.860 --> 01:52:04.180]   It took me a month and a half to get my 6K camera.
[01:52:04.180 --> 01:52:07.260]   VNH says, "New item coming soon."
[01:52:07.260 --> 01:52:09.380]   But that's often what VNH says.
[01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:10.740]   There are people that have them in the wild.
[01:52:10.740 --> 01:52:11.980]   So they're out there.
[01:52:11.980 --> 01:52:17.420]   But again, they're not in large quantity yet.
[01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:23.900]   But it's a great-- again, for business presentations, for classes, for small video stuff, it's an
[01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:25.700]   amazing little switcher.
[01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:26.700]   Wow.
[01:52:26.700 --> 01:52:31.700]   I'm going to get one so that when Lisa and I are going to do our home podcast--
[01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:32.700]   Yep.
[01:52:32.700 --> 01:52:33.700]   That's it.
[01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:35.700]   We could do it on the cash encounter.
[01:52:35.700 --> 01:52:40.260]   And Leo, I don't give out compliments easily.
[01:52:40.260 --> 01:52:45.820]   But I'm going to say that your idea to buy one of these for all of us that you've had
[01:52:45.820 --> 01:52:51.700]   is a typical of the brilliance and forethought that has led to--
[01:52:51.700 --> 01:52:54.700]   Fortunately, Lisa stops me whenever I try to do something like that.
[01:52:54.700 --> 01:52:55.700]   That's why--
[01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:56.700]   Maybe we will, actually.
[01:52:56.700 --> 01:53:01.500]   But that's a good-- if you can make a strong case for it, I think you probably can.
[01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:02.700]   Because you had-- what was it?
[01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:03.700]   Crane Cam 3,000.
[01:53:03.700 --> 01:53:04.700]   Crane Cam 3,000.
[01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:06.180]   Crane Cam 3,000.
[01:53:06.180 --> 01:53:09.700]   Also, podcasts in a sack, 1.0.
[01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:12.700]   That's going to be coming back when the weather--
[01:53:12.700 --> 01:53:13.700]   And also the--
[01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:15.100]   The power requirements very low.
[01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:17.700]   I mean, for something like CES, it could be a good little mobile.
[01:53:17.700 --> 01:53:19.700]   You could literally be switching.
[01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:21.500]   Do you mind if I set up my switcher?
[01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:22.500]   But it's not.
[01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:26.460]   Literally, we've done ones where we've gone mobile with it, where we needed something
[01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:33.940]   that small, where we've done live use, and we have-- we did a shoot that had four wireless
[01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:35.940]   cameras coming back to a little switcher.
[01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:37.420]   And the timer was using an Apollo--
[01:53:37.420 --> 01:53:38.420]   It increases.
[01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:39.420]   We're going to do shows out in the field.
[01:53:39.420 --> 01:53:41.380]   And we know we can't take a switcher with us.
[01:53:41.380 --> 01:53:44.980]   But if we had something-- this is-- it sounds like it's relatively portable.
[01:53:44.980 --> 01:53:45.980]   It's very portable.
[01:53:45.980 --> 01:53:46.980]   Yeah.
[01:53:46.980 --> 01:53:47.980]   Could throw in my suitcase.
[01:53:47.980 --> 01:53:49.380]   We have to-- I don't know.
[01:53:49.380 --> 01:53:50.380]   We should think about it.
[01:53:50.380 --> 01:53:51.380]   We have to bring some--
[01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:55.140]   Seriously, for someone like-- not for me, but for someone like you or for someone like
[01:53:55.140 --> 01:54:00.540]   Renee, particularly for $300, you could almost buy it and just have a standing buy.
[01:54:00.540 --> 01:54:01.540]   And then--
[01:54:01.540 --> 01:54:02.540]   Yeah.
[01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:05.900]   On three days notice, oh my god, thank god I have this thing because that's the perfect--
[01:54:05.900 --> 01:54:08.500]   that makes everything so simple.
[01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:12.180]   I think Renee's been quiet because I think he's been ordering this while we were talking.
[01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:13.180]   No.
[01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:14.180]   Confession.
[01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:18.660]   Surgeh and Larry just retired and handed the company over to Sunjarpachai.
[01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:21.180]   And I've been reading-- I was reading their new founders letter.
[01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:22.180]   Oh my goodness.
[01:54:22.180 --> 01:54:23.180]   They've retired.
[01:54:23.180 --> 01:54:26.180]   The founders of Google have retired.
[01:54:26.180 --> 01:54:29.180]   I wonder what we're going to talk about tomorrow.
[01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:30.180]   I wonder what we're going to talk about tomorrow.
[01:54:30.180 --> 01:54:35.180]   There is a letter from Larry and Sergey, our very first founders letter began.
[01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:37.500]   And so that's interesting.
[01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:39.180]   They're both retiring at the same time.
[01:54:39.180 --> 01:54:41.180]   I think they're both just tired of these--
[01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:45.780]   What is Larry-- is Larry the-- technically the chairman of Alphabet?
[01:54:45.780 --> 01:54:46.780]   What is his role bit?
[01:54:46.780 --> 01:54:50.380]   They were-- Sunjarp was running Google and they were running Alphabet and now Sunjarp
[01:54:50.380 --> 01:54:52.380]   is just going to run everything.
[01:54:52.380 --> 01:54:57.100]   Sunjarpachai promoted to CEO of Alphabet.
[01:54:57.100 --> 01:55:04.380]   And Larry and Sergey off to land on Mars or whatever it is they want to do next.
[01:55:04.380 --> 01:55:06.380]   Well, he's been so terrific.
[01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:07.380]   He's really good.
[01:55:07.380 --> 01:55:09.380]   He's still-- Larry and Sergey were still around.
[01:55:09.380 --> 01:55:11.140]   Yeah, he's really good.
[01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:17.460]   And people like Ruth Porat, their CFO, have really-- they've kind of moved to the foreground
[01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:21.260]   as Sergey gets weirder and weirder and Larry can't talk.
[01:55:21.260 --> 01:55:22.260]   It really seems like--
[01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:23.260]   Yeah, he said health issues.
[01:55:23.260 --> 01:55:26.140]   Yeah, it really seems like this is probably a good thing to do.
[01:55:26.140 --> 01:55:27.900]   And they both have more money than God.
[01:55:27.900 --> 01:55:32.620]   So I'm sure they'll do something wild in the future.
[01:55:32.620 --> 01:55:33.620]   Founder up.
[01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:34.140]   Yeah.
[01:55:34.140 --> 01:55:37.420]   And I think they're actually angel investors for God's next startup.
[01:55:37.420 --> 01:55:39.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:55:39.820 --> 01:55:43.940]   Sunjarp brings-- they write humility and a deep passion for technology to our users,
[01:55:43.940 --> 01:55:46.020]   partners, and our employees every day.
[01:55:46.020 --> 01:55:49.860]   He's worked closely with us for 15 years through the formation of Alphabet as CEO of
[01:55:49.860 --> 01:55:52.540]   Google and a member of the Alphabet board of directors.
[01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:56.140]   He shares our confidence and the value of the Alphabet structure.
[01:55:56.140 --> 01:56:00.020]   That's important because, of course, Google has a very odd setup.
[01:56:00.020 --> 01:56:05.260]   And the ability it provides us to tackle big challenges through technology.
[01:56:05.260 --> 01:56:08.740]   There's no one that we've relied on more since Alphabet was founded and no better personally
[01:56:08.740 --> 01:56:11.340]   Google and Alphabet into the future.
[01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:12.260]   We are deeply humbled.
[01:56:12.260 --> 01:56:15.980]   We've seen a small research project develop into a source of knowledge and empowerment.
[01:56:15.980 --> 01:56:17.420]   We've learned for buildings.
[01:56:17.420 --> 01:56:18.420]   Billions.
[01:56:18.420 --> 01:56:22.420]   A bet we made is two Stanford students that led to a multitude of other technology bets
[01:56:22.420 --> 01:56:24.420]   we could not have imagined.
[01:56:24.420 --> 01:56:30.140]   It's not even been that long back in 1998, 21 years ago, when we moved our servers from
[01:56:30.140 --> 01:56:33.420]   a dorm room to a garage, the journey that would follow.
[01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:34.420]   Wow.
[01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:37.700]   That is a big shift and a big change.
[01:56:37.700 --> 01:56:41.740]   And of course, it comes as Google's facing a lot of headwinds from its own employees,
[01:56:41.740 --> 01:56:47.980]   from government and even in the marketplace, frankly.
[01:56:47.980 --> 01:56:51.380]   So I can understand why they might want to say, yeah, maybe it's time to let somebody
[01:56:51.380 --> 01:56:52.380]   else.
[01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:53.380]   It's a stress.
[01:56:53.380 --> 01:56:54.700]   It's more time with their families and their families want to spend more time with their
[01:56:54.700 --> 01:56:55.700]   money.
[01:56:55.700 --> 01:56:56.700]   So it's a good bet.
[01:56:56.700 --> 01:56:59.740]   I'm always surprised when someone has $50 billion and things get complicated.
[01:56:59.740 --> 01:57:02.660]   I'm like, yeah, how much money does anybody need you?
[01:57:02.660 --> 01:57:05.100]   I would have been with a lot of the money that I would have done.
[01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:06.380]   I had that much money I'd be dead by now.
[01:57:06.380 --> 01:57:08.380]   I would have liked wanted to fly my own 747.
[01:57:08.380 --> 01:57:11.700]   I just want to point out this is why we are all not the founders of mega.
[01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:12.700]   Exactly.
[01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:13.700]   Exactly.
[01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:18.340]   You know, it takes a certain drive and ambition that exceeds how much money you have in your
[01:57:18.340 --> 01:57:19.340]   bank account.
[01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:20.340]   Hey, I'm still young.
[01:57:20.340 --> 01:57:21.340]   I'm just saying.
[01:57:21.340 --> 01:57:22.340]   You could be.
[01:57:22.340 --> 01:57:25.180]   Sickburn Incorporated, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:25.180 --> 01:57:26.180]   You heard it here first.
[01:57:26.180 --> 01:57:31.700]   That's Lori Gill, managing editor at iMore, alcoholic on the Twitter lead singer from
[01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:33.780]   Japan sensation, Sickburn.
[01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:35.860]   It's great to have you on the show.
[01:57:35.860 --> 01:57:37.340]   And you're going to be back on Thursday.
[01:57:37.340 --> 01:57:38.500]   You're going to drive down.
[01:57:38.500 --> 01:57:41.140]   Finally, I've never met you in person.
[01:57:41.140 --> 01:57:42.140]   I'm excited.
[01:57:42.140 --> 01:57:47.420]   It's going to be right here at the round table, along with Mary Jo Foley and Stacey Higginbotham.
[01:57:47.420 --> 01:57:48.420]   They're all coming out.
[01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:50.980]   We're going to do our annual Christmas show.
[01:57:50.980 --> 01:57:54.660]   And this year, it is the end of a decade, not merely the end of a year.
[01:57:54.660 --> 01:58:00.380]   So I think looking back on the decade, the 2010s will be the mission statement for our
[01:58:00.380 --> 01:58:01.380]   end of year episode.
[01:58:01.380 --> 01:58:06.220]   We'll be taping it live 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern, 2200 UTC.
[01:58:06.220 --> 01:58:08.300]   On Thursday, you'll be able to watch us tape live.
[01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:13.020]   And then we release it a few days before Christmas, I think December, what is it, 23rd?
[01:58:13.020 --> 01:58:14.020]   Carsten, what do we decide?
[01:58:14.020 --> 01:58:15.020]   I came here 22nd.
[01:58:15.020 --> 01:58:16.020]   22nd.
[01:58:16.020 --> 01:58:17.020]   Our holiday episode.
[01:58:17.020 --> 01:58:22.020]   And then of course, it's our best of on December 29th.
[01:58:22.020 --> 01:58:25.140]   We give everybody a little time off to enjoy the holidays.
[01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:26.820]   So I'll see you Thursday, Lori.
[01:58:26.820 --> 01:58:27.860]   Yes, I'm excited.
[01:58:27.860 --> 01:58:29.460]   That's because I'm a lot of fun.
[01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:35.620]   Alex Lindsey, he is the man at PixelCore.com also at Alex Lindsey on the Twitter.
[01:58:35.620 --> 01:58:39.260]   We're love having you back in studio for at least a little bit before you take your
[01:58:39.260 --> 01:58:40.660]   ATEMs back on the road.
[01:58:40.660 --> 01:58:43.220]   We will see you next time.
[01:58:43.220 --> 01:58:44.980]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:48.700]   Andy Inaco, when are you going to be on GBH?
[01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:50.660]   This week I'm going to be on Thursday.
[01:58:50.660 --> 01:58:53.820]   And I guess half of it's going to be about Google.
[01:58:53.820 --> 01:58:56.900]   And you just got your mandate, didn't you?
[01:58:56.900 --> 01:59:00.980]   Yeah, this is like I wasn't, I wasn't paying as close attention as Renee was.
[01:59:00.980 --> 01:59:03.700]   So now a lot of things on my docket have just shifted.
[01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:11.060]   So on the plus side, I maybe don't have to read the 380 something pages of PDFs of research
[01:59:11.060 --> 01:59:15.260]   papers that I had downloaded for another topic that I was going to be discussing on Thursday.
[01:59:15.260 --> 01:59:21.180]   I think we all remember when Google started effective Vorek at the time used it as a litmus
[01:59:21.180 --> 01:59:22.460]   test for geeks.
[01:59:22.460 --> 01:59:24.020]   He said, watch your favorite search engine.
[01:59:24.020 --> 01:59:27.780]   And if you said Alton Vista and not Google, then he knew you were really serious.
[01:59:27.780 --> 01:59:31.460]   I remember when we battled for Gmail beta invites.
[01:59:31.460 --> 01:59:35.500]   For you to get in the Gmail beta and people were selling on eBay.
[01:59:35.500 --> 01:59:41.420]   My favorite memory of Larry and Sergey is having lunch with them in San Francisco down
[01:59:41.420 --> 01:59:45.980]   in that what is the park where Twitter, Twitter is South Park.
[01:59:45.980 --> 01:59:51.060]   They were, Google was so new, they were still inviting tech journalists to come to lunch
[01:59:51.060 --> 01:59:56.100]   with Larry and Sergey to meet them and find out more about this new search engine called
[01:59:56.100 --> 01:59:57.100]   what?
[01:59:57.100 --> 01:59:59.460]   Google.
[01:59:59.460 --> 02:00:02.020]   And I'll never forget that it was quite an event.
[02:00:02.020 --> 02:00:05.580]   And now in hindsight, it was the beginning of something very special.
[02:00:05.580 --> 02:00:07.420]   And of course Sergey jumping out of that plane.
[02:00:07.420 --> 02:00:08.980]   Can you remember that?
[02:00:08.980 --> 02:00:09.980]   Yeah, that was crazy.
[02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:10.980]   He had a Google I/O.
[02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:11.980]   Yeah.
[02:00:11.980 --> 02:00:12.980]   Or was it a Google Gino?
[02:00:12.980 --> 02:00:13.980]   He didn't jump out of the plane.
[02:00:13.980 --> 02:00:14.980]   He had everybody else did.
[02:00:14.980 --> 02:00:17.260]   He was on the roof, though, in his rocket suit.
[02:00:17.260 --> 02:00:18.260]   For Google Glasses.
[02:00:18.260 --> 02:00:20.860]   That was the Google Glass reveal.
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:23.060]   And his five tow vibrams.
[02:00:23.060 --> 02:00:24.060]   Yes.
[02:00:24.060 --> 02:00:25.060]   He's a character.
[02:00:25.060 --> 02:00:26.060]   He's a character.
[02:00:26.060 --> 02:00:27.060]   Yes.
[02:00:27.060 --> 02:00:28.060]   Mr. Renee Ritchie.
[02:00:28.060 --> 02:00:29.060]   You can.
[02:00:29.060 --> 02:00:35.700]   I bet you vector will have a topic today that'll be a little different at imore.com/vector.
[02:00:35.700 --> 02:00:36.700]   That's his video podcast.
[02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:39.620]   Of course, he is in charge over there at imore.com.
[02:00:39.620 --> 02:00:41.900]   It's great to have you on the show.
[02:00:41.900 --> 02:00:45.180]   All the way from Sonny Montreal.
[02:00:45.180 --> 02:00:51.460]   Ladies and gentlemen, we do this show every Tuesday, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:00:51.460 --> 02:00:53.020]   1900 UTC.
[02:00:53.020 --> 02:00:54.020]   No.
[02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:58.020]   11 a.m. plus 1800 UTC.
[02:00:58.020 --> 02:00:59.620]   If you want to watch live, you can.

[02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:05.340]   If you're doing that, chat with us at irc.twit.tv.
[02:01:05.340 --> 02:01:08.340]   There was a question on the hacker news this morning.
[02:01:08.340 --> 02:01:10.460]   Does anybody still use IRC?
[02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:11.460]   We do.
[02:01:11.460 --> 02:01:12.460]   We do.
[02:01:12.460 --> 02:01:13.460]   We do.
[02:01:13.460 --> 02:01:14.460]   IRC.twit.tv.

[02:01:44.220 --> 02:01:45.820]   with your podcast application.
[02:01:45.820 --> 02:01:46.820]   That's the whole point.
[02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:48.700]   That's why it's a podcast.
