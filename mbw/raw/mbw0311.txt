[00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.640]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. The show that covers the latest Mac and Apple news
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:08.160]   joining us right now from the left coast. Mr. Alex Lindsay. I threw them
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.640]   there. I'm on you right side. You're on the right side. Well you're on the left side of the screen.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.640]   Yes. So it's always good. Good to have you from PIXA Core. It's good to be here.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.000]   And where have you been? This is like the where in the world is.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.760]   Oh, I was last week I was in LA in Houston this week. I'm just in, oh no, this week I'm in
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.560]   DC and New York in Pittsburgh and Nashville. But before the next show.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.400]   You are traveling man. It's gotten a little crazy. You got a copy of the Diamond Club in
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.680]   your iBooks. So you have something to read. I do have the copy. I haven't broken into it yet.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.080]   Yeah. I don't really read very well. Oh, you got to save it for a special moment.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.280]   I can't really read. Also with us on the right coast. Mr. Andy Naco of the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.240]   Hello Leo. And because I'm sitting roughly five feet to your left, that means that I'm in a
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:08.080]   time zone that's roughly what's that about 21 seconds earlier. So if there is an apocalypse of
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.600]   the sun, I will be able to tell you about it. I'll 21 seconds to tell you about it before we
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.600]   obliterated by plasma radiation. So we have that to look forward to.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.040]   Oh, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy. Hey, just, you know, completely parenthetically, although there were
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:28.320]   quite a few max on the desk at JPL. I did note. What about that? Curiosity, huh? Yeah.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.520]   Huh? Gold medal or what? That is awesome. I mean, the level of the level of complexity is just
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.760]   mind boggling. That's a lie to land something. Freaking crane. Yeah. Who thought that up? That's
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.640]   amazing. A platform. And it worked. When I when they showed when I saw a picture of it, when I saw
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.520]   a picture of what they were going to do, I was like, Oh, I think we're going to be another one of
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.680]   those side of the wall side of the wall moments, you know, they're all just going, you know, I
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.880]   can't believe they're trying this. They couldn't test it because it's too complex. I thought,
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.120]   but we will. And you know, when they did it, wasn't that a great moment? Yeah, I mean, I really
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.800]   believe that somewhere on some whiteboard like at JPL was okay, if it works, we'll have this
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.280]   incredible like one ton rover, they'll have a two year mission. If it doesn't work, we're going
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.720]   to we're going to expose about 8,000 years of strata from the surface of Mars. So the next probe
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.480]   can just take samples and get the geological story from the crater left behind by not one but two
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.040]   of these spacecraft that failed to fail to deploy correctly. But yeah, it's like, it's like never,
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.200]   it was just such great drama because obviously you didn't get to see video of this thing landing
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.240]   not until like later on, and we found out that as the cherry on the cake, NASA actually used
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.400]   another Mars Observatory to actually photograph the spacecraft as it was parachuting down. But
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.240]   like all we all you see is these like dozens of people in baby blue golf shirts just like staring
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:01.520]   intently and then exploding in one moment altogether. That's like, oh, God, this makes up for like
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.680]   losing getting getting eliminated from the from the field hockey Olympic trials for I guess New
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.160]   Zealand two days earlier. This really does make up for that. I feel you feel red, right, and blue
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.240]   all over. I know I was just like, you're in really, it's like in today's media world, what I really
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.520]   want to see is like just as it was just as it was going into its landing thing, I wanted to see it
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.440]   blow out like four little cameras that just take all these different angles. Well, you have to
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.200]   acknowledge and they stream live and then they just they just plummet into the ground. Not to
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.800]   do it in any way, but NASA is brilliant at social media. I mean, the thing's tweeting
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.760]   at, I mean, it was done in every way. It was done really beautifully. The press conferences,
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.040]   they had Will I Am and Will Wheaton together at the press conference. I mean, you know,
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.640]   they're they're clearly have learned quite a bit about and that's still media. Because, you know,
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.360]   Will I Am is really into science and development. Again, it's not to diminish them. They need to do
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.680]   this. The sad thing, the thing that really makes me sad and I was talking with Tom Merritt about this
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:07.280]   is that there wasn't beforehand much talk about it. And he said, yeah, we what they didn't manage to
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.440]   do is is convince people or get the word out about what was going on. Right. And and I wish they had
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.400]   Tom did a great job. We did a special that night live special with Tom, Dr. Kiki, Justin
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.640]   Robert Young. He had a Bill Sell on who was the crane, lead engineer on the crane, the sky crane.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:31.040]   I mean, it was just really good stuff. And that's one thing, you know, I was talking to Lisa's son,
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.920]   who's in fourth grade. I said, are you excited? He said about what? They had not talked about it
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.720]   in fourth grade. And I really think that that's I used to be, you know, I used to stay home for
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.480]   every shuttle launch. I mean, like I mean, home, I, you know, I was until the school decided to start
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.840]   stopping school and letting us all watch the shuttle launches. Like I would just stay home and watch
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.120]   the shuttle. And like that was a huge event. And it should be a huge event. I mean, because it's
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.400]   revolutionary. I mean, what we're what we're doing there. And the thing I think also people,
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.960]   you know, when people have discussions of NASA, they don't realize how much of all our everyday
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.120]   tools, like all the stuff is all comes from NASA. That's all driven from NASA. I mean, I know that
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.440]   Apple has a couple of patents, but you know, a lot, but a lot of the we have to understand that a
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.080]   lot of this technology, a lot of the surfaces, the materials, the the technologies, the all of that
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.600]   stuff is driven out of these not it's not just them going to Mars, it's all the things they had to
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.600]   figure out to get there, you know, affects everything that we do on every day. Right.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:30.880]   I mean, this is this is exactly why I was disappointed that they retired the shuttle fleet,
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.400]   but I wasn't heartbroken about it because I know about all these other missions,
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.760]   at least unmanned, uncrewed missions, they've got going. And to me, each one of these missions
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:45.360]   is sending back hard science. And the second, I think, responsibility of the space program is
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.320]   not only to do good science, but also to inspire another generation of explorers to build the
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:56.400]   next generation of probes and crew the next generation of crew to spacecraft. And I think that
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:02.000]   something like Curiosity does a much, much better as at least as good a job as a fleet of space
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.080]   shuttle. Well, and that's to me, that was the conclusion I came to had this been a manned mission.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:11.440]   Of course, it, you know, we want we like watching humans, we like the human story. And so, of course,
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:17.360]   there would have been a lot more publicity, a lot more press. But in fact, the smart science,
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.560]   the smart scientific thing to do is to do exactly what they're doing, which is a unmanned mission.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.240]   Well, and I think in some ways, you're huge amount of data.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.400]   I think in some ways, we're seeing NASA pivot, where they're really focusing on that Mars and
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:34.240]   beyond where and letting commercial operators manage the close up stuff. You know, okay,
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.200]   like we're done with that. We understand how to do that. Now we're going to move,
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.280]   we're going to do the big, the big lifting that requires that process and let everybody else
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.920]   handle the close stuff. And the tie back into our conversation here, G3 processor.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:51.040]   Was that G3 in there? This is a little 200 power hurts, G3. Yeah. G3 processor running the
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:09:00.880]   not only that, but it was it says 256 megabytes of system memory, two gigabytes of storage or
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:06.320]   or a cache for the data that's sending back. And this is a actual just off the shelf item,
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.600]   running the same operating system that runs an airport extreme.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:17.440]   I thought it was a rad 750. Isn't that the is that a that's a G3? That's like a mill spec G3.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.400]   Yeah. You know how much they cost? $200,000.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:26.960]   See, that's the thing when you when you can, when the damn thing has to work, no matter
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.480]   has to work while it's being while it's being sent through reentry and bombarded with radiation,
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.800]   $200,000 is not a whole lot of money to spend. If you want to make sure the two plus two always
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:43.200]   equals four under every atmospheric and and and and and interstellar condition. That's radiation
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:49.920]   hard and it's so it's not exactly an arduino. It's interesting though, because then in a way,
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:55.760]   there you it is a power PC architecture. They are using a older, less sophisticated technology,
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.800]   but it's all it needs. Well, less less sophisticated is another way of saying prove and reliable.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:05.520]   Something something that engineers have mounds of experience with. And that's something that's
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:11.920]   often kind of cast aside. It's it's you realize that just look to your game console, the games
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.400]   that are being produced from a game platform that's been out for three years are always better
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.320]   than the newest games from the very, very latest console that's been out for about a month.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.000]   Because over the past three years, developers have figured out how to solve every single problem
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.320]   they need to solve to get every single solution they need to get. Whereas if you throw brand new
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.880]   hardware in a brand new OS and a brand new API at them, all they can do is the most linear,
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.160]   obvious answer. That's not always the most efficient thing. One also, when you look at the
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.960]   development pipe for any of these things that it's a decade or more to get it up and the G3 was
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:47.600]   actually a a unique situation, you know, because all those teams, all the Motorola teams work separately
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.080]   or we're working separately at the time. So the G4 and the G3, you know, the big, the big thing was,
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.680]   is that, you know, Apple, kind of, you know, the reason that one of the reasons that this is the
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.720]   rumor anyway, not that I would know, that they plowed under all of the G4s, you know, all that,
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.440]   all that licensing and everything else. Part of that part of that issue was the G3 team,
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:09.680]   you know, because they trade notes between the Motorola teams and the G3 team said,
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.880]   "Oh yeah, we're going to add a little bit of larger L2 cache, you know, to the chip and
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.600]   but of the the the," and they just kind of like a side note. Well, that's why the when the laptop
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.800]   came out, it was faster than the desktops because it had this little change that the G4s didn't have,
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.920]   the initial ones. So suddenly you had these laptops and the thing is, Apple had licensed the
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:34.960]   G3 processors for all of the power computing, Motorola, and some Motorola, you know, I don't think
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:40.240]   they did it on purpose, but the G3 team, you know, so what was about to happen was Apple was about
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.280]   to have all these G4s that were going to get slower, that were expensive, that were about to get their
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:50.880]   their lunch taken out by all these G3s that were actually performing much faster than the G4s.
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.960]   They were clocking, you know, doing performance, you know, they wouldn't clock faster, they'd be
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:00.480]   they'd clock slower, but they were all that L2 cache makes a huge difference. And now we see
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.400]   huge L2 caches and everything else, but and that that all kind of progressed, but that was a,
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.480]   I think it's old enough now I can. Isn't that interesting? I would say, you had heard that. I was
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:13.520]   out drinking with some energy. It has heard that. Not from Apple. So, no, of course not. So,
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.640]   anyway, but no, no, no, literally not from Apple, but it's a mother engineer. It's very
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.160]   interesting. And it makes perfect sense. There's a little backstory for you for the 90s.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.840]   I didn't realize that there was a huge deal. It was a huge deal. It was a huge deal. It
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.320]   would have killed Apple. I mean, it would have killed, it was killed them if they hadn't plowed
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.680]   those under like it would have, it would have been the end. I didn't, I mean, it doesn't even make
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.120]   sense. They were developing these processes as they're just in separate kind of sealed off.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.840]   Yeah, they're just they're all they're all working because one's working on one generation,
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:39.280]   the next one's working on the next generation. I don't know if they do they still do it,
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:46.320]   but that was one of the things that happened anyway. Just to thank you, everybody who worked on that
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:52.080]   Mars space lab, the MSL and to the champion. We can't wait to see because, you know, it's going
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.320]   to be so exciting. I don't know how operational it's going to be up there for quite some time,
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.600]   so we're going to see a lot of new stuff. Which one is still walking around? Is it opportunity
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.800]   or spirit is still running around? It's been years, years of cool things. It's amazing,
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:10.960]   amazing. You know, it was it's kind of fun to watch the Olympics. Of course, NBC didn't even know the
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:16.080]   Mars thing happened, but to be watching the Olympics and to be watching the Mars thing,
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:23.280]   and you just really see two different sides of of what humans can be. And I found that, you know,
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:28.080]   in this day and age, it's really uplifting to know that we can do these amazing things. Somebody
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:35.440]   made an animated GIF, which is hysterical of the winning. What does it call that vault? It's
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:41.440]   vaulting, right? On the thing and the gymnastics, they were vaulting. The winning vault from 1958,
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.600]   which was basically boom, boom, boom. I survived. Compared to the winning vault,
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:54.400]   the gold medal vault from 2013, which boom, boom. And it's amazing that in that in 50 years, 55
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:00.880]   years, well, they were showing the they were showing some of the archival stuff for the
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.520]   Olympics. Also, it was really good. They're showing the old gymnast where the gym, the actual
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:11.280]   balance or the uneven bars fell apart. You know, I was like, and they said, like the budget,
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.840]   you know, this was like the budget for in 1948 was something like $136,000 for the whole event.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.640]   It's a very different. Yeah.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:25.360]   And by the same time, doesn't it show you like how the humans can like screw things up sometimes?
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:31.680]   Because I'm watching these gymnasts. I'm seeing them do this incredible, just super human things.
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.360]   And in any movie, you'd say, well, there's no way in hell they did that like as a practical
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.360]   effect. They just did it on green screen. They manipulated it. And it's like, I'm like my
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:44.720]   jaws on the floor. And the commentary is like, Oh my God, what an incredible flub. He just lost that.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:52.400]   That just cost the battle. What? Oh, that shit. Like this falling apart. His parents are
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:57.360]   turning their thoughts on what? Have you seen that they're doing bullet time? Like a little mini
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:03.280]   bullet time for the gymnastics. It's like a what's that? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I see. I meant to ask you
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.640]   about this. Yeah. So it's just a bunch of that's just a bunch of hair. So you know that what they
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.760]   have is a bunch of I mean, I don't know what they have. I don't even they didn't even highlight it.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.560]   I don't know if NBC made it. It's cut to everyone's but everyone's in the vault.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.360]   So while they'll show during the vault, the athletes in they'll freeze the athlete and they'll rotate
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:21.280]   all the way around it's not particularly. I don't think it's very well done. It's not very well done.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:25.280]   Well, what? Here's my guess. It's a little fuzzy. So they don't have as many cameras. Standard
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.280]   def. Okay. So so it's a in what they probably have is they're going from a
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:34.800]   little web either web cameras or little PTZ like little little a whole bunch a little array of
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.560]   cameras that they probably put out there that that are that are kind of on a string and they
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.160]   probably have 30 or 40 of them there. So it's just like a little, you know, and they're all
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:46.560]   but they're all they're all they're in seconds because they're able to show that almost instantly
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:50.480]   because it's but what's happening is all those images are being organized into a file that can
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:54.640]   be immediately played back. So what you know, rendering at all. Imagine having a folder. I mean,
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:16:00.080]   when we did this for a project that I did a couple years ago and so what we what we had was a
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:05.280]   a whole bunch of remote cameras and what they did is all of them fed an image to a file and every
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:10.480]   camera it was just like, you know, it was it had the image of like what the time stamp was when
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.880]   it was firing. And then it also each camera was, you know, basically told it was frame one,
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:18.880]   frame two, frame three, frame four. So basically from quick times perspective, we could literally
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:23.360]   tell quick time go into that folder and play it back and it would play every camera back as its
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.120]   own. It was just play it back as a sequence because it looked like a sequence to quick done.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.480]   As long as as all the names are the same, except for that last thing and it'll just go,
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.080]   oh, that's sequence and playback. I now understand. I thought that maybe there was some interpolation,
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.120]   but there are enough cameras that they actually have an animation. I think I think that what they
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.560]   did when I looked at it, I don't think it was it might have been some interpolation. I mean,
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.320]   that's not that's totally possible because it does look really soft. So it could be interpolation,
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:48.240]   but I think that actually what you know, it's S.D. You hit the nail on that. We're going from
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.560]   an HD. We're watching HD and all of a sudden briefly, there's an S.D. video in the middle.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.160]   And that's what it looks like. And the person who designed it is like, what? I mean, we just we
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:02.560]   just spun around the chairs of it. Yeah, really? No kidding. They froze. You froze the Adley
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:07.520]   in midair and we spun around them in real time and you're worried about the quads. Give it a second.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:12.880]   It's going to space. Anyway, that's okay. One more thing and then we're going to get back to the
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:18.080]   Mac. This is all technology. Yes. There you go. We're geeking out. TV meets technology.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:24.000]   New York Times men's 100 meters sprint one race every medalist ever. So you say in Bolt,
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:33.520]   9.63, by the way, I saw a physicist do the chalk work. He says the actual limit, the theoretical
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:39.360]   limit is 9.43 because of Eric Drag or whatever you can't you couldn't know human. So we're in
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:44.160]   almost three. I always took a lot of room. Yeah. Watch how far ahead of every Olympic
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.320]   medalist is he? This is the New York Times doing great stuff on there. Just how fast was you saying
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.920]   bolts gold medal sprint? I probably can't play this whole time. I'm on a set of your stage.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.200]   The same race against every Olympic medalist since 1896.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:00.720]   This imagine. I don't know how they did this. Assembled using runner's average speeds.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.760]   Reveals just how much faster sprinters have become.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:08.720]   Usain was insane. A few lanes over. We see it look like he was cruising.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.280]   Who dominated the field in Bayley. It wasn't even breathing hard.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:16.960]   When it ran for 10 seconds. Hey, anyone can do that.
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:24.400]   You won a 1984 to one of our. We can't show the whole thing, but go to the New York Times page.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:28.960]   It's a great. That's a great little. Let's also praise the the the 10 meter diving
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:35.600]   gold medalist to hit the water. I tied the world record for for falling from a 10 meter
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:41.200]   height into water set by the first person to ever dive from a 10 meter board. But still he tied it.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:45.840]   And so that was good enough. And then and then you have the fencer. The fencer who lost because
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:53.120]   there was a 15 year old intern running the clock. Was that is that. Yeah, there was only one second
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.840]   left. So there was she wouldn't leave the because because there was one second left when she and
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:02.720]   all she had to do was survive for one second, but he didn't start the clock. And so because he's a
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.040]   15 year old intern, it was a big protest. And and and then she got this like consolation prize or
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:11.760]   whatever, which doesn't look like a medal. It looks like a ribbon. Oh, yeah. But was it? But see,
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.160]   that's why I wish that NBC would be a little bit more. They understand what I would say and where
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:21.440]   is the actual drama of the events that are unfolding? This is the most incredible thing because
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:27.920]   apparently in fencing, this is like I was reading later on, that you concede the match when you leave
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:32.400]   the when you leave the platform, right? Until you leave the platform. However, you have not
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:37.520]   conceded that you accept the judges ruling. So it was just this filibuster stand up. She just
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:42.400]   stands there. You know, while no one knows what's going on, while not security is up there saying,
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.640]   please don't make us carry you off. We'll look like such it's such a jerk's if we are carrying you off.
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:51.920]   I love that it's called the pissed the piece. The piece is that is that where
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:56.960]   it's French and pissed comes from. Yeah. That's where it comes. I was
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.440]   I was unaware that when you when they score a touch, the person that you hit, your your your
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.880]   fencing mask actually lights up like a silon. Yeah, wasn't that cool?
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:08.160]   I think these red lights and say, okay, you're definitely dead now. And of course, for all of
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.000]   you watching, all of this, of course, is running on a Mac. Is it? I don't know. I know. I just thought
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.720]   I'd try to tie it back in. Sure. We're gonna take it. We got lots of talking about we're gonna talk
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.560]   about Matt honan. We had him on Twitter yesterday. Yes. If you do want to tie it back to the Mac,
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:27.600]   the software that the NASA Curiosity Lander is programmed with is Vx works. And that is what's
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:32.880]   in the airport extreme as well. Here we go. There you go. See? See? There's something that's a real
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:39.360]   time OS, I guess. Yeah. What is going on? Oh, yeah. Wind Rivers. Yeah. Wind River Vx works on. Yeah.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:45.840]   They've been doing great stuff for a long time. Powers, the Mars Rover Curiosity. That's worth
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.640]   the t-shirt for everybody at that company. That's gonna show up in the emotional. I know,
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:55.040]   kidding. They do amazing stuff. Well, we think we think we can keep your beverage
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:00.800]   bottling plant working. Okay. If if curiosity landed. Okay, we think we got you. We're okay.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.880]   By the way, our one live studio audience member has just left. So I think it's time to go to a
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.160]   commercial and we'll come back and talk about the Mac. Really, sir, we'll talk about the Mac.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:13.920]   That's when you know. Yeah. Exactly. I can't hear the audience. It's been a walking out.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:20.160]   Thank you, Chad. Now you can finally do the show that you want to do without caring about
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:24.800]   the audience. Yes. Finally. You can hear your 11 PM show. This is it. There's nobody watching
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:29.440]   left. Chad Johnson, our producer. Thank you, sir. Oh, not a problem for that contribution.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.520]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, a word from Citrix. And we're gonna talk. I want to talk about this.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:40.640]   Apple, I think, is a little bit culpable in this Mad Honan story. Yes. And it's a real cautionary
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:44.560]   tale. We had Matt on Twitter last night. And you should listen to that interview because he's
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:51.600]   basically hackers got into his iCloud account and wiped his iPhone, his iPad, and his MacBook Air.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:59.280]   Wiped it. Not cool. Not cool. Not cool at all. But first a word from Citrix, the folks who do go to
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:06.480]   meeting some time means nobody's there. You call the company. They're at the pool. They're on vacation.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:11.600]   You're trying to pitch a client. Yeah, you know, I don't know. He was at home. But now with go to
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.840]   meeting, you can that you can meet anywhere you are. You can go home. You can go to the pool. You
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:20.960]   can enjoy yourself. You can live life a little and still get work done with go to meeting. Go to
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:25.440]   meeting makes online meetings easy. I know you're probably familiar with their screen sharing and
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:30.720]   go to meeting, which is the best fast, easy, secure. It uses Nat traversal. So you don't have to open
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:35.360]   holes in your firewall. That really makes a big difference. It's very easy for your clients to
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:40.160]   use to do send a meeting invitation in the mail. They click the link. The software downloads in a
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:44.000]   matter of seconds, runs, and they're in the meeting. It's that easy for them. They don't have to
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:51.200]   get IT involved or anything. But now and all of this comes with the newest feature, which is HD
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:57.440]   faces. That means with HD faces that you can actually have a meeting and they don't have to set up
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:04.000]   Skype or anything like that. They can see you. This is for companies like, you know, to make the big
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.240]   10,000, 20,000, $100,000 teleconferencing systems, this must drive them crazy. This makes it so easy
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:16.960]   and so affordable to have high definition video conferences, even from an iPad. It really looks
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.720]   great. We had an all iPad meeting. You have to start the meeting on a Mac or PC, but then you can
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.720]   have the meeting. You can join the meeting on an iPhone or an iPad on the iPad. It uses your
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:29.920]   camera so you can send video as well as receive it. You don't need a phone. It uses the iPads built
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:34.560]   in microphone and speakers and you're in a meeting. I get so used to virtual meetings now that I get
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:40.240]   pretty testy when I have to do an in-person meeting. I know. You really need me to come there? Is that
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:45.600]   really necessary? Are we really? Do we need to touch each other? Do I have to put my arm right?
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:50.240]   No, I think that's a good point. It's not even just summertime. Nowadays, this is just a way of getting
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:55.440]   things done faster. It is here without travel. I want you to visit gotomeeting.com and use the
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:00.160]   offer promo code MACBRAKE and you can sign up for 30 days free. So you don't have to take our
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:05.440]   word for it. Just put MACBRAKE in the promo code slot there, 30 days free. It's only $49 a month
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.440]   for as many meetings as you want as long as you want. So it's a really good deal. And when you compare
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:14.320]   that to what many companies, you know, I walk by, there's an insurance company near my apartment
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.480]   then I walk by and they have one of those big teleconferencing rooms with a camera and they've got
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:23.120]   a big screen and all this stuff. And I think that's what is it? $100,000? That's a huge amount of money.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:26.640]   It's a lot of money. And it's we've looked at doing one. It's absolutely like building on a
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.920]   teleconf. You know, like we've done all that stuff and then after that, you just realized after we
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:34.000]   priced it out, we were like, eventually this is all going to go away. It's obsolete. $49 a month.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.960]   Go to meeting. Try it. You'll like it. So Matt Honan, who is a, I've known for a while, he was a
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:48.720]   gizmodo. He's now wired. He's a part of the wired gadget blog. Got gadget lab, they call it.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:53.440]   Got hacked the other day. Got hacked Friday. And it was a weird hack. He's playing with his
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:58.320]   daughter and all of a sudden his iPhone goes like it's like a reset. Like there's nothing on it.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.880]   And he thought that's weird. Maybe it crashed. Then his iPad does it. Then he goes to sit down
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:08.400]   his MacBook Air and it's gone. And it says a pin. It turns out that hackers who weren't even
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:12.960]   attacking those systems, they all they wanted was Matt's because he has at M.A.T. on Twitter.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:17.120]   They said, Oh, that'd be cool for the lulls to hack. He's a three letter Twitter handle.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:21.920]   We just want to get in there. But in order to do that. So here at now, Matt was on the show on
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:26.160]   Sunday that he said, I'm running a story for Wired. I don't want to, I want to get some
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:32.480]   confirmation and I want Apple to fix this before I write about it. So because Apple was very
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:37.360]   apologetic and they got, they took his air and they're apparently trying to do a forensic recovery.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:43.840]   I don't know what the status is on that. But now because he got responses from everybody,
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:50.080]   he has written the article, how Apple and Amazon security flaws led to my epic hacking. It turned
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:55.440]   out it was a little social engineering. The hackers on Amazon got two things.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:59.840]   And how do they get on Amazon? Well, apparently you can see this in some form of fashion publicly.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:06.000]   And I'm not sure I even want to talk about how it happens. But all they need. Well, so what they
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.600]   did is they went to Amazon, they got his address, mailing address, and the last four digits of his
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:14.400]   credit card number. Not the credit. It's published everywhere. Like your last four digits are everywhere.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:21.280]   Right. Well, yeah, again, again, social engineering. He called Amazon tech support,
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:26.240]   customer support pretending to be him saying, gosh, I need to start. I need to create it.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:30.000]   I want to, I want to deposit a new credit card number. And they were basically reading off
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.480]   which one do you want? The one that ends in a two one four, the one that ends in four four one eight.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:39.040]   You know, like, oh, dear. And so with that, and so that the first and from first piece of that
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:43.760]   was the information that Apple was going to use to verify his identity on another on their own
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:49.520]   services. And so that was the yes. Apple tech support confirmed to me twice over the weekend,
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:56.000]   he writes, that all you need to access someone's Apple ID is the associated email address,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.080]   a credit card number, the billing address, and the last four digits of a credit card on file.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:06.560]   So that credit card number does not have to be the same credit card.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:13.280]   It could be some other credit card number. But if you have my email address, my billing address,
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:19.760]   and the last four digits of a credit card, Apple will then Apple's the representative said,
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:24.640]   that's really all you have to do to verify something with us. Apple will then email you a password reset,
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:34.480]   which they did. The guy immediately went to the dot, logged into his iCloud and took over and took
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:39.120]   over and from there, boom, boom, boom, because Matt now Matt made a bunch of mistakes, which he
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:44.960]   completely admits he didn't have backups. He had Gmail, you know, Gmail get asked for a second email
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:49.920]   address. That was his dot Mac address. So he had so they what they then did is they went to Gmail
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:54.800]   and said a Gmail, Oh, I need a new password that got sent to the now the iCloud address,
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.600]   which they own. So they got that. And then I'm not sure how they got into Twitter. The article is
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:05.680]   worth reading. He said on Monday, wired, tried to verify the hacker's access technique by performing
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:11.520]   it on a different account. We were successful. Now, I don't I haven't seen a response from Apple,
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.000]   but apparently there's no change. The first thing I did when I read this.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:21.040]   Change your, change your password. No, this because it's not get what I did is I change, I
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:25.920]   change the credit card that I use on Amazon so that it's not the same as the credit credit use an iCloud.
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:31.440]   You might also, depending on how you feel, and this Matt said on Twitter on Sunday,
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:37.440]   want to turn off the ability to remotely wipe desktops. I like the idea on a phone. I like the
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:41.440]   idea on the iPad somebody if I lose lose my phone or leave it somewhere, I can wipe it. It's easy
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:45.680]   enough to recover. But when you wipe your desktop or your laptop, or someone who does a lot of work
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.680]   with a lot of confidential material, I want to be able to remote wipe my I know I had I thought
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:57.040]   long and hard I did not turn that feature off. This is it's a little chilling. And I think what
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:03.520]   it is is I think that we're giving the cloud a lot of power and that power to wipe is especially scary.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:09.200]   And you weigh this you weigh this issue because there's there are whole services that I don't
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:13.520]   use because I can't remember the password. Like I couldn't tell before I got one password and
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.880]   everything else. And now which I'm now slowly learning how to use. But they were like whole
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.840]   services. I just can't remember the password and I just stop using them. I was just like, oh, yeah,
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:25.280]   enough. You know, and so so I can see the issue is that, you know, if you lose that and you just
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:30.240]   stop using it, obviously, it's so you Apple has to have some mechanism that isn't so onerous that
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:35.040]   you can't get. It's a you can't get your password. It's you know, and this is really and we're going
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:39.840]   to talk about this with Steve Gibson on the security in Adam Morrow. But he's always said it's really
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:45.440]   true. There's a there is a balance between convenience and security. You give up if you want
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.880]   security, you're going to give up convenience. If you want convenience, you're going to give up
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.480]   security and Apple's trying to balance that. I understand. But and part of it is, I think that
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:56.960]   we are starting to move to a point where someone like me would I would prefer to start using biometric,
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:02.160]   you know, whack anisms for certain computers like that. I don't want to connect to a good
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:07.520]   solution would be and this is what I is to either two factor authentication. And I love this. My
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:11.760]   bank uses a lot of companies uses where you need to pat you something you know and something you have
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:17.760]   or something you are, which is biometrics. And you need two of the three. In this case, Google
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:21.920]   turn you can turn on two factor authentication where you know your Google password, but you also
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:27.680]   will get from the Google authenticator on your phone, a second number that you will use to verify.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:33.840]   And that's great. And my bank uses that. Problem is, it's a pain in the butt on Google because a lot of
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:39.120]   like apps, for instance, don't know anything about two factor authentication. So they have to generate
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.720]   a one time pass. Well, and the thing is, is that when you look at when you look at like facial
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.960]   recognition, for instance, you know, it doesn't work that well. Well, so it doesn't work that well.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:51.120]   When it actually so number one, I photo works surprisingly well. When you think about it is
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.640]   looking at thousands of images recognition. Maybe it's an Android problem. But I have it. But I
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:59.040]   it doesn't work. But I photo works surprisingly well given it's getting multiple angles with
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:01.920]   that, you know, lots of different people with lots of different lighting conditions with lots of,
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:07.600]   you know, if all it has to do, it's, it's, it's all has to do is say it's you are not,
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:12.560]   it'll get real accurate real quick. You know, like, you know, that's, you know, if it's only like,
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:17.920]   I hold it up and I go click, it's you. That doesn't your face doesn't change that fast.
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:23.200]   Well, the thing is, if it's if the only thing this algorithm is supposed to be able to do is say
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:28.480]   that that face looks exactly like Andy and not goes God forbid. That's that's good enough for what
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:34.960]   I photo needs to do. If it's meant to say this user is the user who is authorized to access this
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:38.880]   data, then it's nowhere near good enough. Well, but I think but as I said, but when you when you
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:42.320]   reduce the when you reduce the number of variables that it has to manage right now,
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.200]   it's trying to manage lots of different angles, lots of different lighting conditions, lots of
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:50.400]   different people. If it only has to manage a handful of, you know, like one image, like it is a
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:54.720]   Boolean and it looks like this person or not, and it's going to keep on adding to those samples every
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:58.960]   time you do it, you're going to get to a point where it'd be pretty darn accurate. Now, and again,
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:03.680]   if it's two or three, basically says you can use your biometric and your code and you're in.
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.920]   If your biometric for some reason doesn't work, then you have to have it textured your phone or
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:12.000]   something like that. Like I would, you know, I would love to have that enough. So,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.920]   phobia, who's the hacker who did this? And by the way, this is how Matt knows how it happened is he
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:21.280]   taught, he's talked to the hacker, the hacker contacted him. And it wasn't because Matt was
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:25.280]   well known. The hacker said, no, I don't have no idea who you are. It was because he had a three,
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:29.040]   a three letter Twitter. That was it. And the guy wanted to, you know, mess with it.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.840]   Phobia said you honestly, you can get into any email associated with Apple.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.920]   And then once you now, so there are a couple of lessons. First of all,
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:43.760]   don't, you know, be careful. I would say pick a very, maybe have a special account for email
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:48.400]   verification and make sure you got to think about how they're interlocking. Because what
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:53.280]   happened is once they got Apple, it was all over because everything went into the dot Mac or the
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:58.800]   iCloud account, right? So how did he get the vital information? He says he began with the easy one.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:04.800]   He got the billing address by doing a who is on his web domain. So who is privacy would be a good
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:09.520]   thing, right? If someone doesn't have a web domain, you can also look up his or her information on
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:15.360]   Spokio, which is a really creepy site. But this is all public record. If you've bought a house,
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:20.000]   it's public record. If you've donated to a campaign, a political campaign, it's public record. A lot
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.400]   of the things that we do put this information. And in the past, you've had to go to a courthouse
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:29.920]   and said, I want the public record. Now it's all online. Because companies like Spokio actually
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:34.160]   send people to the courthouse and record all this stuff and then put it in their database.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:38.880]   Getting a credit card numbers trickier, but also relies on the advantage of a company's back
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:43.920]   and systems. Phobia says that a partner performed this part of the hack. And it was what we described.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:48.080]   You call Amazon, tell them you're an account holder. You want to add a credit card number.
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:54.160]   By the way, this is as far as I know, this has now all been exposed as a technique. And none of
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:57.520]   these companies have changed how they work. We're just now we're in a very scary.
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:59.920]   So now we're in this horrible state. Right.
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:06.480]   Isn't that always the question? I mean, I don't, I don't have the ability to look into the souls
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:11.200]   of the people who perpetrated this. But every time this sort of thing happens, you sort of try to
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:16.480]   see if there's an upside at all to it. And sometimes it is that it hopefully will inspire a lot of
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:21.600]   people to do audits of how they manage their own financial information about their own passwords.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:27.680]   I myself spent last night the night before going through like every single service that I subscribe
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:31.760]   to that might have a credit card number on file and trying to remember, Oh, look, there's that one.
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:37.440]   I found I found one that Oh, God, that's this using a password that I was brand new four years
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.960]   ago. But I have since used on a couple of other places. So I changed that password.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:48.160]   It's it really is a lesson that it's not so much about trusting or not trusting the security of
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:54.560]   any one website or any one service or company. It's wondering if one company will give away one
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:59.680]   tiny, harmless piece of information that when you couple it to another tiny, harmless little piece
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:04.480]   of information that another company is giving up and to another third one and then a tiny little
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:08.720]   security hole that could never be vulnerable that wouldn't be then vulnerable in a million years.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:12.240]   But now that you have three pieces of information that clicked together so beautifully well,
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:15.840]   that's how basically all of your security is completely torn down.
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:21.040]   Yeah, I just I feel that Apple is still the one that needs to change its policies.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:26.160]   Because basically, if you haven't addressed an email address and the last four digits of a credit
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:31.840]   card and by the way, Matt points out that if you anytime you call Pizza Hut and order a pizza for
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:36.960]   delivery, you're giving them that information. Right. That that if that's all you need to compromise
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.680]   an Apple account, Apple needs to change that policy.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:46.320]   Apple did not have anything to share by press time. So I think there was something in that one of
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:50.720]   those articles that said that Apple had responded that said they take it seriously and they're
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:55.040]   looking at what they did and there was not and according to them, certain things weren't followed.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:58.720]   But who knows? I mean, they did respond at this point, but they didn't say they had done anything
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:04.480]   yet. I think I think it's pretty clear though that this led a list ruined everybody's Monday at Apple.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:08.080]   There are a lot of people who are now scrambling to figure out what went wrong, how to fix it,
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:13.840]   because this is Apple is not so stupid as to simply think that issuing a half a paragraph
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:18.160]   explanation for a wired article is going to be everything the public wants. I'm sure that they're
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:25.520]   preparing a full out solution for this and a full out a tech note, if not just an open letter
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:33.360]   saying, here's how we've made security tighter on the Apple store. Because this could be if a lesser
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:38.880]   company that doesn't appreciate how scary this is for ordinary consumers would let this be their
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:45.120]   Waterloo. I don't think Apple is that stupid though. The saddest thing he's talking to Fovea,
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:49.920]   the hacker and the hacker says, yeah, I am really a nice guy. I don't know why I do some of the
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:54.480]   things I do. This is on aim. I don't know. My goal is to get it out there to other people. So
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:37:02.640]   eventually everyone can overcome hackers. Yeah, because part of this was that he has a newborn
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:08.640]   baby. All the photos were on the wiped device that he had never backed up. So he lost every
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:13.280]   photo and video of the cloud, right? He had had it all backing up to the is that right?
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:19.200]   I believe the article said that he had no backups anywhere. Yeah, he wasn't backing it up. The
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:24.720]   problem is and Matt said this on Sunday. It's just too easy to wipe the hard drive.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:30.800]   And that's the real problem is that once you wipe the hard drive now, Matt should have had
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:35.840]   backups and Matt cop to that and everybody listening, I'm hoping that among all the changes you make,
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:40.480]   another one is to back it up. Right. And maybe not just to iCloud. Okay.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:47.120]   No, never, never just I cloud is a convenience service. It's not a backup solution, in my opinion.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:51.920]   You really do need to have a copy of Superduper, which costs you absolutely nothing. You need to
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:59.600]   have a physical hard drive, which will cost you almost the cost of two moderately priced dinners
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:05.120]   at a downtown restaurant. I mean, the cost for the cost of a 256 gigabyte hard drive is almost
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:09.840]   nothing of these days comparatively. And so you need to have that physical backup on a physical
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:14.960]   drive that you can plug in and then detach and then put into a lock drawer, because you're not
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:19.040]   just worried about what happens if someone tries to remote wipe your device have to worry about
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:22.560]   what happens if someone grabs this thing and runs away with it and you can't get it back again.
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:26.160]   They're probably not going to rifle through. They're probably not going to find the lock drawer that
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:30.160]   you lock this pocket drive in. They're certainly not going to find it in your safety deposit box,
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:33.760]   which is where a lot of my data goes. That's ultra important once a month.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:38.640]   Well, the stuff is really important. To me, the stuff that's really important to me is in two
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:42.560]   physical locations and in the cloud, like it's not necessarily iCloud.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:46.080]   Yeah. I mean, I mentioned this all the time and I'm just going to point people to this one more
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:51.040]   time because that's flow. Yeah. So our good friend, Peter Kroeg, who's a great photographer,
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:54.400]   is also an expert on digital asset. He wrote the digital asset management book,
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:58.720]   the Dan book. He has worked with the American Society of Media Photographers in the Library
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:04.080]   of Congress to create this website, dpbestflow.org. It's about photography workflow. And by the way,
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:09.680]   a great site. But if you go to best practices and you go to backup, he describes what he calls
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:15.840]   is three, two, one backup. And it, and really you should read this. I know it seems complicated.
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:21.360]   The fundamental thing is you should have three copies of everything. Deleting the original
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:26.080]   means you have two copies. You should have three copies of everything, two of them on different
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:32.400]   kinds of media. And finally, one of them should be offsite so that if the house burns down,
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:38.000]   they're gone. That's very simple. Three, two, one. But read the whole thing. And backup is not
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   trivial. And if you've got pictures of your kids in one place, I don't care if it's on a MacBook
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.760]   Air or a hard drive. You said that. You're the one who told me this. One copy of anything.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:57.360]   Doesn't exist. It was also interesting that it wasn't a long interview with the hacker.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:04.400]   But I could really, it really took me back to when I was a teenager. And if this guy was anything
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:11.280]   like me, he not violent. He's not mean. He's not a psychopath. He's nothing. There's nothing
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:17.680]   really horrible about his nature. He just, his interface with the person that he's harming
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:22.000]   is a keyboard and a screen that does not have human emotions, does not have human expression.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.920]   I admit that as a teenager, I did a small amount of trespassing myself in ways of figuring out,
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:31.520]   well, let's see what happens if I put this number into the boat. Oh, wow. Well, I bet that there is
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:35.680]   an account that's actually open so I could see what's on this machine. And I never changed any
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:40.720]   data, never deleted anything. I never left any trace that I was there. But it's when you're 13
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:45.680]   or 14, it's hard to appreciate that you have done some damage, even if you left without a trace.
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:49.760]   You've sort of, if someone found out that someone went into your house, then left without touching
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:54.480]   anything, just that fact alone disturbs their knowledge of what has happened.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:59.600]   And if someone said, well, we want to make sure that he doesn't change his password back. The
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:03.600]   only way to do that is to make sure we wipe his hard drive so he can't have the tools he needs
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:09.440]   to do that. I think that given another six months of experience on the planet, he would have realized,
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:14.080]   oh, wait, no, that's going way, way beyond that. That will really, really cause damage we don't
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:21.280]   intend to do. It's so important not to forget that just because we know people through user
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:27.360]   IDs and avatars and cool three letter handles, those are real people. And we are touching real
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:32.160]   people. And we have to never never never abstract away someone's humanity.
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:35.840]   It's one of the unfortunate things about the internet is that does happen. You know, when you're
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:40.320]   in a chat room or you're on a forum or you're tweeting or you're hacking, it's very easy to
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:45.280]   forget there's somebody else on the other, a real person. I guess I was actually is quoted today in
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:52.640]   an article at ZDNet by David Meyer was says I was wrong. I really worry about everything going to
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:57.760]   the cloud. I think it's going to be horrendous. I think there are going to be a lot of horrible
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:01.920]   problems in the next five years. And what now what he's mostly concerned about is not data loss.
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:06.320]   He's worried about when with the cloud, he says, you don't own anything. You've already signed it away.
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:15.440]   Another issue entirely. Yeah, I mean, it's it's it's it's a I myself have a great difficulty managing
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:21.120]   all these great cloud services because you know, what if what if you know, let's let's be really
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:25.200]   bizarre. Let's say I meet George Lucas. We hit it off and George Lucas says, here's my private
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:28.960]   personal phone number, my private personal email address. Just don't let this get out. I change
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:33.840]   it every three every three or four weeks. And whoever and whoever screws up, they don't get the new one.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.320]   And I would I would be so worried about, well, what do I do with this? I can't put it in my phone
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.440]   because that's going to be synced up to iCloud if someone gets access to my account. They could
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:45.200]   possibly sync it back down. I can't put it on my Android phone because that's also going to be
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:50.080]   synced up to a cloud service where I don't know I don't have physical control over that data.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:56.240]   Am I going to have to write this down in sort of a Jeffersonian code on a card and my wallet?
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:00.080]   Every time I want to email my close personal friend George Lucas, I make sure that this
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:04.720]   incredibly personal and private piece of information can never be compromised without
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:11.200]   doing something horrendously stupid. It's it's it's a problem that comes when you design these
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:17.040]   systems for the 75% for the 85%. Because I think there are most most people who are not cheating on
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:22.560]   their cheating on their wives or husbands don't have certain entries in their address book that
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:27.200]   they never ever ever ever ever want synced up to a cloud or put on to another another device.
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:31.120]   But there are a lot of people who are in that sort of position where there is a certain percentage
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:34.560]   of their calendar, a certain percentage of their address book, a certain percentage of their documents
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:39.440]   where it's absolutely crucial that they know they can tell somebody they can tell the person
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:43.840]   they're contracting with that, "Nope, I have had physical control over this confidential report
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:48.400]   at all times. It has never been backed up to a cloud. It has never been synced put on to a server
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:54.640]   where anybody could possibly breach and access it." And as we're moving towards the these
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:59.360]   operating systems that are designed to put things into the cloud, again, that works great for 75%
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:03.600]   of the people who don't have any information that's particularly confidential or who never would
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:09.280]   ever be a target of anybody with with malicious intent. But for the other 25% for the other 20%,
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.720]   whatever that number is, this is a huge problem with no obvious solutions.
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:18.160]   Well, maybe maybe maybe maybe it's maybe it's maybe just me to go get go get my my Z80 CPM box
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:24.400]   out of the closet. One of the big issues is the the what the ramifications for someone's friends.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:30.400]   This is something you touched on in Twit was on Sunday was that once someone hacks into one account,
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:36.640]   the ability to spoof everybody else and for that to chain react. I mean, fortunately,
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:41.680]   I think that it doesn't sound like this guy was ready to exploit this at a level that
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:45.600]   could have done. And he may have. The thing is we don't even know yet. I mean,
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.320]   there could be a whole bunch of his friends that suddenly have their account strength.
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.880]   I feel for Matt. This is just
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.200]   anyway, we're going to take a break when we come back. Well, boy, there's lots talking about Apple
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:00.720]   Samsung. The trial is on last week. Some big revelations, some surprises, some admissions.
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:04.880]   This is this lawsuit has been awesome. This is this has been great. This is this is the best.
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:08.720]   This is juicy. I don't really like patent lawsuits, but I have to admit, every once in a while,
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:12.640]   the same thing happened with Microsoft Department of Justice, you know, 12 years ago. There was
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:16.720]   some good stuff. So we got some good stuff coming up and just a little bit also more iPhone,
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:23.040]   five rumors and more. But first, and I'm not, you know, Chad, I'm not going to do it because I don't
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:26.960]   want to, you know, Chad said, this would be a good place for a carbonite commercial, but I don't
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:31.680]   want to be, I don't want to be that guy. I don't want to be that guy. We'll save the carbonite
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:37.280]   commercial for later. I'll talk about hover.com. Actually, you know, this is Jermaine because if
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:42.640]   you register your domains at hover.com, they give you who is privacy as part of the deal
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:48.800]   because they know that that actually is something you want. So there's many of those other registrars
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:53.360]   when you say, I want a domain and then there's 800 pages of, well, would you like this? Maybe
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:56.960]   like that. One of those things is who is privacy and you have to pay extra for it,
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:03.040]   not at hover.com. It's built in. Hover is domain name registration and management. I really should
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:07.760]   say that. You know, I started using everyone. Actually, when they started advertising the show,
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:13.600]   I'll give them a shot and I can't go back. It's just clean. It's simple. It's right. Yeah.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:19.120]   And I have to say so easy. They don't use a scantily clad women in their advertising.
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:23.520]   And I know that sounds, but I just, I'm kind of glad about that. Yeah, I know.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:30.400]   I'm just glad. I don't want to throw them under the bus or anything, but just glad.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:35.360]   Hover.com. If you go to Macbreak.hover.com, you could find out more about
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:41.440]   what hover we'll do. For instance, the next time you want to get a domain, just go over to hover.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:50.800]   You'll see they have all the big tlds.com.net also.co.ca.org. A lot of country-specific ones,
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:47:00.560]   which are very handy.it.asia.es.us.de and even.pro.triplex and.tv that we use.tv a lot.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:05.840]   Great policy for customer service. I really like this. They will not, if you, you know,
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.560]   calling during business hours, Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to eat pea,
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:14.720]   a string, they will not put you on hold. They'll just, and everybody who tells me that they've
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:19.920]   moved to hover, and I get a lot of tweets and emails say the customer service was really, really
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:28.080]   good. Now, if you need a domain, use our offer code Macbreak, and you will get 10% off the domain,
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:35.120]   on standard domain names, 10% off. Great for email. Everybody should have a, I think,
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:41.840]   you know, one of the, one of the things that this is also helps is that I have a single domain
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:48.000]   that is my domain, and I can use Gmail, Yahoo, Mail, Hotmail, or a variety of email services,
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.280]   and forward my mail from that main domain, which is registered at hover.com, to any of those services,
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:57.440]   and I can change that forwarding anytime I want, and that gives me some great flexibility. Plus,
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:01.840]   my email address never changes to the people I care for. They know that it's, you know, not
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:06.160]   going to change. Lots of good reasons to use hover. Give it a try. Great management, too.
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:13.680]   If you're a Macbreak weekly listener, you're going to get 10% off hover.com. Just go to
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:21.360]   Macbreak.hover.com or use the offer code Macbreak. I think all my, I finally unlocked the domains
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:24.960]   that were locked in at the other place, and I think I've got them all moved over now finally.
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:29.600]   I should have just used Hover's concierge service. By the way, if you're moving domains,
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:33.520]   ask them about that. That's a great deal. If I just mentioned my name, I think they will
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:37.680]   waive the fee. There's 25 bucks for however many domains you want, but I think they'll waive that.
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:42.160]   If you said, "Hey, Leo said, "wave it." They'll say, "Oh, Leo, all right. Okay."
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:51.920]   This is actually a breaking story. I mean, we'll do this first. No U2BAP in iOS 6.
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:49:00.880]   So there are three Google things in iOS, Maps, YouTube, and the last one is Search.
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:06.640]   And I have to think that when we see iOS 6, maybe Google will not be the default search anymore.
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:08.320]   Yeah, that's a hard one. But I think that,
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:14.000]   I mean, the YouTube, Google spent a lot of time trying to get people to move over to their YouTube
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.920]   HTML5 version, to the web version. There was a couple of years ago where there was a lot of
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:24.720]   push-up. Apple hasn't updated that app in ages. Google hasn't. It's Google's app. No, it isn't.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:28.400]   It's Apple's app, but it's licensed from Google. And yeah, it hasn't been updated.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:32.480]   But Google spent a lot of time trying to get you on to their web version. And the rumor is,
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:38.400]   is that they actually, the licensing ran out and Google didn't update the license. Apple didn't
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:44.320]   take it out. Google didn't update the license. And so, because it's Google is working on a new
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:50.240]   version for iOS 6. But you will have to actively download it. Well, and in Google's best interest,
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:54.960]   to have you using a, you know, going through a web browser or through one that they can punch
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:50:01.520]   ads into, because right now the YouTube one that you get on your iOS doesn't allow them to run ads,
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:06.000]   which is, you know, not Google's way. Apple did confirm YouTube will continue to work in Safari.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.680]   So you've not lost YouTube, you just that app, which hasn't been updated in a while.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:15.600]   And for the record, Apple has never had a problem with allowing Google to create good
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:20.400]   third party apps and put them into the app somewhere. So this Google voice,
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:26.080]   but that's there now. But it wasn't for a long time. But I mean, Apple's kind of, but there's
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:30.800]   currents and there's all the other Google apps are in there, including Chrome to Apple's credit,
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:35.760]   Chrome. Yeah, remember, remember how we always thought that when when Apple started the app store,
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:39.760]   the big gotcha, but it seemed to be in the in the developer agreement was that you can't,
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:43.360]   they will never approve an app that competes with a built in app that's built into the
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:48.800]   operating system. And now that seems to have been either tabled completely, or at least something
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:55.520]   that they will haul out only for the most extreme examples. Because now we want, you want a different
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:51:00.080]   email client, you want a different web browser, you want a different search engine, no problem,
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:05.440]   we will let you do any of that sort of stuff. And I think I just think this is a good move for
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:09.600]   both companies. I'm sure that Google, in addition to wanting to serve ads, I'm sure that sort of
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:15.920]   offended them that the YouTube app on iOS on one of the on the predominant phone in the United
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:21.680]   States and one of the predominant phones the entire world was just such a 19, such a 2008
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:26.160]   just feel that way ever just was not it didn't show off the service as good as Google could
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:30.880]   promote it. So now now Google has a chance to just dive right in and make it make it as good as the
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:35.040]   as the Android version of the player. Of course, the reason that I use the YouTube I actually use
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:40.240]   the YouTube player a lot is because the number of hands. It was like a quick question.
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:43.280]   Do you personally or do you refer your kids? Personally, no, personally, I turned it off for
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:47.200]   my kids. I don't let my kids use go to YouTube. Don't you get something gets crutch shots?
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:54.240]   What happens is that Malachi plays he plays Angry Birds a lot. He's gotten really good at it.
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:59.360]   He's a four year old. I mean, he's really good. And he's learning physics. Yeah, exactly. He plays
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:04.320]   Angry Birds. He's going to be a launch engineer at NASA. I'm teaching him to fly one of those
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:10.080]   little helicopters now. So anyway, but the but the but then I didn't even know there were YouTube
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:13.680]   videos that were connected to Angry Birds. Like I just never, but somewhere in the interface,
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:17.920]   level, but somewhere in the interface, you can click on it. It'll take you to YouTube videos about
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:23.280]   Angry Birds. And then once he's in YouTube, then within three or four minutes, the iPad is screaming
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:27.200]   profanity. Like, like, you know, like whatever the ones that are kind of like Angry Birds,
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:30.640]   they're angry. And so the thing is, so he starts clicking on the other movies and
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:35.440]   before you know, there's like M F blah blah blah, like, like his iPad is like screaming profanity.
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:40.240]   So we had to turn off kind of kept YouTube family friendly. It's not no, no, no, there's no
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:45.520]   sexual content, but that's and no one. There's lots of swearing, but there's lots of swearing.
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:49.360]   So Nathan, Nathan, Angry Ham writing on the Verge says in gadget has also heard from Apple,
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:55.440]   learned that why iOS six devices will lose the YouTube app iOS five devices will not,
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:59.600]   apparently licensing allows that. Interesting. So it goes back to a licensing agreement.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:04.800]   Yep. And Google says, yes, they will be working. We are working with Apple to ensure that we have
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:10.640]   the best possible YouTube experience for iOS users. I don't know what that means.
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:13.520]   Well, and they're working really hard. And I mean, a lot of these iOS apps, I mean,
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:20.480]   if you look at like the G plus app, it is the best social platform app out there. It is so silky.
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:24.720]   Yeah. And this and this and the search app has a feature that I'd love to see as a standard
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:30.640]   feature on the iOS keyboard, where if you're sort of in the back of a cab, you don't have the sort of
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:35.920]   digital dexterity to type what you're searching, you can actually draw the letters and big fat letters
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:40.080]   in the middle of the search, the search window. And we'll just take it letter by letter and put
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:46.640]   that into the search box. Google is not certainly using the iOS platform as a,
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:52.880]   as if even if pride, simple pride isn't involved. It's a way for Google to say, hey, look, we can
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:57.040]   make cool software too. It's not like Apple has a lock on making cool software.
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:59.920]   No, in fact, I agree with you. G plus is amazing.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:09.280]   Xcode 4.5 developer preview four and iOS six beta four now released to developers.
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:14.480]   Does that mean we're getting close to an iOS six? This is the fourth beta.
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:22.640]   Closer, closer. We have to be close. I'm figuring I figure that my guess is that iOS six is going
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:28.640]   to get released September or. Oh, actually, September, maybe September.
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:33.920]   So you're 12th. Wait, 12th, 11th, 10th, one week. You're saying one.
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:37.200]   You're saying five days before the announcement. September seven.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:40.400]   Definitely. Why? Definitely. It's the five. So you go through.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.840]   Definitely. Everybody upgrade. And then you launch it or it could happen any time the week
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:46.160]   after, but it'll happen September. I think that they're trying to get it all ready to go.
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:51.520]   It you're going to with iOS five, I mean, with the iPhone five and whatever else they're going to do,
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:54.960]   they're going to want to upgrade it for that. You know, I'm sure that the things that are specific
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:58.880]   to that. So that's probably the range that they're trying to hit. Definitely. Definitely.
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:02.880]   September seven. Definitely. Why? If it gets right, you have a great or the nine highlight.
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:06.720]   Maybe the fifth definitely no later than the 13th. Definitely. That's the 16th. Yes.
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:14.400]   Sometime between now and December. And by the way, in this beta four, the simulator
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:23.360]   now goes to 11 36. 640 by 11 36. Interesting. That's the simulation. There's nothing that could be
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:30.640]   anything. Baldur dash. We're irresponsible to pass along to rampant and irresponsible speculation.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:37.440]   Cows to 11 36. So that's your resolution. And that is by the way, though, what everybody thought.
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:44.240]   If you were going to write, no, to agree. If you were to keep the width the same and make a
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:48.560]   four inch screen, right? I don't remember the exact number, but that's close to what the number
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:54.240]   I think is supposed to be mid may. In fact, it was that nine to five Mac reported the next
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:56:04.480]   generation iPhone would feature a 3.999. In his display, this is in May with 11 36 by 640.
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:13.200]   And in fact, now that is a simulation in the SDK for eggs. That's pretty good. You know what?
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:19.280]   Well played. Not quite like landing curiosity on Mars. Right. Pretty good prediction. Yeah.
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:26.880]   From May. Well done. They had you by saying 3.999. It's also if they had a source who told them four,
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:31.520]   then they decided to conceal his identity by fudging the number a little bit so Apple wouldn't
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:36.480]   catch on. By the way, the sub line, the sub head on this is updated more decimals.
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:45.680]   We need this just in more decimals. I don't know 3.999. That's what one one thousandth of an inch.
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:49.840]   It would have been another pixel. I want to screw the whole thing up.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:57.920]   Oh, I guess. What you're like. Hey, Missio, would you like one more pixel? It's only it's
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:03.120]   it's not only it left out being good. Good. Put another picture on the screen.
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:14.240]   Physiopixel bite. 176 pixels taller. Thank you very much. It doesn't though. It's not a 2x or
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:22.560]   anything. Is it? It's not it's not any easy ratio. Is it? No. It's 16. It's close to 16.9.
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:30.640]   It's interesting. I admit to being I'm sure that it's important that Apple more than any of the
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:34.560]   company. It's not just enough to know that they've ordered this component or that this thing will
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:40.160]   have an extra feature like if if near field communication is part of of of the new iPhone.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:44.400]   If it's in a Samsung phone, Samsung will put it out there and let third party Android app support
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:48.080]   it. Now they support it very, very well with Apple. It's not just the fact they put it near
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:53.040]   field communication chip in or they made the screen longer. It's the explanation they give you of why
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:58:01.600]   they decided to make it longer. So I'm I have to admit that I don't know yet what reason Apple is
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:06.560]   going to give for why they decided now of all times to make it longer. It's possible that they
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:10.720]   were just going to that they're going to say display technology has come a long way since we
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:15.360]   designed the first iPhone. We figured that we could make a larger display with a little bit that
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:20.720]   made movies, white screen movies, a little bit more luxurious to watch without affecting the
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:26.400]   compact size, the iPhone that we think is a main asset of the size of the device. So we decided
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:29.680]   what the hell let's go ahead and do it. And he's going to fill up the at that rate. Of course,
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:34.800]   of course, we are taking the risk that the next iPhone will be an incredibly major hot seller with
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:38.720]   this new feature. But that's just a risk we're going to have to take by the way. This goes back
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:44.080]   to an earlier post. Thank you to the chat room for pointing this out from the Verge forums by a
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:50.720]   guy named Model War on April 9th, which I you know we were I remember seeing this and I don't know if
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:56.320]   we reported it on it. I think I might have rejected it because it was just too far fetched in which
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:59:02.400]   he goes through quite a bit of logic to come up with 640 by 1136.
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:09.440]   So and this is this is proportional. So it's a 16 by 9, which means that when you're watching
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:14.800]   movies on it, you will or whatever that are 16 by 9, you won't have that annoying strip on the
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:19.600]   top and the bottom. And as he does point out, you get one more damn point of this out to one more row
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:28.800]   of icons. That's what I need. That's all I was asking for. If I got one more row of icons,
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:34.800]   that's what I was looking for. Apple, according to Renee Richie at iMore, who's been on a roll lately,
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:43.120]   will roll out the new dock connector across the entire lineup on September 12th. So it won't just
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:50.800]   be an iPhone 5. It will include the seven inch iPad mini and the current iPad. Why and I always
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:55.360]   thought that's strange. Why change the connector on one if you still got a 30 pin on the other?
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:58.640]   Right. Now we know the answer. They don't want to make any more. I mean, they're going to want to
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:05.360]   just say we're dead according to Renee. I have so many 30 pins. It's all I want to say. Hey,
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:11.600]   I'm not gonna say anymore because people think I'm a well, whiny little toad. So I'm not gonna say
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:17.040]   anymore. You can do the whining for me when I have so many 30 pins. I'm whining for you. Thank you.
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:20.800]   I have so many 30. Thank you. I'm tired of whining.
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:31.760]   Web 3532 again with another great link. This from valuewalk.com, the iPod dock connector to mini
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:42.320]   dock connector converter 999. This looks like an Apple page in white or black. Maybe it's still
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:47.440]   won't fit on my. I guess you could just get the promise. It's gonna be 10 bucks to upgrade all
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:55.120]   your $30 cables to something you can use. I think it's a store. Is that a store page or is a
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:01:00.080]   it's a Photoshop is what it is. Well, because because we do know that a lot of even a lot of
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:04.640]   stores when they see we got a screenshot of an unpublished page from Best Buy or whatever,
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:09.760]   oftentimes they will do a placeholder SKU right for a product they think is gonna ship but they
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:13.520]   don't know yet and they'll put a place because no one is gonna they think no one's gonna see it.
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:18.160]   It's okay if they put a dummy image just to so that's there for for maintenance but.
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:21.840]   Yeah, it's looking pretty cheap.
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:25.360]   McCourt in our chair room says, oh, it's obviously a fake. They spelled color with a U.
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:35.280]   Hey, also also a white adapter after Labor Day. I think so. That's not the that's not the
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:45.360]   stylish Johnny I that I grew up with. Sprint cutting the phone iPhone 4s price $149. You'd
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.520]   expect this across the board soon right as we get everyone to be really mad when they get
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:53.280]   the when the iPhone 5 comes out and they realize they just bought the wrong phone.
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:56.960]   Do you think they're selling any iPhone 4s is right now?
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:00.320]   No one listening to this show is buying more as I don't think.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:05.760]   I don't know. I mean, I know a couple of people who bought iPhones because they're not that
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:10.160]   interested in the next model and this is about the they need they need a new phone for school or
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:15.040]   this is the they have a six week window in which they can buy a new phone and they're not exactly
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:19.520]   tearing their hair out of off of the idea that they're not going to get the next the next iPhone.
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:22.880]   All right, we're gonna do this.
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:27.680]   Phones are weird. Phones are weird. People people a lot of people think of them as practical
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:31.200]   functional devices as opposed to something that they're going to put part of their soul into.
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:36.080]   People are like that. She's like, whatever. Phones are weird. She had a razor for the
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:39.760]   long time. I had to rip the thing in half before I could buy an iPhone. We know that I won't give
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:45.520]   up the eye after our straw poll from two was it two weeks ago that 58% of our audience is waiting
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:50.720]   for the next iPhone. What is wrong with? Oh, you're using the Symbian. There's a lot of movies in the Symbian.
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:56.560]   Or other. I should have put other. My trio is working great.
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:03.520]   Let's take a break. I do want to talk about Apple Samsung, but first before we do this
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:13.360]   text expander for is here and I really love it. I am I will not use I will not use a Macintosh
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:18.480]   unless text expander is on it and the new text expander for makes it even more fantastically
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:24.800]   useful. This is actually a feature that I spent a lot of time in perfecting in my DOS batch files.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:33.920]   The ability to do a fill in snippet. So let me I just love text expander. Let me see how I could
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:37.200]   do it. So it's like a keystroker. Then you type something and it pauses and says what would you
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:40.000]   like? Yeah, that's awesome. What would you like to fill in here?
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:50.080]   Really is not an apt description at all. But it just reminds me that smile software.com/mac
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:53.760]   break text expander. You know, it's fun. I'll probably isn't much on this
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:04:02.320]   computer because I have I have just recently updated it, but it will show you your statistics
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:08.000]   of how many keystrokes. So I should explain what this does. So what text expander does is when you
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:14.560]   type something, it will expand it. So you can say, for instance, when I type address and hit tab,
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:22.720]   I want you to put my address in. If I type deer and hit tab, then you will type deer and then I
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:26.960]   can fill in the name that see that's the pause and then I'll put the comma and then put the rest
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:31.840]   of the entire letter in if it's always the same letter. In other words, you'll get the idea.
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:36.720]   Thanks so much. I'm really glad to listen to the show and yeah, yeah, we have one of two of those.
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:42.960]   We thank you for your feedback. Now go away. Now this is and this is a machine that I don't use
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:48.000]   all the time. This is just my show machine 49 snippets expanded, 924 characters saved,
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:54.560]   hours saved, 0.04 hours at 80 words per minute. I love that. And I could tweet my stats. So here's
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:05:00.000]   some of the email boilerplates. I have quite a few of them. Some of them do have and I love this.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.760]   For instance, here's one percent clipboard will insert the contents of the clipboard.
[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:12.000]   Oh, nice. So all I do is I type a href tab and we'll take whatever URL is on the clipboard and make
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:19.520]   it a link. This is so insanely powerful. There's variables. So here's the current time. So if I
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:24.080]   type time tab, it'll put the exact time of day in there. And then there's a, you know, thanks for
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:31.360]   writing. Go away. That kind of stuff. I love these. These save me so much time. I am for me.
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:36.560]   It's also accuracy. Like when I use it a lot with my address, so I get a lot of stuff sent to me.
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:40.080]   And so people will be like, what address should I send this to you? And I just hit, you know,
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:44.960]   I type my code in. And it's always right. And it's all the things you want.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:48.880]   Our FTP servers or where we put up movies and stuff. I just hit it. Because otherwise you
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:52.880]   mistype it and then they'll exactly. I do that all the time. I use, there's a, there are a number
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:57.680]   of different, you can subscribe to other people's library. So there's a tidbits auto-corrects
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:02.640]   library, which I subscribe to. So it fix all of the common misspellings for like,
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:07.360]   absolutely ridiculous. All the things that I never spell right. This is fantastic. I just want to
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:12.160]   say when I type ridiculous, I just wanted to change it to ridiculous. You could do that. I'm just going
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:16.080]   to set that up. You want to do that? I'll set that up here. Watch. From now on, I never write
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:20.160]   type ridiculous. It's going to say redonkulous. So we get an email from, from, from Leo say,
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:24.000]   this is all redonkulous. You know, you already meant ridiculous, but it just said redonkulous.
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:30.800]   That's a good snippet. So I'm telling you, this is a great program and anybody who has a Mac
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:34.800]   should, in fact, there are plenty of PC people who go, oh, I really want that.
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:43.760]   Nope. Got to have a Mac for it. Go to textexpander.com/macbreak and find out what the new version for
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:48.800]   can do. Yes, of course, there's a free trial. $35 to buy, but you got a free, I think 30-day trial.
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:56.160]   Take a look at this video on here. David Sparks did a video on Mac Sparky on how the new Texas
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:01.440]   banner for filling features work because they're really, really great. Registered users can upgrade
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:05.920]   for $15 or free if you bought it after January 15th. So if you're a tax expander user, make sure you
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:10.960]   upgrade to the new version for can't buy it in the app store because it's sandboxing, but you can
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:21.520]   get it from smile software.com/macbreak. It is a must. Got to have it. Fantastic. I put it on
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:25.600]   every computer. And it's on the app store. And I have it for years. No, it's not on the app store.
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:30.160]   Is it not on the app store? No, no, no, the other one I have, I have the PDF Pen Pro.
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:35.120]   They put stuff on the app store. They do. And that one's not quite a sandbox.
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:40.720]   I should see. I should see just if the, I'm pretty sure they have a certificate.
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:44.560]   Yeah. So they have a certificate. So you can just download it and
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:48.960]   install it even if you have the higher security settings on here. The PDF Pen Pro, by the way,
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:52.240]   is really cool too. We're not talking about must have. We're not selling it today. But if you're
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:08:01.200]   at you happen to be at smile software.com, check it out. We love it. I love it. Smile software.com/macbreak.
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:06.640]   Leo, one quick update. I just checked Twitter, the Twitter feed apparently,
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:11.440]   according to Wired. Amazon has closed the loophole that allowed that hack to happen.
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:15.360]   So they haven't announced it or anything, but it's no longer possible for you to call
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:20.560]   Amazon and add a credit card number or get those four numbers off of the account.
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:27.600]   Well done, Amazon. Quick. Quick. That's a really hard thing to do for a big company is to
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:30.720]   suddenly change a whole bunch of policies overnight. It is. And I did.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:38.080]   Notice that Apple has still not moved. Again, I'm sure there are a lot of people who are thinking
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:43.040]   on it. Damn it. My kid was going to be like, "B-B-B-B-B,
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:47.360]   first our varsity soccer today." And I can't say. Yeah. Somebody's staying home.
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:50.720]   I mean, your Apple, your geniuses, I'm sure you got someone over there thinking things up and
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:54.480]   someone packing that one. My brother-in-law, this is the oldest kid for four days because he
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:09:00.720]   was landing an Voyager on the planet Mars. Why am I staying staying at the office for three days?
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:05.040]   Oh, to fix a bug in our store. Oh, but that's just as good.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:09.840]   Security is hard and I, you know, it's hard. Let's just face it.
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:19.600]   Let's talk Samsung and waiting for this one. So we did this on Twitter. What was your favorite
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:24.880]   revelation in the Samsung Apple trial? The latest one is that Apple does, in fact, do product
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:28.960]   placement. Lots of it because they kind of implied, no, no, no. I was kind of surprised that people
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:34.160]   don't realize that. Well, you see them everywhere. But, and I- They have a great program. I've been
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:37.440]   the beneficiary of some of those programs. Those are awesome. I think the distinction is,
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:43.760]   I don't think Apple has to pay anybody. So for instance, when you're CSI Las Vegas and you want
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:50.400]   laptops, you can go to HP and they will pay you to have HP laptops and you see this all the time.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:54.640]   You can go to Apple and they'll say, "I don't think we'll pay you." They might give you some.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.400]   Yeah. They were pretty good programmers as far as providing filmmakers and so on and so forth.
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:02.000]   Mostly it's for movie stars. Well, movie stars, but also- No, no, no, but film makers-
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.640]   Tell Steve Martin. I said, "You don't need to buy those anymore."
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:08.880]   But you can get, you can get good, you can get great loaners and you can get great deals on them
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:11.360]   and stuff like that as a filmmaker because they, you know, obviously they want to have that
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:14.800]   placement. You can tell which producers really want to get paid for it because you'll see a
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:21.120]   Mac laptop with that silver sticker on over top of the Apple, which has meant the producer had a
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:24.640]   conversation with Apple saying, "I want to get paid for this." And Apple said, "No." And then they
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:29.360]   just put a sticker over it like, "Mah, screw you." Right. Or they'll paint it out. Alias,
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:33.680]   I think they used to- The TV show, I think they used to actually- I think that actually got
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:40.480]   painted out like a You Can See It in my Good Ex-Post or whatever. But the- There was a lot of-
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:45.520]   That's been an old program. I mean, they've been interacting with filmmakers for a decade or more.
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:49.920]   In fact, I'm sure there are iPhones, iPods. And every company does that, but- iPads in
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:54.000]   Academy Award, Presenter, Baskets, and all of that stuff. Yeah. I mean, well, and the thing is,
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.600]   is that every company tries to get product service, just that Apple has cooler stuff. Wasn't it the
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:04.960]   case that- I didn't watch 24, but wasn't it the case that the bad guys on 24 ran Windows and the
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:09.680]   good guys from the Macs? Was that not the case? And a lot of times, because so many people in
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:14.000]   Hollywood, I mean, you go to Hollywood, you don't see a PC anywhere, like in the production staff,
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.400]   people who are designing the shows, you never see a PC anywhere. It's all Apple. So the thing is,
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:24.080]   they're already on their side. And so a lot of times, they're quite willing to just
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:27.520]   write it into the thing because they think it's cool. They're excited to have the Mac there.
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:30.320]   Andy, what do they use on Big Bang Theory?
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:38.320]   Actually, they use a variety of machines. Raj, I believe, uses a MacBook, only with a small sticker
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:41.360]   above the byte in the Apple. So it's not technically an Apple logo.
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:49.360]   Sheldon uses a, I believe he's using Ubuntu on a-
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:49.840]   Yes.
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.280]   ... still, I think.
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:53.360]   Of course, Sheldon's using Ubuntu.
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:54.160]   Of course.
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:59.040]   Can't remember what Leonard's doing. What Leonard's using. But they do use a very
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.840]   free dispersal of machines on their edge, which I really, really like.
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:04.880]   Yeah, I think that's the right thing to do. Somebody's pointing out, and this is true,
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:08.320]   at the end of 30 rockets, has promotional consideration provided by Apple computers.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:08.880]   So that's-
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:09.360]   It's a part-
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.480]   This is not a revelation.
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:14.480]   Well, I mean, the thing is, is that you gotta imagine that part of it is wanting to have a little
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:21.680]   bit control over how the product is used. I have to cite the worst product placement of
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:28.160]   any computer in the past five years, maybe 10 years, maybe forever, was in Sex and the City 2,
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:33.440]   whereas Samantha has a big, beautiful office in the middle of Times Square,
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:36.480]   has a big, beautiful HP touchscreen computer.
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:39.840]   HP does some really nice things with Windows 7 touchscreen stuff.
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:45.760]   She answers a phone call by reaching over and tapping a button that says,
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:49.600]   "Accept call from the phone over here is the ID," which would have been a wonderful
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:54.400]   demonstration of the product, if not for the fact that she had just one second later,
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:59.680]   but using that exact same hand to rub a hormonal cream into each of the parts of her.
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:00.240]   Exactly.
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.480]   It wasn't done as a joke, right?
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:02.480]   No!
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:05.760]   I think the filmmaker just did- Oh, didn't think that one through.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:08.400]   And you see this HP guy, oh, it's gonna be the hottest movie.
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:09.200]   Oh, my!
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:12.000]   Oh, my God, we've got estrogen.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.760]   There's $1.8 million.
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:16.320]   Can you please add an ASOS logo to that device?
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:18.560]   That's a good point.
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.080]   You don't know how it's gonna be used.
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:23.120]   But we also have, like, if Apple's taking care of a production,
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.120]   or anybody taking care of production rules-
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.360]   Well, you start- No, but you also start thinking about it,
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.280]   because you were really happy to have that.
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.520]   And it's not just Apple, it's whoever's sublinin' it.
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:34.800]   We've had conversations about- We've had Gymshots where,
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.280]   when it comes down, we wanna make sure that it just
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:40.080]   grazes across so that you see the Apple logo across the bottom.
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:41.520]   You know, that's on the back of the computer.
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.920]   You know, like, that's a- And Apple's not asking us to do that,
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:46.480]   but, you know, it's like- But the producers obviously going,
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:48.240]   "Well, we're really happy that we're friends."
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:48.960]   Right.
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:50.560]   Let's some stay friends by just that.
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:51.440]   'Cause that's easy.
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:53.040]   Like, it goes down- You know, that's an easy-
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:55.600]   That's an easy gimme to let it just go down just a little bit further.
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:56.000]   Right.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:56.960]   And have that work.
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.200]   And so it's- But it's everything.
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:00.960]   On the other hand, if you're Sony Pictures,
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:02.880]   you pretty much make sure there's a VIO.
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:03.760]   Do the best you can.
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.520]   In every shot.
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:06.560]   You're trying.
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:12.160]   Apple has- The Judge Co. has decided that Samsung
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:16.400]   cannot use a clip from 2001, a space odyssey.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:17.520]   Copyright violation.
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:18.560]   No! No!
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:19.520]   (laughing)
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:20.960]   It's actually more complicated than that.
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.480]   But remember, we've talked about this,
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:25.200]   that there is something that looks a lot like a tablet
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:28.000]   in this movie that came out in 1969.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.160]   I thought that was a set-
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:33.760]   That was a big blow for Samsung.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:38.560]   'Cause I think that the big case that they have on their side is that
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:44.240]   what Apple calls a distinctive and unique design element
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:48.400]   is just here is how everybody always imagined a slate computer would be.
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:51.840]   If someone who has no knowledge of what computing would be like in 2010,
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:54.400]   imagine what a slate computer would look like.
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:56.960]   They come up with something that looks exactly like the iPad.
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:59.600]   It's complicated.
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:02.560]   Isn't that she doesn't think that that's germane?
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:06.160]   It just has to do with the fact that-
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:07.920]   I don't know, it's timing or something.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:13.280]   It's a legal thing.
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:13.760]   Right.
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:15.360]   You can read Fospatents for yourself.
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:20.720]   Judge prohibits invalidity arguments based on both 2001 and tomorrow people
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:26.080]   saying that Samsung was kind of changing its-
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:29.360]   Let me read the germane quote from 9 to 5.
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:31.760]   I can understand 9 to 5 Mac better than Fospatents.
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.200]   Smaller words.
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:34.160]   Smaller words.
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:34.720]   Less syllables.
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:40.400]   Samsung did not, however, argue that these references supported an invalidity or non-infringement
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:43.120]   theory in previous conversations.
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:45.440]   This was during the preliminary injunction phase.
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:51.520]   That Samsung changed tack after the close effect discovery to include these references
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:57.280]   in their invalidity theories, likely prejudiced Apple, who was not made aware during the preliminary
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:01.600]   injunction proceedings that Samsung intended to rely on these two prior art references.
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:04.000]   So in other words, basically Samsung's lawyers screwed up.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.960]   Or they decided that-
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:08.720]   I don't know whether they screwed up or not.
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:10.000]   Maybe they did it on purpose.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.240]   Well, no, no, no, no, that they didn't-
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:14.400]   they changed direction, so that's clear.
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:14.400]   Right.
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:18.240]   And that happens a lot in the case where you change your argument somewhere along the case
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.120]   because you realize that-
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:20.000]   When it was not good.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:20.960]   Like during discovery.
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:23.840]   Well, they lost a preliminary injunction phase, so maybe that's why.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:24.400]   Okay, that didn't work.
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.280]   Let's try something else.
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:29.680]   But the problem is that- and the way a lot of the legal stuff works is that you can't
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:33.280]   bring news- oftentimes you can't bring new stuff in past that.
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:39.120]   Like for instance, if you get an appeal, you can only appeal to things that you oftentimes,
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:42.000]   you can only appeal what you objected to.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.520]   If you didn't- if you didn't inject your kind of-
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:44.720]   Who's-
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:46.640]   That's why you have all those objections.
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:52.320]   Apple asked the court to instruct the jury that Samsung engaged in serious misconduct,
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:55.040]   and that as a result, the court has made a filing.
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:59.680]   This is the misconduct over Samsung leaking to the press.
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:00.640]   That was a huge mistake.
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:01.600]   I don't understand that.
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:02.640]   I don't understand if they realized it.
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:03.280]   So what happened?
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:07.280]   So Samsung couldn't get something into court and they-
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:07.840]   They wanted-
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:08.640]   They wanted this not-
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:09.760]   They wanted this not- releasing stuff to the public.
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:11.760]   Samsung wanted the pictures.
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:14.880]   This Sony style- they wanted this Sony style defense where they said,
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:18.160]   "Look, Apple is copying Sony."
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:18.800]   Right.
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.800]   And the judge says, "No, you cannot introduce that."
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:28.000]   So according to some Samsung or somebody who agreed with them-
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.440]   Who leaked this to the press?
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:30.800]   They leaked it with a quote like,
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:33.680]   "This was stuff that wasn't allowed into the court case."
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.760]   The judge was pissed and in fact instructed it,
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:37.440]   it went to each juror one by one and said,
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:38.480]   "Did you see that article?
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:39.520]   Did you see that article?"
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:41.680]   Trying to make sure that the jurors were not treated.
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:44.000]   In some ways it's like jury tampering in some ways.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:44.960]   You know, and so-
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:48.800]   So Apple wants the judge to instruct the jury
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.720]   that Samsung engaged in misconduct.
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:56.320]   Well, not only that, Apple wants-
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:57.120]   Apple wants to send-
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:58.240]   They want the ruling now.
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:59.600]   They just said, you know, they-
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:03.280]   What Apple doesn't want is a mistrial because they don't want it to delay.
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:03.760]   They don't want-
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:04.720]   They don't want this to stretch out.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.720]   They just want the judge to rule.
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:08.400]   There's a theory that Samsung wants-
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:09.360]   Samsung wants this-
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:12.000]   It's a mistrial because that's going to keep on delaying this out.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.040]   And they'll want to stretch it out.
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:14.400]   So Apple doesn't want it to stretch out.
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.160]   They want- they want to stay in court.
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:17.680]   They don't want to change the jury.
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:19.200]   They don't want to declare a mistrial.
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:21.840]   But they want- they say that now they should just-
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:22.800]   You know-
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:23.920]   And that's-
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:24.400]   Apple says-
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:25.120]   Apple says John is not-
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:25.120]   Apple says John is not-
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:26.240]   Apple says John is not going to get it.
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:28.640]   Fines are not a severe enough punishment.
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:29.760]   We want a judgment-
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:33.360]   Against proper remedy for Samsung's misconduct
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:37.840]   is judgment that Apple's asserted phone design patents are valid and infringed.
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:39.360]   And this is what every lawyer would do.
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:41.040]   I mean, just so you know, it's not like this is-
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:42.160]   Because after-
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:45.280]   After every time after the defense closes it,
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:47.360]   -after the prosecution closes- - You ask for a mistrial.
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:48.000]   You ask for a mistrial.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.040]   You ask for this to be-
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:50.000]   You ask for the-
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.040]   -alarmory judgment.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:51.680]   -alarmory judgment.
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:52.960]   So this is just them going-
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:54.800]   We should- we should win now.
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:56.000]   And that's- they have to do that.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:56.640]   That would- it would be-
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:59.840]   They wouldn't be lawyers if they didn't do that.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:00.080]   So-
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:02.240]   So that's- I think that- that makes sense.
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:03.920]   I do think that the- the big mistake is-
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:04.800]   is that, you know,
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:06.960]   I think anybody who sat in a court case realized
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:09.360]   that's very subjective and the judge has a lot of power.
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:09.760]   And-
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:11.120]   By the way, Apple did-
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:12.400]   The judge did decline that request.
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:13.760]   -Right. -We're going back in time, all right.
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:13.760]   -Right.
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:14.320]   The- the-
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:15.680]   -You know-
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:16.320]   -So complicated-
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:17.120]   -These are complicated cases.
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:18.640]   They're a long time and the judge has a lot of power
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:19.440]   to do a lot of things.
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:19.840]   -Right.
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:23.360]   -And- and, you know, making the judge really irate
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:26.080]   is not a great way to move things forward.
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.120]   You know, like, you know,
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:28.960]   crossing them directly is-
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:32.320]   is a great way to have a lot of your objections over ruled.
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:32.800]   -Right.
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:33.760]   -And a lot of things, you know, a lot of things.
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:35.680]   -So on Friday, the judge co-
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:37.440]   said, "No, I'm not going to grant that."
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:38.800]   Um,
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:42.240]   Samsung has responded by filing a motion to strike.
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:44.560]   It's a bet- this is like-
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:45.760]   This is trench warfare.
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:47.600]   This is- this is a battle.
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:54.480]   The interesting revelation at the end of yesterday's hearing
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:57.760]   was an internal email from Samsung.
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:00.240]   This was kind of the- the bombshell that came out yesterday.
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:01.440]   Um,
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:05.680]   JK Shin, Samsung's head of mobile communications,
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:09.440]   described the difference in user experience between Samsung and Apple.
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:12.560]   This is when the iPhone at first come out as a difference between
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:15.360]   heaven and Earth, heaven being the Apple iPhone.
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:16.080]   -Mm-hmm.
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:20.160]   Samsung, of course, tried to keep that email from being admitted
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:21.600]   and had kept it out until now.
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:24.480]   But this morning- this is- I'm reading from Mike Isa-
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:26.160]   Mike Isaacs in All Things D.
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:28.080]   This morning, that is yesterday morning,
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:31.360]   Samsung legal counsel John Quinn mentioned-
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.520]   big mistake.
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:34.080]   I gotta think.
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:39.200]   The crisis of design moment in a question to Samsung's strategist,
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:43.120]   Justin Denison, at that point, Apple felt it's in.
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:44.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000]   He's now introduced something.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:46.640]   -Step that amount.
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:47.200]   -We've got it.
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:47.840]   We've got it.
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.280]   We can put that memo in.
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:49.840]   -Right.
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:50.080]   -Yeah.
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:52.560]   -Uh, and so this is what Shin wrote-
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:56.320]   influential figures outside the company come across the iPhone,
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:59.920]   and they point out that Samsung- this is an internal memo to Samsung engineers-
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:01.600]   that Samsung is dozing off.
[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:05.360]   All this time, we've been paying it all our attention to Nokia
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:09.600]   and concentrated our efforts on things like folder, bar, slide.
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:15.680]   Yet when our UX user design is compared to the unexpected competitor of Apple's iPhone,
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:18.320]   the difference is truly that of heaven and earth.
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:20.560]   It's a crisis of design.
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:22.320]   Okay.
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:27.360]   But isn't- what is he saying other than we need to make phones that are easier to use,
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:29.280]   that are more elegant, that are simpler?
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:29.760]   -Right.
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:32.720]   -It's not a- it's not a- it's not a smoking gun saying-
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:33.280]   -Let's copy.
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:33.760]   -Well, right.
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:36.880]   And it's not- it's also not saying anything different than what Apple says,
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:38.640]   you know, there are seven-inch tablets that work well.
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:39.600]   We should think about that.
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:42.720]   You know, that's another- you know, on the other side of it is that you're always
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:43.840]   paying attention to a competition.
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:44.960]   And of course they're going to have this.
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:47.520]   I don't- I agree that I don't think that that's necessarily like a-
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:49.120]   we should copy the- you know, the iPhone.
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:51.840]   I don't think it's as much of a smoking gun as it's made out to be.
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:54.720]   -The only line in the email that maybe you could say that is,
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:56.480]   "I hear things like this.
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:58.240]   Let's make something like the iPhone."
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:21:59.040]   He's not saying it.
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.880]   He's saying, "I hear this."
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:03.600]   Right.
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:04.480]   Not a smoking gun.
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:07.040]   And also that these are internal memos.
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:13.760]   It's hard to- it's- I imagine how you would couch everything that you said in private
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:17.200]   conversation if you knew that it would have to be reinterpreted for the outside.
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:22.000]   Where you would- there's shorthand that you use that you know would be legally actionable
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.320]   because if you misinterpreted it to something else completely.
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:28.560]   So this is- I've just seen this thing flagged as a smoking gun in too many blocks to think,
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:29.360]   "Oh, come on."
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:32.480]   -Which, by the way, this is another word of warning like we were talking about security before.
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:34.240]   -Don't write anything.
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:34.800]   -You're reading emails.
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:36.400]   Just remember that those are legal documents.
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:39.200]   -You know, and they can be subpoenaed.
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:40.080]   I use them all the time.
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:42.000]   I nail people down all the time.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.120]   I have a phone call with somebody.
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:45.200]   -And I will- -I'll use that for it in writing.
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.440]   -Well, I have a phone call with someone and I go, "As per our meeting,
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:48.480]   this is what my understanding was.
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:49.680]   If it's not that, let me know."
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:49.840]   -Right.
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:53.520]   -You know what I like, but it's- so I always kind of put a hook in there.
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:55.680]   Just because I don't- -Right.
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:56.640]   -Work with too many people.
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:59.200]   -Other revelations.
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:03.920]   And by the way, you could play this game, Andy and Alex, if you have your favorite.
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:05.680]   Another revelation I thought was interesting.
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:12.400]   Apple did not buy advertising after the original iPhone announcement.
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:16.400]   Schiller, discussing the iPhone said Apple decided not to pay for any advertising
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:19.120]   during a brief period after the device was introduced.
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:22.000]   And when it went on sale later in the year, "We didn't need to,"
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.840]   Schiller said.
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:27.280]   He read from several rave reviews of the iPhone and iPad explaining,
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:30.800]   "Such stories did a better job than advertising to build buzz."
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:33.920]   This is no news to anybody.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:38.480]   This would be like having to take out full page ads and rolling stone
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:41.760]   to try to sell some tickets to a Beatles reunion in 1978.
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:46.640]   The thing was gonna go, and people were already talking about it.
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:49.040]   We did the advertising for them.
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:50.080]   -I'm sad to say.
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:53.680]   -No, I mean, I don't want to say we're sad to say.
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:54.880]   I mean-
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:56.720]   -You know what, the great thing is the great thing.
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:59.520]   -We have this great position being in our jobs.
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:03.040]   And sometimes we are genuinely enthusiastic about something.
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:06.560]   And we get to come on the microphone or take to the typewriter.
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:07.280]   -Typriter, yeah.
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:08.400]   -Typriter.
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:10.160]   -Hey, it's 2007.
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:14.480]   I just saw a demonstration of this incredible touchscreen device.
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:18.000]   I actually got to use one for 38 blessed minutes.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.880]   Let me tell you about what each minute of that experience with the iPhone in January was like.
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:24.160]   And it's not-
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:25.920]   I don't feel like a shill.
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:27.440]   I don't feel like I'm a stooge.
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:28.800]   I don't feel like I'm being exploited,
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:31.760]   because it comes from a sincere place.
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:34.960]   And I've stopped because they filled with complimentary shrimp
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:39.280]   and also caught me at the gaming tables or paid off my gambling debts.
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:40.080]   It was just-
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:41.120]   -This is just a cool-
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:41.760]   -Right.
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:42.400]   -I always told you-
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:43.120]   -Always-
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:46.640]   -Sometimes there's an awkward moment when I will write a-
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:49.760]   -Almost embarrassingly positive review of something I like.
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:52.960]   And I'll get a thank you note from the guys who are-
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:54.560]   -And the people who develop it.
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:56.560]   And I have to say, just keep making great stuff.
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:57.600]   I mean, you earned that.
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:58.480]   And you didn't have to-
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:24:59.440]   No thanks are necessary.
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:03.680]   Thank you for giving me something that made me very, very glad once again
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:06.240]   that I chose to write about technology instead of writing about the movies.
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:09.600]   -And when it came out, I mean, the bottom line is we all hated our phones.
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:10.240]   And we finally had to know-
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:11.920]   -Scott Warren should get a check from that.
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:12.560]   -Well, I didn't-
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:13.360]   -I didn't get a check from that phone.
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:15.120]   -You know-
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:18.880]   -But my previous phone was actually a Windows phone.
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:25.040]   And I actually thought that they had done a really great job on the five-button interface.
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:26.080]   It was a flip phone.
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:30.160]   It was actually designed to look like a Star Trek communicator,
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:31.360]   more than anything else.
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:37.040]   The apps for it that were back by really nice mobile apps.
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:37.920]   I liked it a lot.
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:42.320]   But yeah, as soon as you even saw the iPhone for the first time,
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:43.280]   you just never went back.
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:44.080]   -That was-
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:44.640]   -I think it-
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:48.080]   -I don't think that it was really the iPhone that other companies were copying.
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:52.880]   It was the excitement that people that it caused that they're trying to copy.
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:55.600]   They're saying if everybody is this excited about something that-
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:26:00.640]   -That only maybe 80 people outside of Apple on this planet had even touched
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:01.680]   in a functional state.
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:04.320]   Maybe they're on to something.
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:08.240]   Maybe the Apple is on to something and we should see what we're doing wrong with our own phones.
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:13.520]   People aren't already lined up six weeks in advance to touch the hem of our next phone's garment.
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:15.680]   So-
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:18.000]   -I thought my favorite revelation is Apple.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.200]   It was either a phone or a car.
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:20.160]   -What?
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:20.720]   -Yeah.
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:24.160]   -There was one of the articles that were reading that Apple was actually-
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:26.640]   -The other things they were considering is they were looking at new markets to go into-
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:27.760]   -Is it a phone or a phone or a car?
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:27.760]   -No, it wasn't either.
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:29.600]   -I simplified that a little bit.
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:31.120]   But one of the other-
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:31.680]   -What was the other one?
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:32.640]   There was-
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:34.000]   -I think a TV was one of the other ones.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:34.480]   -Oh, I like it.
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:37.440]   -But there was a list of other things they were thinking about and a car was-
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:39.360]   -Because I think that Apple's going to eventually make a car.
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:40.240]   -Oh, I love an Apple car.
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:41.760]   -See?
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:45.040]   That totally synced in with your iPhone and everything else?
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:45.680]   -I couldn't love an Apple car.
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:46.640]   -See, I would-
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:46.640]   -I would-
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:47.680]   -You know, and I'm-
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:48.240]   -You know, the-
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:48.640]   -No, I'd-
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:50.240]   -See?
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:51.040]   -Yeah, no, you're right.
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:52.000]   -Then you got me excited.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.200]   -When you talk about-
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:55.840]   -My opinion is how Apple gets to a trillion-
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:57.280]   -A trillion dollar market value?
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:57.520]   -Right.
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:58.400]   -Cars.
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:26:58.720]   Cars.
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.320]   Big business.
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:02.960]   And think of all these iPhone users that would buy a car, an Apple car.
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:04.560]   -Oh, it'd have to be a hybrid or a-
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:05.760]   -It'd be a hybrid or electric.
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:07.120]   It would be like simple.
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:08.160]   There wouldn't be-
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:10.080]   -You'd either be a steering wheel, but there'd be, you know,
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:11.120]   not a lot of knobs.
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:14.480]   -The only problem with an Apple car is that people would actually aim their cars at you.
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.400]   [laughter]
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:17.360]   -The only negative.
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:20.320]   Also, putting that white sticker in the back would actually be superfluous.
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:21.280]   [laughter]
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:21.600]   -Right.
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:22.560]   -But I-
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.640]   -For some reason I always think of it as a VW bug.
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:25.600]   -Headlights.
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:28.320]   -Headlights in an Apple shape logo.
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:31.520]   -We're already seeing it in the form of the Tesla,
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:32.960]   where the new-
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:34.640]   -What's the new model of one of the-
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:34.880]   -Yes.
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:35.520]   -Worder Amsterdam.
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:35.920]   -Right.
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:36.400]   -Right.
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:38.640]   -Where it's incredibly cool,
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:40.640]   uses incredibly advanced technology.
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:42.400]   The cockpit is amazing.
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:46.960]   It comes with this huge, beautiful touchscreen in the center console that controls everything.
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:51.040]   It is one of the most desirable and wonderful cars ever made,
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:53.040]   but it costs way too much money,
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:57.840]   and it is way out of reach of the majority of the people out there.
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:00.880]   I do think that Apple would have a problem creating a car that-
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:03.920]   that any significant number of people could have found.
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:04.160]   -I think-
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:04.720]   -I bet you they-
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:04.720]   -I bet you they-
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:05.200]   -I bet you they-
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:05.200]   -I bet you they-
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:06.000]   -I bet you they did one there.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.400]   -I bet you they did one there would be between 25 and 40,000.
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:09.520]   It wouldn't be like a cheap one.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:11.360]   It wouldn't be a luxury one.
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:12.960]   I think it would be in that range.
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:14.080]   And I think that-
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:15.840]   There's just a lot of people when you look at the interface stuff,
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:18.400]   like I was test driving a car over the weekend.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:19.200]   And it had a great-
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:21.360]   -Which car?
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.280]   -BmW. It was new.
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:24.240]   Anyway, I'm not going to buy it.
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:25.920]   It's too much money.
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:26.480]   -It's too much money.
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:27.920]   -It was way too much money.
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:29.680]   -But I had to try it.
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:34.720]   So anyway, the BMW has this incredible interface that you could do now.
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:35.680]   -All of them went through and everything else,
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:38.400]   but I have to admit, I don't really want to learn that interface.
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:39.200]   -They had an op-
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:39.200]   -I had an op-
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:39.200]   -I had an op-
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:39.200]   -I had an op-
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:40.000]   -It had to be able to attach my-
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:40.560]   -It didn't-
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:41.360]   -Oh, yeah, it did have the-
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:42.400]   -Yeah, see, I don't like the knob.
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:43.840]   That's wrong.
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:44.720]   There's something wrong there.
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:47.680]   That's why I like Ford because you talk to it.
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:49.760]   And the knob is to me, anything that you have to fiddle-
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:52.640]   -Well, my thing is I didn't want to learn new interface.
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:54.400]   I just want my iPad to work in it.
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:55.920]   Like I just was like, you don't need to build that.
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:57.920]   Like, I really don't need something new.
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:59.920]   And I think that's the issue is that I want-
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:01.200]   Like, when I look at where Apple can go,
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:02.880]   it's anything that I want to interface my stuff with,
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:04.960]   whether it's a washer and dryer or refrigerator or whatever.
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:06.800]   I just went to interface with my iLife.
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:07.680]   -Yeah.
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:10.000]   I mean, to me, I often-
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.120]   I think I've said this before,
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:13.680]   that I often contrast the way that I relate
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:16.320]   to technology, to the way I relate to my car,
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:18.800]   where I'm a straightforward,
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:21.200]   plain, Jane boring consumer when it comes to cars.
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:24.080]   I am the person who thinks that the Crown Victoria
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:25.840]   is a sweet, sweet ride.
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:30.960]   When I look at cars, really,
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:34.080]   in addition to all the mechanical stuff I'm looking for,
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:36.400]   is there a blank spot somewhere on the dash
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:40.880]   where I could bolt in my ram mount for my car phone?
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:42.000]   For my iPhone mount?
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.440]   And if it has one, okay, good.
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:44.320]   I'm fine.
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:46.960]   But don't you want to try to hear about the really wonderful
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:47.200]   set of-
[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:47.680]   Nope.
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:48.400]   -But you're-
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:48.880]   -So it has it.
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:49.520]   I don't care.
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:50.400]   -But just think of-
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:51.200]   If Apple made a car,
[01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:53.520]   someone was mentioning this on the chat,
[01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:55.040]   but you wouldn't be able to change the battery.
[01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:55.600]   -Right.
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:57.200]   -There'd be certain parts of the city you just can't go.
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:00.320]   You know, I mean, no, no, no, you can't.
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:02.160]   -No, no, no, you don't want to go there.
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:03.520]   We're trying to keep you sandboxed
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:05.840]   into the good parts of the town.
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:07.920]   -And it would get terrible reception.
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:08.960]   [laughter]
[01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:09.360]   -It would get-
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:10.400]   [laughter]
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:10.800]   -Yeah.
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:11.920]   [laughter]
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:13.840]   -It would get bad reception.
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:15.120]   -Let's move on.
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:17.040]   One more thing from the trial coming up.
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:20.080]   Susan Care, who is just incredible,
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.440]   was on the original Mac team,
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:24.080]   she did the original icons for the Mac.
[01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:28.800]   She will be on the witness stand, I believe.
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:31.120]   -I said this is designed 32 by 32 icons.
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:33.360]   And I just have so much respect for people who are well.
[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:34.160]   -She is just wonderful.
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:36.160]   She worked for Microsoft, by the way.
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:37.360]   She did icons for Microsoft.
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:39.040]   -It works for anybody smart enough to hire her.
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:39.280]   -Yes.
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:44.240]   -It's not a big mystery as to why she's on Apple's list, is it?
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:45.360]   -No, no, no, no.
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:47.840]   She did the Facebook gifts.
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:49.200]   Remember that when you could buy somebody
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:50.880]   something on Facebook, a virtual gift?
[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.480]   She did those original icons.
[01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:54.560]   You could tell too, because it was a unique style.
[01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:58.000]   So Apple is expected to ask her to talk about the design
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.600]   of Samsung's devices compared to three of Apple's design patents.
[01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:02.720]   She is a designer.
[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:05.920]   Also, let's see who else?
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:08.400]   Apple, each side is 25 hours of court time.
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:10.800]   And up to 50 witnesses.
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:18.080]   So there's a fairly long list on the CNET of people who were expected to hit the stand.
[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:20.880]   -I mentioned it here if they talk to her about the design of icons
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:25.360]   that Samsung put on their first generations of post-iPhone devices.
[01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:28.480]   Because I am the first one to say, "Oh, look, I mean,
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:31.440]   there's some things that are just logical when you're designing a handheld device."
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:35.120]   But then there are other elements where, "Yeah, but they actually took
[01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:37.520]   the icons for the music player and the calendar,
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:39.680]   like pixel for pixel." -Yeah, that was the issue.
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:42.320]   -Is that that was the issue that I think really got Samsung.
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:44.880]   It's one thing to make it look just the same on the outside.
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:46.880]   But it was like, "All these icons are the same.
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:49.520]   All the, you know, there's so many things that were copied."
[01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:51.280]   I think that's what really brought them into it.
[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:53.840]   -The first generation, I don't think it's true anymore,
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:57.600]   but the first generation of Samsung, like post-iPhone devices,
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:01.200]   there was just no defense they possibly had.
[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:05.600]   They were trying to, I honestly believe that they're hopefully trying to catch people saying,
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:07.440]   "Oh, well, that looks exactly like..."
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:10.400]   Actually, I thought it was called an "I-something," but okay, it's the...
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:12.160]   Okay, got it. Nope, this is good.
[01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:16.160]   -If that's the case, then this is a very legitimate core case.
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:18.640]   I mean, that's really what the whole thing boils down to.
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:20.800]   -Parts of it are, a lot of it I think is overreaching.
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:26.320]   We see now Apple with the full Apple graphical graphic arts treatment,
[01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:29.680]   the famous, "Well, this is what every phone looked like before the iPhone."
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:33.280]   And now after the iPhone, every phone looked like the iPhone.
[01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:35.120]   I'm like, "Actually, no, that's not true at all."
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:40.080]   Every phone looked like no, it's like, "I said every phone looked like the iPhone."
[01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:41.840]   It's like, "Okay, you're being really..."
[01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:45.760]   You could work for presidential candidate with logical like that,
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.840]   logic like that, but okay.
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:54.960]   -Let's do a break and then come back with tips and picks.
[01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:58.480]   The usual, I think we've got everything.
[01:32:58.480 --> 01:32:59.520]   -We've got such a great pick.
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:00.320]   -Do you have a pick?
[01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:01.280]   -I'm so excited.
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:01.280]   -All right.
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:02.080]   -I got a good tip too.
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:07.040]   But first, and I am going to mention this now because they bought the ad
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:09.680]   and it really is a great product, carbonite.
[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:12.000]   And I'm just going to say, I'm just going to mention Matt,
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:15.040]   if you want, I can set you up with a little deal.
[01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:15.840]   I should.
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:17.680]   I should just get Matt out of a carbonite account.
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:20.880]   Because really, nothing to worry about.
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:22.160]   It's not that the cloud is bad,
[01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:24.560]   it's just you don't want to put all your eggs in one basket.
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:28.560]   And this is why that three to one backup is so important.
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:31.680]   Three copies of everything, two different forms of media,
[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:33.760]   so you're not all zip disc.
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:36.800]   Two different kinds.
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:38.720]   And one of them offsite, carbonite is it.
[01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:42.880]   It's a continuous automatic offsite backup to the cloud.
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:47.840]   Your carbonite account, absolutely safe, secure.
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:50.080]   You can actually encrypt it further if you wish.
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:51.920]   They offer that as an option.
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:54.320]   And only you have the keys, they always use SSL,
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:56.000]   which means whenever you're online anywhere,
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.320]   you're backing up safely, securely.
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:02.640]   And $59 a year for everything on your hard drive,
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:04.400]   $59 per year per computer.
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:06.240]   That's a good deal.
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:08.000]   You could try it free for two weeks.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.040]   I do recommend that.
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:11.280]   You want to see how it works on your system,
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:12.480]   Mac or PC.
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:17.200]   They do have small business and home office accounts as well.
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:19.760]   Some don't work on the Mac yet, they still are Windows only.
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:22.480]   But if you want that simple, easy to use,
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:25.120]   back it up for less than five bucks a month,
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:27.920]   you got to go to carbonite.com, use the offer code.
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:29.360]   Mac break when you try it,
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:31.360]   just click the try home free button.
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:34.160]   Offer code Mac break.
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:37.760]   And by the way, you don't need a credit card to do this.
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:41.440]   And after the two week trial, if you decide to buy,
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:43.840]   you'll get 14 months for the price of 12.
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:48.160]   Carbonite was designed to solve this problem.
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:49.040]   It's been around for a long time.
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:51.200]   I'm surprised more people don't use it.
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:52.640]   I'm doing my best to spread the word.
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:55.120]   Carbonite is really good for laptop.
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:56.800]   Carbonite.com, the offer code is
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:58.960]   Mac break.
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:00.080]   It's the good part of the cloud.
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:03.120]   Well, you said it.
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:04.320]   You got to have it.
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:07.040]   You shouldn't make, you got to have different, different.
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:09.680]   Heather, heather, heather,
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:12.560]   a genie, is your friend in this particular case.
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:12.880]   Yes.
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:14.560]   Putting everything in one spot, not good.
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:17.120]   Basket, one, everything in one basket.
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:18.720]   One basket, so to speak.
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:21.680]   Do you want to do an iOS tip?
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:22.480]   I always ask you this.
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:22.880]   Yes.
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:23.520]   All right.
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:25.760]   So, um, well, actually having any do with it,
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:26.480]   the lion tip first.
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:27.520]   Lion tip first.
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:28.080]   I want to make sure I get proper attribution.
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:29.440]   Because someone sent me in first.
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:30.480]   I want to make sure I got rid.
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:33.680]   Well, this is sort of a minor tip.
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:34.240]   Oh, there it is.
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:34.560]   Hang on.
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:36.000]   I'm cycling through the windows.
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.080]   I love that javelin thrower, by the way, behind you.
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:38.560]   Yes.
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:42.160]   That's a Soviet poster from like the 1950s or something.
[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:43.600]   Did you watch the hip tathlon?
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:44.480]   I keep trying to find it.
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:45.440]   I can't find anywhere.
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:46.160]   Such a great entity.
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:50.240]   But when NS1, that 800 meter leading start to finish,
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:53.920]   you know, that's javelin shot put running.
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:57.840]   I mean, that has to be the event, like the, you know, Olympic event.
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:35:59.920]   You're an all around athlete and look at her.
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:00.400]   You could tell.
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:02.240]   She ran a text.
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:04.080]   Like she's not even known for running that 800.
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:07.440]   And she ran a 800 400, but it was a textbook win.
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:08.960]   I mean, it was just really well done.
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:09.680]   Just amazing.
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:10.400]   Anyway, sorry.
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:10.880]   Go ahead.
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:12.240]   Oh, no trouble.
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:15.840]   This is sort of a minor tip where that, again, that's, that's,
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:18.080]   that's a woman that you, you're going to, yeah, that's.
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:22.960]   I don't know what this is, but I love her already.
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:25.200]   Them, them Soviets had a lot to fight home for.
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:25.920]   That was good.
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:30.000]   The Apple has a whole bunch of RSS feeds.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.800]   You should know about one of them is that there's so much things going on on the iTunes
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:35.040]   store.
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:37.680]   You can't really keep up with the flow of new stuff.
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:41.600]   Sometimes people ask me, gee, how come you, how do you keep coming up with like new
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:43.920]   picks for like software for iOS and iOS?
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:47.280]   A lot of it comes from when I've seen someone using a, using an app and I think
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:50.720]   it's really good or I see someone talk about it or is reviewed in a blog.
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:51.440]   That's good.
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:54.880]   Another part of it is that I actually have RSS feeds set up to inform me,
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:57.360]   just so I can get a big picture of what's coming into the store.
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:05.360]   An Apple actually has an RSS feed generator at itunes.apple.com/rss.
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:10.240]   And it's actually a tiny little web app, like a web form where you just navigate
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:14.640]   through a bunch of pop up menus where after you decide what, what, what story you want to
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:19.120]   keep an eye on, you can say, I want to, please, I want to, I want to find out about this,
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:21.200]   this feed to cover iOS apps.
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:25.840]   I want you to not show you, there's like a million different options of what kind of iOS apps you
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:26.480]   want to check out.
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:31.920]   Say, I want to, I want you to show me every new app or every new free app or every new paid app.
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:36.960]   And then just show me, just show me the first 50 and only the ones that are in productivity.
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:40.800]   And then just click the generate button and we'll give you an RSS feed that you can
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:42.640]   plug into Google Reader.
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:48.720]   And I mean, it's, you, you, you are like Lucy and Viv trying to box chocolates.
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:51.920]   If you're trying to keep up with everything that gets posted to the store,
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:56.320]   but every time you dip in, if you go through those 50 in the list that you or that 10 in the list,
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:00.160]   you're liable to see something interesting that's worth clicking on that link and seeing
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:01.040]   what it's all about.
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:04.880]   As a matter of fact, my pick of the week this week is something that I discovered
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:08.320]   through my Mac OS app, RSS feed.
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:12.640]   So iTunes.apple.com/rss, very, very handy.
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:16.400]   And of course, they took RSS out of both mail and Safari.
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:19.440]   I think they get a complaint from a woman who said, you know, they not only deleted,
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:24.720]   took the feature out of mail, but they actually, I lost everything because it just is gone.
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:30.480]   And she said, I had to, took me a long time to figure out, I think she got support from Apple,
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:34.640]   that the feeds are persist, but they persist kind of in a hidden, probably in the application
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:35.600]   support folder.
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:37.840]   So she had to go dig and finally found everything.
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:39.120]   But that is kind of a shock.
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:42.080]   You have to grab the mountain lion and all your feeds are gone.
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:43.600]   So what do you like for a feed reader?
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:44.480]   What do you, what do you use?
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:45.200]   What do you recommend?
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:53.680]   On the desktop, actually, I actually use Google Reader as my, I'm talking about the web app
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:59.200]   as my, as my main app, chiefly because it's the one platform agnostic system where I know
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:01.680]   how it works, place by place by place.
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:06.240]   Also, I've subscribed to so many different feeds that I don't always know for sure
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:10.400]   that I'm going to get to, I want to make sure that my place is kept from app to app.
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:16.960]   On the desktop, I had actually go into mission control to make sure that got the exact right one.
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:19.520]   Reader is my favorite.
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:21.040]   I love reader.
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:23.040]   And a log of, of Google Reader.
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:26.000]   Two terms of have, R-E-E-D-E-R, right.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.080]   It's not even a terribly expensive app.
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:33.360]   It works exactly like Google Reader in that whatever you do, let's say on your Android phone,
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:36.240]   on your iPhone, it will be reflected in your reader counts.
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:42.960]   If you're the alternative to reader for me is NetNewswire,
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:47.520]   chiefly because it lets you have subscribed to feeds outside of Google Reader.
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:55.280]   I've actually, it's a very timely question because finally, after realizing that my Google
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:40:00.480]   Reader subscriptions had become really difficult to use as an actual tool, because
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:06.960]   you want to know how old some of the feeds in that subscription work, I actually had a subscription
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:10.000]   to YouTube newly posted videos.
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.360]   Not anymore.
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:14.560]   There were so few videos being posted to YouTube,
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:18.560]   you can actually ask me that told you all of them, like, oh gosh, only eight today.
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:19.920]   Oh, well, there's nothing really there.
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:21.040]   It's hysterical, isn't it?
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:21.840]   Oh my gosh.
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:26.240]   I went up with well over, somewhere close to about a thousand, a little bit over a thousand.
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:31.040]   And so, unfortunately, over the past x number of years, I had never been completely diligent
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:34.480]   about making sure they're all organized and folded, so it was a total, total mess.
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:40.480]   And I finally had to do the Aliens, Lieutenant Ripley algorithm, which is just nuke it all from
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:41.440]   orbit, it's the only way.
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:44.000]   And started again from zero.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:47.680]   The first thing I did though was export all 1000 of those into a OPML file.
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:50.080]   They're getting to the point now.
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:52.960]   You could actually, I could actually import this into NetNewswire.
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:58.240]   This isn't, these thousand feeds are not a Google Reader subscription, but I have them
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:03.520]   offline so that as I keep weeding things out and slowly moving things into Google Reader,
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:08.160]   now I'm up to maybe 80 or 90, I'll probably be up to about 200 or 300 by the time I'm finished.
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:11.120]   Like the stuff that I really rely on to get my news and information from,
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:17.200]   but it's nice that I'll also be able to have lesser important news feeds and blogs offline
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:21.120]   that will not contaminate, will not ruin the experience of trying to just keep up to date
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:22.800]   while I'm waiting in line at the deli.
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:26.000]   And that's why I use NetNewswire for.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.560]   That's a veteran Mac app, which I've used for years and years.
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:34.800]   Doesn't it make you happy that there are some of these tools that have just been
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:40.880]   getting the job done like the Gene Hackman of the app world where they're always out there
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:43.440]   and they're always doing good stuff year after year after year.
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:45.360]   He's getting the job done since 2005.
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:48.000]   I always tip.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.320]   Okay, so this one, oh, look at that man.
[01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:53.280]   Oh no, that's my pick.
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:54.000]   Oh wow.
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:54.640]   That's not it.
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:55.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:56.000]   See that's what I was.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.040]   Oh baby.
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:58.400]   That's what I'm talking about.
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:41:59.600]   That's what I'm talking about.
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:07.200]   So anyway, so this tip is, Derek Slater sent this in and this is,
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:10.240]   I tweeted this morning like I'm looking for a tip.
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:14.320]   When he said it, I didn't believe it would work, but it does.
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:19.840]   So what you do is you, if you are in anything that can type,
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:21.600]   so let's just say your text messaging.
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:27.280]   So I'll go into my text message and I will text message to my daughter.
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:29.680]   All right, so anywhere the cursor's sitting here?
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:35.120]   If you put it up to your head, so if you start typing and go, hello,
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:42.480]   I just want to test the text on my SMS.
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:44.880]   There it is.
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:47.280]   Just by putting up to your head, Siri launched.
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:48.160]   Siri dictation.
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:49.520]   It wasn't, yeah, Siri dictation.
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:52.160]   So the dictation worked just by putting it up to my head and starting to talk.
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:54.000]   And I find that you do like that.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:54.000]   I like that.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:54.880]   So you can finish it.
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:56.880]   You're just like, oh, I can't keep on typing this.
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:42:59.200]   You know, that's all you hear it?
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:01.360]   I was like, wait, hold on.
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:02.640]   See if I pull it up here?
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:04.000]   No, it's still waiting.
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.240]   Anyway, so I thought that was a great little tip.
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:09.520]   So anywhere your cursor is sitting, you can just put it up to your head and just start talking.
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:11.280]   You don't have to hit the little microphone.
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:12.400]   That's what I always did before.
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:14.640]   Is that hit the microphone and you just just start talking.
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:15.600]   It's just there.
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:17.040]   That's my tip.
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:17.920]   Good tip.
[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:18.880]   Just put it to your head.
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:19.520]   Just put it to your head.
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:20.720]   See what happens.
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:22.400]   Put the phone to the head and pull.
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:24.720]   And now it's time for actually, you know what?
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:27.840]   I'm going to, instead of doing a pick, I'll do a quick tip.
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:30.160]   And it's actually in a way, a news story.
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:33.840]   There's been a lot of conversation about how the fact that you no longer have a save
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:35.840]   is in mountain lines.
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:36.880]   Oh, that would be fun.
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:37.360]   Yeah.
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:38.480]   That's an important news item.
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:47.360]   And good article in it's MacPerformanceGuy.com where he points out that, yes, there is a work
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:48.160]   around.
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:48.960]   We've mentioned it before.
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:53.520]   Hold down the option key for the, so let me do it in pages because pages is one of the
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:56.800]   programs that lost its save as.
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:58.000]   Not that I'm bitter.
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.080]   Well, but I'm going to point out something.
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:06.720]   But anyway, so there's no save as when you, let's create a blank document here real quickly,
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:07.520]   a new document.
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:07.920]   Okay.
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:11.760]   You can see I haven't used pages in a while.
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:12.320]   There we go.
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:13.040]   That's not me.
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:14.960]   But it could be.
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:15.760]   Maybe next year.
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:19.040]   But you see there's no save as anymore.
[01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:23.920]   If you press the option key, save as appears.
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:26.960]   But here's the most important thing to understand.
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.400]   It is not what you think it is.
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:33.600]   If one edits a document, this is from MacPerformanceGuy.com and chooses save as,
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:41.200]   then both the edited original and the copy are saved, not only saving new copy, but silently
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:46.000]   saving the original with the same changes overriding the original original.
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.440]   Well, because that's what it does.
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:48.800]   Well, it's iterating it.
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:50.160]   So it's not really overriding.
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:51.360]   It's adding to the iterations.
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:52.400]   It's an inversion, right?
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:55.280]   But people may not understand the only way to do that.
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:58.160]   The only way to handle this would be to, as soon as you open your document, save as,
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:00.480]   and then keep on going, knowing that.
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:01.040]   Right.
[01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:03.040]   Now, I have to point out there's a difficulty.
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:08.320]   The difficulty is that I think Apple arbitrarily decided that here is a way that everybody expects
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:09.280]   save as to work.
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:13.600]   We're going to have it work differently from now on and not make that monumentally obvious,
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:15.200]   which I think is just an obvious mistake.
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:20.720]   But what they have in place of the save as, right below save in pages, is duplicate,
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:23.760]   which to me is kind of--
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:24.240]   It's a lot of--
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:25.200]   Is that not the same?
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:26.560]   I know, but it's just like, it's duplicate.
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:27.680]   Now, do you want to revert it?
[01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:29.920]   Okay, I want to revert it and then duplicate it.
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:31.200]   And then I have to save as again.
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:34.080]   I mean, just a whole lot of steps for, I want to save one more iteration.
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:36.960]   Well, I think duplicate is more of an explicit fork.
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:38.080]   Right.
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:39.920]   But isn't that what you use save as for?
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:41.760]   No, I use it as iterations.
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:43.040]   Like, I don't--
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:44.400]   Yeah, you're forking it now.
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:46.240]   I don't want it to iterate everything.
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:49.040]   I want to say, this is where I want to keep this document.
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:49.760]   I want it to stay.
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:50.640]   Do the key do that?
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:51.120]   Yeah.
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:53.360]   I know, but it's a lot of steps rather than save as in--
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:54.880]   It's not one step, duplicate.
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:57.040]   No, I've got the difficulty for me is that--
[01:45:57.040 --> 01:45:57.520]   No, it's but--
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:58.320]   But now it's like, scroll down.
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:45:59.120]   Now I have to save it.
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:02.000]   Well, not only that, it's duplicate.
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.640]   It's usually, do you want to revert the file you were in before?
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:05.520]   What happens a lot of times?
[01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:05.840]   I have it.
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:08.320]   I'll use something as a template in numbers.
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:09.760]   I do a lot of stuff in numbers.
[01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:15.840]   And so I will take an old quote that I did for somebody,
[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:17.680]   some other company, and I'll start working on it
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:20.000]   and then I'll realize, oh, now I have to duplicate and revert.
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:20.800]   So it's not just duplicate.
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:22.640]   I want to duplicate and revert the one that I had
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:24.160]   because that was somebody else's quote.
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:26.800]   Ah, so you went to Florida on the road.
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:27.280]   I started going to--
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:29.040]   You're using as a template and then--
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:29.760]   Well, that's different.
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:31.360]   You're using it wrong.
[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:32.080]   No, I mean, it's just--
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:32.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:34.480]   You're holding it wrong.
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:36.560]   It's just the save as works great.
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:38.400]   I just pointing out that this has changed
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:40.160]   and you should be careful when you use save as
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:41.680]   because the behavior is different.
[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:42.800]   But if I go to file--
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:45.040]   No, so I've created the first version, right?
[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:46.880]   And now I go to file, duplicate.
[01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:48.400]   It doesn't do the same thing as save as.
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:51.280]   What it literally does is creates on a screen a copy,
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:56.960]   which you could then rename to the second version.
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:46:58.400]   Now I have two versions.
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:01.440]   And that's kind of what I was expecting.
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:03.440]   It took one more step than save as does.
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:08.240]   I don't think Apple should be really faulted
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:12.720]   for creating a versioning system that I think maybe
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:13.440]   needs to be tweaked.
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:15.600]   I think that they should have understood that
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:18.000]   over the next year or two, we might have to modify
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.480]   how it works as we adapt to how people are using it.
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:23.680]   For me, I really wish it worked the way that--
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:25.520]   for instance, Scrivener's version of versioning
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:29.360]   worked where you can actually take explicit snapshots
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:31.840]   and name them as well as doing the automatic backups
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:33.840]   because the way that I work--
[01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:37.040]   I want to say here's the point, which I got a 4,000 word column.
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:39.360]   I know I got to cut it down to 2,800.
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:41.440]   I'm going to take a snapshot of the original and say,
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:43.520]   here it was with all the flab intact
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:46.720]   so that if I ever need to rewind it's back to a specific point,
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:48.880]   I don't have to guess as to what--
[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:51.040]   I don't have to try to guess, okay, it was a Monday.
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:55.200]   I think it was an afternoon because the more repovate show was on,
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:56.880]   it was one of those baby shows.
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:58.240]   Oh, no, wait, I'm sorry, it was Oprah,
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:01.440]   but it was like Oprah's next-- oh, damn it, which one was it?
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:04.320]   That's not easier than simply rolling back
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:05.600]   to an actual named snapshot.
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:08.240]   Right, like you, I have very specific times that--
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:11.040]   when I do a destructive editor, I'm about to do a destructive editor,
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:12.320]   I'll save something.
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:16.080]   That's where I want to remember to go back to if I have to.
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:18.880]   And it's not like I want to do it every time I make a change.
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:20.080]   Right.
[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:21.440]   Anyways--
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:23.360]   I'm saying this is a warning.
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:25.120]   It's kind of like when Apple changed the scroll.
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:27.600]   It's like they're doing it differently.
[01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:31.840]   And sorry, you had to be upset until you figured out
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:33.120]   where to go in preferences to make sense.
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:35.280]   The main thing is once you learn this option,
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:38.400]   Save As, to not assume that that's going to be the same as your old Save As.
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:38.560]   Right.
[01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:39.600]   It's still not the same.
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:40.080]   Right.
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:40.960]   That's my main point.
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:42.880]   Andy, you're pick of the week.
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:48.560]   My pick of the week is a really cool combination graphics demo and screen saver
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:53.120]   called TextifyMe, T-E-X-T-I-F-Y-Me.
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:57.200]   And it's on the Apple, the iTunes store.
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:00.320]   And what it is-- I'm trying to figure out a way to demonstrate it,
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:01.360]   but there's no way to do it.
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:08.240]   What it does is it will just-- it will give you a live camera shot of what your camera is doing,
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:11.040]   but it will transmogrify it into ASCII Text Live.
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:11.680]   I'm going to do it.
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:11.680]   Out of it.
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:12.160]   Out of it.
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:12.720]   Out of it.
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:13.920]   I'm downloading it right now.
[01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:14.480]   Right now.
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:15.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:16.800]   And it's free.
[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:19.360]   The cool thing is-- and also, after you launch it,
[01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:22.480]   realize that you can also-- if you activate the menu bar,
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:25.520]   you can change the size, the point size of the text,
[01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:29.600]   so that on a retina Mac, the text, the individual characters,
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:32.720]   it'll be so small that you don't know what it's doing.
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:34.880]   It just looks really, really cool.
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:37.520]   But then you can slide it up so that it looks really like
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:39.600]   yet the county fair in 1977.
[01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:40.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:41.360]   So that's in the menu.
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:42.400]   Go to--
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:43.280]   Go in the menu bar.
[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:45.840]   Oh, and you can make this a screen saver.
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:47.840]   No, does it a single screen or does it--
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:49.200]   I believe it's still--
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:50.320]   --steal screen saver.
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:52.160]   Wow.
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:52.960]   And we're on it.
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:54.160]   Oh, this is so cool.
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:54.960]   Yeah.
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:55.760]   So the color--
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:49:57.280]   --is a little character resolution,
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:59.360]   so you can make it bigger so it's a little more ASCII.
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:00.400]   Right.
[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:01.280]   Video contract.
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:02.880]   Oh, this is sweet.
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:08.240]   This is just-- I am-- I know that it's just a very low
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:10.160]   resolution image when you look at it,
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:12.960]   but the idea that it can do this live--
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:14.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:16.880]   --that you can actually move around and you just see like
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:18.640]   ASCII text shifting around.
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:20.240]   That is just kind of the coolest thing ever.
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:21.280]   This is so matrixy.
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:22.560]   Yeah.
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:22.960]   Wow.
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:25.680]   And it's green-- you can make it-- it's green screen,
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:26.880]   but you can make it amber if you--
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:28.640]   --if you had a different--
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:30.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:32.960]   If you're over 32 years old, you can make it both colors.
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:33.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:34.080]   Black and white.
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:35.040]   Wow.
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:36.720]   If you're over 50, you can also make it white.
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:37.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:39.280]   It's just so cool.
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:40.880]   All right.
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:41.520]   Very good pick.
[01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:42.480]   And it's free.
[01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:44.240]   Textify me in the App Store.
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:46.560]   Of course, now that they do warn you,
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:48.560]   that's not certified for 10.8 yet.
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:50.160]   It seems to work OK, but--
[01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:50.960]   One part of the line.
[01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:52.480]   I'm sure they wouldn't say, you know,
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:54.800]   10.8 coming soon unless they just had it in--
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:55.360]   Let me see.
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:56.960]   I'm going to install it as a screen saver,
[01:50:56.960 --> 01:50:59.360]   because I'm really curious what happens now
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:00.560]   as a screen saver.
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:04.720]   Where is it?
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:05.520]   Textify me.
[01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:06.000]   Where'd it go?
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:06.560]   Oh, there it is.
[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:06.880]   OK.
[01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:09.280]   So I selected--
[01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:10.000]   Oh, god.
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:10.960]   I'm going to show you what this is.
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:12.320]   The lights are flashing.
[01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:13.280]   Look at this.
[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:13.600]   Yeah.
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:14.640]   It does everything.
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:15.840]   It's so cool.
[01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:17.600]   Screen saver options.
[01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:18.800]   Same options as before.
[01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:22.080]   Let's make a hot corner in the lower left.
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:23.520]   So I can just see what it looks like.
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:24.640]   OK.
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:25.680]   All right.
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:28.320]   Now I'm going to turn on the Textify me screen saver.
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:31.440]   Is it live?
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:31.760]   Yeah.
[01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:33.920]   Wow.
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:35.440]   That's the screen saver.
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:37.440]   Of course, it's not going to save the screen as much, but--
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:38.080]   Who cares?
[01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:38.800]   Yeah.
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:41.680]   It's a good way to make sure that when you get back to your
[01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:43.600]   cubicle with your coffee, they're like nine people
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:45.440]   like going like this in front of your screen.
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:46.240]   You know.
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:46.720]   Exactly.
[01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:48.320]   [SINGING]
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:49.360]   Oh, my god.
[01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:50.160]   Look at it.
[01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:51.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:53.760]   I have to admit, my kids would probably do that for hours.
[01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:56.080]   Wow.
[01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:56.960]   That's neat.
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:57.440]   OK.
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:51:57.920]   Thank you.
[01:51:57.920 --> 01:51:58.560]   Good pick.
[01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:00.240]   Your turn, Alex.
[01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:00.880]   Top that.
[01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:02.400]   Oh, you're going to, too.
[01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:03.440]   I could tell.
[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:04.800]   So one quick one.
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:06.720]   I talk a lot about iBooks.
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:08.800]   A video to Brain, which is kind of like a--
[01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:09.680]   they do video training.
[01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:11.280]   They have an iBooks author to workshop.
[01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:12.480]   So if you're interested in iBooks,
[01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:14.480]   and you want to figure some of that stuff out,
[01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:18.720]   it's by Joseph Lanaski, who's actually on Twitch a lot.
[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:19.840]   This week in photography.
[01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:20.400]   Oh.
[01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:21.200]   So he's great.
[01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:24.640]   And I'm sure it's a great-- I'm going to be downloading it.
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:26.480]   I looked at some of the examples, and it looks great.
[01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:28.160]   So anyway, check that out.
[01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:29.680]   But here's my pick.
[01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:31.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:34.320]   So I have to admit, I'm so excited.
[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:38.320]   So John Saunders, who I do a lot of production with,
[01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:40.240]   he had this at one of the things we were doing on Friday.
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:42.320]   And I just lost my mind.
[01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:44.000]   So this is called Aria.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:45.760]   And this is on the iPad.
[01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:46.240]   OK.
[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:46.960]   And look at the screenshot.
[01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:47.440]   I just left.
[01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:48.240]   We go ahead.
[01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:50.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:54.240]   And there's a before you show it, realize, audience,
[01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:55.760]   that there are designers at Apple that
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:56.880]   are going to have a conniption.
[01:52:56.880 --> 01:52:57.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:52:57.400 --> 01:52:57.900]   Yeah.
[01:52:57.900 --> 01:53:00.000]   This is definitely not what the iPad was designed for.
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.000]   Oh, but it is.
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:01.520]   It is.
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:03.360]   ARIA.
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:06.520]   This is-- it's A-U-R-I-A, I believe.
[01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:07.640]   A-U-I, like Aria.
[01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:09.320]   Yeah, it's U-R-I-A.
[01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:13.600]   So but it's a multi-track recorder.
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:18.440]   I believe it'll do up to 24-track recording with your iPhone--
[01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:20.200]   I'm sorry, with your camera connector.
[01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:22.480]   So you take a USB mixer.
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:23.320]   Mixer.
[01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:24.920]   You feed it into your iPad.
[01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:27.960]   And it is a multi-track.
[01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:28.440]   And look at this.
[01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:30.440]   So you hit 48 tracks.
[01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:31.760]   It'll manage up to 48 tracks.
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:35.160]   I think it'll record up 24 at a time on your iPad.
[01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:36.720]   Yeah, 24 tracks on your iPad.
[01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:37.760]   This looks like my--
[01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:38.400]   Look at this.
[01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:39.360]   So you hit play.
[01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:41.480]   Can you-- can you-- we have it over the shoulder?
[01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:42.560]   This is the only one I have.
[01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:44.760]   So you're going to have to move your movement.
[01:53:44.760 --> 01:53:45.920]   Yeah, you're going to do that.
[01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:46.440]   Look at this.
[01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:46.940]   OK.
[01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:47.920]   So this is doing a playback.
[01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:48.920]   Holy coddole.
[01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:49.920]   And let me alter up the--
[01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:50.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:53.920]   There we go.
[01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:55.080]   It's got reverb.
[01:53:55.080 --> 01:53:56.920]   It's got stereo delay and chorus.
[01:53:56.920 --> 01:53:57.920]   And you just have--
[01:53:57.920 --> 01:53:59.400]   Auto pitch correction.
[01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:00.240]   Yeah.
[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:01.400]   You can pop this up and down.
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:02.400]   And then look at this.
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:02.920]   And slide this.
[01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:04.200]   Wait for a minute there.
[01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:05.920]   So you're like, oh, this-- yeah, that's a lot.
[01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:06.600]   Look at that.
[01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:07.100]   Yeah.
[01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:07.800]   Yeah, look at this.
[01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:09.120]   OK.
[01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:10.320]   And these are-- now--
[01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:11.280]   It's $50.
[01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:12.120]   That's pretty awesome.
[01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:14.760]   But check this out.
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:15.600]   And you can edit this.
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:17.640]   This is like Adobe's audition.
[01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:18.640]   It's like--
[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:19.880]   This is amazing.
[01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:20.880]   Wow.
[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:23.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:24.000]   Can you overdub?
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:27.560]   So if I'm only using the built-in mic or external mic--
[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:29.120]   I can just start playing it.
[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:31.720]   --record track after track after track.
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:33.960]   And the thing is that this is--
[01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:36.200]   Up to 24 tracks simultaneous recording.
[01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:37.600]   Simultaneous recording.
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:42.960]   Sample rates of 44.148 and 96 of 24 bits.
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:45.480]   If you have an iPad 3.
[01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:50.560]   And the thing is that it supports VST plugins.
[01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:52.080]   Yeah.
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:53.240]   That's all I got to say.
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:54.840]   I mean, it's incredible.
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:55.640]   It's got OXs.
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:56.880]   It's got two OXs built in.
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:54:59.120]   Works with Dropbox SoundCloud.
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:02.760]   The-- I just-- it's insane.
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:03.240]   It's insane.
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:05.240]   And I get that $50 is a lot for an iPad app.
[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:08.360]   But this is more functional than the Pro Tools
[01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:09.480]   that I bought for $6,000.
[01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:11.320]   Yeah, this is actually quite amazing.
[01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:13.520]   I mean, it's incredible.
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:15.640]   I mean, and this is-- I guess what--
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:18.640]   I guess this is my app cap for Thursdays iPad today.
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:19.880]   I'm going to have to say this.
[01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:22.440]   It's just-- it's too bad it's so expensive.
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:24.080]   But you know, that's a deal for what you're getting.
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:25.880]   For what you're doing, though, it's expensive compared
[01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:28.040]   to lots of little games and single, like, whatever.
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:29.640]   But this is a real production app.
[01:55:29.640 --> 01:55:30.800]   I mean, for $50.
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:33.760]   So it's in relationship to--
[01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:38.080]   I could have done this network for the first three years.
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:40.160]   I was saying, you could be recording podcasts
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:42.320]   through a little mix of going in here and easily.
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:43.320]   And doing all this.
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:44.720]   Anyway, that's-- so it's called--
[01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:46.920]   They really need for the next version
[01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:50.000]   to communicate with nearby iPads.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.560]   So you can actually put four iPads next to each other
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:55.880]   and have the entire console in one suite.
[01:55:55.880 --> 01:55:56.800]   Exactly.
[01:55:56.800 --> 01:55:58.040]   Wow.
[01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:00.040]   You need-- but you'd need a mixer if you want more than one
[01:56:00.040 --> 01:56:01.200]   channel at a time, obviously.
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:04.000]   And that'll work through the camera connection kit via USB.
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:04.920]   USB mixer.
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:06.120]   Yes.
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:07.640]   [GASPS]
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:08.200]   OK.
[01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:10.520]   It is the ultimate skeuomorphic design.
[01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:10.960]   It is.
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:11.460]   It is.
[01:56:11.460 --> 01:56:11.960]   It is.
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:13.160]   This is the ultimate--
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:14.920]   But I mean, this is--
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:18.160]   it would be hard for guys who do this to switch over to something
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:18.960]   else too.
[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:20.640]   This is what it looks like.
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:21.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:22.760]   I have to admit, knobs don't work out well.
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:23.760]   Knobs are not so good.
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:24.760]   They're kind of--
[01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:28.360]   But I will say, though, it's just killer.
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:30.320]   Andy Knock goes at the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:34.400]   He also has a website, www.cwob, the celestial waste
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:35.560]   of bandwidth.
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:37.440]   And you can.com.
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:38.840]   And you can catch it.
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:42.780]   I'm the 5x5 network with his Enoch Cos almanac every week.
[01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:45.180]   And of course, here on Mac Break Weekly every week.
[01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:46.860]   Thank you, Andrew.
[01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:48.420]   It's always the slices that you have.
[01:56:48.420 --> 01:56:48.900]   Alex.
[01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:49.900]   Good to have you.
[01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:53.500]   Mr. Alex Lindsey is at the Pixel Core, Pixel Core.com.
[01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:56.420]   His podcast, Pixel Core.tv.
[01:56:56.420 --> 01:56:58.860]   Anything else you want to plug?
[01:56:58.860 --> 01:57:02.260]   We're going to be opening Pixel Core again soon in the fall.
[01:57:02.260 --> 01:57:06.180]   But in the meantime, we are just hiring location people
[01:57:06.180 --> 01:57:06.820]   all the time.
[01:57:06.820 --> 01:57:09.160]   People should follow me on Twitter and G+, because--
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:09.840]   Do you like tweets?
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:10.560]   I need five people.
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:11.920]   I need three people in here.
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:13.680]   I haven't been doing that lately.
[01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:15.000]   I've been mostly-- because we film most of it
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:15.680]   through the Pixel Core.
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:17.960]   So mostly when we hire people, we hire people inside
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:19.160]   of the Pixel Core.
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:22.080]   But in areas that we don't--
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:23.400]   And what kind of skills?
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:27.240]   We're looking for people who understand video production,
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:30.440]   for the most part, and also understand often times,
[01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:34.040]   just a computer savvy, which of course the listeners here
[01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:34.840]   are.
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:37.620]   So computer savvy people with video skills.
[01:57:37.620 --> 01:57:39.700]   But you should definitely follow me on Twitter and G+,
[01:57:39.700 --> 01:57:41.260]   and you can find it.
[01:57:41.260 --> 01:57:42.260]   It's @AlexLindsey.
[01:57:42.260 --> 01:57:44.060]   And G+, you just search for Alex Lindsey.
[01:57:44.060 --> 01:57:44.060]   I'm--
[01:57:44.060 --> 01:57:45.020]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:46.220]   --or DSAY.
[01:57:46.220 --> 01:57:47.820]   Yeah, and so-- but those are the two places
[01:57:47.820 --> 01:57:50.900]   that I'm going to be starting to talk more about some of the stuff
[01:57:50.900 --> 01:57:52.980]   we're looking for, and also do some more training related to it,
[01:57:52.980 --> 01:57:53.820]   and all that stuff.
[01:57:53.820 --> 01:57:54.380]   So stay tuned.
[01:57:54.380 --> 01:57:55.100]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:57:55.100 --> 01:57:56.340]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:57:56.340 --> 01:57:59.700]   We do this show 11 AM Pacific 2 PM Eastern time
[01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:04.060]   every Tuesday on twit.tv.
[01:58:04.060 --> 01:58:08.200]   You can-- that's 1,800 UTC if you're outside the US.
[01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:11.960]   You can also watch on-demand versions via the usual download
[01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:12.460]   places.
[01:58:12.460 --> 01:58:13.960]   People are always asking you, what's the best way,
[01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:16.200]   any way that you can download it is OK by me.
[01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:20.520]   But if you subscribe in iTunes, we get one little added benefit,
[01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:23.680]   the potential for iTunes promotion showing up on those most
[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:25.040]   listen to lists, things like that.
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:27.120]   So that certainly helps.
[01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:27.600]   Be a mitch.
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:28.440]   And be a mitch.
[01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:30.880]   And make sure you get a copy every week.
[01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:33.560]   Any of the subscription services, and even just clicking
[01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:35.900]   download link is fine as well.
[01:58:35.900 --> 01:58:37.420]   If you like this show, remember we've
[01:58:37.420 --> 01:58:40.100]   got two other Apple-oriented programs.
[01:58:40.100 --> 01:58:45.140]   iPad today, every Thursday, 1 PM Pacific, 4 PM Eastern time
[01:58:45.140 --> 01:58:46.060]   with Sarah Lane and me.
[01:58:46.060 --> 01:58:48.900]   We talk about iPad, iPad apps, iPad tips.
[01:58:48.900 --> 01:58:51.780]   And then Sarah does i5 for the iPhone.
[01:58:51.780 --> 01:58:56.540]   A quick 5 tips or apps for the iPhone every Monday.
[01:58:56.540 --> 01:58:58.220]   And she does it 11 AM as well.
[01:58:58.220 --> 01:59:01.380]   Yes, 11 AM Pacific 2 PM Eastern time.
[01:59:01.380 --> 01:59:03.740]   Correct on Mondays.
[01:59:03.740 --> 01:59:07.300]   So there's lots for you to consume.
[01:59:07.300 --> 01:59:08.860]   We brought the Oreo site down.
[01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:09.360]   Yes.
[01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:10.780]   Oh, well.
[01:59:10.780 --> 01:59:12.220]   Obviously, they were not on Squarespace.
[01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:13.380]   Sorry.
[01:59:13.380 --> 01:59:13.740]   Thanks.
[01:59:13.740 --> 01:59:14.780]   But we do.
[01:59:14.780 --> 01:59:16.780]   We take the websites of good things,
[01:59:16.780 --> 01:59:18.380]   and we ruin them for everybody.
[01:59:18.380 --> 01:59:20.100]   That's why we can't have good things.
[01:59:20.100 --> 01:59:21.380]   That's why we advertise on Squarespace.
[01:59:21.380 --> 01:59:22.700]   We have Squarespace advertisements
[01:59:22.700 --> 01:59:24.500]   so that people understand they need to move over that
[01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:25.620]   before we recommend their app.
[01:59:25.620 --> 01:59:29.020]   Before we recommend your app, get a good hosting.
[01:59:29.020 --> 01:59:29.780]   Thanks, everybody.
[01:59:29.780 --> 01:59:32.660]   New mission images from-- I almost tapped my screen
[01:59:32.660 --> 01:59:37.260]   on the Mac back book that just shows you too much iPad usage.
[01:59:37.260 --> 01:59:39.380]   New images from Mars.
[01:59:39.380 --> 01:59:41.700]   Oh, boy.
[01:59:41.700 --> 01:59:43.940]   Thanks for joining us, and we'll see you next time.
[01:59:43.940 --> 01:59:44.820]   Get back to work!
[01:59:44.820 --> 01:59:45.660]   Break time.
[01:59:45.660 --> 01:59:46.660]   There's over.
[01:59:46.660 --> 01:59:49.500]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:59:49.500 --> 01:59:52.860]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:59:52.860 --> 01:59:56.220]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:59:56.220 --> 01:59:58.800]   (upbeat music)
