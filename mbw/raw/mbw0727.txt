[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.920]   We're also going to talk about some brand new things from Apple, including new Apple music stations,

[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.160]   Oh, Lordy is there news.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.600]   The usual team is in town, Renee Ritchie from youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.600]   Hello, R.R.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.600]   Hello Leo.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.600]   I'm suing everybody.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.600]   I'm tired of this.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.360]   I've got it over the court.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.000]   Everyone is out of order.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Yeah, it's just I'm done.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.040]   I'm just suing everybody.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.040]   I'm through.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.880]   He says I'm through.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.720]   Do you play Fortnite?
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.520]   We need a Fortnite expert on the panel.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.640]   I have played Fortnite.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.840]   I have played Fortnite too.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.880]   I am familiar with that.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.120]   I am familiar, but I don't have any of the dance moves down.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.760]   It's PUBG on the Unreal Engine is my understanding.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.760]   Perfect.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.760]   Ooh, ouch.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.760]   Perfect.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.760]   So Andy Inako is here.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.720]   WGBH in Boston's Andy Inako wearing a--
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.000]   Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.640]   A stunning Star Wars shirt I might add.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.640]   I like that.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.640]   It's got tie fighters.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.640]   Is that an at-at?
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.240]   It's got tie fighters.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.200]   It's got Rebel Alliance symbols.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.880]   It's got all train air when transports and lots of them.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.880]   Oh, it does.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.680]   It also has the Imperial cogs.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.680]   It is.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.680]   Oh.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.680]   It's the old.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.920]   I'm old school enough that if there's a piece of Star Wars related clothing that I like,
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.600]   but it has any of the symbols from the new films, I'm like, I don't want that.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.520]   What I like about that is it doesn't pick sides.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.520]   Exactly.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.120]   You could be Empire Rebel Alliance.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.120]   Doesn't matter.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.120]   It's OK.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.120]   It doesn't pick sides.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.120]   It's very--
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.720]   Only a Sith believes in absolutes.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.160]   Yes, it's very ecumenical.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.160]   Sure.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.280]   Also, here, Laurie Gill.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.760]   It's good to see Laurie in a new setting.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.760]   She looks--
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.760]   That's a second.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.400]   All she's done is rotate her I-Mac 180 degrees.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.160]   And I think I've got Andy Beet because I've got my permanent-- this is my permanent Star
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.160]   Wars.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.160]   So I think I've got--
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.160]   Whoa!
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.160]   That's a commitment.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.200]   Oh, I didn't know you had that.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.520]   Show that to us again.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.520]   That's cool.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.200]   This is actually Boba Fett's chest plate insignia.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.400]   So most of the symbols will usually show that Mandalorian symbol.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.720]   But that's what he has on his chest.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.720]   Oh, my God.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.720]   Do you have geek cred?
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.040]   I've been a fan of Boba Fett for a long time.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.760]   That immediately puts you right up there in the geek pan.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.600]   You rescued him from the Sarlacc pit.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.600]   That's why he's around today.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.640]   I've seen Little Rebel Alliance.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.720]   That's not commitment.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.360]   You put a little Rebel Alliance on your head.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.600]   That's not commitment on the web.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.400]   Although, I would argue on your hand.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.080]   It's way more obvious than on your shoulder.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.360]   You could never invade the Death Star because they just go, what is that?
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.360]   No.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:22.040]   Now the symbol of being all in is, did you have it done in all black ink, which can be
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.520]   easily removed by laser?
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.480]   Or did you incorporate red, which is impossible to ruin my laser?
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.880]   Is that-- is that-- see, I'm learning so much about tattoos.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:41.360]   So we're being happy, go lucky because right now a shooting war is about to break out between
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.680]   Apple and Epic.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.840]   And I am going to-- I'm going to stay above the fray for a moment because I'm a little
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.040]   heated about all of this.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.440]   And Google, let's not forget it's a three-way fight.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.000]   Yeah, Google, I don't think.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   I'm not-- OK.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.640]   So here's the deal you all know.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.040]   But I'm just going to give a quick recapitulation.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.720]   So for those who don't, on Thursday, Epic launched a missile.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.640]   I mean, it really had clearly planned to begin this war.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.640]   It knew.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.560]   It had a 30-page court pleading prepared.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.840]   It had a 1984 style movie made.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:28.720]   They put-- they replaced the in-app purchases at first on iOS and then on the Google Play
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.900]   Store with a mechanism that would get around it so that you could buy credits from Epic
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.600]   directly and not pay the 30% to Apple or Google.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.280]   Both Apple and Google immediately responded by pulling Fortnite from the Play Store.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.440]   Now, Fortnite is a free game, but the in-app purchases have been very successful.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.000]   They've made Tim Sweeney an Epic billions and billions of dollars.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.480]   I think Sweeney made $7 billion last year in the Fortnite DLC stuff.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.800]   You know, dance moves, outfits, all of that stuff.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.800]   It's very successful.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.800]   People love it.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.800]   It's a great game.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.880]   And by the way, it's not exclusive to iOS or Android.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.280]   It's probably much more played on PC or consoles.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:19.320]   In fact, they even pay the 30% to both Sony and Microsoft for in-game app purchases in
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.920]   their stores.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.680]   So then they didn't pull it there.
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:31.440]   But remember that Tim Sweeney had started this fight when they first put Epic Fortnite on
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.520]   Google Play or on Android.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.880]   They decided not to go through the Google Play Store.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.120]   They said, "Well, you can sideload it because we don't want to give them 30%.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.520]   But it turned out to be a little more, a little more complicated and be a little more risky
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.520]   to do the sideloading.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.480]   In fact, it didn't launch well.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.040]   Somebody, some hacker was able to get an insert malware into the downloads initially.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.640]   So eventually they joined the Google Play Store.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.440]   Apple's response and Google's response, as I said, to pull the game down.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:05.960]   But then Apple this week went one step further and perhaps a step too far.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.600]   Epic sued immediately.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:16.120]   What Apple's response to that was they sued Apple and Google was to yank or threaten to
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:23.120]   yank.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.120]   It would be an effect August 28th.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.720]   Epic's developer credentials, which means no Epic properties could be updated in the app
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:34.160]   store, including the apparently, according to Epic, the Unreal Engine.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.600]   The Unreal Engine is not only used for Fortnite, it's used for many, many iOS games.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.800]   And those game developers would be put on the spot.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:48.440]   They would either have to replace the Unreal Engine, which is not really doable, or not
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.440]   be able to update their apps ever again.
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.640]   Epic could release it unsigned, but they'd have to give up their own signing privileges
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:56.640]   to do that.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.400]   So that's where I want to begin.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.240]   Because I know that both you and Laurie have dug deep into this and Andy have dug deep
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.520]   into this.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:14.400]   Epic says that by doing that, this retaliatory move, they have jeopardized Unreal Engine.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:19.240]   And in the legal document, they immediately filed for injunctive relief from the courts.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:24.320]   In the document, they said, "If the Unreal Engine can no longer support Apple platforms,
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.720]   the software developers that use it will be forced to use alternatives, the damage to
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:33.840]   Epic's ongoing business and to its reputation and trust with its customers, will be unquantifiable
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.720]   and irreparable.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:41.120]   Preliminary injunctive relief is necessary to prevent Apple from crushing Epic before this
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.600]   case could ever get to judgment."
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.520]   Is it the case that yanking the developer credentials, is that the effect it would have
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.520]   Renee?
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:55.160]   So, can I sort of preface this quickly by saying that all the legal stuff is posturing?
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:59.800]   Like everyone is taking the most extreme position possible to sort of make the most extreme
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.160]   case possible.
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:06.160]   And I truly do believe that all of them sincerely think that they are in the right and are rationalizing
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.360]   their behavior by telling us that they're doing it all for us.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.600]   And there is a lot of, like just so much, all the money at stake.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:21.880]   So technically, they are both Apple and Epic are using the Obi-Wan Kenobi version of the
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.320]   truth, whereas from a certain point of view.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.800]   Like Apple is saying, "This is level playing field for all the apps."
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.240]   And this is in Apple's agreement.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.880]   It says if you want to give this.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.680]   Let me give you Apple's response from last night.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.360]   The app store is designed to be a safe and just so that everybody gets their pleadings
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.360]   app.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.360]   The Apple store is designed to be a safe and trusted place for users and a great business
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.760]   opportunity for all developers.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:49.000]   Epic has been one of the most successful developers in the app store, undeniably true, growing
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.240]   into a multi-billion dollar business that reaches millions of iOS customers around the
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.240]   world.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:59.480]   We very much want to keep the company as part of the Apple developer program and their apps
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.160]   on the store.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:07.920]   The problem Epic has created for itself is one that can be easily remedied if they submit
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.640]   an update of their app that reverts it to comply with the guidelines they agreed to and
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.660]   which apply to all developers.
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.120]   We won't make an exception for Epic because we don't think it's right to put their business
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.080]   interests ahead of the guidelines that protect our customers.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:29.040]   But it seems to me that still would be true, but the minute they yank developer, is that
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.040]   part of the agreement?
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.920]   Yeah, that's in the agreement.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:37.240]   It says that you at first they give you a time period to fix it and then you lose your
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.240]   ...
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.240]   Okay.
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.920]   But most developers, that's fine because they just can't put their app up.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.760]   But Epic, I think both Apple and Epic forget in this that they are responsible for a huge
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.600]   dependency for the end of the other ...
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.600]   For the ecosystem.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.600]   ... developer.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.800]   And if either Apple or Epic does anything to jeopardize the Unreal Engine, it's not just them
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:54.800]   who suffer.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.480]   Epic could release it as unsigned.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.680]   You can still ... we talked about this before.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.000]   You can go in, do a terminal command.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.600]   It reveals a little button that says don't turn off gatekeeper and you can still install
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.600]   Unreal.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:10.520]   But I believe Unreal lets you sign applications with your certificate inside their app and
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:14.120]   they require certification to be able to do that part of it.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.040]   So it would just make it ... It's already a really tough ... Brianna was putting about
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.680]   how tough the procedure is.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.600]   It's already really tough to spit out a finalized app and it would just make it that much tougher.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.760]   And Epic, as we see from their pleading against Google, they hate the idea of sideloading.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.120]   It's just not ... They don't think normal people do it.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.200]   So ... And you can't sideload on iOS.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.760]   No, you can't on Mac, though, so that's the developer part that people were concerned
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.760]   about.
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.800]   So you can't ... You can't ...
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:47.200]   You can't ... It affects the game developers downloading and installing Unreal Engine on
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.280]   their Mac in order to make an iOS app.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:55.040]   It doesn't impinge on the iOS app itself.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.440]   It's merely ... They can't get updates on it.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.440]   Updating it, yeah.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.320]   Well, they can, but they'd have to go through the same sideloading process that Epic says
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.520]   is so egregious on Android.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:09.040]   So basically, they contend that ... Again, normal people don't sideload Apple and Google
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.000]   make it seem so scary when you do it.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.680]   And they effectively block you by not making it the default status and use things like
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:19.640]   Google Protect and Gatekeeper to make it almost effectively impossible and they're wording
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.640]   to do it.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.160]   So they want full access without having to go through that procedure.
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:30.120]   So it just ... It struck ... At least the optics of it, the second blow ...
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.400]   It's all bad.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.760]   Really looked like ... For Apple, I think.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.040]   Well, maybe that's just my point of view.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.920]   But for Apple, the optics of saying, "Hey, you got a nice ecosystem you got here.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.120]   It'd be a shame if anything happened to it."
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:48.200]   Laurie, is this ... How are regular people going to react to this?
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.520]   I think they're going to react like I did.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.280]   They don't know what the agreement is.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:56.880]   They're going to say, "Apple, you are being dicks, or is it Epic?"
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.560]   Well, no.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:08.240]   They're going to say ... Epic Games has really done a good job of marketing this as the tyrannical
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.840]   overlord that is Apple into a lesser degree.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.480]   Google are the ones who are doing everything wrong here.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:22.200]   The average person is not going to see this as Apple trying to adhere to its guidelines.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.480]   They're not going to see Epic as having done something wrong.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.320]   It's definitely ... Unfortunately, Apple is the one who's looking the worse in this case,
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.160]   even though Google is doing the exact same thing too.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.600]   See, Google ... Apple is the one getting the bigger headlines.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.040]   Google's less of a monopoly because you can sideload.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.800]   Apple prohibits that, says you cannot ...
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.080]   They're not a development platform.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.560]   Nobody's writing on real apps using their Android phone.
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.120]   They're doing it on Windows, or they're doing it on Mac.
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:53.000]   Also, they're a lot less stringent about collecting 30% on every transaction that happens within
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   the ecosystem.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Not on games, though.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.200]   On games that are identical to Apple.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:03.120]   But their argument at Epic is that this is a universal thing that is just no good and shouldn't
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.120]   be allowed.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:11.360]   Let's also admit that ... Part of the fun is that Epic didn't just do a search and replace
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:15.440]   Google and Apple when they file the lawsuit against Google.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:22.800]   Google's lawsuit specifically calls out ... Every time I want to say this, I want to use the
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.520]   Southern sweaty country lawyer voice.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:31.920]   You'll have founded upon the principle that don't do evil.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:36.040]   What have you to say about this now, sir?
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:42.680]   Part of the lawsuit against Google mentions that, for instance, Epic tried to get a deal
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:47.880]   with OnePlus, for instance, to put the Epic Game Store preloaded on all of their phones.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.000]   But that had to deal in place.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.480]   But Google stepped in and said to OnePlus, "We would very much like for you not to do
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.480]   this deal."
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.480]   The deal was kibosh.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:04.680]   This underscores the fact that this was not ... For people on Twitter and other social
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.040]   media that are saying, "Oh, well, this is a stupid lawsuit.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.480]   It can't possibly proceed."
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:14.480]   That has the idea that this was something that they did impulsively as opposed to something
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:19.680]   they built month by month over a period of a year to make sure that whenever arguments
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:25.960]   they make ... They have Christine Varney as part of their co-counsel for office.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:30.680]   Explain to me how this makes customers safer.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.080]   How about it makes customers safer?
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.080]   This is Apple's response.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:39.120]   We're trying to make Apple customers safer.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.440]   We've proven that it's not like they've handled transactions, and this is part of Epic's complaint.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.280]   They've handled transactions for Amazon.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:48.560]   When you buy non-digital goods, transactions are handled through the vendor, not through
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.000]   Apple, and those are secure.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.800]   When you install apps using Gatekeeper, and when you install apps using sideloading on
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.800]   Android ... This is ... Apple says we won't make an exception for Epic because we don't
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:02.600]   think it's right to put their business interests ahead of the guidelines that protect ...
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.600]   That's the terrorist problem.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.600]   Our customers.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:09.280]   In fact, they should say we don't think it's right for them to put their business interests
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.440]   ahead of our business interests.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.440]   That's the truth.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.200]   This is why it hurts Apple.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:18.000]   This is why it hurts Apple because they have the right to do this.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.520]   It's in the agreement.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.280]   It looks terrible.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.000]   It looks because it followed on after the lawsuit.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.880]   They said, "Well, in that case, no developer license for you, and we're going to hurt an
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.080]   entire ecosystem of people."
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:34.720]   You can't make the argument, despite Apple's statement, that it's protecting customers.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.280]   It's protecting our bottom line.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.600]   I think the optics on this could not be worse.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.080]   Whether Apple has merit, whether it's doing the right thing, whether you can argue that
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.280]   they've added so much value that it's ... 30% is the norm and all that stuff.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:53.480]   It doesn't matter because the normal person is going to look at this and say, "What dicks?"
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.440]   I did a poll right after this.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.440]   I used YouTubers.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.120]   I wanted an extra answer.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.520]   After the Microsoft thing, the streaming game thing, talking about last week, almost nobody
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.120]   was on Apple's side.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:09.360]   Even in my audience, I'm assuming, are vastly composed of real ardent Apple enjoyers, whatever
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.800]   you want to call them.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.480]   In this case, most of them don't like Epic.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.600]   I don't know if that's just because they don't like Epic, or they think Epic started
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.600]   it.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.120]   In their mind, starting it is the original sin.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.400]   What I'm just seeing in the Apple tech community is, yes, there's a bunch of people who have
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:29.040]   their Apple monopolist rent-seeking signs, absolutely.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.000]   There are a bunch of people who said that they knew the agreement and they broke it,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.120]   and yes, this thing sucks, but it wasn't the right way to do it.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.160]   It's us, the customers, who suffer.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.720]   I think they all look bad.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.680]   I don't think the App Store is doing the right thing here.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.880]   There's a whole bunch of things about Epic that is deeply problematic.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.360]   This is not the Batman I want to be fighting Apple in this case at all.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:55.440]   I'd rather it be a much more ethically run company, but I think Apple's position there
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.960]   is just shut up, take it down, and then come back and talk to us in two weeks, much like
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.880]   people handle international incidents.
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.520]   I have Apple just acting like a Mafioso here.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:15.280]   Well, this is a situation where this has been coming up and coming up in the news and
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:21.240]   the tech world a lot recently, and I think this is where Apple is making a stand is that
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:25.280]   what they're doing from their perspective is we're proving to you and we're proving
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.680]   to the government that we treat all app developers the same.
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.800]   This is what we've been claiming we do, and we're doing this, and we're even doing it
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:37.320]   to the biggest game company, the biggest mobile game company in the world.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:45.160]   If we would stand on our laurels and say that Epic has to go along with it, then we
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:49.200]   are clearly doing what we claim to be doing, which is treating all developers the same.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.120]   Now, I don't believe that they do.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:58.760]   I believe that Apple, it's a complicated situation where not all developers are treated the same,
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:04.360]   but I think this is why Apple is making such a strong stand with this particular gaming
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.280]   company, with this particular company.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.920]   You can win in court, and probably Apple will win in court, but if you lose in the court
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.360]   of public opinion, I don't know if that's a victory.
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.080]   They'll win in court and lose.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:19.440]   The current law they'll probably win, at least in the US, the EU, it's a totally different
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:24.200]   question, but in the US they've been pretty stringent up to the Supreme Court that you
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.960]   don't interfere with deals.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.720]   There's no duty to deal.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.960]   You can make business decisions that you want, but as we saw with Congress, this is
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:38.360]   exactly, exactly what Congress was getting mad at Apple about.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:45.360]   Again, it's so high profile, and I think both Epic and Apple are asking or claiming the
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:52.800]   most extreme position they possibly can as a negotiation point, but I don't think it'll
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.200]   end well for any of them, and it's not going to end well for the customers, and I wish
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:02.720]   that they would stop using us as ways to rationalize their positions and actually reverse engineer
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.800]   it, come out with the outcome, and then figure out how to get there, because there's a lot
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.200]   of people who are super upset about what's going on.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:13.720]   Epic, as I've chosen this time carefully, they watched what happened with the "Hey"
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.160]   email thing right before WWDC.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.880]   Apple did back down a little bit.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.080]   They were able to work something out.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:26.960]   Now Epic is trying to build a coalition of other app store complainants like Sonos and
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:33.520]   Spotify to help fight this.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:39.640]   I think if you really get into the weeds of it, Epic is just as much at fault as Apple.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:44.440]   Epic probably just should say, "Yeah, we're just not going to make it for iOS or Android,
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:50.320]   and let the children beg Apple on Google to do it."
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.640]   I think Epic really wants to do a store.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.640]   That's what they've done.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:21:01.880]   They've created an app store competitor on iOS, and I'm sure that's what Apple does
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.720]   not want them to do.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:08.400]   But I think it feels to me like these guys could get together and work out something.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.840]   Or no, is that impossible?
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:16.000]   I think this is definitely a fight that was brewing for years, that this was not something
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.560]   that was going to be settled in a conference room.
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.840]   This was definitely something that was going to have to be settled by the courts at some
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.840]   point.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:28.480]   Apple and Google were begging for a court case to come up.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.800]   They just didn't know exactly who would pull the trigger and when it would happen.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:40.520]   We also have to confront the fact that although Epic does have an uphill battle chiefly because
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:50.480]   this is a ... their alleging is what's called a single market majority or single market.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:56.320]   It typically doesn't work to say that if you have an isolated platform like this, that
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:02.000]   is to have an up monopoly on this platform is to have what is antitrust regulators would
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.640]   identify as a monopoly.
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.720]   In a civil case, this is going to be a problem.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:09.920]   Remember that even if Apple does beat this back, and I'm sure they're going to win it
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:15.320]   at some point, they still might lose it at the California state level.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.520]   They still have to deal with the Department of Justice.
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.760]   They still have to deal with the FTC.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:27.400]   They still have to deal with 50 state district attorneys that are going for similar antitrust
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.400]   stuff.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:33.000]   They still have to deal with EU, which is also hammering them on the exact same things.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.360]   This is something that there was always going to be a period of a year or two in which Apple
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:42.680]   is going to have to adjust their app store guidelines or actually the way they run that
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:49.440]   entire business to make sure it conforms to the 2020 version of what governments are
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.120]   willing to allow and what they are not willing to allow.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.960]   It just seems to be happening right now.
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.000]   It seems to me like it was a mistake to sue Google.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.920]   I think that when they first sued Apple, right away, they had a lot of support, or at least
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.640]   when I was watching on Twitter, I was trying to track the sentiment.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.840]   They had a lot of support.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.360]   People were like, "Why didn't you sue Xbox?
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.720]   Why didn't you sue Sony?
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.800]   Why didn't you sue Nintendo?
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.440]   They all do the 30 percent."
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.560]   When they sued, Google is well because Google is more open.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:19.040]   They do allow, again, granted not for games, but they do allow things like sideloading.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:24.160]   I think at that point that their goal of getting their store where they operate functionally
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:28.440]   very similar to Apple, they take 12 percent, but they don't offer as much as Google and
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:32.680]   Apple clearly because they think what Google offered was so valuable, they wouldn't do
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.680]   sideloading to them.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.520]   There's a precedent for that on Android.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.760]   Samsung has a store.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:42.240]   There are plenty third-party stores on Android.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.680]   That's not the issue there.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.520]   Not inside Google Play.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.520]   No.
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:47.520]   There are vendor stores.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:53.920]   It's harder to get them on a device that you're like, "The Samsung store on LG is not really
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.280]   a thing as far as I know."
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.080]   No, that's right.
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.680]   But I don't think it would be hard if you have some serious fans to put an Epic store
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:06.240]   on Google, but you absolutely could not have an Epic store on iOS.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.680]   It's complicated because 10 cent owns 40 percent of it.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.400]   Sony owns 1.4 percent of it.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:16.200]   They have a developer deal with Nintendo that's beyond what the basic app design thing.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.560]   Again, Epic is not the Batman I wanted to go to war with on this one.
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.520]   John Gruber thinks Epic will blink.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.520]   He's got a point.
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:29.080]   He says, "Consumers, gamers may blame Apple for this, but developers who are using the
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.280]   Unreal Engine are going to blame Epic.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.200]   They're going to say, 'You are screwing us.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.600]   You're really risking our business entirely here.'"
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.680]   Because it's not practical to move to a different engine.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.680]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.600]   They blink last time.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:50.520]   They will blink because it's not necessarily the people using Fortnite.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.680]   It's the only people using the Unreal Engine.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.680]   That's an important business to Epic.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.160]   These people are going to be mad as well.
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.600]   The vulnerability that other companies wouldn't have.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.960]   Spotify doesn't have to deal with that.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.560]   Nobody's developing with the Spotify engine.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.400]   They can sue Apple this way as much as they want.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:09.240]   Gruber says, "Look, it's actually easy for Epic to say face to say, 'Alright, Apple made
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.920]   us do this.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:16.680]   We're going to raise the cost of V-Bucks because that 30% goes to Apple now.
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.160]   Sorry, kids.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.920]   Blame Apple.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.840]   Then the court case will continue to widen the court."
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.240]   That's a good strategy.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.680]   This whole thing got so much attention.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:29.160]   If they were to do that, they would take off whatever taint they currently have.
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.400]   They would redouble the pressure on Apple, making them look even more jerks.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.120]   That would be a huge win for them, PR-wise.
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:40.760]   Well, the lose there is that they'd be required to raise their prices on every platform, wouldn't
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:41.760]   they?
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.760]   I don't think so.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:43.760]   If their goal is to...
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.760]   Really?
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:45.760]   Apple, would they make them do that?
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:46.760]   Doesn't Apple say?
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:51.560]   Yes, because Spotify does 30% more on iOS than they do outside, I think, now.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:52.560]   I thought that...
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.560]   Okay.
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:54.560]   Maybe an all-in-a-day.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:58.520]   I knew that at some point they had a requirement that said that you can't offer a deal to
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.000]   iOS people that is not the same as deals on other people.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   You can't have a better deal somewhere else.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.200]   I think that changed a couple of years ago.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.600]   I'll have to double check.
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:12.200]   But also, to go back and address EPIC's relationships with game platformers, they haven't addressed
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.200]   this in the context of this lawsuit.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.800]   But a couple of years ago, at least, the CEO was talking about this and essentially saying
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.200]   that they're getting far, far more from their relationships with Sony and Nintendo and the
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.320]   rest in the fact that they are investing in their platform.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.320]   They're getting co-marketing.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.880]   They're getting co-promotional benefits.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:34.160]   Whereas, from Apple, all they're getting is the ability to sell apps in the store and
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:41.160]   they feel as though that's not enough for their 30%.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:45.600]   Well, this was a play that I think is Steam, right?
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:50.240]   They made their own store specifically to go after Steam and then started signing exclusives
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.880]   to keep them away from Steam.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:56.800]   I think they know how to run the "We Wanna Be the Platform" play.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.280]   It's a really interesting position.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:05.040]   As I said last week, the company that really should be suing is Microsoft because they
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.040]   want to put XCloud.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.840]   But they don't have to because I think people are just going to say, "Hey, how come I can't
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.440]   run XCloud on iOS?"
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.440]   And Apple said because this is a store.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.840]   And they're probably negotiating rather than suing.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.400]   And also, this is a market that they don't have yet.
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:23.560]   EPIC is trying to protect a market that they've already proven is very, very successful.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.640]   So they have a different kind of motivation.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:30.800]   But remember that this is much bigger I think than just the 30%.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:35.040]   Like I said earlier, I really think that there was always going to be building a pressure
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:41.560]   point where Apple would have to start either negotiating or at least explaining everything
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:45.800]   about how they operate the App Store and everything about their relationship with developers.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:49.680]   One of the things that I've always found like a big thumb in the eye to developers is that
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.680]   they could often simply say that, "Hi, I know that your app has nothing really won't
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.360]   benefit from this new API that we're putting in.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:00.280]   However, we're going to insist that you can't push any updates into the store unless you're
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.560]   supporting this new API."
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.720]   And time is money.
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:09.600]   Instead of these developers putting in new features that they know that their users want,
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:13.400]   we're now we're going to have to make sure that this will work with conceivably a round
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.840]   iPhone even though we really have no idea of whether or not this is going to ship or
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.200]   whether we want this to happen.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.120]   We would much rather have search and replace, which is something that we haven't been doing
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:25.360]   for the past two or three years, are bad, but we really want to put search and replace
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.520]   in our app.
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.960]   We don't want to have to support something that Apple simply is saying that we're only
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:33.400]   doing because Apple will not allow us to update our app otherwise.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:38.240]   These are all kinds of little steps of control here that Apple is insisting upon and it's
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:43.640]   important that they deal with this by making an argument in front of a neutral third party
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:48.280]   with legal authority instead of putting out a press release once again saying, "Hey, two
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:52.440]   hippies in a garage, wheels for the mind, remember that?
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.520]   We just want the best experience for our users."
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.560]   There was a great thread from a German developer whose name I'm blanking on, which was the
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:03.280]   opposite of his argument saying, "I don't mind paying the 30 percent, but Apple needs
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.920]   to hold up their end of it.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:09.800]   I can't be paying the 30 percent and have these dumb search ads and have you not put
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:14.400]   test flight here and have you have the worst subscription implementation of anyone in the
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.160]   modern industry."
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:21.040]   He just went through the list of things that Apple has either badly implemented, hasn't
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:24.520]   implemented, or has otherwise made their lives difficult and saying, "If you want my
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.680]   30 percent, I'm happy to give it to you."
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.720]   Instead of saying, "My rent is too high," it's like, "You've got to fix my apartment."
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:31.720]   I thought that was--
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.720]   Yeah, this thing counter--
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:37.680]   This has been my reaction to a lot of the conversations that I've been seeing that a
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:42.240]   lot of people, they seem to be taking the point of view that, "God, all these companies
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:48.960]   are lucky to have a wonderful company like Apple, providing them with something as transformational
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:53.360]   as the App Store and a platform as wonderful as iOS to develop on."
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.600]   No, that's not how business works.
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:01.200]   Like, the Apple delivers a lot of benefits to developers, but developers, by creating
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:06.640]   the kind of apps that define the iPhone experience, they also provide a big benefit for Apple.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:10.240]   This is an unequal partnership, to be sure, but it has to be a partnership.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.760]   There's something to be said--
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:13.760]   Go ahead.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:23.720]   There's something to be said for Apple, sort of-- in this idea of utopia that your company
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:31.240]   can grow and get bigger and make a better profit, more revenue.
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:34.400]   That's the sort of consumer-based dream, right?
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:38.640]   The American dream, if you will, that you can just keep doing these things, but when
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:47.560]   you're beholden to another company for your company's ability to grow, that really does
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:53.120]   kind of put a big block wall in front of that.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:31:01.600]   So, for Epic Games, they can't have a store within a store, no matter what, even if they
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.160]   have the best store in the world.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:08.360]   And it makes tons and tons of money, and it's the future of Epic Games, and it's the
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:09.760]   future of gaming.
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:15.040]   They don't get to do that on one of the most popular platforms in the world.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:23.560]   So, there's this roadblock that goes up for-- I do think that Epic is doing this wrong,
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:30.480]   but I think the sentiment behind what they're doing makes a lot of sense of that they don't
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.680]   get to grow.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:36.960]   There's a stopping point where growth doesn't get to happen anymore because of these two
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:42.240]   phone companies that dominate the operating systems around the world.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.280]   That seems imbalanced to me.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:52.240]   Yeah, the counter-argument to that, and for me, it's a lot of balancing.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:55.640]   When Apple created the App Store, and I'm guessing when Google Play created the Play
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:32:00.880]   Store, it was in an era where there were monster software companies dominating literally the
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.160]   shelf space.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:06.520]   And one of the goals was that it didn't matter if you were Microsoft or Adobe, you could
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:11.120]   create Acorn, or you could create Pixelmator, and it could be right there on the App Store
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.040]   and next to these billion-dollar companies.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:16.960]   And because you're using Core Graphics and Core Animation and all these things that they
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.040]   invest in for the platform, your app can be every bit as good, maybe even better than
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:25.480]   these giant companies that don't care as much about that single app as you do.
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:31.160]   And that was sort of the Chewy granola hippie dream of an App Store is that you don't have
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.760]   to be the billion-dollar Epic.
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:38.440]   You can get the Unreal Engine or Unity or just use Apple's, I'm blanking on the name, their
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:44.320]   3D frameworks or ARKit and make an app every bit as good as Fortnite.
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:49.560]   And nobody knows that you're a two-person shop grinding this out every weekend.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:53.640]   You're competing for attention and for money right next to Fortnite.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:57.600]   So yeah, for Epic, it's sort of these two parallels.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:01.920]   One is, Apple's point of view is, hey, we put you through college, and the minute that
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:05.480]   you graduated, you dumped us and tried to get a hot new deal.
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:10.240]   And Epic's thing is, we were miserable for all of these years, but we waited because
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.560]   we were amassing money and we were amassing power.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.880]   And finally, we can stand up to you.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.920]   And they both believe they're absolutely right on those two point of views.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.200]   And we're both looking going, this is just not how to give you good people.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:26.160]   I think it does look a little bit opportunistic on the part of Epic.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:31.840]   It's like they're eyeballing all the controversies that you, they're watched, hey,
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:37.600]   dot com, and thought, this is our time to see if we can take a bite at Apple.
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:44.480]   But you should be punished for being smart about their time.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.360]   And you know, like, they were smart about it.
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.880]   Well, the argument against it is, they want a story too.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:49.880]   Right.
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:53.480]   The argument against it is, you made the deal, you agreed to be on the platform according
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.480]   to these rules.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.480]   It's, you know, and now you're taking advantage of a moment in time when Apple is a little
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:05.440]   bit down to try to get around those rules.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.920]   I'm not sure I agree with that.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.480]   Yeah, I don't agree with that either.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:14.200]   I think that this is why it's a little bit disappointing that Apple's defense anytime
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:18.520]   this sort of thing comes up is that we have rules for developers and we expect everybody
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.160]   to extend the same rules.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:24.880]   And when they drop what sounds like a bombshell, like saying, oh, well, we've just, we're giving
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:28.800]   you 10 days notice that we're either going to pull your pull your act, your complete
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.840]   access to all of our developer tools.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:35.480]   If you don't shape up, that's, and they say, oh, no, see, that's, that's, we're not doing
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.480]   something special.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.480]   We're not singing you out.
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:41.080]   That's part of our agreement that we get that we put into place for everybody.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:45.000]   And really what they're actually saying is that, no, no, we abuse all developers.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.760]   We have contempt for all of you.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:47.760]   Believe me.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:52.840]   This developer to the largest conglomerate is like us like a bug underneath our steel boot
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:53.840]   heel.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:54.840]   You're welcome.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:00.080]   There's a kid who's 24.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.280]   Apple tried to hire him, but he decided he didn't want to do it.
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:08.160]   It may remember his Game Boy Advance for iOS, which of course, Apple ended up killing.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:11.560]   He was using the Enterprise certificate to distribute.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:12.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.960]   But he, I don't know how he gets away with it.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.040]   He has something called the alt store.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:22.040]   I owe, which is a Mac OS app or Windows.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:26.800]   There's a beta version where you download the server on your computer and stole the app
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.520]   on your phone.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:33.680]   And then you, when the server is running, you can then connect to the server and download
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:34.840]   new apps.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.760]   This guy's name is Riley Testa.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.400]   He turned down a job at Apple.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.400]   He's clearly.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.400]   He was chatting with him this week.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.400]   Oh, you talked to him.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.400]   I love his perspective.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.960]   Well, I love his perspective because like I learned so much.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:50.200]   Like often I say dumb things on Twitter because I want to read what people say who are way
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.400]   smarter than me and then I can learn something.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.720]   And he immediately said like there's all these different opinions like Ben Thompson believes
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:36:00.400]   that Apple should just allow alternate payment methods that is too risky to allow other,
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.640]   other sources of apps.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:05.960]   And he disagrees with that saying that, you know, you, you, it isn't really free unless
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:09.560]   you have other sources of apps because of things like this, but also China saying you
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:13.360]   can't and have VPN apps and maybe America saying you can have TikTok.
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:18.560]   And that's the only real guard for user access is to have these sorts of third party stores.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:22.400]   Granted, Epic doesn't like them because they want, they want their installation and their
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.600]   promotion too.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.080]   Like, because they want everything.
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:28.960]   But from his point of view, and I think a lot of developers point of view, that by itself,
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:32.960]   just gatekeeper on iOS by itself would remove so much pressure.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:36.440]   Maybe they'll still go on the app store voluntarily, but there's a difference between doing it
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:39.360]   because you want to and doing it because you have to.
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:59.200]   And I think that Apple runs their app stores from the consumer side.
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:04.200]   Apple runs the app store so well that if you did have an alternative app store, it would
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:09.320]   be something that most people would kind of be somewhat aware of but have no interest
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:14.400]   in and they wouldn't provide the sort of apps with maybe one or two exceptions that people
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.840]   would really be interested in as well.
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:19.840]   I feel as though it would be sort of like jailbreaking, meaning that it's something
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:20.840]   that is out there.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.000]   It's something that you can do.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.520]   It's something that people are some people are even aware that you can do, but it's not
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:32.200]   the sort of thing that anybody who it's not the sort of thing that people who with normal
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.840]   needs can't can't do without.
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:39.040]   I'm sorry, let me back up one half of a sentence.
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:44.800]   All of people's needs seem to be being met best and very, very well by the regular Apple
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.000]   app store.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.040]   And if there were these alternative app stores, they would be kind of weird.
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:54.000]   They would be on the outskirts, but they would be present for people who actually want them.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   It's interesting.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.640]   The Alt Store has been around for a year and he gets away with it because it's a loophole
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.680]   that's very hard for Apple to close.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:10.120]   It's the same reason I could put apps I develop on my iPhone using Xcode and you have to allow
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:15.080]   that otherwise developers couldn't test the apps on iPhone or iPad.
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.160]   So that's what he's doing.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:21.840]   In effect, that Alt Store game or app that you're adding appears to the iPhone is something
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:27.280]   you developed that you're sideloading from your own computer to the phone.
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:31.920]   And I don't know how Apple would stop that without making it hard to do.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:32.920]   You'd break everything.
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:33.920]   You'd break a lot of things.
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:37.040]   And I guess that's why Apple's just decided it's too complicated and we're not going to
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:39.320]   have to worry about this.
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:47.120]   Honestly, this whole frica underscores for me what I philosophically always believe,
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:52.360]   which is that open systems, especially for platforms, is the best solution.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:57.920]   The proprietary systems for platforms inevitably comes down to problems like this.
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:00.360]   This is kind of the inevitability of it.
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:04.600]   The only difficulty is that open systems, things like Linux, there's no open, there are
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:05.600]   some open funds.
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:09.600]   There's a pine foam that's based on Linux, but they're not really competitive and open
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:16.280]   systems have yet to develop the ease of use and the competitive hardware that proprietary
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.280]   companies don't have.
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.280]   It's good to have both though.
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:26.840]   Do we need a whole closed and a whole open system like we have now with iOS and Android?
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:32.920]   Or can both systems be both closed and open and that is provide highly curated experiences
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:34.440]   and completely open options?
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.800]   So like, would people benefit from a gatekeeper in iOS?
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:38.800]   I think so.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.680]   Would they benefit from having a better boutique on Android?
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:46.520]   Probably some people would who are more nervous and more worried about these sorts of things.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:50.560]   And if you concader to both the edge cases, you probably catch most of the people in between
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:51.560]   too.
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:55.800]   Yeah, and one of the big problems I think is that we have to also acknowledge the fact
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:03.200]   that sometimes companies can do something that is legitimately the best choice for consumers
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.520]   that also happens to be anti-competitive.
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:10.840]   And so we have to navigate that as we try to figure out what do we want?
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:15.960]   What role do we want the government to do in terms of regulating what these companies
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.720]   have the power to do?
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.440]   Because we could spend an hour talking about examples.
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:25.880]   But you know that I am evangelical about saying that look, if you can't do whatever you want
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:29.400]   with a piece of hardware, you spend $1,000 for you, don't own it.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:34.520]   Nonetheless, the fact that it is such a tightly controlled environment, the fact that all of
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:38.800]   the apps that you install on an iPhone come from an app store where there are at least
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:42.320]   a lot of basic rules that developers have to come with.
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:47.360]   And as René keeps saying, the fact that the tools that developers are given to create
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:53.360]   really rich and wonderful experiences without having to invent an entire graphics pipeline,
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.200]   all of those things benefit users.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:59.800]   And it's possible to acknowledge that while also acknowledging that this is giving Apple
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:06.000]   an unfair advantage and power over the market for apps on this device.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.160]   I think it's hyper-competitive versus anti-competitive is the language the court looks at.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:14.080]   You're allowed to do everything up until the point where you don't like it.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:17.120]   Ben Thompson makes that point in his certiquerie piece of that.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:25.160]   He leads it off quoting a decision in the Qualcomm case from the Ninth Circuit, which
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.160]   will also be very-
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.160]   Same lawyers, by the way.
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.160]   Same lawyers.
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:29.160]   The Qualcomm lawyers.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:32.200]   Same court that the Epic will be in.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:38.680]   And the judge, Consuelo Callahan, last week wrote, "The case asks us to draw the line between
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:45.000]   anti-competitive behavior, which is illegal under federal antitrust law, and hyper-competitive
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.800]   behavior, which is not."
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:52.960]   Ben says, "This is admittedly distinction I have not seen before, but perhaps is a useful
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:42:00.440]   one for the simple reason being a successful business by definition means being anti-competitive
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:04.320]   without some sort of differentiation and/or superior cost structure.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.760]   Any sort of margin a business has will be competed away, so preserving that differentiation
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:13.840]   or cost structure, being anti-competitive in that general sense should be the goal of
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:14.840]   any business."
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:18.800]   Ben Thompson And all people complain about Qualcomm too,
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.440]   and the courts that is right.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.640]   Ben Thompson Right.
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:24.640]   Business should compete.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.680]   They just can't break the law on the way.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:27.680]   Ben Thompson Yeah.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:31.240]   Ben Thompson Maybe hyper-competition is a better way to describe what Apple and Qualcomm are
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:32.240]   up to.
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.280]   Ben Thompson But it's a very mallet.
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.280]   Ben Thompson It's a very malleable concept.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:39.160]   Remember, that's always human beings that have to decide whether or not they're engaging
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.960]   in anti-competitive processes or not.
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:47.320]   And I think one of the bets that Epic is making is that we are in an environment where
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:51.360]   as five years ago, this would have been a much harder case to put forward.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:57.680]   Now that we have bipartisan support in Congress for basically knocking down a peg, any tech
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:02.080]   company's making a trillion dollars, we feel as though this is a really good time to pounce
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:06.560]   at the very minimum a good time to get a very, very favorable negotiated settlement with
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:07.560]   Apple.
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.960]   Ben Thompson And the problem is like if they do go to
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:15.080]   the courts or the legislation, we had the e-book trial and they were concerned about pricing.
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:18.400]   So Amazon won and now Amazon has 83% of the e-book market.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.120]   They were concerned about competition in the EU.
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.320]   They made Microsoft put a browser ballot up.
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.360]   Slept near an opera or no better off for that browser ballot.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:30.800]   And now instead of like six rendering engines, we have two and a fork and one of them is
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.280]   on life support.
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:37.400]   So like letting it get that far does not always end up well for anybody.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:39.200]   Ben Thompson Yeah.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.680]   Ben Thompson I'm a slip near.
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:43.680]   Ben Thompson Yeah.
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.680]   Ben Thompson Did you ever use it?
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:49.920]   I did just when the browser ballot came out, I downloaded and tried them and the Scandinavians
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.680]   made a bunch of very delightful browsers.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.440]   Ben Thompson There you go.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.440]   That's good.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.440]   Ben Thompson Also rally cars.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:56.440]   Ben Thompson Yeah.
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.080]   Ben Thompson I don't know if there's a link there.
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.080]   Ben Thompson Yeah.
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:00.080]   Ben Thompson I don't know if there's a link there.
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:03.080]   near a Chrome or derivative or is it so?
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:06.880]   >> I think they are. I mean, operate uses webcam now and Firefox,
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:08.680]   was again was on life support as of last week.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.480]   Now they got a fresh infusion of Google money,
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:14.040]   but that's not like I Microsoft had a spot,
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:17.880]   spot by a spotlight, something like and then and then edge
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.520]   and then now they just use Chromium.
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:20.880]   I mean the browser,
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.320]   there's competition in that they have different labels on them,
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:26.040]   but they aren't we no longer have 4 or 5 different
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.000]   vibrant rendering engines. Like we used to.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:28.900]   >> Right. Yeah.
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:33.900]   >> The question with that is that what's the argument that
[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:38.600]   the makers of these rendering engine have actively tried to crush competition.
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:43.800]   I think that the most that the biggest vector towards that has always been that
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:47.600]   the browser is now a development environment and
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:53.400]   developers are building commercial apps in the form of eBay,
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.280]   New York Times, Amazon,
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:58.240]   all these other apps that run inside of browsers and they don't want.
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:01.900]   If they have incompatibility problems that affects their ability to make money,
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:04.180]   that affects their ability to track users.
[00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:07.140]   That's why I think the market has sort of
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:08.260]   collapse in rendering engines.
[00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.300]   They don't want to have to target five different engines.
[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:12.420]   >> Can you imagine? Can you imagine if Apple goes,
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:14.180]   okay, you can have as many stores as you want,
[00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:16.620]   but you can only use iOS frameworks in our store.
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:19.260]   You got to build it yourself otherwise.
[00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:21.040]   Like we'll give you the compatibility that's fine,
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.420]   but you got to build it all before it.
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:25.900]   Then Epic can do it, but not very many other predictions.
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:27.620]   What's going to happen?
[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:30.680]   >> I think that they're going to lose eventually.
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:35.020]   I think it might be surprising how many appeals have to happen before
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:36.520]   Epic loses the lawsuit.
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:40.680]   I think that Apple is going to lose eventually.
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:44.400]   I think that it's going to surprise a lot of people how high up it has to go before.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:48.040]   They finally lose their suit on appeal.
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:53.200]   I honestly think that there's a slightly lower chance that
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.960]   these two companies are simply going to get together and figure out
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:01.120]   a way to prevent this from becoming a three, four, five year lawsuit.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:05.960]   Epic is definitely at a disadvantage here because I think Apple has greater power to hurt
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.360]   Epic than Epic has to hurt Apple.
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:16.400]   Epic's biggest leverage is essentially giving another howitzer to Congress and regulators
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:22.680]   in their battle against the idea that Apple has an monopoly on their market.
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:26.240]   I do think that this is going to end in a settlement eventually.
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:28.240]   >> You agree, Laurie?
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:34.160]   >> I think Epic is going to give in and do what Apple says,
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:38.760]   and then they're going to tell the world how Apple is so horrible for the things that they made them do.
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.440]   >> I think exactly right.
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:44.280]   >> They're going to look really good with it too.
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.560]   They're going to look real good on that one.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:49.040]   >> I think that they saw this whole game through and that they knew that's what would happen.
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:50.600]   That this is all put in the plan.
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:51.560]   Renee, what do you say?
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:54.440]   >> Just looking at their past behavior,
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:56.560]   they did blink with the Google Play Store.
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:00.120]   They realized that they had to be on there, but they made a huge think about it first.
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.640]   I think they'll do that here too.
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.720]   Also, Sweeney hated Microsoft.
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.400]   He was raging.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:10.400]   He was so mad at Microsoft because they wouldn't let the Unreal Engine onto HoloLens 2.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:12.120]   Then Microsoft said, "Okay, fine."
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:13.480]   He's like, "I love Microsoft.
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:14.880]   I heart Microsoft."
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.840]   Now they're like super best buddies.
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.040]   >> That's so funny.
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:20.640]   >> His affection can be easily bought when he gets what he wants.
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:25.720]   My guess is Epic will do exactly what Laurie said.
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:27.440]   They'll say, "Oh, this is untenable.
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:29.720]   We're going to go back on the store, but we're not going to like it."
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:33.480]   Then a few weeks later, it's like when you negotiate for hostage release.
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:37.360]   We can't give into terrorists, but then you get really low development loans,
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:40.920]   like a month later or two months later after the people are let loose.
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:42.760]   Everyone will be fine.
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:44.080]   You'll get your Unreal Engine.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.320]   Then two weeks later, two months later,
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:50.240]   Apple announces one or two changes to the App Store that happen to be
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:55.920]   not everything Epic wants, but enough that a few of the billions move from Apple to Epic.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:00.360]   The last thing just to add is when the economy and everything is great,
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:02.040]   and the money is just there for everybody,
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:04.160]   everyone concentrates on expanding the pie.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.000]   But the minute anything goes bad,
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.800]   everyone just looks over at the other slices thinking about,
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:11.160]   "How come I can't get more of that other slice of pie?"
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.720]   This is common.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:15.040]   If they were making money handover fist,
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:17.920]   faster than they can count like Jeff Bezos level money,
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.400]   we probably wouldn't be seeing this.
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:22.520]   It's when things get tight and they suddenly want to still make profits
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:25.400]   in a downward trend that everyone starts trying to think about
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.600]   how much money they could take away from each other.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:33.480]   I'll just say that Epic really hired a murderers' roof of counsel for this lawsuit.
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:36.160]   I think that at least from Epic's perspective,
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:39.400]   they think they have a very, very real chance at winning this lawsuit
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:43.000]   because there are less expensive lawyers to hire.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   These are the lawyers that you hire to put the fear of God
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   into the defendant and the lawyer.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   And they're usually on the other side.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   They're always hired to win.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.720]   Yeah, I mean, you have a former commissioner of the FTC.
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:59.000]   You have a former attorney, assistant attorney,
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.520]   deputy attorney general of infertia antitrust for the Obama administration.
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:07.160]   Again, Christine Varney, I am terrible at just remembering names just out of the blue.
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:10.320]   But as soon as I saw the, "Oh, they've got Christine Varney."
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:12.080]   I did not have to Google that name.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:13.080]   That's kind of the--
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:14.400]   You must know where all the bodies are buried
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.880]   because they usually defend against antitrust delegations.
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.080]   They don't usually launch them.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:22.280]   So they probably know very well which ways to attack these particular laws.
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:23.280]   Yeah.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:27.080]   Well, and also let's point out Apple has some money too.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.480]   So I'm sure they can--
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:29.480]   Exactly.
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.680]   And they have other revenue streams.
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:33.880]   They end up 30% they're getting from Epic Games.
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.480]   So I'm sure we--
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:38.080]   They have a comfortable position, I think.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:41.280]   It's going to be-- it's not quite the Scopes Monkey trial,
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:45.280]   but we're going to see some very good opposing arguments in this.
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:49.680]   And it's-- you know, whichever way you come down on it for us, it's great.
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:53.480]   It gives us a lot of stuff to talk about over the next four or five years.
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:56.880]   Can I just quickly add that I think it would be great from a PR point of view
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.480]   if Epic were to do a little bit of leadership by example,
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:03.080]   because they're currently being sued by a lot of especially women and black artists
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:06.280]   who say that they have just stolen their dances and are selling them to people
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:09.880]   on the Epic, you know, the Emote store inside Epic.
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:13.880]   And Epic hates it when people get in between creators and audiences,
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:16.880]   when other people make money off of your effort and work.
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:19.680]   So I think it would be fantastic and would really help them in this
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:23.080]   if they gave Carlton from the Fresh Prince of Bel Air his money
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:27.280]   and the back back kid his money and everyone else who they've made these billions of
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:29.680]   just give them their share and then no one could argue with you
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:31.880]   that you're in this for altruistic reasons.
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:34.280]   Yeah, but that's not going to happen because they're not.
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:35.280]   No.
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:36.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:39.280]   You're just a hippie, Renee.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:40.280]   Come on.
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.880]   They're just a younger Goliath.
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.880]   Yeah, there's a David in this.
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.880]   You're just a younger Goliath.
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:46.880]   We're going to take a little break.
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:49.880]   Lots more to talk about, but we'll move on from the Epic story.
[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:50.880]   It is an Epic.
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:51.880]   I love it.
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:53.880]   It's aptly named the Apple Epic.
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:54.880]   Oh, it's common.
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:55.880]   Yeah.
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:59.880]   Our show today brought to you by Roman.
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:03.880]   Guys often have a little bit of an issue going to the doctor.
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:04.880]   I don't know what it is about us.
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:08.880]   I think honestly, I'm going to blame Little League.
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:12.720]   I think it started when we were playing team sports and the coach said when you get hit
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:15.520]   by the ball, don't show the pain.
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:17.080]   Don't rub it.
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:19.480]   Even in Major League Baseball, they still don't touch it.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:20.480]   Don't rub it.
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.520]   Just walk to first base like it didn't hurt at all.
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:23.680]   You could see they're an agony.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:29.120]   They're practically crying because there's no crying in baseball where the coach says,
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:33.760]   rub some dirt in it when you get a scuff after sliding in a home.
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:37.720]   That's what we grow up with, but there are some medical conditions you probably should
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:39.920]   see a doctor about.
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:42.440]   One is erectile dysfunction.
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:48.040]   It's a normal thing as we age, but younger people with it, it could be a sign of an underlying
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:49.040]   condition.
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:53.480]   In fact, that's how Roman was started, a young guy suffering ED.
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:57.880]   Fortunately, his father was a male health doctor physician.
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:51:59.840]   He wasn't too embarrassed to tell his dad.
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:03.800]   I think most of us would be too embarrassed to tell our doctor, but fortunately he didn't
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:06.760]   because his dad said, you know, at your age, that could be something more serious.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:10.520]   He got tests found out it was an underlying heart condition.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:11.520]   He had surgery.
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:14.680]   He's fine now, but he and his dad started Roman as a result.
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:21.840]   They've built a digital health clinic for guys who just are too embarrassed or too macho
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:24.160]   to go to the doctor.
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:31.080]   And of course, if you're suffering from ED, it's tough to admit to that if you're macho.
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:33.560]   But let me tell you something.
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:35.840]   Your loved ones know.
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:37.520]   There's no reason to suffer.
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:38.520]   No reason for them to suffer.
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:40.280]   No reason for you to suffer.
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:41.280]   It's easily fixed.
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:44.360]   You really need to go to the doctor.
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:47.600]   It's awkward to talk about in person, but there's a simple, convenient solution to get
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:50.440]   the treatment you need without leaving the couch.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:51.440]   It's Roman.
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:55.120]   They've spent years building a digital platform that connects you with a doctor licensed in
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:57.440]   your state without leaving the house.
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:00.560]   Nowadays is really a good thing, right?
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:04.160]   Get discreet professional care and a real doctor.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:08.640]   Not some guy just going to write a prescription for you, but you do get genuine prescription
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:14.560]   medication, not some pills shipped from China or anything, with a real deal.
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:18.540]   Or they have over-the-counter treatments as well for other conditions and unmarked packaging.
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:20.440]   No one needs to know.
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:24.800]   Roman helps you with sexual health, hair and skin, dandruff and eczema.
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:26.040]   Daily health too.
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:30.400]   They have some great supplements for guys, prostate health, bone health, and they make
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.000]   it very convenient.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.600]   You grab your phone or your computer, complete a free online visit.
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:41.160]   You're going to hear back from a US licensed physician within 24 hours.
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:43.760]   The doctor is going to really do a checkup.
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:48.240]   If they decide the treatment is right for you, your medication can be shipped right to your
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:50.920]   door with free two-day shipping.
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:55.600]   Your suffering is just the end of your suffering is just two days away.
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:59.280]   You also get free unlimited free unlimited follow-ups with your doctor.
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:02.520]   Anytime for questions, if you want to adjust your treatment plan, there's no commitment
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:04.680]   you can cancel at any time.
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:10.000]   Roman is a great source for guys for wellness and it's actually so easy.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.240]   You're actually going to say, "You know, I need to use this more often.
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:14.720]   This is good."
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:17.880]   If you're struggling with ED, don't worry.
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:18.960]   It's okay.
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.320]   It happens.
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:29.240]   Go to getromen.com/macbreak for a free online visit and free two-day shipping.
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:32.880]   It's getromen.com/macbreak.
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:36.800]   When you go to the website to look at all the different conditions they treat, it's really
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:38.040]   become.
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.080]   We first started doing the ads.
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:43.720]   It was really just ED, but they've really broadened it and they cover a lot of things
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:48.560]   that men don't want to talk about, like hair loss.
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:54.840]   Getromen.com/macbreak for your free online visit, free two-day shipping.
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:57.840]   They're really doing important work.
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:00.960]   It's pharmacy, US licensed physicians.
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:05.080]   It's the real deal.
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.920]   Let's see.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:12.960]   Weibo survey asking users to choose between WeChat and iPhones.
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:22.160]   1.2 million responses, 95% said, "We'd rather give up the iPhone than give up WeChat."
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:27.120]   Now this isn't because Apple's thinking of getting out of China or banning WeChat.
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:32.320]   It has to do with the White House, which has already banned.
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:39.520]   Along with restricting TikTok, WeChat was also in that executive order.
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:42.800]   I think the new time was 45 days.
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:47.160]   They now have 90 days to find a US buyer or all their funds will be frozen.
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.960]   Very Ellison is all up in it now.
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.480]   Oracle wants it.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:51.480]   Oracle talk.
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:52.480]   Oracle wants it.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:58.880]   Oracle wants it.
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:02.000]   Then making a lot of money on it.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:10.640]   Apple may be in that position because if you wouldn't be able to be on the iPhone, I guess.
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:12.440]   This is the Bloomberg story.
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:16.920]   Felix Tam and Xi and Chen, Apple's $44 billion China market.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:18.920]   I didn't realize China was that important.
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:27.600]   It's threatened by this WeChat ban because the Chinese customers who use WeChat would
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:32.240]   rather switch than fight.
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:37.360]   The Chinese market represents multiple percentage points of Apple's revenue.
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:39.840]   This is a really super big deal.
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:42.280]   If Apple were forced to remove- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:43.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:46.240]   Can we just point out that Andy put on his blazer?
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:47.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:48.400]   I missed that.
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:49.400]   Let's see.
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:54.920]   If you're going to bring the tattoo, I'm going to match her tattoo.
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:55.920]   That's very scary.
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:59.720]   This isn't as cool as your tattoo, but at least I'm upping my game.
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:04.360]   It also has the symbols on the Apple patches.
[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:06.360]   Check out this lighting.
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:12.560]   You think I should have something like Darth Vader helmet lining or something?
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:14.560]   Oh, it's Boba Fett, of course.
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:15.560]   Mandelerian.
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:16.560]   Yeah.
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:37.320]   We had our four best-gar steel armors ready.
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:40.720]   We could have been wearing them right now and just people like you.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:41.720]   Wow.
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:43.720]   Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:46.720]   I was so beautiful.
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:48.440]   How many years have been working together?
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:53.280]   I now learn that Andy has a blazer with the same patch on it that Laurie's shoulder
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:54.280]   tattoo has.
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:57.120]   The whole cast is coming together.
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:58.560]   They're both Mandelerians.
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:57:59.560]   What about you, Renee?
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:01.400]   What have you got to prove you're allegiance?
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:03.440]   I crawled out of a Sarlach pet this morning.
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:05.840]   I was like, I can give the show.
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:06.840]   Excuse me.
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:11.400]   Can we highlight his wonderful Montreal Expos cap?
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:12.720]   Oh, that's good.
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:15.520]   The classic Elle will logo.
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:17.560]   One of my favorite baseball logos of all time.
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.400]   It's also nice and gray, which I really like.
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:20.400]   I like the monochromatic baseball.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.520]   I have a child on the shelf behind me.
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:23.520]   Just a little.
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:25.360]   He's talking to Groot on the shelf behind me.
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:26.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:27.360]   There we go.
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:28.360]   There's Baby Yoda with baby Groot.
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:30.160]   There's on there with Baby Groot.
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:31.160]   That's a good combination.
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:35.680]   Plus, you use lightsabers for your in-studio lighting, so that's not nothing.
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:42.680]   If Apple were forced to remove WeChat from the App Store, analysts say annual light,
[00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:49.040]   multiple shipments of the iPhone would decline 25 to 30%.
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.040]   That's all?
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:54.720]   I mean, WeChat is the operating system layer effectively for most of China.
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:59:00.720]   95% of participants say they'd rather switch devices than give up WeChat.
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:05.200]   I hear this all the time for people who use WeChat.
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:07.760]   A lot of them have family in China.
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:10.200]   It's the only way they talk to them.
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:12.280]   They say, you don't understand.
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:15.640]   WeChat's not just like Facebook Messenger.
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:17.160]   It's the ecosystem.
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:18.160]   It's everything.
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:20.160]   It's a platform.
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:22.480]   You pay for things with WeChat.
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:24.160]   You travel with WeChat.
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:25.960]   You do your banking with WeChat.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:34.400]   It is every time I see YouTube videos of people living in China, the only transaction platform
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:38.960]   for any sort of transaction between two human beings in China is through WeChat.
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:40.720]   So I'm with Renee.
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:47.040]   It's amazing that there's anybody who said that they'd be willing to give up WeChat in
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:48.880]   order to keep their iPhones.
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:50.680]   That's kind of remarkable.
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:52.360]   And listen to this.
[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:57.200]   They interviewed a Shanghai-based commodities trader who was thinking about replacing his
[00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:00.880]   Huawei handset with an iPhone, which he stopped now.
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:03.440]   He said, "I'm worried that WeChat will be banned on the iPhone.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.200]   That would affect my work to a large extent.
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:08.760]   90% of my clients and colleagues communicate via WeChat.
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:11.720]   But he's also worried about switching to...
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:16.320]   He's thinking about Samsung, but then he realizes because it's Android, he's worried
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:22.480]   that this ban will also affect Android and that he won't be able to run WeChat on an
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.160]   Android device.
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:28.320]   It's going to be good for the Chinese handset makers, like Huawei, which has...
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:33.880]   No, they should be okay because remember that Google doesn't have an app store in China.
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:39.360]   So they all the handsets that use Android are using the open version of Android.
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:41.640]   So people will still continue to use Android phones.
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:43.760]   They just won't be able to...
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:50.440]   They will just continue to not have any sort of any money going to Google for that.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:51.440]   But that does...
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.440]   There is...
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:58.040]   Is it an area of concern that there's so much of what we used to think as an open and
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:05.840]   free internet is now becoming really compartmentalized and contained by government and by all the
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.520]   conflicts that we're having.
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:13.840]   Already there are classes of Huawei phones that you can't get anywhere else except for
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:14.840]   China because...
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:18.840]   Or you can't get in the United States because of the ban against importing and doing business
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:20.360]   with Huawei products.
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:23.520]   There are a whole bunch of other platforms that you can't get in the United States,
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:28.640]   which is actually because of trade bans and the ability to have a powerful market that
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.440]   sort of lives in and of itself.
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:36.240]   It's kind of disappointing and it also makes me wonder how worried Apple is that they're
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.920]   going to continue to be able to do business in China.
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:46.680]   Whether they think that it's separate from whatever discussions they're having about
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:54.400]   their responsibilities as a corporate world entity, will they even be able to continue
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:57.760]   to operate in China in a way that makes sense for Apple anymore?
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:58.760]   It's not just Apple.
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:05.840]   In fact, according to the Wall Street Journal, several big American companies got on a call
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:12.280]   with the White House before this ban, begging them not to ban WeChat.
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:20.840]   Apple Ford, Walmart, Walt Disney and others trying to persuade the president not to do
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:23.160]   this because it would hurt their business.
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:31.040]   Procter and Gamble, Intel, MetLife, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, UPS, Merck, Cargill.
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:40.240]   This is the blue chip American companies and obviously they couldn't persuade Trump to
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.240]   back down.
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:46.920]   The golf course is sadly, if they owned golf courses, we would just be fine now.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:47.920]   That's humor folks.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:48.920]   It's humor.
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:50.640]   He didn't back down on Huawei either.
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.840]   The stakes were a lot bigger with Huawei.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:53.840]   But at this point-
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:03:01.560]   I think he has more support for Huawei because he's got the Commerce Department, even in
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:07.080]   the Obama administration concerned Department of Defense because Huawei is a network infrastructure
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:08.080]   company.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:09.080]   Right.
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.280]   That's another concern there.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:13.000]   The other world governments are also involved in that.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.680]   We don't want Huawei to be building out our private-
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:15.680]   This is unilateral.
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:16.360]   This TikTok week-
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:19.120]   The chat thing is completely unilateral.
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.600]   That's completely coming out of the White House.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:25.520]   To be fair, I think last week I was talking about how there seems to be a lack of evidence
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:29.200]   so far that TikTok is doing anything unusual in terms of surveillance.
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:34.920]   Since then there has been a report about it taking part in practices, at least on the
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:40.520]   Android platform that violate Android's own privacy and security regulations.
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:44.880]   It remains to be seen whether, kind of like what we talked about last week, is this because
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:49.800]   they are acting as an espionage tool for a foreign government or is this because they
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:53.720]   are a social media network that wants to grab as much data as they possibly can just on
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:56.640]   principle?
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.840]   Augustus Gloop falling into the Chocolate River.
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:04.360]   This is any social media app that you put onto a phone.
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:12.880]   Apple One is, we had speculated for some time that Apple might offer a bundle of some kind.
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:17.520]   Mark Gurman says it is going to be called Apple One.
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:23.600]   This is not confirmed by Apple yet, but he has sources inside Cupertino that will let
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:29.440]   customers subscribe to several services at a lower monthly price, but not much lower
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.440]   if Gurman's report is right.
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:36.440]   It doesn't match the tin.
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:41.160]   It's Apple Music, Apple TV Plus.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:43.160]   That's the basic package.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:46.720]   The higher end package will have that plus arcade.
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:52.720]   Next tier up adds Apple Music TV Plus Arcade, now News Plus.
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:58.000]   And then there's finally a big bundle, the real Apple One bundle, which includes iCloud
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.360]   storage, not clear how much iCloud storage and all of that.
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:09.120]   But Gurman estimates that it's a savings of maybe $5 to buy it through a bundle.
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:13.120]   It's not a Gully Dwarf, but I can count high enough to know that's not one.
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:16.960]   One means one buy.
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:18.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:19.920]   It's Apple Prime.
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.640]   It's the same thing as Amazon Prime is.
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.080]   We'd heard about this for a long time.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.240]   You speculated about it.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:32.040]   I think Renee, when Apple's one price, that's the whole point of using a name like they don't
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:33.040]   have tears.
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:35.840]   Otherwise, you call it Apple Your Way or Apple.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:37.040]   The more you say.
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:41.280]   Actually, the Amazon Prime does have tears.
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:48.760]   So they have the Amazon Prime where it's just the digital watching of things.
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:51.840]   And then they have the Amazon Prime tier that includes the shipping thing.
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:53.040]   So they do have tears.
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:58.440]   You can just get TV alone instead of just because I think most people think Prime is.
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:01.360]   You get two day shipping.
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:04.040]   And then by the way, there's a bunch of other stuff we'll throw in.
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:08.720]   I believe there is a tier that allows you to just have the digital downloads and it doesn't
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:09.720]   include the shipping.
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.520]   I believe that's the case.
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:15.320]   Or it might be the opposite, which is shipping but no digital.
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:16.520]   There is one new service.
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:23.520]   I'm fairly sure.
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:26.520]   A virtual fitness service code named C-more.
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:27.520]   Yeah, that's been around for a while.
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.520]   But that would also be part of the bundle.
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:32.720]   Virtual classes.
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:36.640]   That's a valuable package, I guess.
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:42.600]   The new bundles will be geared towards family so they'll work with family sharing.
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:48.760]   But according to German, the offerings are designed to save consumers about $2 to as
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:53.000]   much as $5 a month depending on how much you buy.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.160]   That's my big problem with it.
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:57.720]   It doesn't seem like you get much of an advantage.
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:03.440]   You get stuff you don't really care about and then you don't get much of an advantage.
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:04.920]   Is that a cable TV joke, Leo?
[01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:15.080]   I get it ESPN along with 13 different gardening channels per herb.
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:19.720]   There are a lot of things that Apple offers that I probably wouldn't pay for as a standalone
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:25.800]   service but if he gave it to me as a bundle, I probably would see the logic in that without
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:27.880]   taking the time to do the math.
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:29.360]   Five bucks is five bucks.
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:32.200]   That's not a whole burrito but that's like most of a burrito.
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:35.640]   That could be the same.
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:44.560]   We fall for the trick, if you will, of marketing things when it's on sale.
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.560]   Prime Day is a perfect example.
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:53.400]   I never wanted this light for my toilet seat but suddenly now that it's 50% off I have
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:58.200]   to have it, it's the same kind of idea.
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:07:59.760]   I know I would do the same thing.
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:03.400]   If there was a bundle of it, I'm only saving two to five dollars.
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:06.560]   I'm getting some service that I actually probably am not that interested.
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:10.560]   I would do it anyway because I would think, well this is a good deal for the entire package.
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:13.280]   Well, I think we would all do it because we buy all that crap.
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:15.720]   I mean, we're already there's I own everyone.
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:17.200]   We're getting the discount.
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:20.200]   Yeah, so it gives us five bucks.
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:25.440]   The approach according to Gorman is likely to be applauded by Wall Street and that's really
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:30.840]   what's happened with Apple is they're doing revenue per customer as opposed to revenue
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:34.960]   by selling devices and Wall Street likes that.
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:39.520]   I would love it if they took their prime thing of value because like Amazon, and I think
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:43.880]   Nileve from the Verge was talking about this, Amazon's value is that delivery and they're
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:47.600]   just making it more and more attractive for you to hook into that delivery.
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:52.480]   The buy ship, whatever thing, by adding on services on top of it where Apple's prime
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:56.080]   motivator to forgive the pun is the iPhone and they already have subscriptions based
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:57.080]   on the iPhone.
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:01.760]   You can pay monthly, get a new iPhone every year and building value on top of that where
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:06.000]   for a couple extra bucks on your iPhone payment, you get all of these services as well and
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   that really becomes transformative because it's your best customers already paying you
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.600]   on schedule and you're just increasing the amount of their payments.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:17.760]   It's limited because that plan is mostly US only or carrier based in other parts of the
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:18.760]   world.
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:22.160]   But if Apple could build that out where you get right now they have two tiers, just the
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:25.040]   phone and the phone and AppleCare Plus.
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:29.440]   But if they had more tiers where you had like, I would just give TV to anybody right now,
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:31.480]   they're not even producing new shows, they can't.
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:35.600]   So like just music and TV and then like a couple extra bucks is all right.
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:39.200]   Make it like when you're configuring a new Mac where it's like, oh, it's only 100 bucks
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:40.200]   extra for this.
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:41.200]   Oh, it's only 100 bucks.
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.360]   Pretty soon it's 1000 bucks, but you didn't notice.
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:47.840]   And if they could do that, that would be an Apple one for me.
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:50.880]   Yeah, maybe now how much would you pay?
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.840]   Apple music's added to two new stations, right?
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:57.040]   Apple music hits an Apple music country.
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:00.000]   No hip hop lame.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   No hip hop.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000]   I don't care about it.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.480]   Didn't we always think that the Apple radio play was going to have multiple channels and
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:09.600]   then it was only beast one for the longest time.
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:10.600]   That by the way,
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:11.800]   One applied more than one, right?
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:15.440]   Yeah, that would be channel one and then there's no channel two.
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:18.320]   It will be renamed Apple music one.
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:22.600]   Apple music hits will celebrate everyone's favorite songs, maybe not mine from the 80s,
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:24.400]   90s and 2000s.
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:28.160]   Apple music country will spotlight country music.
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:32.680]   One thing that Apple's doing with these, which I think is, I don't know how I feel
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:41.800]   about it is it's very heavily just like Apple one, Apple beats one very heavily DJ flavored.
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:49.600]   They've got big name DJs who are going to host these music beats one was Zane Lowe and
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:53.680]   remember in Judy Antinuga and all of that stuff.
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:59.320]   Then they would have musicians host their own kind of shows.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:04.760]   Let's see what Apple music hits is going to be helmed by and maybe you know these names.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:13.800]   Jade Donovan, Estelle, low key, Jen Marino, Sabi, Nicole Sky, Natalie Skye and Strombo.
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:20.040]   I do know Strombo and I'm sure you do too Renee, George Strombo-Lopolis.
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:21.400]   Canadian icon.
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:24.560]   And the Canadian icon.
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:25.560]   Special shows.
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:27.800]   I was going to say he's our Alan thick, but that doesn't work.
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:31.200]   Yeah, because Alan thick is also your Alan thick.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.200]   Yeah.
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:36.240]   Strombo, was there a scandal around Strombo?
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:37.560]   I feel like I remember that.
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:39.240]   I just figured there's a scandal around everybody.
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:42.200]   If you're on the internet, it's three minutes you buy a scandal.
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:43.200]   But I like Strombo.
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.520]   In fact, Amber MacArthur was friends.
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:46.920]   I really liked him.
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:47.920]   Yeah.
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:49.720]   Yeah, I think he's good.
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:54.240]   Special shows from MSNBC host Ari Melber.
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:12:00.040]   Fans can also tune in to hear new exclusive shows from artists like Backstreet Boys, Ciara,
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:07.000]   Coppas, Huey Lewis, Alana Smoresett, Snoop Dogg, Meghan Trainor, Shania Twain and more.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:14.520]   Now, Apple Music Country is going to have hosts Kelly, Ben and Ty, Benel, Bree, Alicia,
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:15.520]   Davis.
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:17.240]   I have to figure these are all radio people, right?
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:19.360]   The various markets you would know them.
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:21.480]   It's not quite a Canadian icon as well.
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:22.680]   No, I know the music.
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:24.080]   I know the music.
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.080]   Yes.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:27.760]   So, if you have Apple Music, two new stations.
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.760]   I'd like to see more than just two new.
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:30.760]   Is it hard to do these?
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:34.160]   Is that why they have to really work hard to develop?
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:36.800]   The first new one's in four years, so I think.
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:38.480]   I don't understand it.
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:40.320]   I just don't.
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:42.880]   I've never, I still have a subscription to Apple Music.
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:44.240]   I keep dipping into it.
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:45.680]   Just keep familiar with it.
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:53.720]   I still haven't found like a DJ station that to me has any significance apart from the
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:59.200]   automated stations that you get on any other subscription music service.
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:06.280]   It would be a great signature if Apple Music were able to do something like WBCN and Boston,
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.480]   where it's like this is a signature station.
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:09.480]   They're going through personalities.
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:14.640]   They're going to control the content in a way that isn't just, hey, we, here is the
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:21.400]   library of 1000 tracks that you are allowed to program for your station and we need you
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:25.000]   to program these 60 during this week.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.720]   I wish that it had been more of a signature for the service.
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:32.680]   I feel Apple could have been more Apple-y.
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:36.320]   It's just instead it's just some sort of international radio station.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:42.400]   Yeah, what they really could have done is really just throwing it wide open and allowed
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:47.360]   it to become a platform kind of similar to what YouTube and Twitter like.
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:53.160]   Where here is a library of music you have access to here, a million tracks.
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:57.720]   And we will, you have to go through a certain procedure to make sure that we know that you're
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:03.200]   not going to just be spouting like anti-fau, or excuse me, you're not going to be spouting
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:06.920]   like a nonsense that we're not going to approve of.
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:10.120]   Sorry, I didn't mean to say anti-fau, I was looking for.
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:14.360]   There are three other organizations that come up in my mind and I couldn't think of it.
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:18.200]   There's such idiots that, I'm sorry.
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:24.720]   It would be to give us a sense of spontaneity and a sense of identity and a sense of we
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:29.320]   are here to support every voice that's out there, people who are providing the music that
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:30.320]   is in our future.
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.320]   Too much moderation would be quite for that.
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:33.840]   Yeah, but I just don't understand.
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:41.320]   It's kind of retro because I think I guess this, I believe this goes back to Jimmy Iovine,
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:47.720]   who right from when he started at Apple when the Beat sale happened, said that what people
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:50.040]   miss is curation.
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:57.680]   That's the only answer you can have in the radio business because honestly, you got every song.
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:01.720]   There's all sorts of algorithmic ways you can put a playlist together for people, but
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:03.440]   they already do that.
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:06.240]   What's the one thing missing while a human curated?
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.840]   But I think that that's very old fashioned.
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:11.120]   I don't know if people want that anymore.
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:17.160]   I listen to Beats 1 a little bit and then I realize I'm just annoyed by these people.
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.160]   Just get it.
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.720]   Let me listen to my music.
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:20.720]   I don't want to hear it.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:21.720]   24/7 worldwide.
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:22.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:23.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:27.160]   The fact that I'm coming up with WBCN as a reference point, that might be just show
[01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:29.200]   up how old I am.
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:31.200]   They went out of business several years ago when-
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:32.200]   Well, there you go.
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:33.760]   All free form radio did Andy.
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.720]   I have to tell you.
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:39.560]   But wouldn't it be great to be able to- I still think that there's something about that
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:41.320]   that's still very, very valid.
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:46.400]   The idea that it wasn't a Coke versus Pepsi sort of thing, it's that it's five minutes
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:50.720]   after five o'clock, I'm definitely turning tuning into the B.C.N. to hear the comedy.
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:53.920]   I'm definitely tuning into Carter Allen.
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:54.920]   I'm home.
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:55.920]   It's a weekend.
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:00.760]   I'm definitely tuning into Charles Lockwood era because you really, really had a sense
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:03.520]   of identity with this station.
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:07.040]   It was playing lots of music you liked and introducing you to things that you had no
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:10.880]   idea but you kind of had an idea that you would trust them to give you stuff that's
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:13.600]   interesting and introduce you into new directions.
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:16.360]   I just wish that there was something- maybe there is something like that.
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:21.840]   I haven't come across but it seems like an opportunity for some streaming service.
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:26.240]   This is all coming out because this is a- I have to dump Google Play music.
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:29.080]   I have to dump YouTube music because it's terrible.
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:34.840]   Google Play music is being shut down whether YouTube music is capable of taking up that
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:35.840]   role or not.
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.680]   And so now I'm like, okay, do I switch?
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:42.640]   I am subscribing to Apple Music but should I now take up a paid subscription to Spotify
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:48.480]   to basically give me the access to a million tracks when I'm doing sampling and when I'm
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:50.920]   just trying to figure out something new.
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:55.560]   And I'm just shocked that all three of these services with the exception of YouTube music
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:17:01.000]   being stinky, they're basically the same sort of thing where you launch the app and it will
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.480]   show you lots of playlists and lots of new music and lots of stuff that you're not interested
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:09.840]   in and you have to do a couple of tasks before you get into, here is my personally curated
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:12.200]   area of this experience.
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:17.600]   And it's just, I just feel like you can go for any of these three and still get pretty
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.440]   much 80 to 90% the same experience.
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:21.640]   So that kind of frustrates me.
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:23.640]   We're taking a little break here.
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:24.640]   Come back.
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:28.280]   There's lots more to talk about on Mac break weekly.
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:30.680]   Let me see.
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:34.600]   I wanted to do, I thought there were three new things from Apple.
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.600]   Oh, there is another one.
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:37.600]   AppleCare.
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:41.880]   It used to be you had to buy it quickly, right?
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:44.880]   How long you had 60 days after you bought an Apple product?
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:48.040]   They even put up a little reminders.
[01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:51.840]   You only have a few weeks left to buy that AppleCare.
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:52.840]   You want AppleCare?
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:53.840]   Come on.
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:59.480]   Now you have a year in the US and Canada to get AppleCare Plus, which kind of makes
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:05.560]   sense because what you're doing is extending the existing year-long warranty, right?
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:12.480]   So you should have until the warranty runs out to extend it, it makes sense to me.
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:13.480]   Is that why they're doing it?
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:14.480]   I don't know.
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:18.520]   It's, I think, probably just gives people a better chance of opting into the service
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:21.640]   and just once again increases service services revenue.
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:22.640]   Yeah.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:26.040]   And we should point out one of the reasons Apple is fighting so bitterly over the App Store,
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:32.560]   this is a graph from Bloomberg, is that when you talk about services revenue, the App Store
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:35.480]   is easily the lion's share.
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:37.720]   Number two is the Google search deal.
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:42.480]   This is estimate according to an analyst at Bernstein.
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:47.000]   Then AppleCare, everything else is far below it.
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.080]   So you really do want to beef up AppleCare if you can.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:52.240]   You want to beef up the App Store if you can.
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:56.840]   I'm sure they'd like to see these other services pick up, but they're not as big.
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:58.160]   They're not as important.
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:18:59.920]   At least Apple doesn't break this down.
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:02.240]   This is at least according to what an analyst says.
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.840]   I don't know how I think Neil Seibert says he disputes all that.
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:05.840]   Yeah, that's the problem.
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:07.560]   How do you see it?
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:09.400]   How would you figure that out?
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:11.480]   I don't know how you would figure that out.
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:12.960]   It's all a guess.
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:13.960]   Slide rule.
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:16.400]   I'm guessing there's a slide rule involved in Apple.
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:23.880]   And Apple has expanded its independent repair shop program to Mac computers.
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:30.440]   So this is actually really good news in the right to repair scene.
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:34.240]   The program was expanded last year to iPhones.
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:39.040]   Mac users either had to go in an Apple store or an authorized warranty service provider
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.320]   to get fixes with parts from Apple.
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:43.640]   Now you can go to an independent third party.
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:44.640]   This is important.
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:50.320]   In fact, it's timely because on the weekend before Apple's announcement, I had a woman
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:55.720]   call who had her husband whose name was Si.
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:59.600]   She said, "Don't say my husband's name on the air."
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.560]   His name was Si.
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:09.680]   From Encino, in case you know him, he reached over and knocked over the iMac and it broke
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:12.320]   and it broke the glass.
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:16.480]   And I said, "You know, actually Apple might charge you more than if you could find an
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:18.000]   independent repair store.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.920]   But if they don't have the parts, there's nothing you could do about that."
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:22.960]   Then I found out it wasn't just the glass.
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:25.720]   The LCD, the screen also got damaged.
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:28.480]   Now it's a very expensive repair.
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:37.000]   So I remember speaking in my MacBook to when we had Mac Adam here in San Francisco.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:44.040]   My friend Tom Santos's independent repair store, I had brought my MacBook stopped charging.
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:49.680]   I kind of jammed the, this is years ago, jammed the cable and Apple said, "Yeah, you
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.080]   need a logic board."
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:54.920]   I brought it to Tom and he said, "Oh yeah, we just sold that back on and it'll cost you
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:56.360]   $25."
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:57.760]   I mean, that was a big difference.
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:00.880]   And I think that's having these independent guys who maybe are willing to do a little
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:03.720]   bit more is good.
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:08.040]   TechServe, there are a lot of these regional stores that just create their own legends.
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:11.280]   Like TechServe was legendary in New York City.
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:16.800]   And I can't tell you how depressing it was to walk by there back in January or February.
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:21.160]   And now it was like, at least for the day, it was this boutique sort of thing selling
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:23.480]   really exclusive prints and posters.
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:30.280]   And it was like, "Oh, you used to be just full of riff-raff like me with trying to hope that
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:33.560]   the repair person doesn't smell the Dr. Pepper on the keyboard."
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:36.200]   So you can say, "Oh, it just stopped working."
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:40.240]   But I'm glad that Apple is really moving forward on this because this was another thing that
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:48.000]   was giving them a lot of bad PR that they really deserved as people were going to Genius
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.320]   Bars and coming back saying, "Well, I came to them with a problem that the E key and the
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.720]   Y key on my keyboard wasn't working.
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:22:00.160]   And they tried to charge me $900 to replace the entire lower half of my MacBook.
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:01.160]   And no, they're not a lot."
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:03.880]   And I went to this other place and they said they can't get the part from Apple because
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:07.120]   they don't, Apple doesn't consider them a legitimate repair shop.
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:09.720]   This is something that Apple really needed to take care of.
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:15.560]   And I'm glad to see that without being sued by a murderer's row of lawyers that they're
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:17.840]   actually trying to correct that a little bit.
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:23.720]   I wonder, and this is an example of how putting pressure on Apple can't have a beneficial
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:27.960]   result because Apple was really fighting the right to repair movement.
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:31.400]   And the complaint of these independents was Apple won't give us manuals, instructions
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:32.640]   or even sell us parts.
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:34.400]   So now they're going to do all of that.
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:37.400]   They're going to sell parts, provide training, the independence shops.
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:39.040]   Go ahead.
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:43.120]   I immediately go and look at what Lewis Rossman's hottest of hot takes is on all these things.
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:50.320]   He's mixed to negative on it still, but it's the same thing with Epic and Apple is that
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:52.240]   everybody is really stuck in their point of view.
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:57.200]   And Apple's point of view on this has always been, anything goes wrong, we're going to
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:59.760]   be the ones that are sued and we can't trust anybody.
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:02.040]   And we don't know what you're going to do with the parts and we don't know that you're
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:03.040]   going to do.
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:04.720]   And so they make everything just rigidly controlled.
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:07.640]   You can only get the screen when the customer comes and asks for it.
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:09.400]   And the pair of shops, that's not tenable.
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:11.760]   We need to have them in stock so that we can easily do it.
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:13.120]   And Apple's like, but then you're going to resell them.
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:15.120]   Are you going to do this with it?
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:16.120]   So it's it's.
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:18.120]   So what is Rossman's saying?
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:20.520]   Because Rossman is this independent repair guy.
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:21.520]   Rit Lard.
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:26.760]   He doesn't like it because he he he he he originally plays it saying it was a step in
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:30.520]   the right direction or at least Apple was doing something, but he doesn't like the restrictions
[01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:31.520]   on it.
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:34.760]   Like for example, you have to take down all the information about the customer.
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:35.760]   They're serial number.
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:39.240]   All of that send it to Apple at that point, Apple will send you the part.
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:42.840]   And there's only a few parts that they currently cover under the program and it restricts a
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:46.520]   bunch of other things that you can't do if you want to be a part of this program.
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:50.800]   So it's I think I would say he's mixed to negative decided point more negative now that
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:52.320]   he's spent more time with it.
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:55.720]   But I do think again, this is like Apple learning how to do this and they're going to get a
[01:23:55.720 --> 01:24:01.720]   lot of stuff wrong for the independent like spoots on the ground store before they get
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:02.720]   it right.
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:05.760]   But I think it's better than what they were doing and the only way they're actually going
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:09.840]   to get to a point where everybody trusts each other and thinks everyone has good intentions
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:11.720]   here and starts doing what's best for the customer.
[01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:12.720]   It is what the customer.
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:19.120]   I mean, if you're out of warranty, having independent repair stores is a huge thing.
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.120]   You need that.
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.120]   Yeah.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:28.200]   But I'll credit Renee on this because he's the he's the one who like brought this concept
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:33.760]   from a background idea to a foreground idea that now that devices have to be are now being
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:40.960]   built as more of one single component and that the security of that entire device is
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:45.880]   it has to be has to be held integral to each component in the device.
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:50.360]   It's hard for it's hard for a company to now be able to say that yes, you can replace
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:55.800]   this motherboard, but now we need to be able to we need to disable certain security features
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:25:00.520]   because we can no longer trust that because components are now inside this device that
[01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:04.880]   we didn't put in there, we can no longer trust that there isn't a piece of nefarious hardware
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:08.440]   in there that's trying to overcome some of our hardware security features in there.
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:13.880]   So it's a you have to acknowledge that again, as I am the I am the the the the communist
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:17.920]   person who's saying, you know, I the workers control the means of computing.
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:21.760]   I am the person who owns this computer, but nonetheless, I have to have to do so while
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:24.360]   also acknowledging that this is a much more difficult thing.
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:28.800]   It's going to become much more difficult as Apple becomes more more successful in getting
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:35.480]   that parts getting the parts countdown and integrating all of their designs into simpler
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:39.920]   simpler designs that now can't really be taken apart at all.
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:46.880]   Apple is last week released updates to Mac OS and iOS 1361 and 1056.
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:48.840]   Those are bug fixes, right?
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:50.120]   Renee, were they?
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:51.120]   I don't know.
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:52.120]   Yeah, security fixes.
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:54.320]   As far as I can recall, yeah.
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:55.320]   Yeah, I know.
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:56.320]   I know.
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:57.320]   I know.
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:00.320]   Only last week.
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:01.560]   I applied them.
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:02.560]   Yeah.
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:03.920]   Well, of course.
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:04.920]   I mean, I'm unfortunately.
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:05.920]   No new features.
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:07.600]   In other words, no new features.
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:08.720]   That's why you didn't notice it.
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:09.720]   It was.
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:14.120]   So I think it was a fix is on behalf of all listeners and a good percentage of the Mac
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:15.120]   community.
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:17.760]   Thank you for always being that first penguin off the ice to jump off the ice.
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:23.340]   We'll run eight because even even I like I'm like, Oh, here's the new here's a new version
[01:26:23.340 --> 01:26:30.340]   of the beta.
[01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:36.340]   I think I will wait a day and a half to install it because I don't have the emotional bandwidth
[01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:37.340]   right now to deal with.
[01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:41.340]   They call it a supplemental update on Catalina.
[01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:42.340]   What is that?
[01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:45.340]   It means it's not like a point up.
[01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:47.340]   It's not like a big feature release.
[01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:49.340]   Like you get like 10 point.
[01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:52.340]   Forget where I was around 11, but this is still 12.1314 whatever.
[01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:54.900]   The version number we're just going to.
[01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:58.820]   The thing that's hard though is that like it used to be all this beta.
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:26:59.820]   Go ahead, Laurie.
[01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:05.540]   Oh, I was just going to make a joke about how it's sort of like when the captain is releasing
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:08.380]   a supplemental update to a journal entry.
[01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:10.180]   It's not actually major.
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:11.660]   It's just kind of a little.
[01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:12.660]   Capital.
[01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:13.660]   Capital.
[01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:14.660]   Capital.
[01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:15.660]   Capital.
[01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:16.660]   Okay, I got it.
[01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:19.500]   It turns out like retiring into a brief.
[01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:24.100]   Remember talking about a problem was not the right approach because we've had our asses
[01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:26.300]   handle was so there's a long standing.
[01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:29.340]   You're going to add those.
[01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:31.060]   Sometimes there are big bugs that affect everybody.
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:34.980]   Like you download this beta and you instantly say this beta fries like the LTE radio or
[01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:37.980]   it does this thing and it happens to everybody and that's bad.
[01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:41.900]   But all these devices are so complicated and everyone has such unique setups and such unique
[01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:48.740]   software combinations and setting toggles that you know is that it's affecting 1% or 2%
[01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:51.460]   of people still hundreds of thousands of people.
[01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:55.220]   So like I was having a problem with PDK on the Mac just always using tons and tons of
[01:27:55.220 --> 01:27:58.100]   resources a plug in manager and I had to kill it every day.
[01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:01.500]   But like I didn't find almost anyone else complaining about it and this fixed that for
[01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:02.500]   me.
[01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:03.500]   So you had that problem.
[01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:07.140]   But like you probably had some other problem and like so me installing it and saying that
[01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:08.540]   may mean nothing to you.
[01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:09.740]   Laurie, like Laurie, how complex.
[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:13.980]   Now that you have the new 2020 iMac, I know you and Renee both.
[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:17.820]   You'll be glad to know that the supplemental update fixed a problem that could cause the
[01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:22.140]   iMac to appear washed out after waking up from sleep.
[01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:25.180]   Did it fix the desire to touch the nano coating?
[01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:26.180]   Did it fix Laurie?
[01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:28.420]   Laurie, don't touch it.
[01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:30.020]   Nope, it didn't fix that.
[01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:31.020]   Did you touch it?
[01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:32.020]   You touched it.
[01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:33.020]   Oh yeah.
[01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:34.020]   Yeah.
[01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:37.140]   The thing that worries me about the nano coating is not touching it.
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:41.540]   It's that like as you were saying this like usually like if I'm spending 12 hours in front
[01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:45.780]   of in front of my desk, I am probably having a beverage or I might be having a snack and
[01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:48.780]   sometimes I'm talking and I'm spitting as I go.
[01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:53.420]   And is there going to be like a little little fleck of my sandwich that is going to remind
[01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:56.420]   me that three years later that oh yeah, that's right.
[01:28:56.420 --> 01:29:01.020]   I was having that Skype call Skype call with a friend of mine and we were having nachos
[01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:02.780]   and yeah, now I can't get that.
[01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:06.860]   So Laurie, when you touched it, what did it feel like?
[01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:11.860]   So it it's so funny that we're even having to talk about this but because we talk about
[01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:15.260]   it by the way, I should explain for those just tuning in.
[01:29:15.260 --> 01:29:21.180]   We're talking about the nano coating, the the matte coating on the new iMac because that's
[01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:22.940]   pretty loaded question actually.
[01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:23.940]   Yeah.
[01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:24.940]   Yeah.
[01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:29.580]   Laurie, when you touched it, what did it feel like?
[01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:37.380]   Well, since the nano texture screen, it's etched glass instead of a coating that's diffusing
[01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:38.380]   light.
[01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:42.860]   You know, you hear that description and when they show you like the super zoomed in thing
[01:29:42.860 --> 01:29:47.360]   and you see all these little divots in it, you're like, oh, yeah, it's going to feel
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:48.360]   textured.
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:52.660]   Yeah, it feels like a matte screen.
[01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:56.100]   It feels so you do feel a texture doesn't feel shiny.
[01:29:56.100 --> 01:30:01.140]   It definitely feels a texture compared to an iMac that that does not have a Mac.
[01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:03.180]   I think does not have an any texture.
[01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:06.820]   Laurie, you should make a YouTube video.
[01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:08.260]   You should have it on the pairing.
[01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:09.860]   You should have them side by side.
[01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:11.860]   You've got them both touch one.
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:13.940]   Yeah, you could do a whole thing.
[01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:15.300]   Be great music on them.
[01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:18.780]   See if you could scratch reaction video.
[01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:21.980]   It was really bad.
[01:30:21.980 --> 01:30:26.100]   One of my least favorite parts of modern journal, I can't even call it journalism, but like
[01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:30.340]   so when Apple explains this, it's like the difference between a traditional matte display
[01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:34.780]   as a coating on it and what it does is diffuse light, but it prevent it reduces a lot of
[01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:36.300]   the contrast as well.
[01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:40.580]   And nano texture does is disrupt the light because it doesn't have a clean surface to
[01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:46.300]   refact off and it does cause some loss of contrast, but not as much.
[01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:49.660]   And immediately these videos and these articles pop up saying there's less contrast than on
[01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:52.060]   a non-annogatured text or display.
[01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:53.620]   And you're like, yes, yes.
[01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:54.620]   There has to be.
[01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:55.620]   Good behavior.
[01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:56.620]   That has to.
[01:30:56.620 --> 01:30:57.620]   Yeah, just not as much.
[01:30:57.620 --> 01:30:58.620]   You're just you're defusing the light.
[01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:01.500]   So I mean, please stop speaking of updates.
[01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:04.540]   You can also get developer betas.
[01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:05.780]   I think we must be getting close.
[01:31:05.780 --> 01:31:13.020]   We're now in the fifth round of developer updates for iOS 14, iPad, OS 14, TV, OS 14 and watch
[01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:14.020]   OS.
[01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:15.940]   Close means September or waiting for the iPhone in October.
[01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:16.940]   Like we get a question.
[01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:19.980]   I mean, it feels like it could be September, right?
[01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:24.500]   You told me once Renee that the fifth update is usually the last.
[01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:25.500]   So I would prefer it.
[01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:29.180]   Like Lori and I were talking about this earlier and and you know, the more they spread out
[01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:32.020]   the stuff that we have to review, the better it is for us.
[01:31:32.020 --> 01:31:35.700]   But you know, they might feel like they can't release this until they really they can't
[01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:39.180]   release the final version until they released a new phone because people from websites will
[01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:41.660]   go in and find out all these secrets about the new phone.
[01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:43.460]   Oh, it's not that off.
[01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:47.700]   So maybe the new phone gets maybe the new phone gets 14.1 and not 14.0.
[01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:49.940]   So it's like it just or it's okay.
[01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:57.060]   Or maybe or maybe they have an extra month to work on it and there is no need for 14.01
[01:31:57.060 --> 01:32:01.860]   anymore because there's always been that hold, maybe hold back for a couple of weeks,
[01:32:01.860 --> 01:32:04.380]   see if there's something that's incompatible.
[01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:05.620]   But who knows?
[01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:11.660]   Or I would be just frankly, knowing how hard and all hands on deck developer crushes at
[01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:15.900]   Apple, I would be just as pleased if they retain their original deadlines and simply
[01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:19.020]   said, okay, for three weeks, it's casual Fridays.
[01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:20.020]   Come in if you want.
[01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:24.740]   Don't come in if you don't want because it's hard to know what they have to do with another
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:28.260]   month in the in the development timeline.
[01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:29.260]   Got the emoji ready.
[01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:30.260]   That's what we're all waiting for.
[01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:32.180]   It said the point one updates the emoji update.
[01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:33.940]   That's when everybody upgrades.
[01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:37.340]   It's the most important update of the year.
[01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:39.620]   Yeah, I'm on the public beta.
[01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:44.020]   So I won't see an update till next week or the week after is that usually what it is
[01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:45.180]   about a week later.
[01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:46.780]   Usually every year.
[01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:47.780]   Yeah, something like that.
[01:32:47.780 --> 01:32:48.780]   It's not a week later.
[01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:51.420]   I think now I think they just wait longer to release the public beta and then it's like
[01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:56.020]   to if nothing goes wrong on the developers they experiment on the public gets it two
[01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:58.220]   days later.
[01:32:58.220 --> 01:33:01.780]   This has not happened to me but gives moto article by Andrew Lachevsky.
[01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:08.900]   Hey, Apple watch, please don't send me heart stopping notifications that I wasn't exposed
[01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:09.900]   to COVID.
[01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:11.500]   Have you been getting this?
[01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:12.500]   I haven't.
[01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:14.940]   I think it all depends on.
[01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:16.860]   Yeah, I have the Canadian.
[01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:17.860]   I have the Canadian.
[01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:19.180]   Where you live.
[01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:26.060]   This is this is the Canadian government's voluntary COVID alert mobile app for iOS and
[01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:27.060]   Android.
[01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:28.620]   You're not in Ontario.
[01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:29.620]   You're in Quebec.
[01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:30.620]   You have it.
[01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:31.620]   No, but it's the same app.
[01:33:31.620 --> 01:33:35.220]   Yeah, it's the same app that says no exposure, but you don't get an alert.
[01:33:35.220 --> 01:33:37.300]   But Apple doesn't control the push notifications.
[01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:39.860]   Apple can the developer gets to set push notifications.
[01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:41.380]   So that's interesting.
[01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:44.100]   Is that based on the Apple Google API?
[01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:45.100]   Yep.
[01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:47.140]   Oh, so they did do it.
[01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:52.140]   Yeah, see, oh, I have all these options that maybe I can set before I write articles
[01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:53.140]   about it.
[01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:54.140]   Get a one time key.
[01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:55.140]   How it works.
[01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:56.140]   How it protects your privacy change.
[01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:58.660]   When did you get this?
[01:33:58.660 --> 01:34:01.340]   So I got it late only because it didn't work on the beta at first.
[01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:05.300]   The first few betas didn't have the COVID API is active and then Apple and activated
[01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:07.060]   them two weeks ago.
[01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:09.260]   But I think the app's been out for a month already.
[01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:11.260]   Nice.
[01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:20.060]   Apple TV plus adding a new bundle 50% off if you get the CBS all access and Showtime bundle.
[01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:21.060]   That's good.
[01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:28.660]   Dying it will go from $9.99 a month each to just $9.99 total.
[01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:35.580]   Actually it's $10.99 for Showtime, $9.99 for CBS all access.
[01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:37.780]   No cheers, no thrills.
[01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:39.580]   No, I'm just the Apple one bundle.
[01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:40.580]   I'm so confused.
[01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:41.580]   It's a different bundle.
[01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:42.580]   It's another bundle.
[01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:43.580]   And Apple TV is--
[01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:50.380]   I'm on board with this one because there's a lot of CBS all access shows that I've been
[01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:55.300]   wanting to watch but I didn't want to pull the trigger on it because it's another subscription.
[01:34:55.300 --> 01:34:59.060]   And so here's a bundle and my brain goes, oh look at this deal.
[01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:02.340]   So I will probably-- I haven't yet but I'll probably get this bundle.
[01:35:02.340 --> 01:35:03.900]   That's where Picard is, right?
[01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:07.140]   The CBS all access and discover.
[01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:10.300]   I got it and then watched all the-- we don't get the Star Trek in it because they separately
[01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:13.620]   licensed-- CBS separately licensed Star Trek to Bell and Canada.
[01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:16.220]   So our CBS all access does not include Star Trek.
[01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:17.860]   We have to get its crave for that.
[01:35:17.860 --> 01:35:21.100]   But I just watched all the NCIS and CS.
[01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:25.460]   Anything with initials I spent most of the summer watching.
[01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:33.140]   Apple TV plus announcing a new show, a reality music competition hosted by Reese Witherspoon
[01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:42.340]   called My Kind of Country that will focus on finding extraordinary country music talent.
[01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:48.060]   This is Apple's first music competition show, of course they're very popular on regular
[01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:50.420]   network television.
[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:57.380]   Hello Sunshine, which is I guess her production company partnering with Apple TV to do this.
[01:35:57.380 --> 01:36:00.500]   I didn't realize she was all in on the country.
[01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:06.300]   Apple's really embracing the country music fans.
[01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:07.300]   Apple--
[01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:10.060]   >> They have-- it's supposed to come.
[01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:13.980]   >> Let's see, Apple, this is a really weird story but I kind of like it.
[01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:21.740]   Reportedly made a secret iPod for the US government that had a built in Geiger counter.
[01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:22.740]   And this--
[01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:23.740]   >> Maybe.
[01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:26.940]   >> This comes from a former Apple software engineer, David Shayer.
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:30.820]   It actually comes from tidbits so I should really show the tidbits.
[01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:35.980]   The case of the top secret iPod, it was a great day in late 2005.
[01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:39.420]   >> It makes you want to know like if anything you see out on the street is real.
[01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:43.460]   Maybe they're walking on the fake umbrellas and fake briefcases and fake iPods and what
[01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:45.660]   is even real?
[01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:50.340]   >> Without knocking the director of iPod software, my boss is boss abruptly entered and closed
[01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:51.660]   the door behind him.
[01:36:51.660 --> 01:36:53.300]   He cut to the chase.
[01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:55.700]   >> I have a special assignment for you.
[01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:57.580]   Your boss doesn't know about it.
[01:36:57.580 --> 01:37:03.700]   You'll help two engineers from the US Department of Energy build a special iPod, Rick.
[01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:05.340]   Report only to me.
[01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:09.980]   I don't think he talked like that, but the next day the receptionist called me to tell
[01:37:09.980 --> 01:37:12.540]   me the two men were waiting in the lobby.
[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:18.620]   I went downstairs to meet Paul and Matthew.
[01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:22.700]   They were engineers who had actually built this custom iPod.
[01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:25.300]   They were from the DOE.
[01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:26.500]   They didn't actually work for the DOE.
[01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:31.100]   They worked for Bechtel, but Bechtel was a big defense contractor to the DOE.
[01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:33.100]   And they wanted to put--
[01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:37.500]   They wanted the iPod to look completely normal but have a Geiger counter in it.
[01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:40.620]   >> No, they're speculating it was a Geiger counter.
[01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:41.620]   They're just--
[01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:43.460]   >> They say what it is.
[01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:49.900]   >> The person who wrote it was obviously not shown exactly what they were doing.
[01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:54.580]   They were just here to offer developer support to these two people who had to basically get
[01:37:54.580 --> 01:37:59.820]   -- learn how to build an entire binary of the entire iPod software so they can add software.
[01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:04.900]   The only things that he was aware of is that number one, they were putting extra hardware
[01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:05.900]   into it.
[01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:11.580]   Number two, that the nature of what they wanted to modify this iPod to do is to secretly be
[01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:19.900]   able to collect readings/data and save that data onto the hard drive in a way that does
[01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:24.100]   not make the iPod look like anything other than a normal iPod.
[01:38:24.100 --> 01:38:25.100]   >> No.
[01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:26.100]   >> And he talks about--
[01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:27.100]   >> So it wouldn't be a bug.
[01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:28.300]   It wouldn't be like listening device.
[01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:33.420]   It would be something that you-- the person carrying it would know that it could do something
[01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:36.820]   because he has to return it to get the readings off of it.
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:38.100]   So that would make sense.
[01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:44.140]   Maybe a nuclear inspector looking-- maybe somebody visiting North Korea just checking
[01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:46.700]   around seeing what he sees.
[01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:52.180]   >> He was speculating that it was a Geiger counter type of device because they were working
[01:38:52.180 --> 01:38:54.060]   on a contract with the Department of Energy.
[01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:56.380]   That is one of the things that they do.
[01:38:56.380 --> 01:39:00.860]   One of the talk back on that article was from people who were kind of in that industry who
[01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:05.580]   saying that they're probably less-- they're probably simpler ways to achieve the same
[01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:08.740]   result but they aren't mentioning what authority they're doing it on.
[01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:11.660]   All we know is that it was definitely a secret.
[01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:15.540]   They were talking about how-- they were asking-- they would do things like ask them like how
[01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:21.660]   can I store data on this device in such a way that it wouldn't interfere with the device
[01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:23.820]   and no one would be able to see the data.
[01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:27.300]   He said, "Well, why don't you create a new partition that way even iTunes wouldn't see
[01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:28.460]   this extra partition.
[01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:30.420]   It would just be reading as a regular iPad."
[01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:31.420]   "Oh, that's great.
[01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:32.420]   That's wonderful."
[01:39:32.420 --> 01:39:36.940]   And they weren't-- it was a contract that lasted a couple months and then they left
[01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:38.940]   and then they didn't come back again.
[01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:42.220]   Again, the trigger for this apparently was there.
[01:39:42.220 --> 01:39:45.360]   The other thing that they're asking about is that we need to be able to activate, to
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:50.820]   turn on the data collection and recording and they found-- if they helped them find like
[01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:53.820]   some sort of like whatever the deepest sub-menu of the settings--
[01:39:53.820 --> 01:40:03.740]   If you listen to Rick Astley never going to give you up, it will type in start recording.
[01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:07.540]   Type in 9.9s, take the integral and then do a square root.
[01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:10.860]   I think it's a great-- it's just a great story.
[01:40:10.860 --> 01:40:15.300]   But if you think about it, yeah, if you're going into some facility and you can't carry
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:20.740]   a Geiger counter or some other measuring device but you could reasonably carry an iPod and
[01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:24.340]   they might look at it, spin the wheel a little bit, see what your musical taste is.
[01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:28.740]   But if it looks like a normal iPod, certainly Apple wouldn't build a Geiger counter into
[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:29.740]   their iPod.
[01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:32.060]   You got three, you two, album two, huh?
[01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:35.620]   I think that's the one that either-- how you stuff it.
[01:40:35.620 --> 01:40:37.620]   There's lots of mystery things.
[01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:42.020]   He's also mentioning that the model of iPod that they were using was one where it was
[01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:45.780]   very easy to take it apart and put it together again without leaving any tooling marks.
[01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:51.180]   It was also the last model of iPod where the operating system software was not signed by
[01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:52.180]   Apple.
[01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:56.540]   So apparently that would be a very, very easy thing for them to do as opposed to the next
[01:40:56.540 --> 01:40:58.140]   generation of Apple.
[01:40:58.140 --> 01:41:02.380]   The whole thing is very interesting because it's like I always say, the best stories always
[01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:07.700]   come from people who not only are no longer working for the company but now they're like
[01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:13.060]   10 years out and now they're thinking that, well, no secret that I have now is going to
[01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:15.420]   be of any good-- of any use to anybody.
[01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:17.860]   So it's probably OK for me to start talking.
[01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:24.340]   If you thought the untitled Goose game couldn't get any better, you'll be wrong.
[01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:31.820]   September 23rd, according to GameSpot, untitled Goose game gets two player co-op multiplayer
[01:41:31.820 --> 01:41:33.820]   mode.
[01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:36.740]   It's a play through the whole game with a friend.
[01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:43.620]   One of you plays the Goose, one of you plays the other Goose, and you can carry each other
[01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:46.300]   around in a Goose box.
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:51.580]   I want to see cable sasser and Stephen Frank just live streaming their adventures in this
[01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:55.460]   game.
[01:41:55.460 --> 01:42:01.380]   The question is, as a two player game, do you get to annoy the other player or is it
[01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:03.140]   about doubling up on the humans?
[01:42:03.140 --> 01:42:04.860]   I think it's ganging up.
[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:10.420]   So that's why otherwise why we have the box so you could sneak it into the farmer's garden
[01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:18.820]   without him knowing two horrible keys, local multiplayer coming to all platforms of the
[01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:21.420]   untitled Goose game.
[01:42:21.420 --> 01:42:22.420]   And if you don't have any--
[01:42:22.420 --> 01:42:23.420]   Have a challenge, Leo and Andy.
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:25.020]   Yeah, wouldn't it be fun?
[01:42:25.020 --> 01:42:26.020]   Yes.
[01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:29.820]   I hope there's like an in-app purchase for like a little horse costume, like for the one
[01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:31.620]   duck that'll front the other is the bat.
[01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:32.620]   I would totally be in home.
[01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:34.020]   Oh, I would totally buy that.
[01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:36.020]   That would be so cool.
[01:42:36.020 --> 01:42:39.260]   Lisa and I have been looking for some game we could play together.
[01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:41.500]   I think it'll be untitled Goose game.
[01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:42.500]   Yes.
[01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:44.420]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:49.660]   And then when we come back, your picks of the week, Renee Richie and the Enoco Lori
[01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:51.820]   Gill.
[01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:58.340]   And I think this week, given that you haven't spent any of my money recently, Lori, I'm
[01:42:58.340 --> 01:43:02.820]   going to let you start before these guys get to my wallet.
[01:43:02.820 --> 01:43:04.780]   What do you got?
[01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:06.460]   Oh, we're doing this right now.
[01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:08.100]   Yeah, let's do it right now.
[01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:09.100]   All right.
[01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:13.940]   So my pick of the week is actually from Pad and Quill.
[01:43:13.940 --> 01:43:16.620]   I, by the way, I love Pad and Quill.
[01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:21.060]   I bought my iPhone leather iPhone wallet case from Pad and Quill.
[01:43:21.060 --> 01:43:22.460]   And I really like it.
[01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:23.460]   Gorgeous cases.
[01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:24.780]   Yeah, that is one of my favorites.
[01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:26.060]   That's the Belafina, right?
[01:43:26.060 --> 01:43:27.060]   Yep.
[01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:28.060]   And it's got a little, you can get colored.
[01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:30.460]   I get all the colors of the straps.
[01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:31.460]   Yeah.
[01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:32.460]   Yep.
[01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:35.460]   And it's aging as I would expect, aging beautifully because it's beautiful leather and all that.
[01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:36.700]   Because it has a good leather.
[01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:37.700]   Yep, it's true.
[01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:38.700]   Well, this one isn't leather.
[01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:42.620]   This is actually their, it kind of looks like a journal notebook.
[01:43:42.620 --> 01:43:47.700]   It's called the Cupertina or Cupertina, depending on how you want to pronounce it.
[01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:50.940]   They have a case for your case.
[01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:54.860]   Oh, so I get to keep my magic keyboard.
[01:43:54.860 --> 01:43:55.860]   Yes.
[01:43:55.860 --> 01:44:00.260]   So you can have, you know, a nice protective covering that also makes it kind of look like
[01:44:00.260 --> 01:44:03.540]   it's just a book on your shelf if you're trying to hide it, which is like kind of one of the
[01:44:03.540 --> 01:44:05.460]   fun things about it.
[01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:10.940]   And it works with the magic keyboard and your iPad Pro.
[01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:12.380]   It's magnetic now.
[01:44:12.380 --> 01:44:20.220]   So Leo, I know that you know that most of their products in the past have used some version
[01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:25.180]   of a sticky adhering thing like an M3 strip or something like that.
[01:44:25.180 --> 01:44:29.580]   So they are moving on to magnetic now, which I'm very excited about.
[01:44:29.580 --> 01:44:36.180]   I actually have the Cupertina that does not include the support for the magic keyboard.
[01:44:36.180 --> 01:44:39.700]   So it's the thinner one, the no keyboard version.
[01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:45.300]   And I love that it's magnetic instead of sticky because it's much easier to pull off.
[01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:49.380]   The great thing about those sticky strips is that they can pull off, but you know, you
[01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:53.260]   kind of have to yank on it a little bit and take some minute being magnetic just like,
[01:44:53.260 --> 01:44:57.980]   oop, you just whip it right off and you know, stick it on another case or put it back in.
[01:44:57.980 --> 01:44:59.380]   So it's magnetic.
[01:44:59.380 --> 01:45:00.900]   It works with the magic keyboard.
[01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:05.660]   It's relatively inexpensive and it's made by a great quality company that makes fantastic
[01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:06.660]   products.
[01:45:06.660 --> 01:45:08.860]   And I think you may have just spent your money.
[01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:10.860]   Yeah, I think you got me.
[01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:13.700]   I wish they had the only ever for the 11.
[01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:16.180]   No, they do have it for the 12.9.
[01:45:16.180 --> 01:45:21.900]   It's you actually have to go to, I think you would go to their iPad accessories.
[01:45:21.900 --> 01:45:23.420]   I just follow their link.
[01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:24.420]   Your link rather.
[01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:31.220]   Yeah, so iPad Pro leather cases, iPad Pro cases and accessories.
[01:45:31.220 --> 01:45:32.220]   All right.
[01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:33.580]   Yeah, cause this is nice.
[01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:37.020]   I love it that it kind of looks like a book.
[01:45:37.020 --> 01:45:38.020]   There it is.
[01:45:38.020 --> 01:45:45.380]   Yeah, for the iPad 12.9, 109 bucks, unless you want a pocket, you can get an internal pocket
[01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:46.380]   for $10.
[01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:48.500]   Which is a nice little thing to have a little pocket in there.
[01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:50.060]   I like the gray linen.
[01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:51.220]   I like the charcoal.
[01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:52.740]   I can't decide.
[01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:55.340]   Oh well, nice.
[01:45:55.340 --> 01:46:00.100]   You know what I like about it is I always feel like the keyboard isn't really a case.
[01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:01.300]   And I don't, I'm worried about it.
[01:46:01.300 --> 01:46:02.300]   It's getting mine started getting.
[01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:03.740]   You want to protect that?
[01:46:03.740 --> 01:46:04.740]   Yes.
[01:46:04.740 --> 01:46:07.540]   Yeah, I spent 350 bucks on it.
[01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:08.540]   Yeah.
[01:46:08.540 --> 01:46:09.540]   Yeah.
[01:46:09.540 --> 01:46:14.860]   I want to protect the case that protects the case.
[01:46:14.860 --> 01:46:17.140]   That's pad and quill.com.
[01:46:17.140 --> 01:46:19.220]   Andy and I go pick of the week.
[01:46:19.220 --> 01:46:23.980]   I'm calling an audible and say that because we were talking about this lovely Star Wars
[01:46:23.980 --> 01:46:28.460]   jacket, there are a bunch of different like licensed and unlicensed Etsy creators that make
[01:46:28.460 --> 01:46:33.100]   really, really great reproductions of like the really good jackets you see like in the
[01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:34.100]   movies.
[01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:40.620]   There is a site called for the for the Han Solo Force Awakens jacket.
[01:46:40.620 --> 01:46:42.940]   You can go to fjackets.com.
[01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:47.660]   They make a really, really good version of that made out of like real leather.
[01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:49.780]   It's not terribly spendy.
[01:46:49.780 --> 01:46:53.140]   It's like 189 I think.
[01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:55.180]   But it's available in like all kinds of different sizes.
[01:46:55.180 --> 01:46:56.540]   It allows you, it's fully lined.
[01:46:56.540 --> 01:46:58.380]   It's not, it's not a costume piece.
[01:46:58.380 --> 01:47:02.700]   It's designed to be like an actual wearable article of clothing.
[01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:07.980]   Other sites like there's one site that I found on this thing is it's a Etsy store.
[01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:08.980]   Yeah.
[01:47:08.980 --> 01:47:11.220]   It's a Etsy store called Lucas jacket designs.
[01:47:11.220 --> 01:47:12.820]   Actually, I think they had a call.
[01:47:12.820 --> 01:47:16.300]   They had a nickname at Luca jackets designs.
[01:47:16.300 --> 01:47:19.180]   It makes knockoffs, knockoffs of newcomers.
[01:47:19.180 --> 01:47:21.500]   I didn't direct Star Wars.
[01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:22.900]   Yeah, I know that.
[01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:24.660]   It was saved in editing.
[01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:25.660]   Yeah.
[01:47:25.660 --> 01:47:31.300]   There, but not, but not only like Star Wars, you can get like you can get Spiderman jackets.
[01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:38.900]   You can get jackets from from Riverdale from you get there is a there is a there is a couple
[01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:43.740]   of jackets that like kind of like want and I'm trying to tell myself that don't spend
[01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:51.460]   $190 on impulse, but the the bat the purple and yellow bat girls leather jacket from
[01:47:51.460 --> 01:47:56.100]   like the reboot when she became like sort of a hipster in the the Brooklyn version of
[01:47:56.100 --> 01:47:57.700]   Gotham City.
[01:47:57.700 --> 01:48:00.300]   That's $199.
[01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:02.500]   The it's really, really nice stuff.
[01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:06.980]   And I've seen some of these jackets like in the wild, particularly a comic con.
[01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:10.740]   And the great thing is that you can be a foot away from them and they don't they don't
[01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:14.700]   look like they are like prop jackets or that they're fandom jackets.
[01:48:14.700 --> 01:48:18.340]   It looks like you went into a store bought something that was made to be worn.
[01:48:18.340 --> 01:48:24.740]   A friend of mine, my best friend had bought from the from the Lucasfilm fan club when
[01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:29.820]   we were kids bought like the fan club version of the Luke Skywalker, best been cloud city
[01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:32.020]   jacket from Empire Strikes Back.
[01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:36.260]   And I made fun of them for it because when he got it, it was just like polyester and was
[01:48:36.260 --> 01:48:42.580]   online, it didn't have working pockets, but he did wear it for like three three of autumns
[01:48:42.580 --> 01:48:44.220]   and winters and it held up.
[01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:49.260]   But these are actually more practical like daily wear jackets and they seem silly until
[01:48:49.260 --> 01:48:53.020]   they become your daily wear and then you kind of don't want to be without them.
[01:48:53.020 --> 01:48:54.020]   Is it real leather?
[01:48:54.020 --> 01:48:56.780]   I mean, is this some of them are some of them are real leather.
[01:48:56.780 --> 01:48:58.660]   You have to find out you have to you have to look carefully.
[01:48:58.660 --> 01:49:00.660]   Some of them are pleather.
[01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:05.620]   I'm not going to say vegan leather because vegan leather is just plastic, which is fine,
[01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:08.500]   which is fine if you don't want to use leather, just make sure that you realize that it's
[01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:09.500]   not.
[01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:13.060]   Oh, miraculously, they found something that wears exactly like leather, but is actually
[01:49:13.060 --> 01:49:14.060]   vegan.
[01:49:14.060 --> 01:49:16.700]   No, it is still going to be like a form of vinyl.
[01:49:16.700 --> 01:49:22.780]   So you're going to sweat like a like a dog and an unventilated basement when you're wearing
[01:49:22.780 --> 01:49:23.780]   it.
[01:49:23.780 --> 01:49:25.980]   But some of them have real leather, some of them are some of these are beautiful like this
[01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:28.020]   starlord trench jacket.
[01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:34.220]   Yeah, that's that's that's that's one of the things I love about like modern modern like
[01:49:34.220 --> 01:49:36.340]   comic book and science fiction movies.
[01:49:36.340 --> 01:49:40.780]   The wardrobe is not as they're not trying to make like a they're not going to give you
[01:49:40.780 --> 01:49:45.660]   the version of the Wolverine jacket that they made for the comic book where it's garish
[01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:47.020]   and colorful and unwearable.
[01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:51.140]   They will make a version of it for the movie that looks like an actual practical wear of
[01:49:51.140 --> 01:49:52.140]   light.
[01:49:52.140 --> 01:49:56.060]   I mean, if you look closely, there is like sort of an X sort of motif and how it's stitched.
[01:49:56.060 --> 01:50:00.500]   And a lot of the stuff is like that you can you can you can wear you can absolutely wear
[01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:05.340]   the Han Solo jacket because you think it's a very you you admired it as a middle age
[01:50:05.340 --> 01:50:06.340]   person.
[01:50:06.340 --> 01:50:08.220]   I said, wow, he's he's older.
[01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:09.420]   He's like 30 years older than I am.
[01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:11.340]   And he looks really, really good in that leather jacket.
[01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:14.700]   Maybe I should buy one and you could actually buy that and wear it and nobody will know
[01:50:14.700 --> 01:50:18.900]   that you're wearing a nerd sort of replica prop sort of jacket.
[01:50:18.900 --> 01:50:22.500]   This is this is why I like about the way that they these people on these Etsy shops.
[01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:26.420]   They do they try to make them they do they make whatever changes they have to make in
[01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:28.580]   order to make them found your jacket, Lori.
[01:50:28.580 --> 01:50:31.820]   Yeah, baby.
[01:50:31.820 --> 01:50:33.500]   This looks good.
[01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:43.780]   Yeah, you should have a little little flap there on your shoulder.
[01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:48.140]   So you could just, you know, in case they want to just flip it up there.
[01:50:48.140 --> 01:50:54.460]   Wow, look at the Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong bomber jacket.
[01:50:54.460 --> 01:50:55.460]   This is amazing.
[01:50:55.460 --> 01:50:57.060]   They have a huge amount.
[01:50:57.060 --> 01:50:58.580]   This must be like a company.
[01:50:58.580 --> 01:51:00.980]   This is not some guy working out of his garage.
[01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:06.100]   Yeah, but but also even but I should say that these are just couple that I singled out there.
[01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:08.140]   Even the people who are working on their garage.
[01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:13.300]   The thing is like there are these there are these clothing makers that they're fans.
[01:51:13.300 --> 01:51:19.420]   They are making replicas and all they do is make the is make the the best the best the
[01:51:19.420 --> 01:51:21.060]   best in cloud city jacket.
[01:51:21.060 --> 01:51:25.460]   And they've been researching it for like 20 years and every two or three years they change
[01:51:25.460 --> 01:51:26.460]   their patterning.
[01:51:26.460 --> 01:51:30.580]   So oftentimes when you do have this one person in their garage or in their sewing room, you
[01:51:30.580 --> 01:51:35.780]   will get this most incredible piece of tailored clothing you have ever seen in your life.
[01:51:35.780 --> 01:51:39.820]   That is far beyond like what you would ever find in a store commercially made because
[01:51:39.820 --> 01:51:44.900]   they're each individually handmade and that this person wanted to get the best the Boba
[01:51:44.900 --> 01:51:47.340]   Fett jacket, the best Han Solo jacket.
[01:51:47.340 --> 01:51:50.660]   And that's all they ever focused on because they're making one for themselves and they
[01:51:50.660 --> 01:51:54.780]   realize that if they're going to be able to like fund this for themselves, they're going
[01:51:54.780 --> 01:51:55.780]   to have to be there.
[01:51:55.780 --> 01:51:58.620]   Maybe they'll make seven or eight instead of just one and therefore they'll get their
[01:51:58.620 --> 01:52:02.260]   jacket for free or at least they'll only lose $80 on it.
[01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:03.260]   Yeah.
[01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:07.940]   And when you go to a comic con, you don't want to be wearing something that's not absolutely
[01:52:07.940 --> 01:52:08.940]   authentic.
[01:52:08.940 --> 01:52:09.940]   Look at that.
[01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:11.380]   This is kind of a neat jacket.
[01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:15.900]   I don't know what I don't know what I guess is I don't know who junk red is in Overwatch,
[01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:18.380]   but I'll I'll wear it.
[01:52:18.380 --> 01:52:19.380]   That sounds good.
[01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:20.380]   You do now.
[01:52:20.380 --> 01:52:21.380]   I do now man.
[01:52:21.380 --> 01:52:24.500]   Renee Richie pick of the week.
[01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:30.540]   So first I have just a quick opening statement Leo and that is Facebook has just announced
[01:52:30.540 --> 01:52:36.060]   that they're going to start requiring Facebook logins to use Oculus on new devices.
[01:52:36.060 --> 01:52:41.020]   Previously, when you bought Oculus, you had the choice not to use Facebook, but to use
[01:52:41.020 --> 01:52:45.340]   an Oculus login and apparently going forward, that would no longer be the case.
[01:52:45.340 --> 01:52:51.220]   So like you said, in my best game of thrones, exhausted and annoyed expression, just shame,
[01:52:51.220 --> 01:52:52.780]   shame, shame, shame.
[01:52:52.780 --> 01:52:55.100]   Can you not?
[01:52:55.100 --> 01:52:56.100]   I've had enough of 2020.
[01:52:56.100 --> 01:52:58.060]   Can you not?
[01:52:58.060 --> 01:53:01.260]   So yeah, let's just put a lot of pressure on them and hope they see the light that not
[01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:03.900]   everyone wants an Oculus once Facebook.
[01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:04.900]   There.
[01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:06.780]   Disappointing.
[01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:09.900]   My second thing is I just wanted to give a shout out because I think it's super important
[01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:10.900]   right now.
[01:53:10.900 --> 01:53:15.140]   And a lot of people don't realize this as crazy it is for those of us inside the business
[01:53:15.140 --> 01:53:19.020]   that there's not just genius bars and Apple stores, but there's Apple care.
[01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:23.220]   And I've been contacted a couple times recently, but just someone on Twitter reached out to
[01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:26.540]   me, actually someone on Discord reached out to me and let me know like just all the work
[01:53:26.540 --> 01:53:28.300]   that Apple care is doing right now.
[01:53:28.300 --> 01:53:32.460]   If you have a problem with your device, it's not Apple care plus, it's not the insurance
[01:53:32.460 --> 01:53:33.460]   part.
[01:53:33.460 --> 01:53:38.100]   It's the online and on the phone and all the other support people who because the stores
[01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:42.700]   aren't active right now, at least many people don't have access to an Apple store or a genius
[01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:46.700]   bar, but you can go to the Apple care page at Apple.
[01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:51.580]   There's one for all the different regions that Apple operates in and they have chat support
[01:53:51.580 --> 01:53:56.140]   and they have telephone support, email support, I think as well.
[01:53:56.140 --> 01:53:57.940]   And you can tell them what your problem is.
[01:53:57.940 --> 01:53:59.780]   You can get help with it.
[01:53:59.780 --> 01:54:02.700]   If you're still under warranty, I believe all the help is free.
[01:54:02.700 --> 01:54:05.940]   If not, there might be an incident charge the same way there is when you go to an Apple
[01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:10.580]   store and you're not covered by warranty, but a lot of the people there are super smart.
[01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:15.180]   I know a lot of people just in the industry that we work in who used to for a while work
[01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:19.500]   in Apple care and they are some seriously, seriously smart people.
[01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:22.580]   And the quality always varies from one to one.
[01:54:22.580 --> 01:54:26.180]   You can always hang up and try again if you want to reroll the dice on your Apple care
[01:54:26.180 --> 01:54:27.180]   support person.
[01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:29.660]   But in my experience, they're super knowledgeable.
[01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:31.180]   They really try to help you.
[01:54:31.180 --> 01:54:32.940]   They do start off with the scripts.
[01:54:32.940 --> 01:54:35.460]   They do escalate all that sort of thing.
[01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:40.060]   But if you are stuck at home, if your local store is not open, if you are having problems,
[01:54:40.060 --> 01:54:44.140]   if Google search and asking on Twitter, if all that stuff doesn't help and you just want
[01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:49.820]   to contact Apple, Apple cares, they couldn't make it easier for you to get through to them.
[01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:50.820]   Nice.
[01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:52.300]   So please do.
[01:54:52.300 --> 01:54:53.300]   Please do.
[01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:54.300]   They need the money.
[01:54:54.300 --> 01:54:55.820]   They're suffering.
[01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:59.340]   Help those poor little people working.
[01:54:59.340 --> 01:55:02.540]   It's more the people who have the problems who would normally like it's like we know how
[01:55:02.540 --> 01:55:03.540]   to do that.
[01:55:03.540 --> 01:55:04.740]   Well, we don't always know, but we know how to ask.
[01:55:04.740 --> 01:55:05.740]   Right.
[01:55:05.740 --> 01:55:08.540]   But a lot of people they just are used to going to their local Apple store and talking
[01:55:08.540 --> 01:55:11.620]   to the genius and they don't know what to do right now.
[01:55:11.620 --> 01:55:16.420]   I never buy Apple care, but if you need it, get it.
[01:55:16.420 --> 01:55:18.860]   Well, you get it for free for the first year.
[01:55:18.860 --> 01:55:21.820]   Like almost all jurisdictions, you get a whole year of it and you should make use of
[01:55:21.820 --> 01:55:22.820]   it.
[01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:23.820]   Take advantage of it.
[01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:24.820]   It's part of what you paid for.
[01:55:24.820 --> 01:55:25.820]   Yeah.
[01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:26.820]   I agree.
[01:55:26.820 --> 01:55:27.820]   Yeah.
[01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:30.420]   Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this thrilling and gripping edition of Maca break a
[01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:38.220]   weekly Renee Richie is on YouTube at Renee Richie and it covers all of the stuff, everything
[01:55:38.220 --> 01:55:40.620]   that we talk about here and more.
[01:55:40.620 --> 01:55:41.860]   What are you working on these days?
[01:55:41.860 --> 01:55:43.340]   What's your latest?
[01:55:43.340 --> 01:55:47.780]   I just spent a ridiculous amount of time putting together what was originally like a 40 minute
[01:55:47.780 --> 01:55:48.780]   video.
[01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:51.940]   Now it's down to 25 minutes on everything you need to know about where all the bones,
[01:55:51.940 --> 01:55:54.940]   the bodies are buried between Apple and Epic.
[01:55:54.940 --> 01:55:59.620]   And then I'm going to shift over to talking about fall products tomorrow.
[01:55:59.620 --> 01:56:00.620]   Oh, exciting.
[01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:01.620]   All the videos.
[01:56:01.620 --> 01:56:02.620]   Yeah.
[01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:06.100]   So you're getting out almost one a day now at this point.
[01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:10.100]   I'm slowing down temporarily because I have another project I want to launch and it's going
[01:56:10.100 --> 01:56:11.100]   to take a little bit of time.
[01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:12.460]   So I was doing four videos a week.
[01:56:12.460 --> 01:56:13.460]   Now I'm dropping down.
[01:56:13.460 --> 01:56:15.260]   I think like the news is just crazy.
[01:56:15.260 --> 01:56:17.940]   So I might change that, but I'm going to drop down to three, I think, for the next couple
[01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:18.940]   of weeks.
[01:56:18.940 --> 01:56:23.020]   It's kind of nice when you're doing something like this where you feel prompted to do one.
[01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:24.020]   Like you don't have to.
[01:56:24.020 --> 01:56:25.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:25.020 --> 01:56:26.020]   What am I going to talk about today?
[01:56:26.020 --> 01:56:27.980]   But like I got to talk about this.
[01:56:27.980 --> 01:56:28.980]   I'm super excited.
[01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:29.980]   Yeah.
[01:56:29.980 --> 01:56:30.980]   Yeah.
[01:56:30.980 --> 01:56:31.980]   Like I could not be happy you're making these videos.
[01:56:31.980 --> 01:56:32.980]   Yeah.
[01:56:32.980 --> 01:56:33.980]   Yeah.
[01:56:33.980 --> 01:56:34.980]   Good job.
[01:56:34.980 --> 01:56:35.980]   YouTube.com/Renee Richie.
[01:56:35.980 --> 01:56:39.100]   Andy Naco, when will you be on GBH Boston next?
[01:56:39.100 --> 01:56:42.820]   It looks like I'm going to be on my usual day and time Friday at 1 p.m.
[01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:49.540]   Tune into wgbhnews.org to stream it live or later.
[01:56:49.540 --> 01:56:50.540]   And thank you.
[01:56:50.540 --> 01:56:54.140]   And of course, Lori Gill, managing editor at iMore.
[01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:56.940]   What are you working on today?
[01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:59.940]   A review of an iMac.
[01:56:59.940 --> 01:57:01.300]   You got that new iMac.
[01:57:01.300 --> 01:57:02.300]   That's awesome.
[01:57:02.300 --> 01:57:03.300]   Yeah.
[01:57:03.300 --> 01:57:07.820]   I'll have a review up on the site in the next couple of days with my opening thoughts on
[01:57:07.820 --> 01:57:08.820]   it, for sure.
[01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:09.820]   Do you like it?
[01:57:09.820 --> 01:57:12.860]   You know, I'll play around with it for a while and give you some more info.
[01:57:12.860 --> 01:57:13.860]   Yeah.
[01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:16.020]   It's an iMac, you know, right?
[01:57:16.020 --> 01:57:21.780]   Other than the very major changes, which is the new webcam and the matte screen on this
[01:57:21.780 --> 01:57:26.220]   particular model, you're just seeing speed differences.
[01:57:26.220 --> 01:57:27.780]   It's still just an iMac.
[01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:31.780]   But my favorite iMac is the 27-inch iMac.
[01:57:31.780 --> 01:57:32.780]   My favorite is a Mac.
[01:57:32.780 --> 01:57:33.780]   That's great.
[01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:34.780]   All of these.
[01:57:34.780 --> 01:57:35.780]   I agree.
[01:57:35.780 --> 01:57:36.780]   That's my and desk.
[01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:37.780]   Yeah.
[01:57:37.780 --> 01:57:38.780]   I love my iMac.
[01:57:38.780 --> 01:57:39.780]   Like a woman.
[01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:40.780]   So good.
[01:57:40.780 --> 01:57:41.780]   I love it.
[01:57:41.780 --> 01:57:43.700]   You want to hug it?
[01:57:43.700 --> 01:57:44.700]   Kiss it.
[01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:45.700]   No, it's great.
[01:57:45.700 --> 01:57:47.140]   It's a really nice system.
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:50.100]   Can't wait to get the new Apple Silicon one.
[01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:51.100]   Yeah.
[01:57:51.100 --> 01:57:52.100]   A couple of years.
[01:57:52.100 --> 01:57:54.300]   Thank you, Laurie, Renee, Andy.
[01:57:54.300 --> 01:57:55.300]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:57:55.300 --> 01:57:58.380]   We do Mac break weekly on Tuesdays right after iOS today.
[01:57:58.380 --> 01:58:02.340]   We're at about 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time, 1800 UTC.
[01:58:02.340 --> 01:58:05.220]   If you want to watch live, you can.
[01:58:05.220 --> 01:58:07.540]   All you have to do is go to twit.tv/live.
[01:58:07.540 --> 01:58:09.780]   There's live audio and video there.
[01:58:09.780 --> 01:58:14.300]   You can get on-demand versions of the website, twit.tv/mbw.
[01:58:14.300 --> 01:58:18.620]   Or maybe the best thing to do would be subscribe in your favorite podcatcher.
[01:58:18.620 --> 01:58:23.140]   That way you'll get it the minute it's available of a Tuesday afternoon.
[01:58:23.140 --> 01:58:24.500]   We'll see you next week.
[01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:25.500]   Thanks everybody.
[01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:29.860]   Now time to get back to work because break time is over.
[01:58:29.860 --> 01:58:30.860]   Bye bye.
[01:58:30.860 --> 01:58:35.860]   I'm Jason Howell, host of Tech News Weekly here on twit.tv along with my co-host Micah
[01:58:35.860 --> 01:58:36.860]   Sargent.
[01:58:36.860 --> 01:58:40.660]   Each and every week we talk to people who are making and breaking the tech news.
[01:58:40.660 --> 01:58:43.380]   It could be journalists writing amazing tech stories.
[01:58:43.380 --> 01:58:44.700]   It could be experts.
[01:58:44.700 --> 01:58:49.060]   It could be the sources of the stories themselves, developers.
[01:58:49.060 --> 01:58:50.060]   You name it.
[01:58:50.060 --> 01:58:54.260]   We bring them onto the show and we talk to them about why their story is resonating with
[01:58:54.260 --> 01:58:55.420]   the world.
[01:58:55.420 --> 01:59:00.220]   You can watch and subscribe by going to twit.tv/TNW.
[01:59:00.220 --> 01:59:02.580]   Make sure you do that and you won't miss a single episode.
[01:59:02.580 --> 01:59:03.020]   We'll see you there.
[01:59:03.020 --> 01:59:04.020]   (music)
[01:59:04.020 --> 01:59:11.020]   (music)
[01:59:11.020 --> 01:59:13.600]   (upbeat music)
[01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:15.100]   Thank you.
