[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.320]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. The show that covers Apple and your Apple,
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.160]   all the Apple news, the Apple stories, the pads, the pods, the eyes, these. It's all here.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.400]   With Mr. Andy Inako of the Chicago Sun Times, good to see you Andy. You forgot about the
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.920]   beep boops. We talked about the beep boops too. The beep's the boops and the beeps.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.440]   Exactly. If it's main role is to look pretty and to enhance your life nine times out of 10
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.600]   and make your life a little bit annoying one time of 10, that's technology. It's probably Apple.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.880]   That's what we're going to be. He's also host of Inako's Almanac on 5x5.tv.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.560]   And I heard you as I was coming in talking about your experience with the Nokia phones
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.280]   and the Nokia camera phones. Yeah. Nokia sent me the new tablet and the new
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.520]   tablet today. I want the 2520. This is the Windows Weekly show on Macintosh Break
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.320]   Every Weekly. I'm just saying that. I want that. These 8.1, these Windows 8 tablets,
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.160]   they got some problems because they haven't really matured yet, but man, it's just a beautiful
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.800]   object. Exactly. It's like, no, it's really got my head turned around. I was saying before the show
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.840]   that if Apple decided to do just like a 5c style iPad, that's just we're going to make it out of
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.560]   plastic, but it's going to be a gorgeous and colorful and really, really joyous device.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.840]   Boy, am I on board with that now. It's kind of interesting because
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.800]   this is the only other company besides Microsoft that makes surface RT tablets.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.800]   Everybody else is abandoned. In fact, Microsoft themselves lost almost a billion dollars last
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.440]   year on surface RT. They took a $900 million right now. I have to admit that I still don't really see,
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:25.280]   this is the Windows show, but it's like if they had, if there were a huge library of really good
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.080]   apps for it, I could see RT, but as it is, it's like, oh, that's kind of painful. Maybe they're
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.800]   jump-starting it. Anyway, they'll do okay. They can coast through. They can coast through.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.240]   Also with this, of course, Renee Ritchie from iMore.com. Hello, Renee.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.760]   I'm taking an extra dose of Apple Kool-Aid.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.240]   Ooh.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.320]   By all the Nokia plastic.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.160]   Ooh, Apple Kool-Aid. It's flavorful. It's delicious.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.160]   It's retina, but it's not a low-color gamma. I'm enjoying it anyway.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.280]   Also here from the cult of Macley, Andrew Connie, great to see you.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.920]   Hey, Leo. Thanks. I'm going to take a swig of the rye behind me, Leo.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.680]   Rye is probably more enjoyable.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.680]   Lander has a new book out on Johnny Ive, and I really want to ask you about this.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.320]   How much access to Johnny did you get?
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.800]   A lot. Not a lot, I'm afraid. I was turned down.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.200]   He doesn't give interviews. No, no.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.760]   We've tried for ages to get him on.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.720]   And he's, I don't know if he's shy or smart.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.360]   Smart Apple controls and messaging.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.640]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.920]   You know, but yeah, he's very articulate. He's a great guy to talk to. I told him in the past,
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.400]   I've interviewed him for WIDE, but unfortunately, not for the book. It was declined.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.200]   Well, but you obviously talked to everybody around him.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.240]   Right. Yeah. Much more than anyone else has done.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.000]   Yeah, I cannot wait. Well, we'll talk about that too in a moment.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.800]   So a great team. Good to have you all.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.000]   And not to steal Nokia's thunder, but the same day that Nokia asked that 25/20 tablet,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.040]   Apple announced its iPads, the iPad Air.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.560]   You may remember last week at this time, Apple had still announced the iPad mini with Retina.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.280]   And I spent half the show trying to get one.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.760]   And I did get one, which just came today.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.360]   But I was more interested in getting it before then so we could review it on before you buy,
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.680]   or at least get a first look on before you buy and so forth.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.760]   So I sent Glenn Rubenstein down and he went and got it that day.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.720]   And I don't know if you watch the Gizwiz, but we actually put a chicken out in the road,
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:35.280]   stuffed one to hold the parking space for Glenn and Z and Josh Windish came back from our office.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.440]   And this is the retina. So I've had it for a week now.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.720]   And I love it.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.000]   And in Bay Area, Apple stores, what percentage of the customers there that day were actually
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.920]   like bloggers and tech reviewers?
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.720]   This is probably the... I could either wait a day to end, maybe Apple will send me one,
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.680]   or I can get it right now.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.440]   Yeah, this is it. Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.640]   You know, I was the mini fan.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.840]   I grew to love my mini an awful lot.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.400]   Took traveling and everything.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.400]   But my one lament was the lack of a high resolution display.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.240]   And I have to say, even more than the high res display, the speed is notable.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.680]   The retina had a look pretty... It was basically an iPad 2.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.760]   Yeah, A5 chipset.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.480]   And A5.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.120]   A7 in there.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.400]   Like you said before, it's like notebook class.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.160]   It's ridiculously fast.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.240]   And especially the comparison between the original mini and this one is even more profound
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.680]   than the full size iPad, because that only went one processor generation.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.600]   And this is a full two generation jump.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.480]   Significant.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:42.080]   So I'm thrilled. I mean, this thing is great in every respect.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.000]   Apparently, I didn't know this, but I have I have girl hands.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.520]   So I have small hands. So I couldn't hold the air in one hand, although everybody else here could.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.160]   But I can hold this in one hand.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.280]   And I just, it just, it just feels right to me.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.160]   Not only that, but I think it looks right.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.440]   It's I don't have one yet, but I've spent a couple hours with one.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.280]   And it's I like it so much more than the first one.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.400]   Not just because the speed, but because of the higher density display and iOS 7,
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:18.080]   it looks so much less like a normal sized iPad that's been shrunk down and more like its own
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.720]   thing. It feels like it's well, and also, you know, then they did.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.920]   It's funny because it's still for three.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.600]   And I do believe that for three is the right aspect ratio, at least for iPads.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:35.200]   But because of the smaller bezels, it almost feels like something between a 16 by nine tablet,
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.320]   like the Nexus 7 and a four three tablet, like the iPad.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.360]   It feels like a Samsung phone.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.440]   It's kind of you take that back.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.800]   A big Samsung.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.360]   So yeah, I'm really, I cannot find a negative on this one.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.840]   I think there have been, so I can't believe this every time.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.400]   So there have been some complaints, complaints of screen retention.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.080]   Which I.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.040]   That's the same panel thing as the, as a retina MacBook Pro Leo,
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.680]   exact same issues, small percentage of people.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.560]   You can exchange it.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.480]   The other, it is a retina display.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.000]   It's higher density than the iPad.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.880]   It's 326, the same as the iPhone 5.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.240]   But they kept the same color gamut as the original iPad mini,
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.120]   which means that it's not as wide as the iPad Air.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.520]   So reds, for example, aren't as saturated.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.040]   And that has caused an incredible amount of angry emotions on the internet.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.840]   How dare they?
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.640]   They did two things that are different.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.400]   So this is, we weren't sure.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.640]   Is it a shrunk down iPad Air and iPad Air?
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.080]   It's just a different size.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.080]   But in fact, it's a hundred megahertz slower.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.000]   iPhone 5S slow.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.400]   How slow is that really?
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.280]   And it's, I didn't know the color gamut.
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.080]   What is that?
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.760]   That must have to do with the part, right?
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.320]   Oh my God.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.320]   Chad's hair will look slightly less red.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.880]   Oh, and G on an air.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.120]   Yes.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.960]   Well, that sucks.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.760]   It's the same as the iPad mini.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.760]   It's all Apple did was go to retina.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.520]   They didn't change the actual panel itself.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.600]   And this is upset some people, upset photographers, other people,
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.880]   most people, the vast majority of people will never know the difference.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.080]   They won't even know what there is.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:06.640]   I didn't.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.680]   Unless they put both sides on.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.720]   You just told me, I didn't know.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.440]   The human brain autocorrects so many things that unless it has a comparative frame of reference,
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.640]   it just doesn't notice these things.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.240]   This red looks pretty good to me.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.720]   That's why I think that some of the reviews that I and other people do,
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.560]   I think we have to sort of differentiate the stuff that we can sense
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.120]   by the virtue of the fact that we have access to other devices
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.400]   and stuff that consumers are really going to notice.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:35.040]   I do have the, I still have the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.840]   And if you put them side by side, that display is visibly better than the iPads.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.680]   But God, if you've got to complain about the quality of the screen,
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.040]   you were born somewhere on Krypton.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.720]   And I'm hoping that you're in the good costume and not the zod costume.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.600]   Or you're just looking for reasons to say,
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.080]   "Ah, but I was able to just tell a difference between these two."
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.840]   It is a magnificent display all the way.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.520]   I've certainly not been unhappy.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.560]   In fact, until you said that, I was happy.
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.160]   [laughter]
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.360]   So damn you.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:07.840]   Damn you.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.160]   This was just our ploy to try to get you to like,
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.360]   "Oh, the piece of crap.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.240]   Why don't you send it to me?"
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.440]   And I'll just give it to you.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.040]   I got a brother with an auto-reccant yard.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.200]   We'll send you a video of something being crushed and you can...
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:23.440]   Oh, you know, my test for all things iPad is how Simpson's tapped out looks on it.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.760]   And it looks fabulous.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.720]   You can still lose hundreds of dollars very quickly.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.800]   Homer has never been more fine-grained.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.440]   You notice the 100 megahertz difference, Leo?
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:33.920]   'Cause I don't.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.880]   Some people complain about it.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:35.440]   I don't notice anything.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.120]   People complain about that?
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.640]   It's sluggish, Leo.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.280]   It is sluggish.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.360]   Oh, you such a silly, silly boy's you are.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.720]   No.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.800]   I got no...
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.760]   I got no.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.200]   And I have an air.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.560]   Yep.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.840]   Yeah, I have an air.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.000]   So how about you, Leander?
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Have you been playing with either the air or the mini?
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.920]   Yeah, I got an air.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:58.560]   I didn't get a mini.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.680]   I like, you know, one of the biggest screens, I think.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.160]   Right.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.600]   It's actually fantastic.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.280]   It's really a beautiful device.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:05.840]   It's very light.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.920]   The one thing I liked about the old mini was the battery life.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.360]   The battery life was really good.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.200]   And is the battery life good on the new one too?
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.320]   Is it as good as the old?
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.280]   I don't know.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.960]   It seems the same to me, but obviously I'm completely tone deaf.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.960]   I have a tinny or I can't see the dimmer red.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.960]   I can't see the slower speed.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.880]   Well, when I think I didn't have the charge for a week.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.200]   Renee, Richie, tell me once again,
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.480]   is this a crappy battery life?
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.520]   'Cause it seems all right to me.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.120]   We've gotten to a point now and people will ask me about the LTE.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.240]   People have asked me about the battery life that your use case now
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.320]   is more impact on the battery life than anything that comes out of the factory.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.640]   It's very hard now to quote a number,
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.720]   totally because everybody uses it differently.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.600]   And I don't know if I buy, I mean, I guess you have to,
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.760]   if your publication choose something.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.240]   So, I don't know, a gadget or somebody says,
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.240]   "Well, we're just going to run video until it dies."
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.200]   And that's one thing, but it's not a normal use per case.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.600]   I think it's like a staircase and the size of the stair steps
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.880]   have become a lot bigger over the past two years in terms of battery life.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.240]   Where there like five years ago, seven years ago,
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.400]   the difference between an open that gets three hours versus four hours was huge.
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.640]   Now we're arguing over whether this tablet gets,
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.400]   one gets eight and a half, another one gets nine and a half to 10.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.280]   And unless you have been using your tablet for nine hours,
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.880]   that's not terribly significant.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.960]   So now to have a really big difference,
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.000]   you have to talk about three hours more or even the difference between
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.880]   like a paper white Kindle and a colored device,
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:40.640]   a battery that will last legitimately for weeks versus for a day or two.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.120]   Well, I'll vouch for this act. This does not last for weeks.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.000]   I've been working on my review still. It's not quite finished yet,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.480]   but I was doing LTE tests and I'm getting 96 or 97 down consistently
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:55.520]   on the iPad mini on Rogers and only 85 on the air and only 65 on the iPhone 5.
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.080]   You see?
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.680]   And I was tearing my hair.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.880]   I was talking to all these different people.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.480]   Is the carrier provisioning it different?
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.200]   Is there any different?
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.560]   And the end, I realized I don't care.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.000]   All these speeds are so fast that it's absolutely no difference.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.360]   And they're consistently fast.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.760]   So I just check the box saying fast and I move on.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.000]   Right.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.480]   That's interesting.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:17.840]   That's on LTE from Roger.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.400]   Roger's.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.680]   Yeah. Roger's got really, it's almost like lanes in a highway and a lot of
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.960]   some places have only three lanes of LTE and Rogers in some places has 20 lanes.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.680]   So that's it.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.000]   Really? Yeah. It's probably very implementation specific.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.240]   This is a Wi-Fi one. I don't ever buy the LTE ones.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.120]   It's my hotspot and it lasts for like a day as a hotspot.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:39.120]   So I always, I really just get the LTE ones and I use it all the time.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.560]   Because I don't like going just for security reasons.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.600]   I don't like going on hotspots like at coffee shops or anything.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.440]   I'd much rather have my own network.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.000]   So I just buy the LTE version and I use it.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   And that was interesting because I've been using it with the new
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.840]   Haswell MacBook Air running Mavericks.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.120]   And previously I could stay at the coffee shop until my battery ran out
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.440]   because I never brought, I never wanted to carry a cord with me.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.480]   And now it doesn't run out.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.040]   I have to get up and lean it because it just goes on.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.120]   Twelve hours in a coffee shop and so much.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.040]   I'm shutting down the coffee shop.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:10.400]   So this is the, I don't normally buy the Apple cases.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.280]   It's kind of hard not to buy this smart cover, right?
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.680]   But it's so bad, especially on the mini,
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.560]   because it doesn't have enough heft to hold the mini up.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.360]   So the mini's floppy and it doesn't protect the back.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.080]   So this is the smart case, which I think is actually pretty good.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.880]   It fits in very nicely.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:32.480]   I got product red, so I felt good about myself ending the world's problems.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.800]   And, but it still doesn't, I mean, it's a little bit more secure.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.960]   At least the case, the cover doesn't fall off,
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:43.120]   but it's still a little floppy in the, you know, but it's okay.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.240]   It's okay.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.280]   I think, did they change the way that those covers fold?
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.400]   Because the one I have on the, on the air, I can't see.
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.320]   I think there's one fewer fold in it.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.640]   Now it's harder for me to figure out how to lock it in.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.120]   It's the same.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.480]   The air is now like the mini.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:56.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.000]   The air is like the mini.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.640]   And then it's okay.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.680]   This, you know, it's good.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.200]   Well, let's see it flopped again.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:03.600]   It's good.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.160]   This is good.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.440]   It flopped.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.320]   Till you touched it, Leo.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:06.880]   Till I touched it.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:13.760]   So this is the old one is as a, it had four, four, equal, almost equal parts.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.360]   One was slightly larger.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.440]   This has three and it was all one at the top.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:22.080]   It was already a stable prism before it took on the task of supporting
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.440]   the iPad and the old design.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:28.240]   This now it's like, okay, but don't type delicately, type gingerly.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.000]   It's just, it's a little squishy.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.760]   But, you know, the new product, there aren't a lot of case choices yet anyway.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.960]   So I mean, I'm happy.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.000]   At least this protects it.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.080]   And it looks awfully stylish in my hand.
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.640]   And I just love the size is good for just like carrying it.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.080]   And Apple is the only one allowed to put an Apple logo on the cases.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.200]   Oh, is that true?
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.760]   So that's good for people, purposes of stealing them.
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:50.720]   You know what you're getting.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.280]   You want your Gucci on the bag.
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.080]   You've got to get an Apple.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.000]   I did not know that.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.600]   Did not know that.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:57.920]   Of course.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.560]   That's why everyone else cuts the circle out so that you can see the Apple logo
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.080]   through it because they can't put one on the case.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.680]   Number people prefer the poetic smart case.
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.000]   It's the same, basically same idea, but less wobble.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.840]   I don't know what.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.720]   The only thing about the retinomini unlike the air is that the form factor is basically the same.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.520]   It is a hundredth of a millimeter, so a hundredth of an inch thicker,
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.960]   but it makes almost no difference.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.720]   So most of your last generation.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.680]   Exhices will fit.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.880]   Ah, that point you're useful.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.000]   You're good to have around.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.760]   I'm going to forgive you the fact that you told me that my reds aren't red
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:33.600]   and my speed is slow and there's retention.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.320]   It's retaining.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.560]   Forgive you all of that.
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.120]   I ran the test online.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:39.680]   Mine is fine.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.760]   100% retention free, but I'm sure there are some panels by some manufacturers that are
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:44.960]   problematic.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.920]   We talked, it was a couple of weeks ago we talked about why isn't there a hypercard.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:56.560]   Ah, equivalent that it would be so good to have hypercard on the iPad and so forth.
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:02.480]   There, somebody sent me a note saying there is a company in the United Kingdom
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:07.920]   is doing a Kickstarter for a new hypercard.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.840]   They call it LiveCode.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.720]   Next generation LiveCode.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.760]   It would be open source.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:21.680]   They wanted 350,000 pounds.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.000]   More than enough, they made their stretch goals.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.760]   So I'm finding this exciting.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:36.080]   Yeah, as a matter of fact, Adam Anks at the Mac Dev a couple of weeks ago was using that
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.480]   exact same system to build like a game board for presentation.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.360]   And the scripting is very much like HyperTalk where you create objects and then you give them,
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.760]   you attach objects, scripts to each one of them.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:54.880]   There are actually a couple of different open source alternatives to hypercard out there.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.480]   I don't think any of them are quite like what we want for the iPad though,
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.240]   which is the ability to just put objects together and script them.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:09.120]   Well, it's being built anyway as a hypercard like environment.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:16.640]   I guess there's a language called open language for the more technical people.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.240]   That would be the HyperTalk equivalent.
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:24.480]   But it's good stuff because there are so many times when people don't necessarily need to
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:29.520]   learn how to develop an iOS or Mac OS program, they just need to build something that's interactive
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.000]   so that they can solve a problem that's right at hand.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.200]   And a lot of times we're talking about courseware, we're talking about presentationware,
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.920]   we're talking about ways to just create a tool for a specific purpose that you can then dispose
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:44.080]   of when you're done with it like a sheet of paper on a notepad.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:48.160]   And that's why I really, really hope that we get to see something like this become a mainstream
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.400]   solution. So it's supposed to be out soon, I guess. I mean, they said fall of 2013.
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:58.320]   So we'll watch with interest. But anyway, I got a lot of people saying, oh, no, no.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:05.440]   These Scottish people have created it. These are hypercards. It's called live food.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.600]   Hey, and you can tell me.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.040]   That's already been falling on the desktop, isn't it?
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.920]   Pardon me? I think it has a big fun with it.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.200]   I think so. Yeah, I think so.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.520]   Like a big, big, big user community. And I think someone talking about some kids that
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.160]   were making iOS apps using it.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.600]   That would be really cool. Yeah.
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.520]   Well, I'm going to download it and play with it and see.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:30.320]   You can get it at livecode.com.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:35.920]   Let's take a break. And then when we come back, I want to, I want all the dirt on Johnny
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.200]   Ive. There's got to be something wrong with that.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.160]   Mostly it's stubble. It's not dirt. That's probably the best perception.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:49.440]   The other Connie is here in his new book is on audible.com. If you want to read it,
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:54.240]   see every time I say read people, get upset with me. If you want to listen to it as if you were
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:20:00.480]   reading it, you can. Oh, did I spell Johnny wrong? I spelled J-O-N-N-Y-I-V-E.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:05.440]   Maybe if I spell Olyander Connie, much easier. K-H-N-E-Y, right? I think.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.440]   Yes, there it is. Johnny I, there's one end. That's why.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:14.800]   Johnny Ive, the genius behind Apple's greatest products.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:20.320]   Simon Vance is one of their best narratives. Did you get to audition the narrators,
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:27.200]   Lander? I was supposed to. I forgot. Well, they gave you their good news.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.520]   So you can get this for free right now. If you go to audible.com/macbreak,
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.920]   listen to a little bit of Simon Vance. Mike Ives influence reached well beyond the
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:41.360]   precocious child in his own household. For many years, he worked as a silversmith and teacher in
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:46.320]   Essex. See, who knew that? Described by one colleague as a gentle giant, he was well liked
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.720]   much admired. Wait a minute. How big is Johnny Ive?
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:54.160]   Gentle giant. That's his dad. Oh, his father was a gentle giant. Oh, okay.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:21:00.720]   He's one too though. He's a big guy. Is he? He's muscular. Yeah. No, no, he's just big, you know,
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:08.320]   barely like a tank. I think I'm a bit of a slight wimpy designer. Oh, he's a muscly guy. He's a
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:14.480]   muscle muscle. Oh, I'm sorry, Johnny. I apologize. So audible is the world's greatest bookstore
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:21.360]   of audiobooks. We are major fans here at Twitch. They've been a sponsor for years. Every show,
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.880]   Andy and I co and I compare notes on what we're reading. I was just telling Andy about
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:31.920]   this great new book I got called Dangerous Men that I'm really enjoying. All about the revolution
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:38.400]   in television that was fostered. Is that the name? Maybe I got the wrong name or he gets just
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:46.240]   Dangerous Men is such a popular name about the revolution in television fostered by started
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:51.040]   with the sopranos. Let me I'm going to go in my library and see what the actual name of this is
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:56.000]   here. If you go to audible.com/macbreakdifficult, man, that's why they're not dangerous. They're
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.800]   just difficult behind the scenes of a creative revolution from the sopranos and the wire
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:06.720]   to mad men and breaking bad and man. I mean, like my four favorite shows, so how could I not buy
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:12.720]   this book? But here's the problem. I just gave you two books and they're both nonfiction.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:18.480]   Well, there's also great fiction enders game. It's the 50th anniversary of the assassination
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:24.560]   of president Kennedy. There are a lot of history books about that as you might guess. You get to
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:31.120]   choose from some of the best. All auto audio means you can sit in the car and listen as you drive.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:35.840]   If you've got a long commute, this is a lifesaver. I listen at the gym. On the treadmill,
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:40.400]   there's nothing more boring than a treadmill. Unless you're listening to the heart of darkness
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:45.040]   narrated by Kenneth Branagh, then the treadmill is not nearly long enough.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:54.000]   So many great things here. So my strong suggestion is you visit audible.com. Take a look at
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.880]   Landers new book. I think that would be a great choice. There's been some really good books about
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:04.320]   technology that have come out in the last six months. The Amazon book by Brad Stone,
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:09.360]   that's fascinating. Hatching Twitter, Nick Bilton's book about Twitter. Suddenly,
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:16.080]   this great technology journalism is back. Thank goodness. We've been I love these behind the
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:22.960]   scenes books and I cannot wait to read this. Johnny I've the genius behind Apple's greatest
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.760]   products. And by the way, Leander doesn't mind if you get it for free. He still gets his royalty.

[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:17.920]   Audible.com slash Mac break. So when did you decide to write a book about Johnny I've landed?
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:26.560]   It was about 18 months ago. And why? Because it was clear that he was stepping into Steve Jobs's
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:30.640]   shoes and that he was going to be the most, he was the most important sort of creative
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:36.160]   force of the company after jobs. And not much is known about him. I mean, he's
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:43.520]   that's what's interesting. Yeah, we tried to interview him for years and he just won't give
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:48.720]   interviews. It almost feels like he's Apple's secret weapon. You know, you know, the name,
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:55.120]   you know, he designed everything from, you know, this this iPad to the first, what was his first
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:25:03.680]   Apple product? It was actually the second generation Newton. What he's been there since the Newton.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:12.320]   Can you give me my new to have a new 2000 message pad? That would be Johnny I's first thing, right?
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:17.200]   Well, it was the one fan. I think the one named codename Lindy. So it was the second one. The first
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:23.680]   one they rushed out and it was a bomb. And they knew it was a bomb. So they when he joined the
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.560]   company, they had him redesign it. And he was redesigning the second one even before the first
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:35.040]   one was released. So they went out with the first one. Unfortunately, you know, it died. And by the
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:41.280]   time his second one came out, it was D.O.A. on the on the Gurney. But it was supposed to be a great
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:46.640]   design. I mean, so we never saw his his new design. Yeah, it came out, but it never really
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:51.680]   went any way. You know, I mean, they this is not this is not it then this is a message pad.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:55.520]   I don't know which one it is. This must be the first one.
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:00.320]   Because it looks a little they had one I think they had the 2000 came out after that. So it was
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:08.240]   like the the message page, the 110 then the 2000 the 210. So this is the 110 probably. This is the
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:17.440]   original. Yeah, it was our windows expert because he's an expert also in an antique Macintosh
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:23.440]   and Apple memorabilia. But so this is not a Johnny I've designed although I have to say for its era,
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:30.000]   this is a really good design. Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, it's got really good in the end. The
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.760]   the new. Yeah, but it never really got traction. So this was this was not under Steve Jobs. This
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:41.600]   was a scully, right? Right, exactly. Yeah. So it was it was John Scully who hired Johnny I've.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:47.200]   Well, it was it was Robert Brunner. It was the head of the design studio at the time.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:53.680]   And he's now, you know, how to he did the beats headphones. He's by Dr. King.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:58.080]   But he was the head of the design department and a lot of what Bob Brunner did,
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:02.080]   sort of set the stage for for Johnny's success. Interesting.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:10.560]   And in fact, the job that Johnny designed a a Newton tablet that was never saw the light of
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:16.080]   day, but that was the design that got in the job at Apple. What are we looking at here?
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:23.600]   This is from the book. This is a video of the book. I don't have to change myself to fit the
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:30.000]   product. It fits me. Yeah, the experience of actually using it is how it feels in your hand.
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:37.120]   It is incredibly intuitive. I mean, you can use it with so funny. You know, it's just the way
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:43.120]   this is how we know Johnny I was in the white space. It's the best thing we've ever done.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:51.360]   A hard work. I think driven by this obsession. This is a parody video for the book where he
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:28:00.560]   edited together. He's talking about the book, right? Yeah. The entire from is just dominating
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:06.720]   by this incredible image. You are just I bet Apple is a really good sport about this.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:10.400]   Were they? No.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.280]   There's not a detail there.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:18.320]   They're a fan of YouTube. Did it? Day after it went up. Yeah. Oh, man.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.880]   Everything is about your content.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:30.160]   Eve, you. The tiniest details. You could see why, but it was a but I so totally appreciate that.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:35.360]   Who did this? Who did this video? Yeah, I got a guy up in Canada.
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:40.640]   I think that signifies to just our care. I mean, just how much we care.
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:46.640]   Up on the UConn where laws are just between man and Nate in Canada. Anything goes.
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:52.080]   They don't have copyright laws up there. We have Sam's deal right on.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:57.520]   Look at Julian Assange thing going for you. No. You can't leave the embassy.
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:02.240]   So was it the partnership with Steve Jobs that really put Johnny Ivan on the map or was he
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:07.760]   great before Steve came along? Oh, yeah. He was totally great, but the design department,
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:11.840]   you know, had no traction inside Apple. It was an engineering driven company. So they couldn't
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:16.800]   they couldn't get any of their work to to get traction. So they were battling the engineers
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:21.200]   the whole time and then when Steve came in, he said, this is crazy. You know, we're going to do it
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:25.840]   my way, the design away. We're going to, you know, design these things from the inside out.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:31.120]   So the break you got in writing the book was getting to meet a guy named Douglas
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:38.320]   Satzger who worked with Johnny for a dozen years. Right. And so he was there before Jobs
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:43.520]   came back and he was there through the iPad. So and this guy was was pretty forthcoming.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:48.080]   Oh, yeah. Yeah. He was very frank. Yeah. He he he told me everything. I mean,
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:51.120]   this is one of those interviews when, you know, five minutes in, you're like,
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:55.600]   what are you doing? Are you telling me all this? Does he still work at Apple?
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.920]   No, he's he heads up Intel's design department. There you go. Now you know why.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:09.600]   No repercussions. Right. So what did he tell you? Well, he you know, he we started with, you know,
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:15.280]   Jobs has returned and and we went through the iMac and all that the string and hit products up to
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:20.000]   the iPod and then the iPhone, the iPad, you know, how they didn't, what the problems they had,
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.960]   how they worked, the design of the layout of the lab, you know, everything, everything.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:32.640]   One of the things that Jobs celebrated and and actually it was one of the things that I kind of
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:37.920]   thought of as the as epitomizing apples and I thought of his Jobs point of view, but maybe this
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:43.040]   is a Johnny I've strayed. I don't know. On the cheese grater iMac, the holes on the front
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:48.880]   are milled in such a way that when they normally if you had circular holes all the way up the front
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:54.720]   and then you bent it as they did at the top to make a curve, the holes that were on the bend would
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:59.680]   become elliptical. They'd be stretched out. They milled it in such a way that when you bent it,
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:05.760]   the holes became circular. So they were circular all the way around. That is mind boggling attention
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:12.560]   to detail. Yeah. And I thought of it as a really good metaphor for better or for worse
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:18.720]   where the focus, the design focus was at Apple. Was that a Johnny I've idea? Do you know? Yeah,
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.800]   yeah, absolutely. And the strength and the funny thing about that machine was that they designed
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:28.160]   every single surface of that to do, you know, but that same to that same aesthetic standard.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:32.480]   Even the inside of the door. Yeah, because they were so pleased with it. They were so delighted.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.800]   They said people aren't going to put this under their desk. They're going to put it on the desk.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:39.600]   No, they aren't. People put it on the desk. I mean, as you can see the back, the sides,
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.000]   and even the inside. They even designed the other floor. Under my desk. But I did. When I first opened
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:51.440]   that power that Mac Pro, I was blown away. I've never I've opened a million PCs. I've never seen
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:56.560]   one that looked like that. I mean, it was gorgeous inside. Yeah. Oh, well, they designed they designed
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:00.560]   the motherboard. They designed all the cables. They designed the chips to look good. They had
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:04.800]   the coloring of everything on the inside. Every single thing in that thing was designed. And that
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:08.800]   was the first time they went in and they actually designed the internals too. Because, you know,
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:14.000]   remember it came with a plastic, a see through plastic front. So if you took the door off,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.960]   you could see inside. Yeah. Crazy. But they found out what they wanted to do almost went
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:24.320]   crazy. That was what started their relationship with Foxconn. Really?
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:29.600]   Because this is nuts. You're pretty or mad. No one does this. But they were trying to work with
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:33.120]   an American company at the time. The American company were like, they just couldn't come up
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:37.600]   with the goods. And then Terry Gao reorganized the whole company. He said, we're going to do this.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:41.360]   You know, and he can't even met the challenge. That's what that's what's starting to work with
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:45.600]   Foxconn. And Foxconn still makes almost all the Apple products, at least to find the assembly on
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:49.440]   almost all the Apple products. Right. Well, people think, you know, that they went to Foxconn because
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:53.840]   of cheap Chinese labor. And I'm sure that didn't hurt. But it was mainly because they had a partner
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:59.520]   there that would bend over Blackwoods to implement their designs. Foxconn invented and built machines
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:04.480]   just to do the things that Johnny I've wanted to do. Oh, they did over and over again. Yeah.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:11.680]   They said, oh, we can make that and they had invented. Yeah. Right. Oh, yeah, they do it all the time.
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:17.920]   I mean, almost every product, the whole all the unibody stuff, you know, has a lot to they're spending
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:22.160]   billion, almost $10 billion a year on machines just to make the unibody products.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:29.040]   Did you say a billion? 10 billion. 10 a year on the manufacturer. Yeah.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:37.040]   Because we always talk about the fact that Intel Intel's got to build billion and a half,
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:42.640]   maybe $2 billion chip fabs. Oh, what a what a huge investment they make to make these chips.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:48.880]   10 billion a year. And they've been doing it for multiple years. Holy cow. And they bought up
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:53.440]   the entire world supply of CNC milling machines. These machines cost one to three million dollars
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:34:00.160]   each. No one else could buy one for three years. But of the entire world supply. I've had these
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.600]   engineers. That's Samsung. No wonder there's stuffs plastic. Right.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:12.960]   Holy moly. So did Johnny I presume he did well off of all this? I mean,
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:18.640]   you know, you hear these stories about, you know, these guys getting rich and
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:25.360]   becoming flamboyant. And you just Johnny is so under the radar. I presume he's doing all right.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:29.600]   Yeah. He's doing okay. Okay. Good. You just bought a $17 million mansion.
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:34.880]   The swankest part of San Francisco. Oh, really? In C Cliff? Where? Where?
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:40.720]   It's low Pacific Heights, billionaire, role. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't actually hang
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:46.880]   out there. I know where that is. Yeah. I actually have a friend who has a couple of houses up there.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:52.480]   Wow. Beautiful. Pure the Bay. Oh, it's gorgeous. That's where all the old mansions, all the old
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:56.800]   money goes is up. Right. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But he lived very modestly for a long time up
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:03.040]   between pigs, small two bedroom house. Really? Yeah. There's the mansion. Oh, pretty.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:11.280]   Well, that's pretty. Yeah, it's not too shabby as they say. It looks like it could be in Oxford.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:17.840]   It looks it looks gothic. Wow. Kicking any bigger. Oh, there we go.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:21.520]   Place was something made out of one huge block of milled aluminum. Yeah. I mean, look at this.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:26.160]   This is very for a guy who hates skeuomorphism. This is pretty skeuomorphic.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:32.960]   That's authentic to the house. Oh, of course. It's exactly what the house wants to be.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:40.480]   It does. It does. It does. Well, I'm sorry. I was just going to say, I always get really,
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:44.400]   really curious when I see right here about a really, really legendary artist or designer who
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:50.640]   builds who buys an ambitious house because if this is a guy who would not be satisfied with the fact
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:56.960]   that holes cut in the sheet of bent metal will change shape when they bend, how long will it
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:00.720]   take for him to redesign this house so that he's satisfied with everything inside it? Imagine
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:08.400]   forever. I was talking to a friend who does cabinet work, actually a friend of a friend
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:18.000]   who made some cabinets for a kitchen for something like this. They were $300,000 for the kitchen
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.800]   cabinets alone. And the reason is it was an it was an older house and they wanted the cabinets to
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:30.880]   be distressed so they looked old and so expensive distressing the cabinets with acid and chains
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:39.440]   and whips and whatever it is they use was $300,000. What I do to my jeans, Leo. Yeah. And I can just
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:45.760]   imagine what you're exactly right, Andy, every every dot on that house. Now that, by the way,
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:51.200]   is the house before he bought it. Right. That's the real tea. That's the real tea brochure.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:56.480]   So who knows what it looks like now could be all the mill aluminum. He's spending a lot of time
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:02.240]   to redesigning the new spaceship campus. Do you see he's involved in that? Oh yeah, very much.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:06.960]   Yeah. If you look at the videos on the coupatino style, you see them in all the all the videos.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:13.200]   And if I do, there's a rendering that just came out, we'll just was on earth this last week and
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:19.200]   the picture was Aston Martin parked out front. Is that Johnny's Aston Martin? I'm pretty sure it is.
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:23.200]   He has an Aston Martin. Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. You tell the story of it's a quarter million
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:28.960]   dollar Aston Martin, something like that. That he totaled. Yeah. He almost got killed crashing.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:36.320]   Somebody's replaced the DB nine with another one. Yeah, got replaced with another DB nine and
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:41.920]   that that burst into flames in his driveway and almost burned his house. Good British engineering.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:48.240]   Never happens to James. That's Lucas with a lot of darkness. He was experimenting with
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:54.320]   the new magnesium body frame that turned out to be a bad bad. Actually, it's funny because those
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:58.240]   cars are all, you know, the construction is very much like the new iPads. They're all glued together.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:05.840]   Dear, oh dear. Does he ever get taken a task for that? I mean, we had, we had I fixed it on taking
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:11.200]   apart the iPad Air and they gave it a repairability. One of the lowest, second lowest they've ever
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:17.280]   given of a two out of 10 and mostly because everything was glued together and there is just no recyclability
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:22.800]   at all possible. Does he does he get involved in that at all? Oh, yeah, totally. You know, but
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   what they say is that the products are very, are repaired expressly to be designed,
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:35.920]   but they're designed to be repaired by professional technicians at Apple. And not you.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:39.040]   It's all interesting things like talking with Doug Satsby when he went out of Intel, Intel
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:43.200]   wants to get into consumer products, but he was like, you've got to think this thing through because,
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.720]   you know, at some point you're going to have to service these products. You know, how are you
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:52.000]   going to do that? Apple's got hundreds of stores all around the world, a huge service
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:59.040]   system already set up and you can just walk in and hand over your iPad and they'll fix it
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:03.360]   behind the scenes. And I fix it, you know, it takes them to task because you can't fix it yourself.
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:07.840]   Right. And they criticize these products because they're not, you can't fix them by amateurs or you
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:13.120]   can't take it down to the guys at Best Buy and they'll fix it for you. But they're very carefully
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:17.760]   designed and Apple builds a whole bunch of tools also for them to be repaired by professionals.
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:23.600]   So they know what they're doing. Yeah, I'm sorry. But the issue is also recycling because,
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:27.840]   well, that's supposed to be a hundred percent recycled. You can't demand professional recyclers.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:31.920]   Well, they're 100 percent recyclable, they say, you know, so then you're equipped,
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:37.200]   it's supposed to be 100 percent. In the hands of professionals, but real recyclers are going to go
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.960]   I don't know what to do with this. I'll just put it in the grinder.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:46.480]   Well, who recycles their MacBook, you know, I mean, you don't break it up and you put some
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:50.800]   in the compost and you know, some of them. You can you can set it to Apple for recycling, right?
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:55.520]   Yeah, you can. Yeah. So presumably they that's when the professionals leap in.
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:02.880]   Right. And, you know, I mean, I think that's probably pretty good. I'm not sure if anyone,
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:07.760]   you know, I mean, cars first, that supposed to be, you know, there are laws about making
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:11.840]   cars more. It's like, well, it's like, well, 85 of 90 percent was like, we've seen them recycled.
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:17.360]   They put them make them in giant cubes. Yeah. Right. With James Bond villain inside.
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:24.080]   So here are renders of Johnny. So, I mean, Steve was very excited about this campus,
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:29.120]   but you're saying that Johnny I was, did he design the curved glass and all of that stuff?
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.440]   No, but he's definitely involved. It's done by Rogers in London.
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:36.720]   Architecture firm. All right. Yeah. But you can see him in all the videos.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:42.960]   I mean, you know, looking at the models and also, you know, very intimately involved in the design
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.840]   of the thing. They're designing it like an Apple product. I mean, they haven't turned it over
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:49.600]   to the architects. You know, the money quote in the story there was that Steve said, don't
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:56.960]   think of me as a client. Think of me as one of the team. Oh, Lord. I'm sure Roger. Oh, yeah.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:02.480]   Okay. It does look gorgeous. Keep going. There's one where you can see the Aston
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:06.400]   one in the foreground. Let's see if we can. Oh, that's that's not the Aston.
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:10.080]   Yeah. There's one of those. There we go. Is that it here?
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:14.240]   I think that's it. Yeah. There it is. So I want to still that. I was like,
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:22.480]   kind of, that's his car. Well, okay. But one thing we'd like to ask, put my DB9 in the renders.
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:26.080]   That's all I ask. Yeah. That's Johnny I'm marketing right there.
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:30.320]   I'd be selling it on Craigslist in four months. I could just recycle the image.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:39.200]   What, you know, but I thank God that Johnny exists. Oh, here's wait a minute. What is this?
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:44.160]   Is that or is that an R8? That looks like a, you know, I wonder if like there's different
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:53.920]   Apple principles have their car in the in the renders because that's an Audi right there.
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:42:00.160]   I can't get past. Wait a minute. That's my car. I asked Johnny to do that.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:03.600]   That's what that's. Tim Cryptorize. Will Shiller drives a Porsche?
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:09.280]   Shiller drives a Porsche. I've drives Aston Martin.
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:13.040]   Q as a Ferrari. Q as a Ferrari. It's called Forest Hall.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.600]   You have to have a Ferrari because he's on the board at Ferrari, right?
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:20.000]   Scott Forest all drives a you go. Used to have a McLaren.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.520]   You had a McLaren. Yeah.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:25.680]   Holy cow. Jiminy.
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:32.320]   Did you see the products that Johnny redesigned for the product Red Auction?
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:35.040]   What did you think of those? Oh, the beautiful Leica that he did.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:38.640]   I thought I thought it was really interesting to see like if he's just going to be,
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.880]   that might be, it might give us sort of some insight on what he thinks is important.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:47.280]   If he could, we just compared the before and the after about what he thought could be dressed up with
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:55.360]   this. Yeah, absolutely. This is it. It's just gorgeous. And this, by the way,
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:59.280]   we were just, we were joking about like a house built out of like one piece of aluminum.
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:06.240]   There is a table that is, I think it is an entirely milled product. I think it's like two pieces of
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:11.040]   aluminum. I think it's multiple pieces. And I think they're using that same CNC
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:16.960]   unibody process to make it make the Leica. Well, here he is with Bono and some other hip guy.
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:22.240]   Mark Newsome. That's Mark Newsome. That's his best friend.
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:27.840]   Oh, is it really? Yeah. Interesting. The auction is coming up November 23rd, four days, if you'd
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:35.120]   like to bid on that. Red Mac Pro. I believe, I, oh, look at this. Look at these gold, rose gold,
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:40.560]   apple earbuds. Wow. Oh, not you fly fast.
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:46.720]   Now that Russia is no longer accepting those $30 million trips, the International Space Station,
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:51.840]   that's freeing up some money for these bids. Johnny and Mark, that's, that's the thing.
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:55.840]   They say Johnny and Mark, I love it. So Mark is a designer as well.
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:44:03.520]   Yeah. Yep. Is he at Apple? No, he, you know, he runs design consultancy. So he does all kinds of
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:09.200]   stuff. He's done everything from cars to airplane interiors, motorcycles, furniture.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:16.400]   Where was Johnny Ive before Apple? Was he at IDO or Frog or one of those big design companies?
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:21.360]   He was in partnership in his own London design firm, design agency.
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.000]   And how did they, how did they lure him in?
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.400]   They tried to hire him right out of school and couldn't, he, he, he, he, he didn't want to move,
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:36.800]   he didn't want to move from London to California. So they, they gave him a, a speculative job
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:46.480]   doing some concepts for a tablet, a Newton tablet. And here's, here's Bono talking about the Johnny
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:51.760]   Ive red auction. So it's the option. Early on, early on, you know, it was in re-evading,
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:55.040]   wanting the three, two to have even, he's doing the auction.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:02.160]   They plan to raise a lot of money. I think the Leica alone is expected to go for,
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:08.320]   it was $350,000. Yeah. Six million. What? Six million. Pardon me. I was always looking
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:12.320]   off the best in the brightest. Leica collectors are insane and it's only one of those from, yeah.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:18.480]   Who are the most vulnerable? Some great rhyme in that design. That's it.
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:22.800]   Okay. Don't ask a rock and roller to be coherent on video because it's not gonna happen.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:28.080]   The sale itself is gonna have a number of objects which loosely speaking, breakdown to either
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:33.120]   works that Johnny and Mark just really liked or objects they really liked but they couldn't help
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:38.480]   it tinker with them. Or most tantalizing, Leah, of all, you've got these, these objects where they've
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:43.360]   actually designed them from the ground upwards which is really an incredible collaboration to see
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:50.800]   two of our times most distinct designers who were able to come together. This really is a one-stop.
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:56.720]   I mean, it's like a Donatello and Michelangelo meeting point. Wow. It's extraordinary.
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:01.440]   This Michelangelo, the history of design, the scenes.
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.480]   So Mark did an interview. I wonder if Johnny yet. Are you trying?
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.960]   It is. It really does cross-losses. This is Mark Reusen talking.
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:11.680]   All of these works have an incredible sort of philosophical value and historical value within
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.480]   the collection. This is on the Sotheby site if you want to watch the video.
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:18.320]   Because they're really so beautiful stuff. Not that. Not that.
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:24.320]   We just both wanted to own each one really badly. And there is a real thread that runs through
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:36.000]   these objects from a telescope to a spacesuit to a pen to watch making tools to a scooter
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.640]   and a cross-product. This is kind of a dream thing for designers to do.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:43.280]   Incredibly different places to do very different things.
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:47.680]   Did you see that? There was a product Red Mac Pro.
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:57.680]   Ooh. One of a kinder. I want to ask you. So what did Johnny do as a student that got Apple
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:04.160]   hot form? I think I can say as an independent contractor doing some work that especially
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:08.720]   stuff that might have been sub-contract for Apple. But if I was surprised to learn that as a student
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:12.240]   Apple wanted him, what did he do? Yeah, he did he did white phones.
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:15.920]   Really? In white plastic. Yeah.
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:20.000]   But there must have been something. Well, it is.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.800]   He was a straight A student. That's probably it. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. He wanted some competitions.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:30.000]   He just interviewed really well. We put him in a white room.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.520]   But what seemed dry? What the heck out of that t-shirt?
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:39.280]   What kind of phones was he designing back then? That would have been 92, 93?
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:43.120]   He got recruited at 92. This is back in the late 80s.
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:47.520]   Yeah. So he graduated like 89, I think.
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:54.960]   I reimagined the Princess phone to be a floating white object, except for the
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:59.600]   wire connected to the wall. Well, yeah, it was not a landline.
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.440]   Yeah, it had to be a landline phone, right?
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.280]   And it was shaped like a weird question mark.
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:09.280]   So I'm actually Jackie Chang wanted to use it. Jackie Chang wanted to use it in one of his
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:14.960]   in some sci-fi movie he was making. But Johnny wouldn't let him use it because it was too delicate.
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:19.440]   They thought he would get destroyed. He took it out to show Robert Brunner in California.
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:24.880]   And Brunner was blown away because he had figured out not just how it looked, but also how
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.400]   it was going to be manufactured. So when you took it to pieces that had all the
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:32.320]   internals and all the part lines and he knew exactly how a molding machine was going to put
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:36.400]   it together. And he said, you never see that in a student. You never ever see that in a student.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:39.520]   They're always, they're only consumed by how it's going to look. They never
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:42.640]   consider how it's going to be made. And that's really what distinguished him.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:46.160]   He got made the head of the design department when he was like 26.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:49.600]   After coming to Apple, he had only been there for three or four years, but he was just,
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:55.680]   he knew the whole business from, he was really, he was just like Steve Jobs. He could get the big
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:49:00.400]   picture. It was also really into the details. So he knew exactly what kind of screws he needed
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:05.520]   and that kind of stuff. He had hair in those days. Here's a picture of him as a sixth former.
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:12.320]   In Stafford with the big hair. Here's a Johnny I've been in that picture.
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:20.880]   He looks like Benny Hill on the left there. It's actually Johnny I've, I'm trying to,
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:25.040]   I'm finding this stuff in trying to find the phone. If I can figure out where the phone is,
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:32.160]   this is an article. It's not on the web. It's, yeah. Yeah. This article in the mail, it says,
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:39.680]   how did this graduate, art school graduate become Sir Johnny Ive, right? And it does list many of
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:47.200]   his creations. He created the Luxo lamp I'm Mac. And I remember in the Isaac's in biography of
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:52.960]   Steve Jobs, I talk about how hard it was to make it the arm so that it was that that after a few
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:50:01.360]   months, the screen wouldn't just slowly sink. I mean, he did the Macbook Air, which is such a
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:07.440]   great design that every single computer company in the world has copied it. Pretty remarkable.
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:13.360]   If you think about his body of work, I don't think there's anybody. He did the Bondi Blue I'm
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:20.240]   Mac. He did the iPods. There's nobody who's who's he's won more Blackpensil awards than most
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:24.800]   companies combined. It's really quite a remarkable. Here's a picture of him with his with the
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:33.040]   the Luxo lamp. I'm I'm I still think that's one of the greatest designs ever. Beautiful.
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:38.160]   Has not not only did it look awesome and cool, not only was it perfectly functional because
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:42.640]   you've seen so many designs that might have been sort of like this, but this get wiggly wobbly
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:48.000]   after week or two. But also when you realize that this is a heavy like 15 18 pound computer,
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:53.520]   and it retained the idea from the original Mac and even the first iMac that it has a carrying
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:57.360]   handle. If you need to move a couple of these from one classroom to another or from one part of
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:03.200]   the other, that's that stainless steel chrome arm is a perfect perfect carrying handle for it.
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:10.240]   It's like, he put handles on all of his early machines. Yeah, every single one. So the
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:15.440]   that it was Steve's idea. In fact, he said back to the drawing board, Johnny, you need to put a
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:22.720]   handle on this. Uh, or maybe I'm just remembering. Yeah, my research was because he it was um,
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:27.840]   Johnny's idea and Steven even asked why and Johnny did because you're right. You're right. Yes.
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:33.040]   People to touch it. Yes. And it was doing it wasn't to carry it around. It was like to say his,
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:38.320]   you know, the handle says you could touch me. You couldn't see that. Timedating and more friendly.
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:42.240]   And then you see this thread going through all of his products like, you know, even the
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:48.480]   the iPod really was an early stab at the iPhone and the iPad. It's an early, simple touch interface.
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:52.080]   Right. And he did this with all of his other products too. Like going back to a pan and the
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:57.280]   Newton, the message pad. He was I did what he called the fiddle factor. He wanted people to
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:01.600]   touch his products. And so he would make them, he would express and design all these little touches
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:06.240]   and encourage people to touch him. And yet that phony design as a student,
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:14.000]   was too fragile to touch. Maybe he learned maybe it was just Jackie Chan. Yeah, he got better.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.640]   He was not a young. Yeah. I mean, well, and you think about a Newcastle poly technique is
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:23.280]   probably I'm not familiar with it. But given that it's a Newcastle for one thing,
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:30.000]   it's probably not the hotbed of design talent. Well, it is. Is it? I don't know it. No, it's
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:35.840]   the best design school in the country. What? Yeah. This is Newcastle on time. All right. All right.
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:40.560]   You would think he got three. He got he got grades good enough to get into Oxford and Cambridge.
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:44.560]   But he went to Newcastle. He went to Newcastle instead. I know that was a head scratcher. But
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:47.360]   then I found out that it's like the top one of the top design schools in the world.
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:51.760]   You would think Northumbria would be the first place people would want to go.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:55.760]   I mean, you think London would be the center of design. Absolutely. Absolutely.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:53:00.640]   Great Britain. Oh, interesting. All right. I take it all back for our fans in Newcastle.
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:06.400]   My apologies. It's pretty grim up there. I'm just thinking a winner. I just that's all.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:12.400]   Yeah. It's called a Branches. Oh, grim. And known for Cole.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:18.560]   Cole to Newcastle, right? I mean, it's a coal town. Right. Exactly. Chip building in coal.
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:24.160]   Yeah. Interesting. Great beer. Of course. You have to have great beer if you live in Newcastle.
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:28.560]   Again, I've offended. I apologize.
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:37.120]   No, really. Really, Johnny I was remarkable. But and more so because he is so private.
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:42.960]   I think you apply. You tried to go like through a friend of a friend.
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:47.600]   Right. And then you Apple did not even respond to your request.
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:52.320]   Yeah. Yeah. And I didn't hear from Apple. I mean, I made a few requests to them too.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:56.080]   I mean, maybe I'm a bit jaded because I've worked, you know, I've been reporting that
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:59.920]   for the 20 years. So I didn't really have very high expectations. But of course,
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:02.720]   you know, I only got a call until, you know, two weeks before the book's going to come out.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:06.320]   Then I get a call. They want to see an advance copy. Oh, I'm sorry. No.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:10.720]   Yeah. Yeah. Like thanks for all the cooperation. No.
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:17.040]   Right. Yeah. I didn't expect any. I'm something he would do like a princess die.
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:22.160]   You know how she she worked with her biographer, Andrew Morton, behind the scenes. Right. And gave
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:25.760]   people permission to talk. But then I find that he sealed all his records going all the way back
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:30.800]   to his high school. So you can't even get hold of his high school transcripts, his college transcripts.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:35.360]   The college wouldn't talk to me because they, you know, he's a visiting professor there now.
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:40.640]   And they use them a lot of his marketing materials. So, you know, it was pretty hard. But I eventually
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:45.440]   got, you know, some of his, I got some, an old teacher, a couple of his old teachers, an old professor
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:50.400]   to talk. And then his colleagues, all of his colleagues in London, ended up talking to me.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:54.800]   So I got a great history about his early career in London. And then I got talking to, you know,
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:58.080]   well, Satsky and then some other designers and then a bunch of engineers. So in the end, it worked out.
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:03.840]   Okay. What is, what is your sense of why is he just very private or is he hiding?
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:09.040]   Yeah. He's, he's, no, he's, he's a classic, you know, it's a combination of two things. One,
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:14.880]   he's got the classic, you know, British reserve personality. Yes. He does not want to call attention
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:21.840]   to himself. And, and to his Apple, Apple's, you know, secrecy. They're still controlling. I mean,
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:25.120]   they put him in all the videos every time they come out of the product, they do a short video
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:28.160]   of him, you know, that's why he's trapped in that white room. Right. And they want to talk about
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:31.600]   the design story, but they don't want him to talk too frankly about the design story.
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:35.360]   But that looks like a lamp, for example. I mean, that was, that was, that was two and a half years of
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:41.520]   a while. They even actually had to call an ideal to help them solve that. And because they don't
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:45.840]   want to talk about this, you know, Jobs was like, he took a leaf out of Walt Disney's book and he
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:49.120]   didn't want to talk. He didn't want people to see the sausage being made. Yeah, I don't blame him.
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:55.760]   Right. So they don't want this stuff cut to come out. But you know, I think this is the most
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:56:00.560]   fascinating stuff. You know, I agree. I solve these problems. I agree. Yeah, it's, it's great. And,
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:04.720]   I think it's a valuable thing to be told too. It's a valuable history. These products are so
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:10.240]   universal. I mean, they're not, you know, they have such a huge cultural impact that the story
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:13.120]   of how they get made, I think is an important story to be told. You've got a modern day
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:20.320]   Da Vinci and it's a shame. Yeah, it is not that, but I understand and I honor his desire for privacy.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:25.760]   I don't, I mean, you know, that's certainly his right to choose that. But let's not, I mean,
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:30.800]   this and I understand Apple's need for secrecy before products announced. And I completely
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:36.960]   understand Steve Jobs saying the product speaks for itself. But now, now in hindsight, you've got
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:42.800]   the modern day Da Vinci. Let's see his notebooks. Absolutely. Absolutely. Because he doesn't get
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:47.200]   any credit either. You know, like Steve, I think, stocked up a lot of the credit for good and for
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:53.520]   ill. Supposedly that, again, Walter Isaacson says that bothered Johnny. Yeah, that Steve would go
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:59.600]   up on stage say I've created this wonderful thing. No, and the truth is a lot more complex,
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:04.400]   obviously. In fact, that was what I was kind of worried about. Like when I was getting, when I was
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:09.760]   doing it, you know, when I was doing it, because like the myth, the job's myth is much better
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:15.840]   than the messy reality. I'm like, who's going to read this? It sucks. You know, they want to read
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:22.480]   about how Steve Jobs woke up in the bathtub and went up the iPhone. Yeah, exactly what we want to
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:26.880]   read about. It's a much better story. Actually, one of the funny things is, you know, the story
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:31.600]   about the Luxor Lambeimack, I mean, he said they got the idea from taking a walk in Jobs's gun down
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:35.840]   in Palo Alto and they're looking at sunflowers. And one of the executives, one of the executives
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:41.360]   have worked for Steve for more than a decade, for longer, in fact, said that the story was bullsh*t.
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:48.160]   It was made up. They made that up to tell the press. And I was flabbergasted. I was like, what?
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:53.680]   Are you kidding me? And people don't understand that Steve Jobs is a marketer and was a marketer
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:58:00.000]   from day one and was completely willing to tell any story to make this picture and felt completely
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:06.960]   justified in lying in any way he wanted to. Right. Because that's not- He was in the presentation
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:11.360]   of this executive. So when they had, they had two versions of the machine. Mom was this kind of
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:15.680]   gooseneck thing and early version of that. And in fact, they built this amazing mechanism to hold
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:22.480]   it on originally. And then a flat screen one that was a big fat machine. And Jobs wanted something
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:26.960]   that was anthropomorphic. He wanted something that looked like a face. So they chose the gooseneck
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:29.920]   one. And then it was like two and a half years of work to try to make it work. How do you make it
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:35.200]   work? Yeah. Yeah. And then it goes, they went back to the flat screen iMac was back to that sort of
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:39.840]   original idea. But they had to wait till the components were a little bit thinner to squeeze it in.
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:47.440]   Yeah. This executive called it freak. He hated it. Really? Yeah. No, I'm with you. I think
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:52.160]   Rachael was Andy who said that. I think it's just an iconic design. And it's clearly influenced
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:58.320]   by Pixar's Luxo lamp trademark. Isn't it? Well, the original, they had this, you can look up the
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:04.960]   patterns and you can see the illustrations in the patterns. They had this crazy ball and socket
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:11.600]   neck that had about 20 ball and sockets with these cables inside and a hook on the screen.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:16.400]   So when you when you undid the hook, it loosened the cables and you could reposition
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:21.040]   the neck. And then when you tighten the hook, it would tension the cables and it would pull
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:24.480]   all back together again. And the designers talk about it. It was one of the best things they ever
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:32.800]   did. But kids couldn't manipulate. They couldn't get children to undo the the the the cam and
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:36.480]   so that's where they went eventually with that Luxo lamp thing. It was one of the best things
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:41.200]   they ever did in the sense that they solved a problem in an elegant way, but not from the point
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:47.440]   of view of a user to oh, you got to remember it. Loosen the cam, loosen the wires, reposition,
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:50.720]   tighten the wires. Very important. You do it in that or no, that's a terrible idea.
[00:59:50.720 --> 01:00:00.000]   Not just for kids. That's a terrible idea. Wow. This is fascinating. I cannot wait to read the book.
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:06.080]   Leander Connie's new book on Johnny Ives in bookstores now. And as I mentioned,
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:10.400]   I'm on a bulldog.com now. There's still lots more Mac news. We're going to take a break,
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:17.120]   come back and talk about it. First of all, from shutters stock.com. This is a great place to go. Now,
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:23.520]   admittedly, not all of us have an eye, but I think you I think if you're a blogger or you have a
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:30.400]   restaurant and you have a menu, I think if you if you are making videos, you need often you need

[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:13.760]   Hey, here's some good news. The Apple II Discoprating System source code.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:19.840]   You can read it. It's being published by the Computer History Museum in Digibarn
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:28.320]   from the 1978 Apple II. Wow, that would be fun to look at, wouldn't it? I didn't know this,
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:32.560]   but it was contracted out to a guy from a company called Shepherds and Microsystems.
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:43.120]   Paul Lawton wrote it in seven weeks in the spring of 1978. He got paid $13,000 for it.
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:50.320]   The source code being released is scans of original documents that he has kept over the last 30 years.
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:53.280]   What a cool thing to be able to look at. I mean,
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:04:01.200]   6502 source code is kind of ugly, but it's also kind of simple. So it makes it very easy for you
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.360]   to look at and see what he did. I think students should be looking at this. And this is an example
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:12.560]   of what we were just saying. I think after a while, there's a certain value to showing the notebooks.
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:20.880]   It really is part of the elevation of programming as a respect for a real measure of craftsmanship
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:25.360]   that it is. It's just like when you take a part in old desk and you see the dovetails and you see
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:29.360]   that they chose a certain kind of wood that was not going to be seen just because it was a good,
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:34.000]   it's the same reason as, "Hey, I know these holes are, I don't want these holes to descend
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:40.640]   when we bend them." So I really love seeing these projects where the source code of code projects
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:48.080]   becomes published. It lets you, particularly from that era, when you can have one person who wrote
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:51.760]   the entire operating system and you can see those one developers fingerprints everywhere.
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:57.680]   How about this? This has been around for a while, but the source code by Randy Wigington and a
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:06.240]   guy named Woz for the very sophisticated, in fact, many people think kind of scarily brilliant
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:14.160]   disk drivers for the original app, too. Even if you don't understand source code,
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:21.280]   just read the comments is fun. To think that Woz and Randy Wigington wrote this in 1978,
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:30.880]   I just think this is cool. It taps into something that's really elemental about the human experience.
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:36.800]   When I see the source code for that kind of stuff, it really is like a couple generations ago,
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:42.960]   if a song that you was being played all the time in high school suddenly comes back 20 years later,
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:50.880]   because this was the stuff that I loved when I was 12, 13, 14. I lived in DOS and
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:59.040]   my investigations into the unique modifications that electronic arts and other game makers made
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:04.960]   to the operating system to improve the security of their games, caused me to really understand and
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:08.400]   spend a little time with that source code at disassembly. Yes, indeed.
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:11.840]   The hex editor. I know where you're going here.
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:17.840]   It's like when I look at this, it's like I'm looking at a car that I've coveted when I was
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:21.920]   in high school. I'm glad to see this stuff happening. There's a great article that
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:27.760]   I've found a link to on Twitter where someone is trying to disassemble the Star Raiders cartridge
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:33.440]   show from the Atari 2600. Of course, because he is an engineer, he has these disassembly tools,
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:37.280]   so he was trying to figure out exactly how they were doing all this animation.
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:40.480]   It's like what you say, you get to see the notebooks, you get to see,
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:45.280]   you don't have the notes of the man or woman that wrote this game initially,
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:49.120]   but you get to see, "Oh, there's how they got this trick. They're actually using this part of
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:54.000]   audio memory to store some bitmaps in because I realized they can move data out of it faster."
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.960]   And then you realize that, "Wow, it's a question of finding problems and solving problems
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:06.800]   step by step by step." It's just so cool. It reminds me of going to the Rock and Roll History Museum.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:10.400]   I can't remember if it was in the one in Cleveland or Paul Owens in Seattle.
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:14.000]   I think it was in Cleveland and seeing John Lennon's handwritten lyrics
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:21.040]   in my life. I mean, you just look at that and there isn't any words for it. It's just
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:23.280]   awe. Right?
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:25.280]   Look behind the curtains.
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:29.440]   Yeah. I think that this is so important. That's why I think what Lander's doing.
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:37.680]   And I wish people would be a little more... If part of it is maybe false, maybe not humility,
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:41.200]   where they say, "Oh, I wasn't that important. I wasn't that important. Oh, you don't really."
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:43.840]   You know what? No more false humility.
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:45.760]   It's important. You're a sir now.
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:53.600]   I was going to say, it's like the X files are planetary. It's the archaeology of the unknown.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:57.760]   It's the stuff that's a secret history of our culture. And I think it's fantastic when it gets
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:58.560]   preserved this way.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:08.080]   Apple, this broke while we were talking on Twitter on Sunday about Apple and the Xbox One.
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:12.720]   Xbox One comes out in three days with a connect, but a connect, apparently.
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:16.720]   It's been completely designed from the ground up by Microsoft because the company that designed
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:23.760]   connect PrimeSense has been purchased by Apple. An Israeli company, deal said to be worth about
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:32.720]   $345 million. We'd seen a rumor about this in an Israeli newspaper, a news site, I guess,
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:40.320]   in last summer, and Apple denied it and PrimeSense denied it, but apparently it has happened now.
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:46.640]   Or it's in the final stages. The CEO of that company on an airplane several years ago,
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:52.560]   and he told me they'd been talking to Apple and you didn't want to go to
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:54.960]   Apple because they were a pain in the ass. They didn't want to do it.
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:59.600]   Yeah. In fact, I remember the story of how Microsoft found out about it was on an airplane.
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:05.600]   I can't remember who it was at Microsoft, but he heard about this technology and he called them.
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:11.600]   And PrimeSense had been talking to Apple already, but it was so much easier to license to Microsoft.
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:18.320]   So what would Apple want to connect to go with its Apple TV? It sounds to me like this can
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:23.920]   revive the rumors of an Apple TV. This is a very interesting technology, a sensor that can see
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:28.640]   you in space, see your movements take. Apple makes a lot of panels, not just television panels and
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:34.240]   gestures and touch are part of their DNA now, but as they themselves have said, you don't want to
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:38.800]   physically touch every surface and every position. It's just not ergonomically friendly.
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:42.720]   And when you deal with 10 foot distances or as you go forward into the future, it doesn't make
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:46.720]   sense to have to physically touch anything. So I think it would be observed of Apple not to be
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:52.240]   doing everything they can to investigate air gestures and abstract gestures. That kind of
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:56.560]   direct manipulation is just so natural. Kids today are growing up using an iPad. They're not growing
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:00.800]   up using keyboards and mice anymore. And we're going to need solutions for them as they get to
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:07.120]   more sophisticated or more familial environments. Not only that, but if we don't even necessarily
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:12.400]   have to be that literal, that such a component could be really valuable just in the sense of telling the
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:18.080]   CPU. There are three people in the room. Two of them are facing the screen. One of them is not
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:23.200]   based on the size of this person and their gestures. I believe that the identities of these two people
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:28.240]   are Roger and Steve. And here, so let's do settings that are going to be appropriate for Roger and Steve
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:31.760]   who are looking at the screen right now and forget about adjustments to the operating system or the
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:35.520]   interface for this other person who clearly is doing something else right now. Well, that's exactly
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:40.800]   what connecting in Xbox One, I think, and recognize up to six different people in the room.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:46.320]   It's amazing. Apple, I think I think it would be non-trivial for Apple to solve the problem of
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:52.400]   creating a library of gestures that people are going to want to use instead of picking up a remote,
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:57.520]   touching a button that clearly says, touch this to play, scroll this to select something in the list.
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:03.920]   It's a non-trivial exercise. So I think that it would have to be a breakthrough akin to Apple
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:09.920]   solving Apple looking at voice commands and building something like Siri, not something as literal as
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:14.480]   what science fiction has always said it to be or what we've seen in other devices before.
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:24.560]   As late as Liz Gaines writing for All Things D, as late as, I guess it was Sunday morning,
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:30.000]   said, "It's not official yet." Close to complaint.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.720]   She got to think exactly to Andy's point, Siri is much more than just listening to your voice,
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:38.880]   and an eyesight camera is on almost every Apple device now. And if that could have intelligence,
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:42.480]   and there's just so many possibilities that they could do with these things moving forward.
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:46.880]   I have to say though, I've used the Leap Motion. I've tried many of these devices. I've used the
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:52.240]   Connect on the Xbox 360. And I don't know. You really... I mean, Connect on the Xbox. Now,
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:57.600]   you can make it better. Obviously, it's early days, but I can never get it to do the thing it's supposed
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:03.040]   to do. And it's really a lot harder than pointing a remote at it, or using your voice, which Apple
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:08.080]   obviously has the capability of as well. Yeah. I mean, I think that when the coolest... when
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:13.520]   the next thing Apple could do that'd be really, really cool, is to really turn Apple TV into a
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:18.320]   standing up device instead of a sitting down device. Not only for fitness apps and stuff like that,
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:24.640]   that's another natural thing for those kind of sensors. But also, my living room is on the way
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:30.560]   from the kitchen to the front door to get to my car. So many... if that device had... if that
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:35.200]   screen had a way that could simply pause in front of it and do one last check of email, or just do
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:38.880]   something... something just to wake it up without having to find the remote, or without having to
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:45.200]   like stop and like direct my voice at something, and to control it very, very simply with a set of
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:51.520]   gestures, that would enhance the value of the Apple TV. And when I... when you look at where Apple's
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:56.240]   making its money these days, and what this sort of a hardware would be able to provide,
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:00.240]   you really are looking more at iOS devices and consumer devices, and you're not really
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:04.960]   thinking so much about desktops anymore. Well, you do have an interesting part in the video with a
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:09.280]   poor guy is cooking and needs more directions and he's covered in food. That's just a problem.
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:14.400]   And it goes to the next direction page for it. And also, we've just had our nails done. Our nails are done.
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:20.400]   Our nails are done. We don't want to tap, touch the screen. Andy and I are mocking the Samsung
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:27.840]   product launch for the Galaxy S4, which featured... Exactly that. So, okay, so good. If you've been
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:33.920]   cooking and you've got flour on your hands or your nails, or nail paint is wet, nail varnish is wet.
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:39.360]   I know, I... well, we'll see, you know, look, I mean, maybe it could be great. I just...
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:43.920]   every experience I've had with these have been very disappointing. The leap, which promised much,
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:50.000]   delivered very little. They're terrible until they're not Leo. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.520]   I'll accept that. They're still terrible. It's not that it's not the tablets were terrible.
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:57.120]   It's just when I figured out how to make a tablet that is approachable. Well, that's true. I tried
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:06.240]   every tablet for 10 years. I tried tablets. Never happy. Never happy. I'm curious if cturtle.org
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:16.560]   is still working for tracking the... Did you hear about this? A site that is promoting the...
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:22.480]   saving cturtles, they invite you to adopt a cturtle for the holiday. Also,
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:30.240]   reasons completely unknown has a check iPhone 5s, iPad, Air, iPad Mini, and Retina availability
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:36.880]   at your Apple store grid. You got attention for the turtles. What's good for the turtles is good
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:41.680]   for me. Apple has not shut them down. And maybe it's because Apple likes cturtles too.
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:48.320]   They shut everybody else down, didn't they? Yeah. In the next to final act of this move,
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:51.520]   we find out that cturtle is actually an acronym for something very sinister.
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:58.640]   So you can, of course, much more useful to you would be to enter in your zip code and so forth.
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:02.960]   But for our purposes, looking at this availability grid is actually very useful.
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:08.480]   The number you see... Now, I see the numbers are going up. The number you see is how recently
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:14.320]   this was checked. In some cases, as recently as a minute ago, but in other cases, hours ago,
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:18.080]   if it is green, that means availability. So what they've done is they've taken
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:24.960]   the different models and they've spread them across this spreadsheet. We'll just talk about the
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:30.880]   Wi-Fi's, for instance, and green means availability. So there is pretty good availability. It looks
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:37.520]   like in most stores, not of every model, but at least one or two models seem to be available
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:43.200]   almost everywhere. This kind of surprises me for the mini with retina. I thought for sure that this
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:48.320]   would be... In fact, did we not speculate this would be a very short supply product? But apparently...
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:56.160]   It is for an Apple product. 32 gig gray is pretty widely available as is 32 gig silver. Everybody
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:00.640]   wants the bigger ones, probably, or the smaller ones. You either come in and say, "I want the cheapest
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:05.120]   one you got," or "I want the biggest one you got," but very few people buy in the middle.
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:13.280]   But for instance, here in the Renaissance Mall at Colony Park in Mississippi,
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:18.480]   you could pretty much get anything you want. They got green... It's lit up green all across the way.
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:24.320]   On the other hand, if you go to King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, you've got a very limited supply.
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:29.920]   There's no rhyme reason. And for some reason, Westtown, Wisconsin, they got none.
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:39.120]   So I think that's... Thank you, seeturtle.org. I hope that your mission continues. Save the sea turtles.
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:46.240]   And if you're in the market for an iPad, apparently there are places you can go. You can pick them up.
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:52.400]   Still, just kind of good news. So Renee, you think this is what was expected?
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:55.920]   Or do you think... Well, I still expect it. I think it's the reality of Apple dealing with
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:59.200]   farguators to apply constraints and they'd otherwise like during the holiday season.
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:04.240]   They have plenty of them. It looks like. They have plenty of them, but compared to usually when they
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:10.160]   have vast containers of them dropping off of planes and giant lineups, tons of pre-orders
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:14.560]   available instantly, Apple's not selling 100 of these. They're trying to sell 100 million of them.
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:22.080]   I wonder if maybe they're not selling as well as they anticipated?
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:26.880]   I think... We'll have to find out. They haven't put out any press releases on them,
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:30.800]   but I'd be surprised if they're not a hot holiday item. Speculative at this point.
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:35.600]   I guess I love it. I'm a booster.
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:48.000]   By the way, I didn't mention your mini site, Landers. So let me do that now. JohnnyIveBook.com,
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.200]   if you want to read up on it and get it best to buy a copy through there, I would imagine,
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:58.960]   because you get a little bit extra affiliate fees there. When I buy an author's book on Amazon,
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:02.720]   I always like to go through their site. It's actually ends up being more money than the
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:04.480]   other ones. I wish to go get up on the independent books too.
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:09.040]   Oh, really? You want to... Awesome. Awesome.
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:14.320]   I can ask you a question directly that I wasn't able to ask about the Steve Jobs book.
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:19.520]   Did it really intimidate the designer of your book who is putting together this cover,
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:25.200]   knowing that if this does not look like a beautiful JohnnyIve style design,
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:29.200]   they will stand out like a sore thumb. Do they panic about this?
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:32.880]   Oh, yeah, totally. The guy that designed it's a huge...
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:33.840]   It's beautiful.
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:37.360]   Johnny Ive found, so he busted his chops to do it right.
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:39.280]   And the image was a huge problem.
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:44.800]   Like I said, the Apple is bought up the rights, just like they did with Steve Jobs, to all the pictures.
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:50.320]   So it's very hard to get a picture that's licensed for things like book jackets.
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:53.760]   And this was actually taken in London a couple of years ago.
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:56.640]   So it's public domain or somehow usable?
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:59.600]   Well, they do.
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.040]   Looks like a studio shot.
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:07.520]   It was a new shot. But what Apple has done is gone past and bought the rights
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:11.760]   till the new shots and tied up the rights. And they did this with Steve Jobs too.
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:17.840]   I mean, it's way to put out an image of Steve Jobs that he will license for something like a book.
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.680]   That's why I could look at a lot of the books by Steve Jobs.
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:22.880]   All the images suck, except for all two reasons.
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:25.200]   You wrote inside Steve's brain.
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:27.200]   Did that have a picture of Steve on it? I forgot.
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:28.560]   It did, yeah.
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:32.240]   I forget where they got the image.
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:33.040]   Actually, it was a silhouette.
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:36.560]   You know what, man, I completely forgot what it did.
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:39.200]   You cannot copyright silhouettes, I guess.
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:41.440]   Trademark them.
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.600]   Maybe that's the only solution to the problem.
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.360]   It's a silhouette.
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:47.360]   Let me see. Let's show it up. Show us the book.
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:50.720]   Oh, yeah. Look at that.
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.240]   But go ahead, Chet.
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:52.880]   There we go.
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:55.520]   It's very obviously Steve because you got the glasses and the honker.
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:59.600]   Yeah, it's a pretty sort of iconic looking silhouette.
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:05.040]   And the Leo LePorte charm offensive against Apple continues yet another one.
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:07.920]   Hey, he had a honker. I got a honker.
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:11.200]   You know, my silhouette would be pretty distinctive.
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:12.720]   Have you bought up all your pictures, Leo?
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:13.600]   Are you protected?
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:16.240]   Oh, God, I cannot control all the images.
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:18.320]   Yeah, what you should have done was you should just
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:20.240]   just like hire a guy, just like keep following,
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:22.400]   like the following, joining your eye around.
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:25.040]   Wait for him to be like at Subway, like opening about,
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:26.560]   eat like a big submarine sandwich.
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:29.520]   We shot this on public on public land.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:30.880]   This is going to be the cover of the book,
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:32.320]   unless you give us something better.
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:35.440]   Was that silhouette inside Steve's brain?
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:38.320]   That actually looks like it was a silhouette of an actual picture.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:41.360]   It kind of does look like that.
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:42.080]   But I know that.
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:42.560]   I think it was.
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:43.680]   It was a royal picture, something like that.
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:46.400]   It's got like a microphone on, so it's obviously a keynote.
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:47.520]   Yeah.
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:47.680]   Yeah.
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:50.240]   It's a good picture, actually.
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:51.840]   It's very obviously Steve Jobs.
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:52.800]   Yeah.
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:55.840]   And the original one, they colored it because this is a later edition.
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:57.120]   I added a couple of chapters.
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:00.000]   But the original one, I think, would look really nice in black and white.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.760]   Ah, neat.
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:04.240]   Yeah, this is the old Apple.
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:05.840]   You know, that's such a good point.
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:09.760]   It seems anytime you associate like more than one color with Apple,
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:12.560]   it just screams out 1988.
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:14.320]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:18.720]   Uh, $100 off the iPhone 5S.
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:20.880]   If you want the 16 gigs at AT&T,
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:23.200]   that means what?
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:24.240]   $199 or no?
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:25.040]   $100.
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:25.600]   $99.
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:26.400]   Wow.
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:27.920]   That's a good deal.
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:33.040]   Thursday, Apple updated iOS to 704.
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:37.120]   Patching unnamed security bugs and a FaceTime flaw.
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:40.720]   Was crashing on FaceTime or something?
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:43.920]   6.5, 6.5, yeah.
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:45.360]   For the old folks.
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.600]   We're doing people.
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:48.560]   7.1 beta.
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:49.920]   7.1 beta yesterday.
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:50.960]   What, really?
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:51.200]   Yep.
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:53.600]   Well, what have they fixed?
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:55.200]   Everything.
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:57.200]   I mean, just the list of fixes.
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:01.120]   I mean, obviously it's under NDA, but the list of fixes is long.
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:04.960]   So it could be soon if they're doing the beta.
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:06.480]   They didn't say a number.
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:09.760]   Like it just looked like iOS 7.1 beta, not beta one.
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:12.640]   Usually they'll do like several beta's and it'll take a few weeks,
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:16.400]   a few months, but who knows what their agenda is for this one.
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:20.640]   It's about a year since Scott forced all left and they did their 180.
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:24.160]   So it just could be them tidying up everything they did with 7.0.
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:26.800]   I'm looking forward to seeing.
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:30.400]   I do think that sometime in the next four months or six months,
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:35.440]   we're going to see a lot of tweaks to the interface and to the design language
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:37.520]   that Apple will not acknowledge in a press release.
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:41.520]   I think they're collecting a lot of feedback over now,
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:44.960]   especially now that the initial shock of the differences of people are over that
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.160]   and now people are left with.
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:47.200]   Well, this is legitimately.
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:49.760]   I'm still having a problem with this tool.
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:51.840]   So Apple pays such close attention.
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:53.360]   They don't necessarily put into press release,
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:56.160]   but I think we're going to see we're going to be able to compare 7.1
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:00.320]   or 7.2 to 7.0 and see where they decided that needed to roll.
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:01.920]   Things back a bit or change things.
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:08.000]   Well, they do continue to roll out the leatherless stitchless versions of their apps.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.240]   If you updated find my friends today,
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:14.560]   which was really kind of egregiously still skeuomorphic.
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:15.520]   Yeah, kind of shocking.
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:17.280]   These jobs is airplane sofa.
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:21.280]   Yeah. It's so funny because once you jump that from everything else,
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:25.680]   the one app that's still in fact, I haven't updated so I can show you.
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:27.280]   It's still so...
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:28.400]   It's like a Galaxy Note 3.
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:29.840]   Yeah.
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:30.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:33.360]   It's kind of stunningly skeuomorphic still.
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:34.800]   Except this looks like real leather.
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.000]   Yeah.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.520]   I'll hide this for a moment while I sign in.
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:40.320]   Yeah, it looks just like real leather.
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:43.680]   Because it's what? It's from Steve's Gulfstream, right?
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:47.200]   Yeah, which is kind of funny because everyone is saying the deforest
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:51.200]   all the deforest allization of iOS is complete or forest all is finally gone.
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:55.840]   When he was implementation, this was not the leather from his airplane.
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:57.200]   It was not the texture he wanted to be.
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:58.320]   No, Steve's airplane.
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:23:58.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:23:59.360]   Yeah.
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:04.720]   I have to admit that that has bothered me since he left that people have been talking as though
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:08.080]   he was a horrible influence and now that he's gone and everything that we don't like about
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:12.560]   the iOS and macOS is going to go away and we just don't know what he was responsible for,
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:16.720]   what he was not responsible for, what fights he won, what fights he lost.
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:17.680]   So...
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:18.480]   I guess I do have the...
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:20.880]   That's something me, the Scott Forest all for instance sake.
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:22.720]   Well, and as it gave us carbon.
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:25.280]   That's right.
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:26.960]   Is it fair to say...
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:28.640]   I did update, find my friends, darn it.
[01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:29.360]   Oh, rats.
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.760]   I forgot they have auto update.
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:33.280]   Yeah, so no more leather.
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:35.600]   I missed my leather.
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:41.360]   Is it safe to say that Johnny I was one of the real opponents of all of this, Leander?
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:42.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:43.200]   Absolutely.
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:45.600]   And you can see it because if you look at the prototypes that will
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:48.320]   lead to in the Apple Samsung trial, you still...
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:49.600]   Yeah, you got the leather.
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:50.560]   You got the stage on it.
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:50.960]   And he's got leather.
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:51.920]   And he's got leather.
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:53.600]   Don't update it.
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:55.360]   Don't update it.
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:55.840]   Vintage.
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:57.120]   That's vintage leather, Andy.
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:59.520]   No, it is wrong because I don't actually have two friends.
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:01.440]   But someday...
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:02.800]   That icon needs to be updated.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:07.040]   It's aspirational, like the Mac Pro.
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:08.160]   Sorry, Leander, you were saying...
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:14.000]   If you look at the prototypes for the iPhone,
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.480]   all those models that were released during the Apple Samsung trial,
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:22.240]   they all have a fake iOS that was printed out and stuck on the screens.
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:25.040]   Because the hardware teams weren't allowed to see what the software teams were up to,
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:25.840]   and vice versa.
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:26.480]   So interesting.
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:29.680]   The stickers look just like iOS 7.
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:31.680]   Very flat, very simple.
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:36.320]   You're saying the original iPhone look was flat.
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:37.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:39.440]   And then somebody came along.
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:40.240]   Well, Johnny mentioned that.
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:41.040]   We were morphed out.
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:43.040]   I heard that...
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:47.520]   The stories I heard about Scott Foster was that he was much more forceful than...
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:48.720]   He wasn't just the implementer.
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:54.480]   Maybe he took inspiration from Jobs' Learjet,
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:57.360]   but things like the App Store.
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:58.080]   That was...
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:02.400]   Steve wanted the App Store from the iPhone in the first two weeks after release.
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:07.120]   But it was forced all blocking it for however long it was 18 months, two years.
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:08.880]   That's the story I heard.
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:09.760]   I don't know if it's true.
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:10.720]   I never put a description.
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:11.360]   I heard the opposite one.
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:12.000]   So who knows?
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.200]   Yeah, I heard the opposite of that.
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:20.000]   That's basically our unnamed source that told us, "Don't tell anybody."
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:20.720]   You know what it is?
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:22.240]   It's like Hitler and the bunker.
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:23.360]   Everybody...
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:29.600]   Everybody's trying to figure out what Adolf wants.
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:32.000]   And they're doing...
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.480]   At least you still have Cupertino privileges.
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:37.040]   You're allowed to buy a bagel with a bagel top of Cupertino.
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:37.840]   Not much longer.
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:39.440]   You're going to Panera and Brad across from the house.
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:40.240]   Not much longer.
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:44.960]   You're going to have to get moved to the studios closer,
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:46.080]   deeper in Moran before talking.
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:49.280]   I'm sorry, but I interrupt.
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:51.200]   Please do keep comparing this to Hitler.
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:53.040]   Oh, okay.
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:54.000]   Hitler's a bad example.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.120]   Let's use Saddam Hussein.
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:27:00.160]   If you have...
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:01.280]   Okay.
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:04.000]   Kimmyl-John, that's fine.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:04.640]   Whatever.
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:08.480]   If you have a totalitarian leader,
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:11.360]   everybody's trying to figure out what does he want?
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:17.440]   And may even be aggressive in pursuing an agenda that's not what the fearless leader wants.
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:22.160]   But in an attempt to preserve their position on the island,
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:23.440]   it's never going anywhere.
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:26.400]   That's interesting, Vato.
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:30.000]   I've always thought that one of the reasons why, in retrospect,
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.640]   one of the reasons why the original iOS has all that gloss and all those shadows was to
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:38.080]   cover up the defects of the relatively low resolution display.
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:42.480]   It wasn't until those effects started being shown on retina that we realized that
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:43.120]   that's shadow.
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:44.640]   You realize that without the...
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:46.800]   With the shadow there, we don't have to see how jagged.
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:50.560]   They can increase the anti-aliasing and we don't have to notice that the curve of that
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:51.440]   isn't really very good.
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:52.880]   It's...
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:54.960]   I've always thought that that was the reason why.
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:56.560]   That actually makes a lot of sense.
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:58.240]   That's just speculation on my part.
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:00.800]   I think though, knowing Apple and how Apple works,
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.560]   there's also a deep philosophy at work.
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:06.320]   And that the deep philosophy was we have to make this somehow
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:11.680]   like real life because then people will be better able to understand it and use it.
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:15.200]   However, in time, people become digital natives.
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:16.800]   We can go to a digital native interface.
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:18.560]   And I think that that's all consistent.
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:21.200]   You don't have to make up a story about Scott Forstall being,
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.200]   Adolf Eichmann or anything.
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:23.920]   It's...
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:24.720]   Training wheels come off.
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:27.040]   It's the training wheels come off.
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:32.000]   It was a logical thing in the beginning and it makes sense when the transition is logical too.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000]   And it's all consistent with this kind of underlying design philosophy that
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.600]   let's make it as easy as possible to use.
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:38.720]   Let's make it intuitive.
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:40.160]   You want people to be able to use it.
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:41.520]   Thank you.
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:43.280]   You want people to be able to use it with that.
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:45.120]   Did I say, "Okay, Google now at some point?"
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:46.160]   It thinks I did.
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:46.640]   Stop it.
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:50.240]   You have to have a processor and a system that can actually push all the graphics.
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:54.720]   Like all these layers of fade and translucency and Gaussian blur are not easy on hardware.
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:57.920]   There wouldn't even be possible on an original life run.
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:58.720]   Right.
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:01.280]   Isn't it funny how iOS 6 looks really dated now?
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:03.040]   It looked...
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:05.520]   Actually, it started looking dated a lot earlier than that.
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:06.960]   Well, I mean...
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:07.920]   Well, I mean...
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:08.480]   This...
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:09.840]   By Sutra Mean, yeah.
[01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:11.040]   If it's using the beta, yeah.
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:13.520]   But you know, and does anyone hate on it anymore?
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:15.120]   Does anyone hate on iOS 7?
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:16.320]   No, you get used to it.
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:17.280]   I'm not fond of it.
[01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:18.320]   Not on the internet.
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:19.280]   I'm not fond of it.
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:20.480]   You get used to it.
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:21.280]   I think it looks awesome.
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:21.840]   I think it's great.
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:22.720]   It's awesome.
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:24.160]   I wouldn't use the word awesome.
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:25.600]   I can tolerate it.
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:27.200]   I think it looks very, very good.
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:32.480]   My only difficulty with it remains that I think that there are times when the user interface,
[01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:37.440]   really a user interface, really needs to shout at you or be really...
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:38.800]   Talk to you in a firm voice.
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:43.600]   And I don't think iOS has the ability to say, "Look, this button here,
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:45.920]   this... I know your eyes are darting all over the screen,
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:48.080]   but this is the button that you want to push next.
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:50.080]   This is where that function is."
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:50.880]   I'm all over here.
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:54.160]   Hey, big boy, over here.
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:57.840]   I just don't like the excessive use of open space.
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:02.080]   There are some screens that are hauntingly beautiful that are amazing looking,
[01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:04.320]   and there are some that look like they're just not finished yet.
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:07.440]   It feels like, yeah, the kerning is wrong kind of a thing.
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:08.880]   But you're a designer.
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:09.280]   I'm not.
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:10.400]   I'm just some kind.
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:12.240]   Well, there's behaviors that don't quite work.
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:13.520]   Some of the stuff renders on top.
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:15.840]   There's stuff in it that needs to be finished.
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:20.480]   I think it's completely reasonable to expect a 7-1 to come along
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:22.560]   that responds to a lot of these complaints.
[01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:25.360]   But I'm still not a big iOS 7 fan.
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:27.600]   But I thought Android was good looking for years,
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:29.120]   so I'm obviously... I got no taste.
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:33.120]   Hey, Leander, don't laugh too loud.
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:34.960]   You guys still got the cult of Android to think about.
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:41.200]   Some of the developer eversions of Android are really gorgeous,
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:43.200]   but the stock one, I don't like it all.
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:43.600]   Really?
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:45.680]   I like KitKat.
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:47.600]   It just shows you.
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:48.560]   It's a matter of taste.
[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:49.280]   It's taste is taste.
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:51.200]   It's not objective.
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:52.000]   It's subjective.
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.840]   There's elements of both.
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:55.200]   There are things that objectively,
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:57.280]   like structurally work.
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:58.960]   There are principles like consistency.
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:01.040]   It's easier for people to remember and muscle memory.
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:01.680]   But then you're right.
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:02.960]   Everything is subjective.
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:04.960]   Like the colors you choose, the size of things.
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:05.600]   So there's both.
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:07.760]   It's like there are some movies that I know are brilliant,
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:08.800]   and I just don't like.
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:10.400]   And there are some incredibly crappy movies
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:12.000]   that I know are incredibly crappy, and I love them.
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.160]   And I'm okay with that duality.
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:15.040]   I kind of--
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:19.920]   One of the things that drew me into the Apple sphere
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:21.440]   in the early days of Macintosh,
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:24.240]   very early on, was the Macintosh user interface guidelines.
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:26.320]   And I thought they were inspired,
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:28.240]   probably mostly inspired by Jeff Raskin,
[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:30.400]   who was then hounded out of Apple by Steve Jobs.
[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:34.400]   But the things that they talked about,
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:37.200]   I had-- remember, we were in the world of Windows,
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:39.120]   what, 3.0.
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:41.440]   No, not even that.
[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:43.280]   We were still in DOS land.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.080]   The things that they talked about,
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:48.320]   the idea of-- they called it monotony.
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:50.800]   That there should be exactly one way to do anything.
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:52.720]   You know, in Microsoft's famous,
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:54.320]   for there's 20 ways to do anything.
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:56.960]   And in the early days of the Macintosh,
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:58.240]   the idea was there's one way.
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:31:59.600]   You learn that way, and that's the way.
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:01.760]   And that way, you don't have to think about it.
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:04.720]   It becomes a path, and you use it more fluidly.
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:06.000]   I really loved those.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:09.760]   And to some degree, as with anything over time,
[01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:11.040]   those are eroded a little bit.
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:14.080]   But at least Apple was thinking about it.
[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:17.440]   Now, Windows Phone is very consistent.
[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:20.400]   Yeah, there's something to be said for that.
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:22.480]   I'm not using a Windows Phone,
[01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:23.520]   but there's something to be said for that.
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:25.200]   I turned-- I just got my Nexus 5,
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:26.960]   and I turned it on, and I looked at KitKat,
[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:28.960]   and the icons are all still different sizes,
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.320]   and have different cutout shapes,
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:32.400]   and different levels of gloss and flatness.
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:34.160]   And for me, that's like nails and a chalkboard,
[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:35.280]   but some people love that.
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:35.600]   Yep.
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:37.440]   Yeah.
[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:41.680]   I'm just glad to see that almost every major
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:43.520]   mobile operating system is taking inspiration
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:44.640]   from each one of them.
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:44.800]   Yeah.
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:49.120]   Because it's-- I hope that the designers of Android
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:52.080]   and Windows Phone and iOS are all playing with each other's--
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:55.440]   all the other devices, and seeing things that,
[01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:57.600]   "Oh, God, look at all these-- look at the differences
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:58.880]   in gloss and size and icons.
[01:32:58.880 --> 01:32:59.920]   We should never do that."
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:03.520]   But also saying, "Gee, that's an interesting take on that.
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:04.480]   We thought that wouldn't work,
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:06.960]   but now that I see it actually as part of an operating system,
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:07.760]   I kind of like that."
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:08.320]   Yeah.
[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:12.000]   Well, and you do have to honor iOS 7's--
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.760]   was obviously iOS 7's goal,
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:16.240]   which was to take a step back, rethink this,
[01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:19.680]   and let us recreate something that is more homogenous
[01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:25.280]   in a good way, homogeneous in a good way.
[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:27.040]   Google Apps and iOS are fascinating to me,
[01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:28.960]   because you have the hollow guidelines on Android,
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:30.960]   but then you have Google's implementation on iOS,
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:32.880]   which isn't exactly iOS 7,
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:34.960]   but is more just in its own right now.
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:36.720]   Their best designers are obviously working
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:39.840]   for the Apple team, not for the Android team.
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:44.640]   Apple has kicked a Bitcoin app from the App Store.
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:48.960]   Coinbase's Bitcoin app still combined on Android.
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:52.480]   This is a Y Combinator startup
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:56.160]   that offered a Bitcoin buying and trading platform for consumers,
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:59.040]   had APIs for developers to integrate Bitcoin payments
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:00.400]   into apps and websites.
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:06.480]   Apple hasn't told Coinbase why the app
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:07.520]   was pulled.
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:13.040]   Not sure myself, but I don't know if they signify--
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:14.000]   you can't tell with Apple.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.200]   Maybe there was just something wrong with the app
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:16.960]   that didn't like the gradient on the coin,
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:23.520]   or maybe there's a philosophical bias against Bitcoin at Apple.
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:24.000]   I don't know.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.240]   What do you think?
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:30.160]   Yeah, I want to--
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:32.160]   they never really explained to why they pull stuff.
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:32.720]   Like they pull--
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:36.320]   remember they did the purge of the sort of alternative app?
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:38.320]   Still is the app recommendation engines?
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:42.000]   The other Bitcoin apps have been approved like this one,
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:42.560]   and then pulled.
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:46.880]   Blockchain's wallet, BitPak, have also been pulled.
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:52.880]   And it says Apple noted that they had to comply with all legal requirements
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:56.240]   in any location where they're made available to users.
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:35:00.720]   So maybe there is some thought that Bitcoin itself is illegal in some jurisdictions.
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:05.440]   The blockchain wallet is back in the App Store with limited functionality.
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:08.240]   You have to have a jailbroken device to do everything.
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:14.720]   I think it seems completely consistent with Apple's point of view
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:16.480]   that maybe they don't want to put a bit--
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:20.400]   that seems a little shady to put a Bitcoin app on the iPhone.
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:23.440]   Or it's one of those things where they said that there's always going to be a bunch of stuff
[01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:25.680]   that they just don't know about, and they'll figure it out when they get there.
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:27.280]   They might be in the middle figuring this out.
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:32.240]   Let us take, by the way, a good article.
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:34.560]   I didn't see this, but somebody added it.
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:38.640]   I think probably chatted it to the rundown.
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:40.720]   The secret little tools, this is from Call to Mac,
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:43.040]   that Apple uses to repair the iPhone 5S.
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:46.240]   This is what Leander was talking about earlier,
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:49.760]   where Apple develops the toolkit and sends it out to the geniuses.
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:53.120]   Things like the-- we'd heard about this.
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:57.600]   The special universal display removal device that is basically for such
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:35:58.640]   cucks with a lever.
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:02.720]   They call it the magic oleo.
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:05.920]   I mean, look at--
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:07.760]   somebody took some time to build this thing.
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:11.600]   The battery--
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:12.640]   And how do we know how to build one ourselves?
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:14.640]   The battery removal scissors,
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:16.800]   which looks just like the scissors I used in fourth grade.
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:21.760]   The special-- yeah, this is funny.
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:25.840]   So are these Leander-- these are repair manuals,
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:27.120]   Apple's Unrepair manuals?
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:29.200]   Yeah, they made the wrong videos.
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:30.720]   I fix this style.
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:32.800]   The genius is behind the-- yeah, to fix the fonts.
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:35.360]   The better one is the battery roller,
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:37.040]   the better you pull it, the better you back in and rolls it down.
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:38.800]   The bottom.
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:41.920]   We are told geniuses can replace seven components on the 5S
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:44.000]   at the store thanks to these tools.
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.400]   The speaker, the receiver, the vibration motor,
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:49.600]   the iSight camera module, the battery, the sim injector tool.
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:52.960]   Wait a minute, they can replace the sim ejector tool.
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:54.080]   That doesn't count.
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:56.320]   That comes in the box and the display.
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:57.760]   Oh, oh, I see.
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:03.360]   There's a little-- oh, they can replace that little doggy thing
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:05.840]   that pops up the sim, okay.
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:07.120]   Submarine ashtray brakes.
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:08.960]   Here's the iPhone battery roller.
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:09.920]   Look at this.
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:11.040]   This is silly.
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:14.560]   Okay, so you-- it's like-- for the audio listeners,
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:16.000]   how would you describe this Leander?
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:16.800]   A pasta machine.
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:18.880]   Yeah, pasta machine.
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:20.160]   It's like a little guillotine, isn't it?
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:22.320]   Without a-- but it's got a roller instead of a blade.
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:23.600]   That's exactly what I thought.
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:25.520]   It looked just like a guillotine.
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:29.120]   And you push the phone through and it rolls the battery back down.
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:29.840]   He's an roller.
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:32.720]   Unfortunately--
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:37.360]   I took my MacBook down to the genia store and had a dodgy tripod.
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:41.280]   The guy goes-- we talked about it for like seven minutes.
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:42.640]   And he says, here, watch this.
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:44.960]   I'll replace this before your 15 minutes is up.
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:48.080]   And he ran into the back store, came back out,
[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:50.640]   ran into the tripod right on the button.
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:51.120]   So, yeah.
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:53.520]   And if you said it-- you know, and if you couldn't have done it
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:56.640]   in that 15 minute window, he said it was going to go to a repair facility
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:58.240]   and I'd be without the machine for about a week.
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:37:59.600]   Because I'm like that, I'm going to ship it back.
[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:01.760]   You know, they got this down to find out.
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:03.360]   I think it's a spherical--
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:04.400]   It's hysterical that they--
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:06.560]   And now he doesn't show you these tools.
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:07.440]   There's top secret.
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:11.840]   But there's got to be a little table with all these do-we-kis on them in the back.
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:13.280]   Back of house.
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:14.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:19.680]   And of course, they made the lever red so you couldn't miss it.
[01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:21.040]   Oh, my God.
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:25.360]   Small arm if guys that just sit in the repair room at the back of the Apple Store.
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:25.840]   Oh, really?
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:26.320]   Yeah.
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:27.760]   Oh, so the genius goes back.
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:28.480]   He doesn't do it.
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:29.840]   He gives it to somebody who's sitting there.
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:30.480]   He's giving it-- yeah.
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:34.160]   Sometimes-- this is a stone sound still, but like in the big flagship one in San Francisco,
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:36.720]   yeah, they give it to the-- you know, somebody who just sits in that room all day,
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:37.360]   fixing stuff.
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:37.840]   Wow.
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:39.520]   Wow.
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:40.400]   I love this stuff.
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:42.320]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:44.480]   When we come back here, tips your picks of the weekend.
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:47.840]   Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times from imore.com, Renee Ritchie.
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:52.960]   And of course, Leander Conning, it's great to have him from the cult of Mac the author of a new book
[01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:58.880]   about Johnny Ive, which is on Audible and Kindle, and of course, at Amazon as well.
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:02.480]   The design genius of Johnny Ive.
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:07.520]   Our show today brought to you by legalzoom.com, not a law firm,
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:12.080]   as somebody who just spent an hour and a half in a room full of lawyers.
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:17.440]   You know when you do that, it's maybe it's just me, but I can't help but like thinking--
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:19.760]   I practically see dollar signs whizzing by.
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:22.800]   Okay, he's $350 an hour.
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:24.400]   He's $250 an hour.
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:25.440]   That's $700.
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:27.840]   $600 an hour, another $200.
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:31.040]   So every minute I'm spending $25 a minute.
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:34.160]   Yeah, you don't want that.
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:38.320]   Legalzoom.com, they're not a law firm, but they let you do a lot of the legal work that you'd need
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:41.040]   to do at much less money.
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:43.600]   But by doing it yourself, they walk you through it and you can.
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:49.040]   And if you now is a great time to start your own business economies heating up,
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:53.440]   I know a lot of you have dreams and desires to start your own company.
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:55.200]   This is how we did it at Twit.
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:59.440]   We went to legalzoom.com, spent $99 on the LLC.
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:02.160]   Basically, they walked me through it.
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:09.680]   I answered some questions and I paid the state filing fees and boom, I'm an LLC and we still use
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:11.280]   those LLC papers today.
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:16.480]   We trademarked the Twit logo and the Twit name for $169.
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:18.160]   This is really important.
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:21.840]   You can also do chapter S or chapter C for $99.
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:25.280]   You might think, oh, I got to have a very expensive law firm do this.
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:28.320]   Legalzoom.com.
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:32.320]   Now, one thing they've added since we used them, you can get help from an attorney
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:35.120]   at a pre negotiated flat rate, very affordable.
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:38.240]   You speak to attorney licensed in your state.
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:43.600]   You can choose that attorney based on their profile and unedited reviews from legalzoom customers.

[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:36.880]   Time for our picks of the week Andy in that code.
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:42.560]   Mine is a simple one and kind of a nice little bit of coincidence.
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:48.240]   I've been firing up my Roku box again because there was a new,
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:50.880]   and a couple of nice new apps got released on Monday forward.
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:54.080]   And that's why I noticed that PBS has a really cool Roku app.
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:59.920]   And coincidentally, just today this morning, PBS announced that they had released that app for
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:01.040]   Apple TV.
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:08.240]   And it's almost exactly the way that you would like a network to create a desktop,
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:13.920]   excuse me, a TV app because you just tell it what your local PBS station is
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:18.240]   and you get pretty much every piece of programming that that station has available.
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:21.760]   Both the local programming, the front lines, the Austin City limits,
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:26.320]   as you can see there, the American Masters, not just what's being shown this week,
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:30.720]   but also whatever they've got in the library that they still have the rights to
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:35.120]   stream. So I was able to, I had no idea that this app existed.
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:38.960]   And it was like, I instantly got myself into trouble because I was mentally saying,
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:41.920]   "Oh, that was a really good, great performances. I really want to see that."
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:44.080]   "Oh, that was a really great American Masters. I want to see that."
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:46.640]   "Oh, there's another two great American Masters. I want to see those."
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:51.200]   So this is another reason to add value to your Apple TV.
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:54.160]   And if you are in any way a PBS fan, it's another reason.
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:57.520]   It's another thing that sort of checks off your checklist of,
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:00.720]   "Oh, so I guess I don't need to have cable TV."
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:05.680]   Or at the very least, "I don't need to put cable TV in more than just the living room of my house."
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:10.000]   Really well done app, chock full of content, easy to use, and just I love it.
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:14.160]   I'm installing it tonight as a PBS fan.
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:18.880]   Mr. Renee Ritchie, what do you have for us?
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:23.280]   I am a fan of the aluminum bumpers for the iPhone. There's several companies that make them,
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:28.080]   and one of them is Draco Design. And this is their new Ducati series,
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:31.760]   which takes inspiration from the famous motorcycle.
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:37.120]   And what this does is, I have a gold iPhone, so I got the gold version here.
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:41.280]   And what this does is it goes around your iPhone like an Apple bumper used to,
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:45.440]   and it's mild aluminum, so it's very high quality, and it's got a gold finish to match,
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:52.960]   but it comes in a variety of colors. It also comes with a lanyard and a stylus.
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:57.680]   So you have the complete Ducati matching pack. I just like the way that these sort of...
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:00.080]   Oh, it's expensive.
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:04.400]   Oh, the aluminum mill stuff is always expensive, but it's usually from companies that draw
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:09.920]   inspiration from special forces apparel or hypercars or high-cost deal-
[01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:10.720]   I see them six.
[01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:14.960]   No, absolutely. And they make a really, really high quality product.
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:18.720]   And the thing with iPhones is they're beautiful, but they're all the same.
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:21.680]   And you might not want to put a rubber case or something on it that
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:25.360]   takes away from the appearance of the iPhone, but you do want something that protects it a little
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:28.880]   bit. And the aluminum bumpers, whether it's Draco's or somebody else's,
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:33.120]   is a really nice way to provide a little bit of extra protection, but to change the overall
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:36.320]   footprint of the phone, so it looks a little more distinctive.
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:40.960]   And Draco in particular, they're a Hong Kong company. They draw on a lot of Asian influences
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:44.640]   for their designs. There's a lot of curves, and there's a lot of very interesting shapes.
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:50.000]   And if you are in the lookout for a premium bumper or premium sort of a case, they're
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.600]   definitely a nice company to look at. And they have a great amount of finishes.
[01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:57.360]   How hard is it to get on? Because I bought an aluminum bumper for my HTC One, because
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:01.440]   I like the iPhone. It was a beautiful phone. I didn't want to hide the design with a case,
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:06.880]   but it required two tiny screws. Taking the case off and on was non-trivial.
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:11.440]   Yes, these require two tiny screws. Taking it on and off is non-trivial.
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:15.840]   And it's not something that, if you like to take off your case all the time and you want
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:19.200]   to change things up a lot, it's probably not for you. But if you're someone who just wants to put
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:23.520]   something on, you like the look and you're going to keep it on, then it's a little bit of work to
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:27.760]   get the screws in or out. And some companies do lever systems where you only have one screw
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:31.200]   or not. It's still a fiddly little screw. So it's something that if you're going to put it on,
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:33.760]   you're going to want to leave it on there for a while. I guess that's part of the appeal,
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:37.280]   is it really becomes integral to the phone. Yes, absolutely.
[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:43.920]   But yeah, the reason I, on the one, you had a dock for the one that I was using the car. And so
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:47.920]   I wanted to take the case off, and you certainly are not going to do that while you're driving.
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:51.120]   Right. Yeah, this is not for someone who puts a case on and takes it off. And also,
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:55.040]   if you use really thick media cables or you have some sort of special accessory requirement,
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:57.360]   you're going to want to check that before you put on one of these cases.
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:04.240]   I do agree they are beautiful. I mean, really, it enhances the phone without hiding its own
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:08.000]   beautiful design. People still know you have an iPhone, but they're going to say, "Oh, my goodness,
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:12.720]   why does your iPhone look like that?" It has wings. Your iPhone can fly.
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:18.000]   Leander, I don't know if we have told you, but if you have anything you like these days,
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:22.000]   it could be hard work, it could be software, something that's turning you on. Please share it
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:25.040]   with us, anything. What are you doing these days besides writing books?
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:32.480]   Well, I treated myself having finished this thing, and two, some Play-It-One speakers from Sonos.
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:38.160]   Aren't they great? Oh, my God. I just love them. It's like my favorite products ever,
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:43.840]   even more than my products. Sonos is so expensive that when they offer a $199 speaker,
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:47.600]   you sit up and take notice, and they do sound really good.
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:52.560]   They sound great. They're so easy to set up. I love to be able to like,
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:55.200]   stream music more of the world. I like to listen to the radio from London.
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:59.200]   I turn my kids on to it. I have to give them a proper musical education.
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:06.960]   So, to me, it's very cool. What do you listen to? Radio One, radio One Extra.
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:10.560]   Like a lot of the music. I miss music. I miss British music culture.
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:15.600]   It's a way for me to keep in touch with it. People don't know this, but music was invented in
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:19.280]   Britain. I know. People know that. No, not people know that.
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:24.560]   Yeah, that's the thing I miss the most. There's a lot of things I don't miss about Britain,
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:28.400]   but the music and I'm big in a music-man place is definitely one of them.
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:36.000]   And so, for me, it's very important to be in touch with my roots, my musical.
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:40.080]   I love Sonos. You know, you can use, I didn't know this, but I'm tempted now,
[01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:47.040]   if you have a play bar as your sound for your TV, a Sonos play bar, you can use these ones,
[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:51.680]   two ones as surround sound speakers. And it's just very easy to pair them up and just it just works.
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:56.560]   That's what impressed me because it was so easy to plug them in and then it detects them,
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:48:01.840]   and then it's two or three button presses to set it up and it works flawlessly.
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:06.800]   I mean, there's not many products you get that are that easy to use and are that smart and have
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:11.280]   been that well thought out. I'm with you on that. And people look at it and they go, "Oh, it's way
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:17.360]   too expensive." It's very expensive. I buy a component like a year or two years.
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:22.080]   That's what I do. I just slowly add. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And of course, it's over the,
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:27.040]   you know, it's cost hundreds of dollars over the years. The earliest units work just as well,
[01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:32.560]   and it's really added value. Every time you add a component, that's more and more valid to the
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:39.280]   whole thing. I have Sonos throughout my house now. Me too. Me too. I just love that. We use it for
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:45.120]   Talk Mobile. We use Sonos with songs thanks to Kevin Mitchell and Ken. Was it songs that great?
[01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:50.720]   They work fantastically well together. Every day was a party. Yeah. So there you go.
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:56.800]   Now, this is the one thing missing from the Sonos. It drives me nuts. They have Spotify,
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:01.600]   they have MOG, they have RDO, but I wish they'd get Google. They have Amazon Music, although it's
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:06.160]   never worked right for me, but they do not have Google Play Music. iOS just got it yesterday, Leo.
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:09.120]   We have to take a look at that. That's my tick of the week. Funny that you should mention that.
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:15.440]   So the iPhone version is out, although I can use it on my iPad just fine. Google Play Music,
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:22.400]   to me, you know, there's a lot of opinion about what the best music service is. But Google Play
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:26.160]   Music has a lot of the things I'm looking for. For one thing, I can run the little Google app on my
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:31.360]   Mac and it will upload all my songs or check and see if the songs are there and add them to my
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:35.840]   library. So I have, I think it's free for up to 25,000 songs. I ran it at the limit.
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:41.680]   And that's awesome. That means my entire library is available streaming on the web,
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:48.160]   on Android, and now on iOS, which I think is fabulous. They added radio too. And now, you know,
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:52.720]   everybody's got different taste about what the, I think it's better than Pandora. I don't know if
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:59.760]   it's better than iTunes radio or Spotify or MOG or RDO. I happen to like it a lot. So you can pick
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:06.160]   a genre, you can pick an artist, you have recommended stations. They will also take a look at what's
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:10.800]   in your collection and modify the radio to include more of your collection in it. That's very nice.
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:16.880]   It is iPhone. So of course, on an iPad, it's, you know, not exactly the best use of real estate.
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:21.920]   But I think iPhone apps now on the iPad are a lot better than they used to be on iOS 7.
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:27.520]   So on the iPad, I'm showing that iPad now if you, yeah, there you go. This is, it kind of looks a
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:30.800]   little bit, but you've got the listen now, which gives you everything in your collection.
[01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:38.320]   You've got your actual collection by genre, artist, album, songs. It will pick up your iTunes
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:42.800]   playlist. So that's kind of nice. These are all playlists that are in my iTunes, but the
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:49.920]   Google music widget that you install on your Mac does put all of your playlists into here,
[01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:54.400]   which is good. You've got the radio. And of course, on the iPad, that means you've got now,
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:51:00.640]   one of the things that really beats Pandora skip as many times as you want. There's no limit on
[01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:07.040]   skips. There's no limit on the number of stations you can have. Radio means you pick an artist or
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:11.040]   you pick a genre and they kind of put a playlist together for you and start playing it. But because
[01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:16.160]   you have unlimited skips, you can really, you can really tune it. And of course, like iTunes,
[01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:20.800]   you can buy music from the Google Play Store. Pretty much, you know, I don't know if it's,
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:24.880]   they're all nine million songs, something like that. They're all pretty similar.
[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:29.520]   And I think all the new albums come out on everything as far as I can tell. And you know,
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:32.800]   you see Google's recommendations are pretty good. Lou Reed just passed away. So of course,
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:38.560]   they've got a Lou Reed album on here. I'm a fan and I'm glad that it came out on iOS. I wish
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:41.920]   Sonos would support it. I'm sure they will. You're right. It's just a matter of time, I guess.
[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:47.840]   I'm a fan of Google music too. I think it's the music service that I really, really wanted.
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:54.800]   One that combines a subscription service with suggestions with my actual library all in one
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:58.560]   app. Just sort of a noise. It just sort of annoys me that everything else is you have to
[01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:02.720]   switch between three different apps and you can't really mix these three things together. And so
[01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:08.080]   I've had the unlimited pass for since they first offered it. And I find that.
[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:12.480]   What's that? Eight bucks a month? Nine bucks a month? I think it's up to it. For new subscribers,
[01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:16.160]   I think it's 10 bucks a month. If you jumped in the first 30 days, it was like eight bucks for
[01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:21.120]   why. We got it for eight. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, so many times I have a playlist that has like
[01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:27.840]   sort of different parentage tracks. And after something really is just a must play item for
[01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:31.680]   about a month and a half, then I'll go and I'll actually buy it and have it and keep it in love
[01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:35.120]   and call it George. But it's good to have that sort of, they're not have to say, well, here's a
[01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:40.000]   playlist of stuff that I don't own. Here's a playlist of stuff that I actually own. It works
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:45.440]   great. It's cross platform now, which is really good. Of course, because it's on the iOS,
[01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:49.680]   you can't buy music from within the app. You have to go to the web to do that because Apple does,
[01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:54.880]   you know, takes 30% Google doesn't want to do that. By the way, I got to say the speakers on the
[01:52:54.880 --> 01:53:01.520]   new iPads, both the air and the retina now are dual speakers and the quality, I think, is much
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:07.040]   better than it used to be. That's something that a lot of I think I think been underreported. I
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:11.040]   really think that when I like about it, too, is that if you hold it on one side, you no longer
[01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:17.760]   blocking the speaker, you can only block one speaker at a time. This was invented in England,
[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:30.000]   this music, like all, like all great music. Exactly. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this ever
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:34.400]   love and edition of Mac Break Weekly. Thank you so much, Leander Connie for joining us.
[01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:40.160]   Really great to have you. Everybody should go to Johnny Ive the book or I'm sorry, Johnny Ive book,
[01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:49.600]   J-O-N-Y-I-V-E book.com and check out the new book from Leander, the genius behind Apple's
[01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:54.880]   greatest products, Johnny Ive. I think this is overdue. It's time to honor this guy for
[01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:59.840]   what an amazing body of work. And I'm talking about you, Leander, not this Johnny. Who the hell
[01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:05.680]   is this Johnny? I don't know. It's a gun, Leander. I think Johnny Ive has done good work listeners.
[01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:10.720]   Oh, all right. All right. Please continue to give me access to events and blown hardware.
[01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:20.720]   Anyway, thanks for being here, Leander. Thank you also from imore.com. Renee Richie, great to see you.
[01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:27.040]   What's the latest from imore? What's you up to these days? We ended up taking John Syracuse
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:31.760]   and putting him on a podcast with Ryan Nielsen who used to work on OS 10 and Daniel Jalkut.
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:36.720]   And it went four hours. So we're going to break it up into two parts and put it up starting
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:41.840]   on Thursday. That is awesome. If you're all interested in why OS 10 made that it like when
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:47.600]   you see Sir Akusa start asking about HFS+, and Nielsen start explaining the realities of working
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:52.000]   at Apple, it's pure gold. And Jalkut, of course, one of the best Apple developers, Red Sweater
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:56.880]   software. So you've got you've kind of got the best three people on. Nobody does a better
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:02.320]   thing. Yeah. Oh man. Is that if I go to imore.com/podcast slash it's high. It's high. It's
[01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:06.400]   high. It's debug. It'll be up tomorrow. It's part of the debug podcast. Oh, I can't wait to hear that.
[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:12.400]   And this with the current episode is with Jonathan Deutsch, who was doing QA and he did a lot of the
[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:16.960]   accessibility features at Apple. A lot of stuff that ended up being an automator, not exactly,
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:20.800]   but sort of the inspiration for Automator. And that's up there now. It's tough. It's tough.
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:26.560]   Smart guys. imore.com/podcast. Thank you also to Andy Ennaco, who is
[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:33.040]   always here, always on time. He replaced in the middle of the show his backdrop, which was last
[01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:39.040]   week's cows with space shuttle with what looks like a star field. Are you are you entering hyperspace
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:46.480]   here? No, that is the Befta Pete shield from a Gemini space capsule in the California Museum of
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:52.800]   Science or whatever in LA that I was at. But I saw the shuttle. I just I would spend money. I wish
[01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:56.960]   I could buy gold tin foil gold foil. There's something so beautiful about it.
[01:55:56.960 --> 01:56:06.720]   Yeah, you can't get in stores. It's like a it's like a sweater. It's this is this was like
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:12.240]   drop something from from Earth orbit and just let it just be coated with plasma of just
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:19.280]   of compressed air trying to get out of the way. Oh boy. Screaming and two astronauts
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:24.160]   lived on the other side. We're only about a couple of feet away from that and they were just fine.
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:29.040]   Andy Ennaco Chicago, sometimes the celestial waste of bandwidth. Always a pleasure. Thanks for
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:34.560]   being here, Andy. Thanks to everybody for joining us. We do the show at 11 a.m. when Leo is in

[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:47.280]   Tuesday. Please stop by and join us if you can't make and by the way, a new time. Are we no, we're
[01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:52.400]   not changing times in January. This show is not moving, but my schedule is changing a little bit
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:59.120]   and you can see more about that at our blog live. I'm sorry, inside twit, inside dot twit.tv.
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:04.000]   A new schedule starting January the week of January 6th so that I can get Thursday and Friday
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:07.120]   off. But I think back break with these. One of the few shows that's staying right where it is.
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:11.680]   So that's good news. If you want to join us in studio live, love that. Just email tickets at
[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:14.960]   twit.tv. Let us know what date you'll be here so we can put a chair out for you.
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:19.360]   If you're here on a Mac break weekly day, the chances of you getting a comfortable chair are
[01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:25.200]   better. If you're on twit, then you're going to have to sit in those bone crunching folding chairs
[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:30.800]   that we've got. Sorry about that. And of course, you can always get on demand audio and video,
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:36.960]   which allows you to choose what you're sitting on while you're listening to the show at twit.tv/mbw
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:43.760]   or wherever finer podcasts are sold or given away for that man. Thanks for joining us. We'll see
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:53.760]   you next week. Now get back to work because break time is over.
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:56.340]   (upbeat music)
